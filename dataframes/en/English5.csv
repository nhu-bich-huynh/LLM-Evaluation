"Of course the 800 000 tonnes of emergency aid promised by the international community must be delivered as soon as possible."
"But at the same time, the countries in the region must do their utmost to facilitate this delivery: by opening up the ports, supply routes and infrastructures."
"Nonetheless, in a region torn apart by a rearguard conflict, this crisis leaves a particularly bitter taste, because every penny paid to buy a gun, to buy ammunition, aggravates an already precarious economic, social and nutritional situation."
"We must demand that Eritrea and Ethiopia freeze their military activities so that all the assets, all the logistical and human capabilities of these countries are put at the service of their peoples."
"The sound of guns has for far too long drowned out the cries of the hungry."
"That is why we must appeal to the reason of the Ethiopian and Eritrean leaders and call on them to put an end to the conflict, to reach rapid agreement on the technical arrangements for a ceasefire under the OAU peace plan."
"But at this moment, of course, we must simply listen to the appeals of the suffering people."
"Mr President, misery and death in Ethiopia were on our screens four years ago."
"The cameramen left but misery and death did not leave Ethiopia."
"Starvation and death continue today."
"The population of Ethiopia pray for rain."
"Sadly they see only a rain of bullets."
"People crave water, food and medicine."
"Sadly all they see is their land and their homes blown to pieces by the tanks and planes our governments supply to the Ethiopian and Eritrean politicians."
"These politicians are hungry for power: politicians who argue over territorial boundaries whilst their people die."
"These politicians fly their national flags on their parliaments and presidential palaces, but sadly the only flag their people see is the flag of death."
"Famine, disease and death remain the hallmarks of these countries."
"Hunger for power must not be allowed to override the hunger for life."
"Mr Patten has listed a number of measures the EU has taken to help."
"Such help has been received with gratitude, but let us put it into perspective."
"Sixteen million people are starving today; 15 000 tonnes have been delivered."
"I accept the difficulties of the logistics but that means less than a kilo per person."
"No time limit is given, in other words it is a kilo that has to last forever."
"These measures are palliative."
"They only relieve the symptoms; they do not cure the disease."
"The EU must take the lead in curing this serious problem and the only way to do it is firstly to stop arms reaching all the warring parties and make sure we use our influence with those who supply them; and secondly teach these people how to grow food and harvest, store, package and process it so that they can be independent and self-reliant, not beggars for life."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today' s debate was very important as a way of demonstrating the commitment and attention which this House gives to humanitarian issues, particularly the one discussed today."
"Commissioner Patten' s words made clear not only an objective awareness of the work already carried out but also an absolute awareness that this situation is intolerable and that the European Commission will be determined on this issue, that it will take specific action and also closely monitor future developments."
"As for the Council, I should like to say that there is great interest in ensuring that situations of this kind can be permanently followed and monitored in close coordination with the Commission."
"It is important that an objective awareness is created within the European Union that humanitarian issues must be dealt with in an increasingly committed manner and that the European Union and its Member States must, within the relevant international organisations, ensure priority attention for these issues."
"The summit between the European Union and the African countries was held just a few days ago."
"Its extensive agenda offered an opportunity for what we hope is the first in a series of organised dialogues between Europe and the African countries. Specifically we want to try and establish a more integrated and coordinated vision of all the issues now affecting the African continent about which we are concerned."
"This must be made clear. These issues do matter to the European continent for a whole range of reasons, even ones which relate to the very safety and stability desired for the European continent."
"Dialogue with the African authorities is essential, as is dialogue with the sub-regional authorities."
"It is vital to guarantee coherent action in preventing conflicts and creating rapid intervention mechanisms for these situations. Without this collective and organised dialogue, there can be no hope."
"The problems cannot be solved through ad hoc actions and one-off interventions."
"If we cannot organise the international community within the global international organisations and within the more regional organisations, we will not have any response to all the crises which are systematically affecting the weakest countries in particular."
"The European Union has, in this respect, a particular responsibility the tradition addressing this type of problem could almost be said to be part of its civilisation. The EU has an awareness and a responsibility which today' s debate has clearly demonstrated."
"Thank you very much Minister."
"I would like to inform you that pursuant to Rule 37 (2) of the Rules of Procedure, I have received five motions for resolutions."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday."
"Stabilisation and association process for countries of South-Eastern Europe"
"The next item is the report (A5-0069/2000) by Mr Lagendijk, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on the stabilisation and association process for countries of South-Eastern Europe (COM(1999) 235 - C5-0124/1999/2126(COS))"
"Mr President, in the time allocated to me, I would mainly like to focus on the Funding Conference of the Stability Pact which has just been held, because it is more beneficial, in my view, to focus attention on this than on the text of my report which, of course, was written for the Conference."
"I would like to make a general comment regarding the Conference."
"It is safe to say that it was a huge success, not only in financial terms but also due to the fact that the emphasis was most definitely on projects which link up the different regions. In fact, this was one of the central themes of the report and the main thrust of the Stability Pact."
"Indeed, regional development is one of the Stability Pact' s key points."
"It was good to see all-round commitment most definitely present at all the desks at the Conference."
"It was also a success - and I do not simply say this to flatter the Commissioner - because it was clear that the European Union or the European Commission took the lead at long last. In my opinion, it had been taking a back seat for a little too long."
"This concludes my general comments on the Funding Conference."
"Further to this Conference, I would like to single out five key points from my report."
"First of all, the funding."
"Everyone was waiting with bated breath for the moment when the Commissioner would produce the amount. He finally came up with EUR 530 million."
"That was very smart creative accounting, I must say, because, of that EUR 530 million, 50% was old, pre-2000 money from the Obnova and Phare programmes and 30% was taken from the same programmes for the year 2000."
"In the final analysis, therefore, there was little new money in it."
"This is not a reproach to the Commission but an observation, and one which will, of course, create even more bad feeling, bearing in mind that another EUR 5.5 billion is still to be found. This is an amount which was quoted by the European Investment Bank at one time, which was later taken over by Commission President Prodi and in respect of which it is still completely unclear, to me in any case, how this is to be raised in the coming year."
"I would, therefore, like to ask the Commissioner how the first year, the year 2001, is likely to take shape?"
"How are the preparations for the Stability Pact budget coming along?"
"What is his reaction to the ever increasing protests, both in terms of loudness and number, coming, for example, from the Council or the Member States, to the effect that those 5.5 billion intended for the western Balkans, by way of pre-accession aid for Bulgaria and Romania, have been pitched far too high and that, in terms of absorption capacity, for example, a much lower amount would be far more realistic?"
"I am in favour of retaining the figure of 5.5 billion for the time being."
"I am only very curious as to how the Commission hopes to raise all this money."
"A request had also been made to spread the projects and planning for this Conference over all the desks: democracy, reconstruction and safety, in the knowledge that, at the end of the day, a bridge is more expensive than a training centre or mine-clearance programme."
"Unfortunately, I have to note that, looking at all the figures after the Conference, the emphasis has been shifted quite considerably towards reconstruction."
"Of 4.2 billion, 80% has been set aside for reconstruction, 17% for democracy and only 3% for safety."
"I would call on the Commission, and Europe has more or less pledged to use the same scale, to take the 3 to 4% really seriously and expand it."
"I would just remind you of a tragic report in the paper this morning about three children who stepped onto a mine near Sarajevo yesterday and were killed."
"A mine-clearance programme is part of safety, is of key importance and should not be overlooked."
"Thirdly, I would like to comment on the appeal in the report, backed by the General Affairs Council, to lift trade restrictions for the countries asymmetrically and, if necessary, unilaterally, the underlying idea being that, in time, trade will be just as important as subsidies."
"What is the progress here?"
"What does the Commission intend to do to lift these unilateral trade restrictions in the short term?"
"Fourthly, the NGOs."
"Regrettably, very little attention has been paid to the role of NGOs, especially the local NGOs, both in terms of preparation and implementation. This is all the more unfortunate if one considers the level of knowledge regarding the Stability Pact in the region."
"I am convinced that it is vital to introduce local NGOs in order to improve the quality of the programmes but also to raise the awareness of the Stability Pact, and the exact plans, in that region."
"Finally, the distribution of tasks."
"Who will ensure that all these tasks are carried out promptly and efficiently?"
"I would like to give the Commissioner a word of advice."
"Last week, he was accused of wanting to saw the legs from under Commission President Prodi' s chair."
"If you are having a go at chair legs, could you take those of Mr Solana' s chair?"
"In my view, he has been given a leading role in the Balkans for no good reason."
"It would seem far more logical to give this leading role to the European Commission, notably Commissioner Patten, to implement this Stability Pact promptly and efficiently."
"(PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I must start by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Lagendijk, on his excellent and important report. The debate caused by this could not have come at a better time."
"As you know, the Special European Council held in Lisbon reiterated the strategic priority for the European Union of ensuring peace and stability in South-Eastern Europe and, as such, this is an issue which is on the EU' s immediate agenda and permanently on our political agenda."
"The European Union is by far the body which has contributed the most aid to this region."
"Between 1991 and 1999, the total aid from the EU to South-Eastern Europe, including that from the EU as a whole and the Member States individually, was in excess of EUR 19.3 billion."
"The EU is furthermore the main trading partner of all the countries in this region. It has allowed valuable trade concessions and, as you know, several thousand soldiers, police officers and civilian workers from the EU are active in the region, particularly in Kosovo."
"We read with great interest the rapporteur' s conclusions on the stabilisation and association process for South-Eastern Europe."
"The assessment of the solidity and possible deficiencies of this process certainly provides points for discussion and I will try to comment on some of these."
"The Lisbon European Council confirmed that our overall objective remains the greatest possible integration of the countries in the region within Europe' s political and economic system."
"The Stabilisation and Association Agreements constitute a central point of this policy."
"As the rapporteur quite rightly notes, these new agreements will not enter into force immediately as we firstly have to prepare, negotiate and conclude each one."
"As a result, the rapporteur concludes that it will be necessary to create a type of medium-term stabilisation and regional development programme."
"I am not necessarily convinced that this is the most appropriate way of tackling the problem."
"The general stabilisation process for the area cannot, by any stretch of the imagination, be reduced to just agreements."
"Clearly these are, shall we say, the most visible and most well-known feature of this process, but other important instruments are required such as preferential trade agreements, direct aid from the European Union and political dialogue."
"Most of the countries already benefit from trade preferences and the Lisbon Special European Council confirmed that the Stabilisation and Association Agreements should be preceded by greater asymmetric trade liberalisation thereby specifically favouring these countries in their bilateral trade with EU countries."
"The idea underlying the stabilisation and association process is sufficiently broad and flexible to ensure a constant project in this area."
"With regard to the agreements, the fact that it is taking some time to prepare these should not, in our opinion, jeopardise the whole stabilisation process."
"This has not been the EU' s experience in equivalent regional processes in the past."
"As with other comprehensive agreements, we therefore hope to be able to establish interim agreements covering the period between the signature and ratification of these agreements, bearing in mind that normally almost twenty months pass between these two events."
"It is also worthwhile to remember that we already have contractual relations in the form of trade and cooperation agreements with Albania and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia."
"The new agreements, which will be more comprehensive and also more demanding on our partners given that they include elements of political conditionality which obviously form part of the Union' s current approach in this area, will specifically replace the existing agreements in these two cases. They will concentrate much more on regional cooperation than the current agreements and will include provisions on cooperation in the area of justice and home affairs, an area which is of great importance to the Europe of the future."
"Negotiations have already begun with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement."
"The Albanian Government recently indicated its reaction to the viability study on the opening of negotiations, which was prepared by the European Commission, and the Council will very shortly analyse this report."
"Following internal political changes, the European Commission is also to prepare a viability study for Croatia which the Council hopes to be able to analyse immediately before or after the summer."
"Bearing in mind the request made by the local authorities, Bosnia-Herzegovina was sent a guide whose use will help towards preparing a viability study on negotiations for an agreement of the same type. This work is moving forward at a good pace given, of course, that in this specific case, we must be careful and not create excessive expectations, as the reality of the situation there does not allow us to be overly optimistic in this respect."
"I should like to refer briefly to the new regulation."
"As we agree with the European Parliament about the need to create a uniform legal basis for support to the region, the Council is waiting for a Commission proposal on a Council regulation which will replace the support granted to the region by the Phare and Obnova programmes. The recommendations to be made will form a valuable contribution to the debates which we will start within the Council on this issue."
"I note in particular that the report highlights that the reconstruction of the region must not be regarded as merely physical and economic but must also be aimed at the social infrastructure, civil society and the public institutions."
"These are the main objectives of our reconstruction strategy for the area which does not just involve a merely physical dimension but also an overall stabilisation dimension."
"The rapporteur also refers briefly to the Stability Pact on which we have been cooperating with these five countries and with the countries involved in the enlargement process."
"The recent regional financing conference which was organised jointly by the European Commission and the World Bank, in close cooperation with the Special Coordinator for the Stability Pact, gave significant impetus to the Pact' s objective of reviving the reform processes and stimulating regional cooperation. It proved that the Stability Pact mechanism has already gained a certain maturity and can and must advance."
"We believe that reciprocal commitment is the key to the Pact' s success and I feel that this point was made very clear in the recent discussions at the Commission and World Bank conference."
"The commitment of the countries in the region to implement institutional policy reforms and to create an environment allowing economic progress is a fundamental element in this Pact."
"In return, the international community is supporting the reform commitments and the donors and financial institutions have promised or mobilised a total of EUR 2.4 billion."
"Of this amount, the European Union alone, that is, the Commission and Member States combined, have promised or mobilised EUR 1.08 billion."
"The international community has financed in particular a quick-start package of EUR 1.8 billion announced at the conference and has made available the necessary financing to accelerate the preparation and implementation of projects and initiatives in the short-term package."
"However, the conference was only one initial step in a long process."
"The European Union is committed to acting as leader and guaranteeing the coherent management of this whole support process."
"It has also pledged to closely monitor and support the regional reform processes in a way which corresponds to the efforts made by each country so that these can be rewarded with advances in the development of new instruments. This will allow economic and social development and progress in line with European standards."
"With the exception of Belgrade, all the governments in the region have stated that they will start on the road to reform."
"I must clarify, however, that the Council considers that, without Serbia, our common efforts will be incomplete."
"A democratic and cooperative Serbia, at peace with its neighbours, will be welcomed within the European family. We must be aware that overall stability in this region can never be complete when one country in the region represents a factor of instability."
"This message about Serbia must be received by the respective civil society. Our support for Montenegro and for the stabilisation efforts being made in this country by the respective government must also be reconfirmed."
"To conclude, we also note that the rapporteur intends that the mandate of the European Reconstruction Agency should not be limited to Kosovo."
"In the meeting of 20 March, the Council invited the Commission to work on a proposal and to present this to the Council with a view to including Montenegro in the Agency' s mandate."
"Discussions are also ongoing about the possible extension of the EIB' s activities."
"Finally, the Council has invited the Secretary-General and High Representative, under the authority of the Council presidency and in full cooperation with the Commission, to ensure the coherence of the policies for the Western Balkans."
"At the last General Affairs Council, an initial commentary was given on these ideas which specifically stem from the presentation given by Commissioner Patten and Mr Solana. We are sure that in future meetings of the General Affairs Council this issue will be followed with close attention and by effective steps towards its realisation."
"Mr President, the report on the stabilisation and association process for the countries in eastern Europe we are debating today attempts, and I believe successfully so, to formulate a stable political framework with which to address the Balkan tragedy."
"Now is not the time to pass judgement past events and situations."
"Today, let us take it that with this report we are taking a step towards the future and creating the platform for a first successful substantive European Union policy, in a way the first successful action of the CFSP."
"Here, however, we must pay attention to certain issues."
"So what are these issues?"
"It is an open secret that interests are being expressed in the Balkans by many sides and many people, who often do not have common strategic aims."
"In all circumstances this must be stopped by non-negotiable political answers given in every direction."
"So what are they?"
"Firstly: absolute compliance with the UN' s decisions on the area."
"Secondly: the boundaries of the states in the area are non-negotiable, even if it proves necessary in critical cases to adopt flexible forms of administrative autonomy and greater decentralisation."
"I note that if there are some who think solutions will emerge either by creating new states or by redistribution between states, they are making a tragic mistake."
"That would lead to continued and lasting tension with no foreseeable end."
"A domino effect."
"Without exaggeration, at the beginning of the 21st century we would have a new thirty-year war, 10 years of which, in any case, we have unfortunately lived through."
"Thirdly: our policy must concern the peoples, and only them."
"That is what is also in Europe' s interests."
"Fourthly: the issue of economic and institutional reconstruction is an urgent priority."
"Positive results will emerge through development, democracy and prosperity."
"For the first time you are passing judgement on a complex problem at the very periphery of the European Union."
"The EU' s political credibility and competence must prove successful."
"It is a bet which must be won."
"I hope that the strong convergence of support for the Lagendijk report achieved in the Committee on Foreign Affairs will find the same response in Parliament, and thereby express the desire of us all for a positive and stable outcome."
"Mr President, I would thank the rapporteur for a report that the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party can fully support."
"I should like to take up a subject mentioned neither in the Commission' s announcement nor in the report and so run the risk of its being said that I am operating at too low a level."
"The subject I want to bring up is that of women' s involvement in the reconstruction programme, and I wish to do so because women and children have always been the major victims when it comes to conflicts, civil wars and wars generally."
"Assaults upon women, rape, killing and torture are daily fare and have been so for many years recently in the countries of south-eastern Europe."
"I think it is absolutely crucial, if cultural understanding is to be promoted and a proper reconstruction programme prepared, that women should be involved - and involved very centrally - in the processes concerned."
"I am taking up this matter because not enough - although, fortunately, a little - has in actual fact been done in this area."
"It is in fact the case that a gender task force has been established under working party 1, but this has not happened because of any initiative from above but because of an initiative from below when a number of women have - if I may put it like this - approached the conference table and asked if it were not unreasonable for them, in one way or another, to have a central place in the whole of the reconstruction work. It is a number of quite concrete, down-to-earth things these women have proposed, such as developing a proper programme for women and involving women in the general development plans."
"The initiative is also, of course, about getting women to stand at elections at local, regional and national levels. If, however, the initiative is to succeed, these women also need to receive money for the projects concerned."
"Otherwise, these will not happen. Moreover, the amount of money involved is small in relation to the other money which, hopefully, will eventually be paid out in this area."
"I would therefore ask both the Commissioner and the President-in-Office of the Council to take care to ensure that, where future work is concerned, women are involved in the reconstruction processes."
"I do not, in fact, believe that the project will succeed if that does not happen."
"Mr President, whatever its positive points, this report is flawed by the demands and requirements set out in the Stability Pact."
"In other words, it essentially accepts that the wolf can guard the sheep."
"By its very nature, the Stability Pact in Eastern Europe is intrusive, on the pretext that human rights and democracy are being protected."
"I will not yet again refer to how the European Union is reacting to the flagrant violations of human rights in Turkey and elsewhere or the strident violations of those rights inside the European Union, i.e. the double standards policy."
"For the moment, I will just note that the Pact' s real aim is to ensure the political and economic dependence of the countries in the area, to plunder their wealth and to overexploit their workforce."
"As is also stressed in the report, it is particularly worrying that in the area there will be a test of the European Union' s - I quote - 'ability to develop an effective civil and military crisis management strategy aimed at conflict prevention' ."
"In other words, new interventions are being prepared, even military ones, with the aim of converting the area into a protectorate."
"The tragic situation brought on by the criminal intervention of NATO and the European Union in Kosovo and particularly in Yugoslavia is indicative of what is likely to happen."
"Besides, respect for borders is not a matter of generalised declarations and wishes, as they occur in the report, but practical respect for the territorial sovereignty and integrity of these countries, in other words precisely the opposite of what the European Union and the USA are doing."
"It is clear that those who support this Stability Pact want to frustrate any resistance to their plans, especially when it involves conflict."
"They try, either by force or by economic blackmail, to terrorise peoples and subjugate them to the new order."
"And the question is this: what principle of international law are they basing their actions on?"
"Convinced, then, that the Stability Pact will bring new strife to peoples in the area and reinforce the dominance of the USA and the European Union, we will vote against the report and step up our fight against the Pact and on behalf of peace, friendship and solidarity between the peoples."
"Mr President, I would like to make three observations regarding Mr Lagendijk' s inspiring and excellent report."
"Firstly, the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe focuses on regional cooperation in the Balkans."
"It is precisely this cooperation which the European Union wishes to promote in the best possible way."
"Well, this regional cooperation still leaves too much to be desired."
"The basic pursuit of common interests is being undermined by a longing for prestige and rivalry among the various nations. In this way, the swift implementation of the innovative Stability Pact is being hampered."
"What is needed here is a powerful response from the European Union."
"This should go hand in hand with a selfless and more balanced selection of regional aid projects."
"Secondly, I consider Paragraph 26 in the Lagendijk report to be a fine idea."
"Indeed, the Stability Pact applies just as much across the borders of the region."
"As such, the Republic Moldavia definitely deserves the opportunity of being directly involved in the Pact."
"After all, the alternative would be that Moldavia would be in danger of finding itself in a kind of political no man' s land."
"What is more: Moldavia is linked with neighbouring Romania both culturally and politically."
"Thirdly, the success of this Stability Pact may well set a positive precedent for the East, with the Pact extended in the direction of the currently very unstable Caucasus."
"Am I right in thinking that Russia already subscribes to the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe?"
"Mr President, I will make three points."
"The first is that Mr Lagendijk' s report has interesting ideas, positive proposals, but I very much fear that it is a naïve report which cannot be implemented in the Balkans by the European Union' s policy."
"When basic factors such as respect of the Balkan borders are missing, when we play games with Montenegro and Kosovo, when this is coupled with the antagonism being shown towards the Milosevic regime, I think we are already undermining every positive effort we should be making."
"The European Union must conclude that it should respect the frontiers in the Balkans, and that is something quite different from its attitude towards Milosevic."
"The second point I want to stress is that financing part of the reconstruction plans by reducing agricultural expenditure must finally stop."
"I think that the donor conference makes this possible, or seems to at least."
"The third point I would like to make here is that there are parts of Greece, yes, unfortunately Greece, for example the Prefecture of Pieria, a tourist province in Central Macedonia, which has suffered enormous economic damage because tourists no longer come to that area."
"Such issues should be considered by the European Union as well."
"Mr President, I am not about to start arguing the toss with Mr Swoboda over where the Balkans begin."
"In fact, it was once said that the Balkans begin at the Rennweg in Vienna."
"But leaving that aside, the fact remains that this Stability Pact is of course adversely affected by the heterogeneity of its States."
"We have first and second wave candidate countries."
"We have countries such as Croatia and Macedonia that are about to overtake candidate countries."
"We have States such as Bosnia-Herzegovina and Albania in which the State is scarcely functioning, and then the two decisive challenges, namely Yugoslavia, or Serbia, where it is a question of doing everything we can to foster democratisation and develop a long-term strategy for the Europeanisation of Serbia."
"Secondly, Kosovo, where we will never achieve success unless elected political structures come into being there, along with a long-term vision of what is to happen to this region, which will never again be a Serbian province."
"We cannot afford to hang about over this issue any longer; otherwise all we will be doing is tinkering about at the edges, as it were."
"But that is not the only factor adversely affecting the Stability Pact, it is also suffering from a lack of credibility on the part of the international organisations and also the European Union, which owing to a confusion of competences, wastage, and mismanagement, are displaying traits that would be dismissed as being typical of the Balkans, were it not for the fact that this is happening in our own organisations."
"We are losing a great deal in the way of credit and respect in this region, and this respect and credibility are fundamentally even more important than the promises of funding that are made and then not kept."
"I truly believe we must put this situation in order in the European Union, primarily by strengthening the Commission' s role in the matter."
"Commissioner, I have a great deal of faith in your work, but I must say that we as a Parliament must also ensure that you are able to give this work more in-depth attention than you have been able to hitherto."
"What we need here is cooperation between our two institutions, so as to strengthen the EU and its credibility."
"Mr President, I, too, consider this to be a satisfactory, significant report."
"I would, however, stress certain points."
"We know that the countries of the South-East are a priority, but we must be careful not to give ourselves more priorities than we can handle and not to establish conflicting priorities or we will lose credibility."
"I refer to the Mediterranean policy and the Middle East peace process, which are also priorities."
"We must be consistent, as I will remind the Council when we come to discuss the budgetary issues."
"Secondly, it should be borne in mind that the regional approach is appropriate and important, and that it is important for the European Union to play a guiding role throughout this matter."
"I therefore call upon the Commission and the Council to ensure, in the management of this extremely complex process, that the balance is maintained between the regional dimension of the Pact and the bilateral Association and Stabilisation Agreements, or we may end up sending contradictory signals to these countries."
"Finally, I would like to mention two other points: the former Yugoslavia and crime."
"With regard to the former Yugoslavia, I feel that we must follow the recommendations of the report and gradually reduce the embargo on the civil community until it has been lifted completely, because to continue to enforce it will only serve to postpone the fall of Milosevic."
"The sooner we do this, the better."
"Apart from anything else, the embargo is affecting other countries in the region, including several candidate countries."
"It is causing serious harm."
"And who can lift it if Europe does not?"
"It appears that even the United States are expecting us to lift the embargo. We must find the courage to take this step."
"Lastly, as other Members have reminded us, we must deal with society as well as infrastructures."
"It might be interesting to meet with the chairmen of the three Working Tables to discuss these projects; maybe the Committee on Foreign Affairs could see to this."
"Society is important, and that is why we must continue with information and culture projects."
"For example, my city, Rome, is organising the young artists' biannual event in Sarajevo and funding the Sarajevo Concert Hall, precisely to give a sense of the reconstruction of a society within which there is dialogue, but which has dialogue with us as well."
"Then there is the issue of crime."
"My country, Italy, has a very high organised crime rate."
"Puglia, for example, is a region which has to tackle crime organisations with a base in our country as well as elsewhere."
"I would include this among the priorities I mentioned before, because investments will also be affected if this level of organised crime is maintained."
"Mr President, I arrived in the Chamber this afternoon with an extremely good speech, which I would like to thank my cabinet for most warmly; but perhaps I can deliver it on another occasion because I would actually like to respond informally to this debate."
"Members of the House will have noticed that the High Representative and I produced a report for the Lisbon Council, and I suspect that Mr Lagendijk might have noticed that it bore a striking similarity to his own report."
"I am not sure which was chicken and egg, but I feel that in complimenting Mr Lagendijk on the report he will not take it amiss and think that I am really congratulating Mr Solana and myself."
"Yet there was a great deal of similarity."
"It is fair to say that our work for the Lisbon Council was very much motivated by the strong feeling that unless we can make a success of our efforts in the Balkans, the whole credibility of our attempts to construct a common foreign and security policy will be shattered."
"It is enormously important that we rise to the challenge in the Balkans."
"A point we made to the heads of government in Lisbon in our report - which was very much reflected in the week that I spent recently in the region - is that the stabilisation and association process has to be at the heart of our strategy."
"To put it in a rather more demotic way, in the phrase used by my honourable friend Ms Pack, what it means is designing, helping countries along the road to Europe."
"They want to be integrated with the Euro-Atlantic structures; they want that as an alternative to the traumatic disintegration of the last few years."
"We have to make that a real process for them."
"There were a lot of references to the Stability Pact conference the other day, which as several people have said was a considerable success."
"The offers made by donors exceeded by a comfortable margin the expectations at the beginning of the conference."
"There are a couple of points I want to make about it."
"One, in response to Mr Lagendijk, it is true that some of the money going into the quick-start projects supported by the European Union was money from the 1998 and 1999 budgets."
"There is a simple reason for that, which is that in some cases we had already carried out feasibility studies and made preparations for these quick-start projects."
"In my book, new money is money you have not spent already."
"Unfortunately, given the fact that our budget is based on commitments and payments, and not just payments unlike the budgets in almost all the Member States, that is a particularly important factor."
"Committing money does not always mean spending it, the next year or the year after or even in the next decade."
"It is important to be clear about that."
"This follows up the point made by Mr Swoboda and it is a point with which I strongly agree."
"We are not just talking about infrastructure in terms of hardware, we must also talk about infrastructure in terms of software."
"That includes the rule of law, democratisation, the sort of civil society projects to which the honourable gentleman was referring; and it includes education - a point I will come back to in a moment."
"I want to make one or two other points which arose at Lisbon and which we are following up."
"First of all, we were charged in the Commission at Lisbon to bring forward a package of proposals on asymmetric trade concessions for the region."
"It is worth remembering that the total exports from the Balkans to the European Union represent about 0.6% of our total imports."
"For agricultural products the figure is about 0.16%."
"So this is an area where we could afford to be a little generous."
"We are also trying speed up our assistance and make it more effective."
"I announced yesterday agreement in the Commission on a rapid reaction facility."
"We will be coming forward to Parliament in the next few months with our new regulation for assistance to the West Balkans, which I hope will make it more rapid, more flexible and will, of course, have to include sufficient funding for projects supporting gender issues."
"I can think of no single model of successful economic or political development which does not include at its heart sensible programmes to ensure that women can develop their full potential and play a full role in their communities."
"One point on education: last winter, despite all the cynicism, our energy for democracy programme in Serbia was extraordinarily successful."
"Alas, there are not many occasions when people cheer the European Union in the streets - all too few occasions in the country I know best."
"But that happened in some of those cities last winter."
"The Mayor of Nis has just written a letter saying that Energy for Democracy was a model of the sort of political support we should be providing in his country."
"The winter is over, so there is not the same urgent necessity for oil at the moment."
"We are looking at ways to extend that sort of scheme."
"What we have been thinking of, among other ideas, is education for democracy: providing schools with equipment, school-books and other facilities, cash to carry out small improvements to classrooms and so on, and with sports equipment - all those sorts of things which can make for a better life for the kids in those towns while they have to wait with their families for the departure - sooner rather than later, I hope - of Mr Milosevic."
"I hope we are at last going to see more progress on the cleaning up of the Danube, which is crucial for the region."
"We had useful meetings with the Danube Commission last week and I hope that the annual meeting of the Danube Commission this week will see us managing to set all that in motion, with the European Union meeting about 85% of the cost of the clean-up."
"I have spoken before of my concerns about Montenegro."
"Following my visit there about a month ago, we have doubled our Obnova support for Montenegro from EUR 10 to 20m."
"We are also providing a good deal there in terms of food security and so on."
"I very much hope that the European Investment Bank will lend some money within reasonable limits to Montenegro before too long."
"Finally, the honourable Member asked about the scale of our financial commitments to the Balkans."
"There will be other occasions when I can follow this up in greater detail."
"For me one of the real tests is whether all those yards of Council communiqués and all those promises about Marshall plans and so on for the Balkans actually amount to a row of beans!"
"This year we will be spending about EUR 540m in the western Balkans."
"Because of the front-loading of our commitments in Kosovo, next year we will need to spend about EUR 800m in the Balkans."
"About EUR 350m of that will go to Kosovo."
"It must be said that it does not involve huge increases in expenditure elsewhere but we have to provide support in a country like Croatia where there is a good and decent government trying to do a difficult job in extremely problematic circumstances."
"We have to spend money with those stabilisation and association countries which are negotiating seriously with us on the road to Europe."
"For me, in public-spending terms, the crucial year is always year one - you are lucky if you get to year two or three."
"Year one is actually the big year of expenditure for us."
"Overall, at Istanbul, when we were asked how much we thought we could spend in the region, recognising that it was subject to the budgetary authority - I know all the theology of these matters now - we reckoned about EUR 5.5bn."
"People say that is a crazy figure."
"Well, I am keen that we should no longer be in the position we are in now where, despite the interinstitutional agreement, we are told by a lot of people that we have to find the extra money for Kosovo within the financial envelope agreed before Kosovo became a necessity."
"One thing I have insisted on is a realistic figure in our budgeting for reconstruction in Serbia, because I do not want to find myself in two or three years time having to find additional costs for Serbia out of that same budget."
"We reckon that applying the same sort of figures applied in Kosovo, we would need about EUR 2.3bn for a serious reconstruction programme in Serbia."
"That could only start once Milosevic has gone."
"However, in my view it would be thoroughly irresponsible for us to suggest figures to this Parliament or Council which did not include an element of what we think would be realistic for Serbia."
"That is based on economists' figures and our assessment that we need to meet the same sort of a proportion of expenditure on Serbia that we have met in Kosovo."
"The rest - EUR 3.2bn - over seven years does not strike me as being outlandishly generous."
"That is how we reached the figure of EUR 5.5bn and I have slightly resented the implication in some newspapers that this is a figure we have plucked out of the air and does not make any sense."
"I should be delighted to explain it not just in more detail to Parliament but I am looking forward in due course to explaining it in more detail to the General Affairs Council."
"Who knows, if I was lucky enough one day, I might even be able to explain it to finance ministers."
"I respond to the honourable Member' s well-intentioned question in that way."
"This is not a figure plucked out of the air: it is an attempt to provide an honest assessment of what our rhetoric actually means."
"People cannot resent the fact that they do it: they asked us to do it in relation to the Middle East - to give some idea of what the cost of a peace settlement would be for the European Union' s programmes."
"So let us see the cost of it in the Balkans."
"If we are going to have an argument about the relationship between rhetoric and reality, let us start here."
"My final point: we are clearly talking in the Balkans about building peace and security, not just in our backyard but in our front yard too."
"We are talking about building peace and security in an integral part of our European common home."
"I hope we can do so in practice with the rhetoric, with the promises, with the optimism that we show in all those rhetorical communiqués."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 11.30 a.m."
"Question Time (Council)"
"The next item is Question Time (B5-0216/2000). We will examine questions to the Council."
"As they deal with the same subject, Questions Nos 1, 2 and 3 will be taken together."
"Question No 1 by (H-0255/00):"
"Subject: Flagrant violation by Turkey of the rule of law and human rights The leader of the People' s Democracy Party of Turkey, together with 17 other members of the party' s leadership, has been sentenced to a three-year and nine months' term of imprisonment for supporting the hunger strike that took place in solidarity with Abdullah Öcalan when he was handed over to the Turkish secret services in Kenya."
"Three mayors of towns in S.E. Turkey, who are supporters of the same party, were also arrested on charges of collaborating with the PKK."
"Other Turkish parties besides HADEP have voiced their opposition to the arrests and sentences, arguing that they are a flagrant breach of democracy, freedom of expression and the basic principles of the rule of law."
"Will the Council raise the matter of the arrest and conviction of democrats for their opinions, and call for unhindered freedom of expression in Turkey together with freedom of formation and operation for all political parties?"
"Question No 2 by (H-0286/00):"
"Subject: Human rights violations by Turkey In December 1999 Turkey became a candidate country for accession to the European Union."
"Article 10 of the conclusions of the Helsinki Council Presidency states that Turkey must fulfil the general accession criteria, and in particular the Copenhagen criteria, if it is to become a Member of the European Union."
"In February of this year three Kurdish mayors (of the towns of Diyarbakir, Siirt and Bingöl) were arrested on their return to Turkey after they had signed the Aalborg Charter in Hanover in Germany together with 4 colleagues making their towns members of the 'European Sustainable Cities and Towns Campaign' ; they are still being held in prison."
"Since Turkey is guilty of continuous and repeated human rights violations, what does the Council intend to do prevail upon Turkey to meet the EU accession criteria?"
"Question No 3 by (H-0299/00):"
"Subject: Continued muzzling of freedom of expression and violation of the rule of law by Turkey The leader of the People' s Democracy Party (HADEP) of Turkey and 17 other members of the party leadership have been sentenced to prison terms of three years and nine months on charges of supporting the hunger strike organised in support of Abdullah Öcalan when he was handed over to the Turkish secret services in Kenya."
"Three mayors of towns in south-eastern Turkey who are close to this party have also been arrested on charges of collaborating with the PKK."
"Other Turkish parties apart from HADEP have expressed their opposition to these arrests and sentences, arguing that this move is totally incompatible with democracy, freedom of expression and the basic principles of the rule of law."
"Will the Council say whether it intends to raise with the Turkish government the issue of the arrest and sentencing of democrats merely for making statements and to demand, as part of the pre-accession procedure, that Turkey give guarantees regarding unrestricted freedom of expression and allow all political parties to be founded and function without hindrance?"
"Mr President, the Council has already raised with the Turkish authorities the issue of the democratic rights of Turks of Kurdish origin, including those mentioned in the question. It will continue to monitor this situation in Turkey as it develops and to act accordingly."
"An Association Council meeting was held yesterday between the European Union and Turkey in which this issue was mentioned again. The Turkish authorities were told of the EU' s concern about this type of issue and of its hope that the Turkish authorities will end what is currently interpreted as a non-compliance with certain basic criteria of respect for human and democratic rights and the protection of minorities."
"Turkey was named by the Helsinki European Council as a candidate country for accession to the European Union."
"This status places Turkey in absolutely the same position as any other candidate country in terms of both obligations and benefits."
"Therefore, Turkey is subject to the same requirements as those imposed on any other candidate country but also naturally has the same rights."
"The European Union cannot make a special case of Turkey which must be treated exactly the same as any other candidate country."
"Turkey is therefore currently involved in a process in which its situation must be assessed in light of the criteria of the Copenhagen European Council. These criteria are clear enough with regard to respect for the rule of law, democratic guarantees, fundamental freedoms and the protection of minorities."
"These are a prerequisite for the opening of any negotiating process."
"On the road towards this, a pre-accession strategy must be established between the Commission, on the EU' s behalf, and Turkey. The preparation of this strategy involves non-governmental organisations, the Member States and the Turkish Government."
"This accession partnership will define the priority areas for reform on which the European Union considers that Turkey must concentrate its efforts in order to comply, hopefully in a progressive, capable and complete manner, with the Copenhagen criteria."
"Clearly it is in this context that the issues mentioned in the questions will be considered."
"Yesterday we heard Mr Verheugen and today the Council' s representative acknowledging, even in small measure, some of the problems related to respect for human rights in Turkey concerning which, indeed, they expressed their sorrow."
"Yet, both yesterday and today they underlined the supposed progress made by the Turkish regime in that area."
"And we heard the representative of the Council telling us the same thing today."
"The truth, however, is that contrary to what some people are claiming even in Greece, the Helsinki decisions on Turkey have emboldened the Turkish regime."
"It is no mere chance that on the next day Turkey' s leaders declared that Turkey has become a candidate for accession without attached conditions."
"It is not by chance that, while they have not complied with any of their commitments, they protest that they have not been given the appropriations provided for under customs union."
"They also told us that Turkey intends to take steps."
"But we have been hearing that in the Council of Europe for very many years, perhaps more than ten, without anything happening."
"If anything, things are worse."
"The campaigner for democracy and human rights who was shot was sent to prison again instead of his attackers being punished."
"My question, then, is: specifically when does the Turkish regime intend to progress with democratising that country' s constitution and criminal code, to set free the leaders of HADEP and the Members of Parliament as well as all the political prisoners?"
"With regard to the comment that Mr Korakas' question was not a new one, I must say that Turkey' s application for accession to the European Union subjects it to closer scrutiny of its responsibilities in complying with the basic criteria for accession."
"I believe that the Turkish authorities are well aware of this. With regard to defining the pre-accession strategy and the accession partnership, Turkey' s problems will certainly be paid close attention, particularly in terms of respect for the basic criteria of acting in accordance with European standards."
"In the past Turkey was a country in which we regularly and systematically undertook certain ad hoc initiatives according to the development of its internal situation."
"But no more!"
"The internal situation is now becoming a strategic element in the progress made by Turkey towards approximation with the European Union."
"In the specific case of Mr Birdal, I was able to meet him in Turkey in January of this year and I told him during this meeting of the EU' s solidarity with his situation. It is clear in this respect that the EU has already indicated its concern to the Turkish authorities, through the appropriate channels, about his status and in particular his return to prison."
"For a long time we have adopted a foreign policy which we allege is based on moral rules."
"And not just that."
"We have come to believe it ourselves and we claim to represent the world-wide moral conscience."
"Already, however, we have reached an impasse, and not just in Turkey."
"You see, morality must be applied towards everyone equally, regardless of risks and interests."
"But that cannot happen."
"You see, Belgrade can be bombed, but not Moscow, Beijing or Ankara."
"Let us therefore acknowledge the obvious and return to tried and tested prescriptions."
"In other words, let us speak of interests, the balance of powers and policy as the art of the possible."
"If we do that we will certainly not be more moral, we will be more sincere and in that case we can all put our time to better use instead of play-acting as we are all doing now."
"I am not sure that you have asked a question."
"If there is no question, the Council is not obliged to answer, only to listen, as you know, Mr Seixas da Costa."
"Mr Theonas wishes to rephrase his question."
"I recommend to all of you that you begin with the question before making a declaration."
"I have a comment and a specific question: would it not be better for the Council to give more specific answers when it asks for specific questions?"
"That was my comment."
"Now, the question: if the pre-accession process for Turkey were to last twenty years, would all those who are imprisoned today have to wait those twenty years for the European Union to express interest?"
"Secondly, would the Council be prepared, in this whole process, to suspend or cancel obligations of the European Union relating to the pre-accession process as long as the people we are talking about remain in prison?"
"And finally, could some action ever be demanded from Turkey which would help resolve the Cyprus issue, granted that this is one of the issues which should be addressed as part of the pre-accession process?"
"Firstly, Mr Theonas, I do not agree with the comment that the Council presidency is not explicitly answering the questions raised by Members."
"In fact, quite the contrary is true."
"The ongoing process of Turkey' s approximation towards the European Union, which was started with its designation as a candidate in Helsinki, is one of progressive approximation. The Member should realise that this process of progressive approximation is resulting in greater attention being paid than in the past by the European Union to Turkey' s internal situation and to the way in which this country acts with regard to the requirements imposed by the international community."
"It is this point which really must be borne in mind."
"Turkey is currently, on its own initiative and therefore as a result of its own political decision, the subject of close scrutiny in terms of compliance with the basic criteria."
"This is not to be assessed over the next ten years but rather on a daily basis, usually within the pre-accession strategy process."
"If there were a lack of progress on the fundamental issues under observation, the pre-accession process would suffer the respective consequences."
"This is very clear to me."
"Furthermore, the Helsinki conclusions, regardless of how they may be read, place the issue of Turkey and its relationship with Cyprus in a new perspective, which was in fact welcomed by the Cypriot authorities."
"We must draw from this the appropriate conclusions about how the development in the Turkish position on the Cypriot issue may also affect the development of the Turkish position in its approximation towards the European Union."
"A comment and question to the Council' s representative: is the answer he just gave us specific?"
"For goodness sake!"
"Mr Korakas, I must make a confession."
"In political life, people are used to reading between the lines."
"On such a delicate issue as the interpretation of a serious situation, like the development in the Cypriot situation and Turkey' s approximation towards the European Union, we must be very careful in our choice of words."
"However, I feel that I made it clear that there is a direct link between Turkey' s approximation process and its position on the Cypriot issue."
"I cannot make this any clearer."
"Question No 4 by (H-0294/00):"
"Subject: Blatant persecution and violation of the rights of the Assyrian-Chaldeans in Turkey Tens of thousands of Assyrian-Chaldeans in Turkey living in the south-east of the country have found refuge in Member States of the EU after being persecuted by the Turkish Government which has destroyed many of their homes, closed and raised to the ground their churches and banned the use of their language and teaching in this language."
"There is a danger that, owing to the use of force, the remaining places of worship and even the traces of the existence of this minority will be lost for ever."
"Will the Council say whether it intends to raise this matter as part of the pre-accession procedure, to call on the Turkish Government to respect the rights of the Assyrian-Chaldean minority in Turkey and, more particularly, to ensure that the Mar Gabriel monastery in Midyat and the Dayr Zafaran monastery in Mardin can continue to operate without hindrance?"
"Very briefly, what I said about the development of the situation in Turkey and the necessary changes in terms of respect for the rights of minorities also applies in this case which specifically involves the protection of Christian minorities."
"The reinforcement of the political dialogue agreed in Helsinki requires progress to be made towards compliance with these political criteria, particularly on issues of human rights. All the situations which have been brought to the Council' s attention during the pre-accession process will be tackled."
"This particular question involves the problem of non-recognition by the Turkish authorities of the Assyrian-Chaldean community under the terms of the Lausanne Treaty of 1923."
"Under this Treaty, the Turkish Government undertook to ensure full protection for the churches, synagogues, cemeteries and other places of worship of non-Muslim minorities. At this point in time, the claims of the Assyrian-Chaldean community basically relate to the problem of restoring monasteries and the official teaching of Aramaic and the problem connected with the free movement of citizens from this ethnic group who live outside Turkey."
"These are clearly administrative issues. They do have a human rights dimension which obviously must be tackled - and we will be vigilant in this respect - but they are essentially administrative."
"The Council will be vigilant and the Commission will also raise these issues during the pre-accession negotiations."
"Mr President-in-Office, I cannot say your answer is satisfactory."
"If the Council were truly concerned about human rights one would have expected a more specific answer."
"We are talking here about two very ancient peoples who have been subjected to systematic genocide by the Turkish regime, a genocide perhaps not so impressive as in Armenia, but just as effective."
"Several thousand people have become refugees or immigrants to the European Union and only a few tens of thousands remain in the area where they have lived since ancient times."
"I would like to ask whether you can be more specific."
"Of course, your reference to the Treaty of Lausanne is apt, but beyond that, the European Union also has a responsibility to stress certain things to the Turkish regime concerning the need to respect human rights, whether they stem from the Treaty of Lausanne or in a broader sense."
"Is the Council going to take any specific action along those lines?"
"Mr Alyssandrakis says that my answer was not positive enough."
"It would be useful to remind him of his question."
"He asked whether the Council intends to raise this issue during the pre-accession process and to ask the Turkish Government to respect the rights of the Assyrian-Chaldean minority in Turkey and, in particular, to ensure the operation without hindrance of their monasteries. He specifically referred to two monasteries."
"I have no idea what more positive answer I could give him than to simply say yes."
"It is the Council' s and the EU' s intention to raise this issue with the Turkish authorities during the pre-accession process."
"Once again, if this is not a clear answer, I have no idea what is."
"Question No 5 by (H-0262/00):"
"Subject: Renewed tension in Kosovo The results of the 'peaceful' intervention by NATO forces in Kosovo are generally acknowledged to be deplorable."
"Instead of the 'multi-ethnic' Kosovo which had been the UN' s objective, we have a situation in which the refugees have failed to return, ethnic cleansing has continued, but now directed at the Serb population, partition has taken root and the dispatch of increasing numbers of new military and police forces is considered 'indispensable' . The current increase in tension is being fuelled by statements by NATO officials and major new military exercises by NATO forces."
"Will the Council say what measures it intends to take to safeguard a 'multi-ethnic' Kosovo as part of the Yugoslav Federation? What action will it take to defuse the crisis and tension in the region?"
"- (PT) Mr President, the European Union' s objective, in accordance with Security Council Resolution 1244, continues to be the establishment of a democratic and multi-ethnic Kosovo within the internationally recognised borders of the Former Yugoslavia."
"The Council accepts the urgent need to find a solution to the continued outbreaks of ethnic violence, particularly against the Serbs, gypsies and other non-Albanian communities in Kosovo."
"The Council has been consistently supporting the efforts made by UNMIK and KFOR to prevent further expulsions and to allow the safe return of all those who abandoned their homes."
"In response to an urgent appeal from the UN Secretary-General' s Special Representative, Doctor Bernard Kouchner, and from the High Representative, Mr Solana, the Member States have significantly increased their contributions to the UN' s international police forces with both financial and technical support and human resources."
"Several Member States have also reinforced their own contingents in KFOR."
"In the past in this House, we have deeply regretted the failure to meet these commitments, which has clearly hindered the action of the international authorities in Kosovo."
"There are now new elements involved and some of these commitments are now being met. This is allowing this issue to be handled differently and more effectively, although we are clearly still a long way from achieving a minimally acceptable solution."
"The Council has urged all the political leaders in Kosovo to adopt urgent measures to combat the escalation of violence, to reject expressions of extremism and to support UNMIK and KFOR."
"It is very important that the Council manages to further develop the progress already made in the reconciliation between the ethnic groups and that Resolution 1244 can be put into practice."
"We are committed to the process of democratisation and coexistence in Kosovo."
"Only responsibility-sharing by representatives of the minorities can lead to the construction of a multi-ethnic Kosovo."
"We should all ask ourselves whether everyone, particularly within Kosovo itself, is interested in the existence of a multi-ethnic Kosovo."
"In this context, the Council repeats its appeal to the Serbian leaders to participate in the joint interim administrative structures."
"The Council places great importance on the careful preparation by UNMIK and the OSCE of local elections to be held this year, including the provisions on voting by absentees and the participation of minorities."
"We believe it is important to start creating legitimate structures with local authority in Kosovo. This is the only way we can guarantee that the political forces which are currently working in an unorganised manner, outside any institutions, will return to normal political life and end up working in Kosovo within a democratic society."
"In terms of supporting this process of democratisation and coexistence, the European Union has been working together with other international partners to re-establish daily life for the whole of Kosovo' s population, whatever their ethnic background."
"In addition to the important bilateral assistance given by the Member States, the European Community has allocated humanitarian aid for 1999 to 2000 to the amount of EUR 429 million for the Kosovar refugees, displaced persons within the country and those returning home."
"The aid for reconstruction and the special financial assistance, including the support for UNMIK, will total EUR 437 million between 1999 and 2000."
"This set of actions and the commitment shown by the EU in this respect have been recognised by the international community."
"Unfortunately, at times the practical efficiency of these actions is not sufficient to end an unstable situation beset by tensions which we hope will decrease in the future."
"Let me first comment that the President-in-Office of the Council is besieged by questions from Greek Members."
"I think that expresses the great insecurity felt by a Member State, but I would also say the inadequacy of Community policy to address serious issues. I want to thank him for his answer."
"I take note of that position, which I find particularly positive and which we do not often see, namely that the European Union' s objective is a multi-ethnic and democratic Kosovo within the framework of the internationally recognised borders of the Yugoslav Federation."
"I think that is a positive thing and I have taken note of it. I would like to ask a supplementary question regarding in particular those minorities suffering persecution today in a situation of ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, whether they be Serbians, of Turkish origin or gypsies, who are, on the one hand, under such pressure from Albanian extremists and, on the other hand, living in a Serbia still subject to embargo."
"Are there any special support and aid programmes planned by the European Union specifically for these people who are living in such misery and desperation?"
"Mr Alavanos, I believe it was clear from what I said and in fact you recognised yourself that the general objective of the European Union and the international community is to respect the terms of Security Council Resolution 1244, particularly on the establishment of a democratic and multi-ethnic Kosovo."
"I am not ignoring the major difficulties present on the ground in applying these decisions."
"There is no point on this issue using euphemisms or diplomatic language."
"The mass return of the Albanians expelled from Kosovo and the tension which has arisen in the meantime, particularly involving Serbian, gypsy and other minorities, have ended up creating a new and different situation. However, we should not only look at the present."
"We must consider what happened in the past which was the cause of all this."
"Perhaps by looking at the causes of this situation, rather than fixing on the present, we will have a fairer and more objective view of the partial responsibility of the Belgrade Government, particularly with regard to what happened to it subsequently due to its actions in Kosovo."
"However, it is true that, for the Serbian minorities who have had to leave the country since the return of the Kosovo Albanians, the conditions have not yet been established to allow them to return. Those still living in Kosovo are having problems coexisting with the Albanian majority."
"However, the Member must recognise the clear efforts being made by the international community to protect these minorities and to achieve a safe situation allowing them to coexist with the Albanians."
"We cannot ignore the fact that this joint effort also needs the Serbian authorities to be involved in the consultative structures."
"This would be one way of making its own actions in Kosovo credible."
"Our only objective is to guarantee the continuation of multi-ethnic integration."
"We realise that there is a long way to go and probably the situation of the Serbs living outside Kosovo, and who cannot return because it is unsafe, is unfair."
"There is no point beating about the bush on this. This situation is unfair."
"However, we must realise that the international community is doing its best."
"Furthermore, we should always remember what happened before, in order to justify what is happening now."
"Mr Alavanos said that until now all the questions we have heard have been Greek."
"I would like to say that the Spanish and the Portuguese, as well as other Mediterranean people, are accustomed to speaking with the Greeks."
"I believe that Lisbon, the ancient Olisipo, was founded by Ulysses."
"The President-in-Office of the Council therefore comes from a country with a long tradition of Greek presence."
"Mr President, could I ask the President-in-Office of the Council - all of whose good intentions for a multi-ethnic Kosovo I accept - whether he would not admit that the international community' s policy there in all its facets - the European Union, the United Nations, KFOR, NATO et al - is really an unmitigated and disastrous failure and getting worse by the day."
"What is being done to get the KLA and the Albanian bully-boys, who clearly have no interest in a multi-ethnic Kosovo, under control?"
"There just seems to be an ineffectual permissiveness of the situation despite all these wonderful, pious good intentions."
"Firstly, to comment on what the President said, I must say that I am very happy to be grilled by the Greek Members. I have some great friends in Greece where I have spent several holidays."
"As for the situation you describe, Mr Purvis, I do not believe that the policy is disastrous. This is the only possible policy, as you know, and it is a result of everything that has happened in the region in the last few years and even in the last few decades."
"We must realise that the international community' s position, which is not brilliant in terms of the practical application of these measures, is the only one which can resolve a conflict on which the international community was only called to act due to the total inability to find a solution within the Former Yugoslavia."
"It was precisely the situation created in the Former Yugoslavia which caused this reaction."
"You refer to the KLA."
"Remember that the KLA only exists because the Albanian community in Kosovo was systematically persecuted and totally besieged."
"Clearly the need to organise themselves militarily to respond to this threat led to the KLA' s action."
"The problem now facing us is to try and ensure that the structures created outside the democratic process, simply because this did not exist in the Former Yugoslavia, allow an approach of solely political action to be adopted in a democratic Kosovo."
"We are still a long way off from finding such an approach, but I believe that the international community' s action is very positive in this respect."
"Mr President, if a mark between 1 and 10 were now to be given for success in pursuing the two objectives of the action programme, namely that Kosovo should be multi-ethnic and that it should remain a part of Yugoslavia, I believe that the President-in-Office of the Council and I can probably agree that the mark concerned would be fairly low. We agree, however, that this is the result of a policy which has been pursued up until now, that is to say a result of what has happened."
"My question is this: is the Council giving any consideration to how this policy can be changed in the future, or is the intention to go on using the same tools, that is to say military action and initiatives against troublesome areas in the region?"
"What is the basic idea behind setting up a 60 000-strong rapid reaction force when we all agree that a number of other initiatives are presumably required if there is a desire to solve conflicts in Europe and in neighbouring countries?"
"If I did I would ask them what other solution they propose. As a specific example of what military forces can do, I would refer you to the case of Bosnia-Herzegovina."
"Just think what the situation was like there for several years. Just think about the international community' s failure to act faced with this problem and then just look at the situation today."
"This is clearly unstable but it is one of peace due to the presence of the military forces. It is clear that there are certain situations in which attempts to deflect ethnic tensions can only be successful by using mechanisms which involve the protection and separation of the waters."
"This is very probably what is needed in Kosovo, who knows for how long, but hopefully for the shortest time possible. We should also bear in mind that the international community and particularly the Member States have no specific interest in intervening in Kosovo and in mobilising human and physical resources for an action of this kind."
"In fact quite the contrary. The international community and the European Union in particular were aware that it was their duty and responsibility to react to a totally disgraceful situation in terms of international standards of behaviour."
"It was the genocide and siege behaviour of Mr Milosevic with regard to the Albanian community in Kosovo which led to our intervention."
"You say that the practical result of this action is not what was wanted. I would point out, however, that the practical result is that today, with a few exceptions and despite everything, this situation is under control in terms of security."
"We have made and are making efforts to achieve greater integration of the minority communities."
"A more effective result has not been possible."
"We will try to continue exerting pressure in this respect and we believe that renewing in some way the institutional organisation of civil society through independent elections may contribute significantly to this stability."
"Question No 6 by (H-0279/00):"
"Subject: Protection of European undertakings in Kosovo Despite the fact that the Council is unaware of this (answer to Question E-2425/99), the above undertakings have indeed appealed to the EU to protect their interests, as this matter falls within the Council' s remit."
"Given that UNMIK and its head, Bernard Kouchner, do not act of their own accord, but under international supervision in which the Council is also involved, the latter should scrutinise their actions more closely where they affect the interests of European undertakings, if it wishes to avoid raising doubts about its intentions though the answers it gives."
"Furthermore, the proper management of the fourth Pillar entails a number of additional obligations for the EU institutions."
"Since the Commission, which is unfortunately taking an unconscionable amount of time to reply, is well aware of the actions of the undertakings concerned, and in order to avoid any doubts about whether the Council is responsible for failing to act, will the latter say to what extent it is prepared to act in accordance with the obligations imposed on it by the Treaties and to support the interests of the undertakings in question?"
"(PT) Security Council Resolution 1244 gave UNMIK, the interim administration in Kosovo, authority over the territory, including full legislative and executive powers, and control over the legal system. The aim was to establish a transitional administration whose mandate was described in the resolution itself."
"This mandate also includes the development of a phased economic recovery plan."
"This means that the individual cases mentioned in the Member' s question should be dealt with directly by the UN Secretary-General' s Special Representative for Kosovo, who is responsible for the territorial administration of Kosovo, or by the Foreign Minister of the Member State in which the undertakings are established."
"The Council assumes general political responsibility for the EU' s participation in UNMIK which is focussed on reconstruction and economic rehabilitation."
"However, neither the European Union as such nor the Council has any competence or direct responsibility with regard to the administration of the territory and the protection of the individual interests of undertakings in the region. These elements are, on the one hand, the responsibility of the United Nations, as the administrator of the territory, and on the other, of the governments of each Member State which may act to protect these undertakings."
"I have been waiting about six months for an answer on this."
"There is a whole raft of questions and answers and we are becoming schizophrenic over the substance and content of the answers."
"What is hiding behind all that?"
"Either the services are not doing their job properly and are giving you wrong information, or there is something rotten in the Kingdom of Denmark and there are many who say that there is something peculiar about Mr Kouchner' s administration."
"My question is this: if the services are not doing their job properly, what are you going to do when they leave you high and dry?"
"If Mr Kouchner is not doing his job properly, what are you going to do about it?"
"And the third question: how can it be that the citizens of the European Union are being called upon to pay for the Stability Pact even though European undertakings established there cannot be protected by the European Union?"
"That does not happen anywhere, it is unreasonable."
"We should therefore see things as they are, because my impression is that Mr Kouchner is not playing his part properly there."
"That is where the problem lies and that is what we should all realise, as European citizens and people interested in developments in the Balkans."
"The question raised has never been submitted to the Council of the European Union, particularly by the undertakings which are complaining."
"The Council presidency has no knowledge of this issue."
"Complaints are submitted to the Member States whose Foreign Ministries are responsible for dealing with this type of question."
"It should be borne in mind that the administration in Kosovo does not come under the EU' s competence but under that of the UN. There is a specific body responsible for this administration."
"Each country is normally obliged to protect the actions of its undertakings within the international sphere."
"Each country has structures to protect its citizens and undertakings internationally and for this reason there are specific mechanisms which we all use every day in our international action."
"The European Union is not a country."
"I do not know under what circumstances the European Union would have to have a global and specific action plan in this respect or why, as a Union, it would have to deal with this issue."
"That is unless we reach a point at which national governments prove to be incompetent in protecting their own undertakings."
"Mr President, an essential element in the reconstruction of post-war society is always that recovery of the local economy should be as rapid as possible, so that it becomes viable once more."
"Local businesses in Kosovo now, however, have one substantial problem: a dearth of qualified and linguistically competent labour, as all those who can speak English, or nearly all, were recruited for reconstruction projects in Kosovo, and local businesses cannot compete with the high salaries being paid."
"Many entrepreneurs are naturally very bitter about this consequent stagnation in activity."
"Mr President-in-Office, I do not know if you have come up against this problem, but I would nonetheless ask you what you think can be done about it at EU level."
"Doctor Bernard Kouchner has at times referred to the difficulty he has in recruiting staff, not only for the country' s administration but also for the normal structures of economic reconstruction."
"It is clear that the cost of recruiting staff is high."
"We consider that this type of question comes within the framework of Doctor Kouchner' s work which, as I have said, is outside the control of the European Union, although we are cooperating on this issue."
"The Union as such does not therefore have a specific and direct response to this type of question."
"We are ready to listen to and consider the requests made to us by Doctor Kouchner and to give him any possible answer within the commitments assumed by the European Union with regard to the extremely high costs involved in the region."
"Mr President, my question is quite specific and is, I believe, of direct concern to the EU."
"Is the Council aware that the Serbian government is planning to sell mines and mineral resources in Kosovo to EU companies and to portray this as privatisation?"
"Does the Council know that there are problems here associated with ethnic cleansing in one part of Kosovo, in that Serbs are being settled in one area, which is the area that is richest in raw materials, and there is a risk of the area being partitioned in order to safeguard these raw materials?"
"Mr Posselt, I have no knowledge of this issue. However, we will consider the information you have given us."
"Question No 7 by (H-0274/00):"
"Subject: Joint efforts to coordinate IT development The Portuguese Presidency has commendably highlighted the need for development of the IT sector in order to promote competitiveness and employment."
"Coordination at European level would be conducive to the further development of the IT sector."
"What is the Council' s view of the need for coordination at European level to develop the IT sector and, in that context, of the need to set up a European IT agency?"
"Mr Andersson, to answer your question I should like to start by confirming that a coordinated approach at European level to the information technology and telecommunications sectors is essential for the future development of the European Union."
"We have already discussed in this House the Special Meeting, which was held in Lisbon on 23, and 24 March. At this it was clear that improving the Information Society policy is central to achieving the objectives which this meeting set and which involve the issues of employment, social cohesion and reinforcement of Europe' s competitiveness at world level."
"In particular the Special Meeting invited the Council and Commission to prepare an action plan on e-Europe, which will be presented, to the European Council in June."
"The idea of launching an agency devoted to information technology was presented at the Lisbon European Council in the document provided by the Swedish Government."
"This idea was not followed up but it responds to our concerns and will definitely be considered and developed in the future."
"It was discussed, however, particularly in terms of possibly being added to the existing Community mechanisms, which include the Information Society Project Office. This has been producing a range of initiatives during the Portuguese presidency."
"On the issue of a possible European telecommunications regulation agency, I would remind you that a study carried out for the Commission in October 1999 concluded that there was no immediate need for such a body. At the same time the Council concluded that regulation should be applied at the closest possible level to that at which the activities to be regulated are carried out."
"This too involves the principle of subsidiarity."
"I want to thank the Council for its answer."
"I was pleased to see that the issue of information technology and its link to growth and employment were so high on the agenda in Lisbon."
"What happens in the future is important."
"The political task is not, of course, to set up IT companies but to build an infrastructure which stimulates development in this area."
"We do, of course, have shortcomings within the EU."
"Moreover, there are major differences between the EU' s Member States and also between different regions within the EU."
"Different population groups have varying opportunities and knowledge when it comes to exploiting this technology, and this may lead to great inequality in the future."
"I would therefore ask the question: how are we successfully to devise a form of coordination which enables information technology also to be used out in the peripheral areas so that we create greater equality between different regions and between different population groups?"
"Is there not a need for a joint authority to coordinate this work?"
"Mr Andersson, you have asked me two separate questions."
"The first concerns the substantive issue of democratising the Information Society itself, which was at the root of the concerns of the Lisbon European Council. This involves the need to spread throughout European society, precisely in the area where it is less competitive and in order to give added value to the usual elements of its economy, all these new dimensions of the society of innovation and knowledge."
"This effort is scheduled to use specific measures contained in the conclusions of the Lisbon European Council, particularly with regard to the Internet and methods of apprenticeship and vocational training. In our opinion, these may be able to form a future action plan, which will be assessed every year at special meetings of the European Council, which will always take place in the spring."
"This is the answer to your first question."
"Your other question concerns the need to have an organisational structure and an institution to supervise this process and to pay specific attention to the similarity between these types of question within the European Union."
"You rightly make the point that on many occasions specifying these measures may create and worsen inequalities."
"This is a danger and risk to which we are alert."
"In the meantime, the governments have decided that the creation of a new structure and bureaucratic mechanism with high costs is not necessary."
"They in fact consider that the structures which currently exist for monitoring this process are sufficient for this purpose."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, as an Austrian I am extremely proud of the fact that the Council Presidency has focussed on development in the IT sector."
"I would be interested to know how the President-in-Office of the Council views the sale by auction of UMTS licences."
"The proceeds from this sector could create a huge amount of impetus and, above all, boost the Portuguese programme accordingly, if, for example, we were to make the proceeds from the licences that are sold by auction available for research and development, education, training and further education, or for infrastructure."
"What do you think to the idea of developing incentivisation programmes for the Member States, so as to enable the proceeds to actually be ploughed back into this sector?"
"The conclusions of the Lisbon European Council specify national actions which are therefore the responsibility of the national governments. These are objective commitments which the governments assumed in signing these conclusions and which involve the reorientation of the mechanisms and structures and action plans and programmes which exist within the European Union."
"With the exception of the possibility of recourse to the European Investment Bank, there are no new elements in this respect for mobilising financial resources."
"This was one of the objective concerns raised during discussions of this issue in Lisbon."
"It was decided to try and achieve greater coherence between the current instruments for the simple reason that we believe that, rather than creating new instruments, we should reorganise the current ones."
"Having said this, it is necessary, as we have done in the employment and macroeconomic policies, to try and achieve greater coherence between the national actions on the society of innovation and knowledge and to ensure that these actions are subject to a specific plan which each Member State undertakes to implement internally. This will occur in accordance with a set timetable of objectives and using benchmarking processes which allow us to see which are the best practices and to try, based on these, to encourage similar practices in the other Member States."
"This process has this national dimension of a commitment on objectives and it is therefore obvious that there are no financial resources for this other than those available in the budget of each country."
"In the other dimension, in which recourse to the European Investment Bank is possible, there is a set of actions within the competence of the EU itself, which not only complements previous actions but also ensures greater coherence between the EU' s programmes and actions in this area."
"The Commission has been extremely active in this field and the e-Europe programme presented by the Commission and whose action plan will be approved at the Feira European Council in June provides new guidelines for this area and a new reorientation of Community policies on this issue."
"As the author is not present, Question No 8 lapses."
"Question No 9 by (H-0275/00):"
"Subject: Women in the new CFSP decision-making bodies Has the Council provided for any measures for women to be adequately represented in the new CSFP decision-making bodies, or made any recommendations to this effect?"
"How many women will there be in the crisis management bodies and the security and conflict-prevention political committee?"
"Will the Council be taking due account of the specific contribution women can make to working for peace?"
"- (PT) The issue raised by the Member is of fundamental importance. It concerns the involvement of women in the common foreign and security policy and the new crisis management structures, such as the security and conflict-prevention political committee."
"The Member has asked whether the Council will be taking due account of women' s particular skills in working for peace. It is quite clear that the contribution of women in working for peace and in other similar respects, particularly in mobilising civil society, is well-known and unquestionable."
"We all know, without bothering to be diplomatic about this, that the role and representation of women in the decision-making process, either within the CFSP or generally within other structures, is inadequate."
"We all know the efforts made by the international community in this area and we remember the conclusions of the Beijing Declaration of 1995 on this issue."
"Next June there will be a Special Session of the UN General Assembly to draw international attention to the need for women to be involved in actions implemented within the Beijing Declaration. In particular, specific measures will be taken to encourage this involvement."
"It should be realised that pro-active policies do not work in some areas of the decision-making process."
"Greater involvement is needed in political actions, in the training process and in the administrative process in general."
"We believe it is impossible to implement just one specific action, for example introducing quotas in the common foreign and security policy structures."
"In our opinion, this is not appropriate and the Council has made no proposal in this respect."
"However, it is the responsibility of each national government to carry out the necessary reforms of its own system of representation in order to guarantee adequate participation by women."
"These issues are now being regulated at European level and recommendations are being made as a result of the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"We believe that, as all representation within the European Union is carried out by people from the Member States, it is the latter which are mainly responsible for mobilising as many women as possible who can rise within the decision-making process."
"I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Seixas da Costa, very much for his reply, which gives us hope since it demonstrates that the Council understands the problem, is responding politically and perhaps even sympathises with the idea."
"Nevertheless, I consider his reply to be basically too retrograde."
"The Helsinki and Cologne Summits specifically gave the Portuguese Presidency the job of strengthening this new protection policy."
"You have said that you are against quotas but in favour of references."
"I would like to ask the Portuguese Presidency: do you not think it would be highly appropriate to include a reference, in the form of a recommendation, in this respect?"
"I believe that the role of the European Union should not be to remain behind the United Nations or to be content merely with a reference to what Beijing was about."
"The European Union must be progressive."
"Women must clearly be involved in political decisions - also decisions with regard to peace - and I ask the Portuguese Presidency to make some reference in this respect."
"Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, thank you for the hope which you have placed in the Portuguese presidency. However, I am sure you are aware of the limits of what we can do, particularly in an area such as this."
"I have no hesitation in saying this because in my own departments 80% of the officials are women, even in managerial posts."
"It is therefore clear that hope must always be the last resort of political action and that equal opportunities and equal representation of the sexes must be the practical and specific goal in our daily life and actions."
"To be totally frank and at the risk of being considered behind the times, I do believe that there are limits to what can be achieved by pro-active political action in this area."
"Bearing in mind these limits, it will be rather difficult, when we set out to assess the new common foreign and security policy structures in terms of defence, to say to the Military Committee or the Military Staff that half of their soldiers should be female."
"This is because it is up to the Member States whether or not they have female generals or brigadiers."
"Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, I cannot raise an issue like this just to appear politically correct. I must always be objectively honest."
"Question No 10 by (H-0276/00):"
"Subject: Participation of research partners from the developing countries in environmental research programmes funded by the EU The key to the development of the developing countries is their ability to participate in development work themselves both as definers of problems and as seekers for solutions."
"On the other hand, at EU level this approach is being poorly applied in relation to science and technology projects affecting developing countries."
"The EU' s framework programmes do not extend to the developing countries."
"This means that North African partners, for example, are not able to be involved in science and technology projects relating to the environment."
"In fact no-one is preventing them from carrying out the research, but there are no funding opportunities, and thus the developing countries have no access to consortia as partners entitled to apply for funding."
"Why is this not the case, given that opportunities have been devised for even Russia, for example, to be involved?"
"Has the matter been considered from the point of view of the extent to which, for example, desertification in North Africa or the problems of the Mediterranean affect the EU?"
"Is the EU prepared to provide greater responsibility in the form of funding to local researchers, so that research activities can combine even after the funding bodies have left, and to ensure that projects can be carried out without the investment of local researchers?"
"In 1998, the European Parliament and the Council adopted the Fifth Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development to run from then until 2002."
"One aspect of this Framework Programme is its four thematic programmes, which define priority areas for research, and its three horizontal programmes."
"One of the latter is entitled 'Confirming the international role of Community research' and is intended to promote scientific and technological cooperation at international level and to help implement Community foreign policy in this area."
"The general objectives of this international scientific cooperation are also set out in this Framework Programme and include support for the development of a Euro-Mediterranean partnership and a contribution to the economic, social and scientific development of developing countries."
"In December 1998, the Council also adopted rules on participation by undertakings, research centres and universities and on disseminating research results in order to implement the Fifth Framework Programme."
"With regard to the participation of legal entities of third countries and international organisations, all the indirect research activities under the thematic programmes are open to research bodies in Mediterranean non-Community countries and developing countries, in principle without Community financing. The only exception to this involves situations in which Community financing is regarded as absolutely vital to achieve the aims of the activity."
"Article 6 of the Framework Programme authorises the participation by entities of third countries in specific research and technological development activities under the horizontal programme on the international role of Community research."
"In January last year, the Council adopted the specific programmes for the Fifth Framework Programme which set out the objectives and activities for the various categories of third countries."
"With regard to Mediterranean non-Community countries, an indicative allocation of EUR 55 million was established for research and development activities such as integrated coastal management in the Mediterranean, including environmental aspects, water management, natural resource management, conservation and restoration of the cultural heritage, socio-economic modernisation and so on."
"With regard to developing countries, an indicative allocation of EUR 210 million was made available for specific activities such as those involving the adoption of innovations, the promotion of a sustainable relationship between population pressure, food safety and the use and management of ecosystems, the improvement of productivity and the prevention of damage to natural resources."
"In addition, a grant system was created under a specific programme which allows graduates and doctoral students from developing countries and Mediterranean non-Community countries to work on European projects."
"Funds were also allocated for coordination with Community technical assistance programmes, including the MEDA and EDF programmes, and also for Latin America and Asia."
"The application of these three decisions is clearly the Commission' s responsibility, supported by the committees for the relevant programmes."
"So far calls for specific proposals aimed at developing and Mediterranean countries have been made with a total budget of EUR 85.5 million."
"Mr President-in-Office, I thank you for this reply."
"I would, however, like a brief answer that is clearer and more precise."
"Do we then have a situation where the developing countries may now apply for funds?"
"They were not able to before."
"How is the situation different from, for example, that regarding the INTAS and Interreg programmes in Eastern Europe?"
"With regard to matters falling within the Commission' s specific competence, the only promise I can make, in answer to the Member' s supplementary question and her concerns, is that I will try to obtain a more concise answer which will probably have to be given in writing."
"As the author is not present, Question No 11 lapses."
"Question No 12 by (H-0277/00):"
"Subject: Common defence policy at the IGC There is a 'shortlist' of proposals for the IGC, according to which the Conference will confine itself largely to 'institutional' issues."
"It is generally supposed that Portugal plans to expand the list at the June meeting."
"Is this true, and will Portugal then bring the common defence policy onto the agenda for the IGC?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Helsinki European Council authorised the Portuguese presidency to establish the EU' s interim security and defence structures as from 1 March of this year."
"These structures were established on this date. Their activities are currently being developed so that they can assume a more specific and practical form and in particular so that the definitive model which we believe could start to operate next year can be agreed."
"In parallel with the work on these practical aspects, a discussion is ongoing within the European Union on determining the mechanisms for participation both by EU Member States which are not members of NATO and by NATO countries which are not EU Member States. This discussion is occurring within the overall context of action on the Petersberg tasks specified in the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"The question which has arisen and which has also been raised by the Member - for which I thank you as it is my responsibility to chair the preparatory group of the Intergovernmental Conference - concerns the extent to which this issue may or may not fall within the scope of the IGC."
"It will only be placed on the IGC' s agenda if and when it is confirmed that amendments need to be made to the Treaty on European Union in order to bring these structures into practical operation."
"It is still not clear at this stage of our debate within the European Union whether or not amendments to the Treaty will be necessary."
"As soon as this becomes clear, we will announce this."
"The Portuguese Presidency will present a report to the Feira European Council in June giving an assessment of the state of progress and an opinion on whether or not these issues should be included within the IGC."
"If these are to be included, this would only be confirmed during the French Presidency."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, European defence policy is at present being drafted, and different countries are involved in the task."
"There are Member States in NATO and there are countries which are not in NATO."
"Mr President-in-Office, do you believe that the European Union can frame a defence policy that would be independent of NATO, or will all the new arrangements be in harmony with NATO' s basic structures?"
"Mr Seppänen, your question indicates that you are clearly confused, unless there has been an interpreting error."
"We are not talking about defence policy but about crisis management for which powers are now included within the Treaties. The issue in question is not therefore a European defence policy or the creation of a European army."
"The issue is crisis management and humanitarian actions which are commonly referred to in Community parlance as the 'Petersberg tasks' ."
"All the EU countries, including yours, can make a valuable contribution to this area."
"We are trying at the moment not to create a European defence policy but rather a common culture of security allowing us to participate in crisis management."
"In this respect, I can see no major problems."
"We hope to ensure that all the various cultures which exist within the Union are compatible."
"I would thank the Council."
"I am nonetheless a little surprised at the answer."
"I was under the impression that it was not possible to act if it was a national legal system which had pronounced judgement, because that would amount to interfering in national affairs."
"In that way, Article 6 of the Treaty of Amsterdam would really, of course, be revoked, that is to say if action were to be taken on the basis of national legal systems."
"It can hardly be intended that a Member State should be able to do whatever it likes as long as it does so via its own legal system."
"I would also ask if the Council intends to look more closely into this issue and perhaps examine it in more specific terms."
"The crisis management and humanitarian actions specified in the Petersberg tasks to which the Helsinki European Council referred are actions which may be carried out by the European Union."
"However, our intention is to guarantee that these actions are totally compatible with what currently exists in the relations between certain EU Member States and the NATO countries."
"The reason for this is that the mechanisms and means which exist for managing these crises are not extensive. In fact, most of the time, these means belong to NATO."
"As it is the means for military and security action which currently exist within the EU and NATO which will be mobilised, it is therefore essential to guarantee effective cooperation with all the NATO countries, including non-Community countries and particularly the candidate countries such as Turkey, Norway and Iceland."
"It is clear that at a much wider level and bearing in mind the dimension of the operations, these actions will also require the involvement of the United States of America and Canada."
"We therefore need broad cooperation which aims to guarantee the sharing of responsibility among all those countries which currently have a similar security and defence culture and objective."
"Question No 13 by (H-0283/00):"
"Subject: Violation of the right to freedom of expression The Court of First Instance of Thessaloniki, presided over by a single magistrate, recently banned from circulation a book by the author Mimis Androulakis, describing it as irreverent."
"Article 6 of the Treaty of Amsterdam states that the European Union is founded on the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms."
"Furthermore, Greece is a contracting party to the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantees the right to freedom of expression and religious freedom."
"In view of these considerations and given that the cornerstone of a people' s Europe is the fundamental commitment to freedom, pluralism and human rights, what view does the Council take of such a measure and will it intercede with the competent Greek authorities to put an end to the persecution of the author and the ban on his book?"
"Mr Papayannakis is asking the Council how it interprets this judgement of the Court of First Instance of Thessaloniki banning from circulation a book by the author Mimis Androlakis which it describes as irreverent. He is also asking whether the Council intends to intercede with the Greek authorities."
"I should like to explain that, under Article 6(1) of the Treaty on European Union, as amended by the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Union respects a set of basic principles by reference to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms."
"The underlying aim of this article is to establish a kind of political supervision over the actions of Member States and to ensure that democratic principles and values are respected."
"It is intended to guarantee the sharing of common values."
"However, Article 6 cannot be invoked for the purpose of any type of interference in the administration of the internal affairs of Member States, particularly at judicial level."
"The Union has no competence to intercede in the exercise of legal power by the Member States. Therefore, the Council cannot interfere in the decision-making of the authorities."
"The judgement delivered by the Court of First Instance of Thessaloniki, which is a judgement of a legal body of a Member State on a specific case, may be subject within the Greek legal system to an appeal to the higher national courts."
"Having exhausted this recourse to the Greek courts, there would always be recourse to the Court of Human Rights."
"My follow-up question is about how the decision at the Helsinki Summit about military, peacekeeping and peace enforcement operations is to be interpreted."
"The decision provides an opportunity for the Applicant States too to participate in the military structures to be established by the EU."
"Does this also apply to Turkey which has, of course, applied for membership?"
"Does this mean that a door has been opened for military cooperation between Turkey' s and the European Union' s forces in, for example, peace enforcement operations?"
"Mr Sjöstedt, the Member States undertake to act within the framework determined by the Treaty."
"This is why they signed the Treaty."
"If a serious and persistent violation of citizens' rights were to be identified, according to the terms of these articles, then there would clearly be ways of interceding with the Member States."
"The Union itself has ways of doing this but only in specific cases."
"A case like this, in a democratic country like Greece, meets all the conditions to be judged and handled within the Greek legal system until the capacities for recourse within this system are exhausted."
"If we were to intervene in a case like this, we would clearly be transposing to the Community dimension an issue for which there is a whole range of recourse in a country which fully respects human and citizens' rights."
"Thank you very much, Mr Seixas da Costa."
"Since the time allotted to Questions to the Council has elapsed, Questions Nos 14 to 31 will be replied to in writing."
"That concludes Questions to the Council."
"(The sitting was suspended at 7.00 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)"
"Address by Mr Klestil, President of the Republic of Austria"
"Mr President, you expressed the wish to speak today at our Parliament' s formal sitting."
"It has always been the case that any EU Member State Heads of State who express that wish are received among us with the consideration due to their person, the high office they hold and the nation over which they preside."
"(Loud applause) It is in that spirit that I now welcome you on behalf of the European Parliament."
"At the beginning of this year 2000, the constitution of the present Austrian Government has, as you know, given rise to some strong feelings in all the EU Member States, among their governments as well as their people."
"(Loud applause)In the case of this Parliament, one question broadly transcends any political or national divergences between its Members, and that is their attachment to the values on which the European Union is founded and their determined resistance to the rise in racist and xenophobic ideologies."
"(Loud applause)Mr President, we know that you were not in favour of this coalition, in which an extreme right-wing party has an equal share, and that you spared no efforts to find an alternative solution..."
"(Uproar on the far right)...and that, before agreeing to what you believed you could not prevent, you demanded and obtained from the political leaders concerned a strong commitment to the values on which the European Union are founded."
"(Applause, and protests from the far right)It is in that context and in a spirit of profound friendship and respect for the Austrian people that we will listen carefully to the message you wished to pass on to the European Parliament."
"We have no doubt, Mr President, that it will take account of the very serious concerns our Parliament expressed by an overwhelming majority, on 3 February last."
"Without further ado, I therefore give you the floor."
"(As President Klestil prepared to take the floor, many left-wing Members left the Chamber."
"Interjection from Mrs Muscardini: ""So that is democracy, not to give a hearing to speakers..."" )"
"Financial services and complementary pensions"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"A5-0059/2000 by Mr García-Margallo y Marfil, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission communication on implementing the framework for financial markets: Action Plan [COM(1999) 232 - C5-0114/1999 - 1999/2117(COS)];"
"A5-0053/2000 by Mr Kuckelkorn, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission communication ""Towards a single market for supplementary pensions - Results of the consultations on the Green Paper on supplementary pensions in the single market"" [COM(1999) 134 - C5-0135/1999 - 1999/2131(COS)]."
"Before we begin I would like to advise you that, since this is a night sitting and we have a lot of work to get through, I am going to be very strict in applying time limits."
"I therefore also ask Members to show an appropriate degree of self-discipline so that we can finish at a reasonable time."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, if I had to point here and now to two complex issues in the economic field, I would no doubt choose the following: the consolidation of the financial markets and the approximation of the direct taxation regulations - specifically tax on savings - which is under discussion."
"The debate which we held recently on the bodies for collective investment in transferable securities and the reactions to the report on pension funds, which we will hear shortly, demonstrate the complexity and importance of these issues."
"These two issues, the liberalisation of the financial services market and taxation, are dealt with in the action plan which is the subject of my report."
"It is therefore appropriate to thank all the groups for their cooperation and confirm once again to the Commission that it can rely on the active cooperation of the European Parliament in the implementation of this plan, and we will not disregard our duties, but exercise them responsibly."
"The complexity of the action plan also reflects the ambitious nature of the report presented by the Commission, which contains 43 measures and involves all the sectors in the field (stock exchanges, banks, investment funds, insurance, etc.) and which applies to what has come to be called the 'new economy' , which is - according to the Lisbon Summit - one of the elements which will help to put an end to unemployment in Europe."
"What is included in these measures?"
"What is intended through these measures?"
"In my judgement, to sum up, it is the following: the liberalisation of the financial sectors and the updating of the regulations on supervision and control in order to achieve a European financial market which is at least as competitive as the United States financial market."
"In order to achieve these two objectives, the Commission proposes a truly arguable and risky formula: the speeding up of the legal process, which, in turn, would involve three actions."
"Firstly, a reduction in the standards which need to be included in a regulation or directive, that is to say, which require the participation of this Parliament."
"Secondly, limiting those standards to the definition of the general approaches and basic principles which must be established in this field, allowing the Commission the possibility of implementing them."
"Thirdly, granting the Commission broad powers of interpretation."
"I do not doubt that we have to speed up the process, Commissioner, but this Parliament is not prepared to relinquish the powers which it has taken so long to acquire."
"Therefore, one of the first tasks which we will have to undertake together is to find a model which will satisfy both objectives."
"With regard to liberalisation, the first of the tasks which the Commission proposes, the Commission starts from one premise: the consolidation of the single market in financial services requires the removal of the barriers which hinder its operation."
"We could not agree more."
"The consequence is that, in order for the market to function, these barriers must be removed."
"Again we agree, but we know that there are difficulties in this approach resulting from the need to reconcile the objective of liberalisation with the objective of protecting investors."
"Firstly, the barriers are not identified."
"Commissioner, it is not sufficient to be able to deduce what they are from the measures proposed by the Commission."
"Personally, I would have liked to have seen a list of those national measures which, in accordance with the Directive on financial services, are hindering the operation of the market in each country."
"Secondly, the solution proposed by the Commission still raises difficulties."
"It is ridiculous that a financial company has to operate while being subject to, and having to have knowledge of, fifteen different legislations, but it is at least as ridiculous that an investor - especially a non-professional investor - should end up needing to contract services, bound by regulations which he or she does not know, from companies whose solvency is unknown, and, in the event of legal dispute, he or she has to take action in a foreign country, with foreign jurisdiction and procedures."
"Liberalisation must therefore be implemented in parallel with the increase in measures relating to control and taxation."
"With regard to control measures, we have a new problem: the need to adapt the competence and jurisdictions of authorities which are still national and which, on the whole, apply differing models, to a different world affected by globalisation, international competition and free movement of capital."
"Finally, Mr President, my personal conviction is that, if we do not want liberalisation to give rise to distortions in competition and the flight of capital to more beneficial climates inside and outside the Union, the correct operation of the market in financial services will not be possible without a certain degree of approximation of the laws which regulate savings."
"These are the concerns which are raised in my report."
"These concerns reflect a constructive attitude towards cooperation with the Commission, which I have always considered to be a loyal ally of this Parliament, in the development of an issue which is so very complex."
"Mr President, I am referring, as you have said, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, to the Commission communication on the action plan for the implementation of the framework for the financial markets."
"As the main rapporteur, Mr García-Margallo y Marfil, has pointed out, in this regard there are two questions which are, firstly, taxation - without fiscal harmonisation it would be very difficult to establish Community financial markets - and secondly, a legal framework."
"With regard to the legal framework, I believe that there is a paradox in this sector."
"The more liberalised an economy is, the more necessary it becomes to rigidly regulate the financial markets."
"The American economy, which is probably one of the most liberalised economies in existence, is the economy which lays down the most detailed regulations for the financial markets."
"The Commission, in its proposal, on page 18 of the Spanish version, after recognising the competence of Parliament by means of codecision, in accordance with Article 251 of the Treaty, tells us that we should move towards very flexible procedures by means of comitology."
"Comitology in these cases usually means taking away with one hand what is given with the other."
"In this respect, I am in total agreement with the conclusions of the rapporteur."
"I believe that we need some very specific legislation and I am sure that the Commission can count on the support of Parliament in the drawing up of this legislation."
"As the rapporteur said a moment ago, we cannot expect confidence on the part of investors, consumers and, ultimately, the financial markets, if they do not have a specific legal framework in which to operate."
"The only way to do this is to replace the current rigid regulations with a set of specific Community regulations which will produce certainty in this very delicate sector of the economy."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy deplores the fact that the action plan for the financial markets does not take into account the problems which industry, small and medium-sized businesses in particular, is facing with regard to financing cross-border activities."
"Many businesses, ranging from small businesses in border areas to large multinationals, would like to treat their accounts as one national account."
"For example, they would like to use funds in their euro account in country A to settle an account in debit in country B. In this way, they would pay less interest."
"Existing legislation, however, prohibits or hinders this type of cash management technique."
"The world of banking has already driven this problem home to you on numerous occasions."
"On behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I would now like to ask the Commissioner whether it would be possible to set up a forum group which carries out market research into the legal and fiscal obstacles for businesses, SMBs, in particular, when they finance their cross-border transactions within the euro zone, in order to solve this problem."
"I would appreciate a reply to this."
"Mr President, in view of the Resolution of 3 December 1998, to which the Kuckelkorn report does not appear to contain a reference, Parliament once again is obliged to request that the Commission produce as soon as possible a directive or, as Mr Medina Ortega appropriately suggested, a Community law coordinating the various national laws."
"The Commission appears to be somewhat apathetic in this regard, and seems to be concentrating rather on producing a directive on prudential rules for pension funds, which is easier to achieve but less effective in terms of decision-making in relation to the elimination of barriers to labour mobility and the coordination of taxation systems."
"The legal bases are very important, and, clearly, different: in view of the various judgements delivered by the Court of Justice, pension funds could be governed by Article 47 and Article 55, the removal of barriers to labour mobility could be governed by Article 42 and the coordination of national tax systems by Article 94."
"However, I would stress the need and the desirability to develop a single package, because this is the only way to achieve an overall framework which tones down the extreme positions contained in certain proposals for amendments."
"I refer, in particular, to biometric risks, which are a very important factor but which should be dealt with on the basis of paragraphs 7 and 8 of the opinion drawn up by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"Indeed, making cover for biometric risks obligatory would be likely to make the system very inflexible."
"I therefore feel that funds which cover biometric risks should receive privileged treatment, and that any inflexibility of the system could, in effect, result in negative imbalances for the beneficiaries."
"Mr President, we see the reality of the situation all around us."
"If 23% of Europe' s population is over 65 years old today, this figure will have reached 40% by 2025, and the proportion of four working people to every retired person will have become two working people to every retired person by 2020."
"This demonstrates the pressing need to allow the development of supplementary self-funded high return pension schemes in the European Union to usefully supplement state contributory pension schemes."
"As we all know, our Member States are working towards ambitious structural reforms, but it is also up to the European Union to intervene in the area of pensions, particularly supplementary pensions, in order to facilitate the free movement of workers in the context of the single market, to establish a genuine single capital market and also to ensure that equality between men and women is respected."
"With this in mind, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has been concerned to reconcile the security and efficiency of supplementary pensions for future pensioners as it is true that the guarantee of a high level of security for beneficiaries encourages healthy and desirable competition between European pension funds."
"This is why our Committee feels that the proposal for a directive on Community prudential regulations applying to pension funds must be tabled and adopted as quickly as possible, bearing in mind our discussion today, with proper guarantees for the external and internal supervision of the funds concerned and for the calculation of their prudential commitment."
"Furthermore, in order to encourage the free movement of workers, we felt it essential to quickly improve the transferability and the acquisition of pension rights from supplementary schemes from different European countries."
"This is the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
". (FR) Mr President, I would like to say first of all in this debate that we are expecting to see a proposal for a framework-directive very soon, which will guarantee the development of a genuine single market for supplementary pension funds under the second and third pillars, given that the first pillar, which covers all biometric risks, must remain the cornerstone of the European Union' s social protection system."
"This directive must in particular establish a framework to remove obstacles to the free choice of a pension fund, to the free movement of people, to the free provision of services and to charging double taxes."
"We recommend a solution based on the principle that contributions should be tax-deductible, and that supplementary invested income should be taxed in accordance with the income tax law in force in the country of residence."
"On the controversial issue of whether supplementary pension schemes should cover biometric risks, I wish to state that from the point of view of taxation, pension funds that do not cover these risks will not be discriminated against in relation to those that do."
"With regard to prudential regulation, this should not be disproportionate, so that the security of the fund is guaranteed."
"That covers the general framework."
"I am grateful to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for having included all the relevant conclusions of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities in the motion for a resolution."
"I now come to the report by Mr García-Margallo y Marfil."
"With regard to the action plan which seeks to deepen the internal financial services market, I would like to issue a warning about certain strategists who are attempting to hold the liberalisation of the financial services sector hostage, because the work that has been undertaken on the taxation of savings has not made the progress they would have wanted."
"As matters currently stand, we should remember that a single market for capital and financial services can function perfectly well without tax harmonisation."
"Faced with proposals that confuse ambition and reality, I wish to emphasise that establishing a European Committee for stock exchange operations is certainly not the number one priority and, as I have no speaking time left, Mr President, I will give an explanation of vote tomorrow to say the rest of what I still wanted to say, because as draftsperson of the Committee' s opinion and as a speaker on the second report, it is really impossible to say everything in two minutes."
"Mr President, representatives of the Commission and the Council, Mr Kuckelkorn, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to thank the Commission for the sterling work they have done."
"The communication from the Commission is liberal-minded and forward-looking."
"Why should Parliament now adopt a less liberal position and vote in favour of stagnating structures?"
"We should not define the form and scope of the directive too narrowly."
"What we need to do instead is to view the issue openly and from a wider perspective."
"It is essential that we do not define the nature and scope of the risk coverage in a restrictive way."
"Instead, we should be open-minded and look at the issue from a wider perspective and encourage a framework which is based on liberal markets and vigorous competition between different types of pension schemes."
"What we should promote is the freedom of choice of the employee and the employer to choose the kind of scheme that best suits their interests"
"The question of biometric risks has proved to be of a controversial nature."
"My firm opinion is that all the different pension schemes should be covered by the same directive in order not to protect certain types of schemes from competition."
"Consumers and employers must have the right to choose the most suitable form of pension scheme and, therefore, schemes covering biometric risks should be treated under the same directive as schemes not covering these risks."
"Both form a pension scheme but focus on different competitive benefits."
"Mr Kuckelkorn, no-one in this Parliament is of the opinion that supplementary pensions should not cover the longevity risk, through the purchase of an annuity or by some other tool."
"It is not the task of the European Union to define the nature and scope of the risk coverage concerning other biometric risks."
"But it should be determined individually by each employee, as the Commission proposes."
"Leaving this kind of decision to the individual is consistent with the principle of subsidiarity."
"Allowing supplementary pension scheme managers the freedom to invest in a diverse range of instruments increases the security of the overall investment portfolio."
"Increased freedom promotes the functioning of the capital market and has a significant impact on the growth of venture capital in Europe."
"I am committed to the idea that we, as the European Parliament, should encourage healthy competition and the freedom of choice of the individual."
"This must not only mean a single market for supplementary pensions, but the whole package of legislation concerning the financial services."
"Mr President, the Socialists support the Commission' s efforts to establish a transparent and fluid internal financial services market."
"It is in the interest of economic operators and all consumers that the costs of capital and financial intermediation should be as low as possible."
"European financial markets are currently suffering from compartmentalisation along national lines, even though, following the globalisation of the international financial system, we are seeing the widespread phenomenon of mergers and internationalisation."
"The action plan aims to make the European market equal to the American market."
"The success of the American market is basically due to 'king dollar' ."
"It is paradoxical in this context to note that some of the most ardent supporters of financial liberalisation at the same time oppose the euro."
"The real introduction of the euro in 2002, however, will result in transparency and competition, which will force the national markets to adapt more quickly than they had anticipated."
"The problem is that the legislative bodies, both national and European, are taking a long time to adapt the law to reality."
"Personally, I would not be opposed to an accelerated legislative procedure, on condition that it does not end up as a mere exercise for non-accountable technocrats."
"The Commission could make a useful contribution in the form of proposals simplifying and codifying the 11 or so directives that govern the banking sector, the 8 directives on investment funds, and the 21 directives dealing with the insurance sector."
"There is not only a problem of coherence in the various legislations on the different sectors of the financial world, but in particular there is the problem of supervising and protecting the public interest."
"John Kenneth Galbraith condemned the mistaken idea that there is any link between money and intelligence."
"The lure of profit is such that the financial world tends to create a form of collective euphoria, which often leads to financial crisis."
"The free movement of capital must be accompanied by an efficient regulatory and prudential framework, because supervision of the various markets is divided up according to country and sector, but at the same time, as a result of mergers, acquisitions and amalgamations, boundaries between banks, insurance companies, investment funds and pension funds are disappearing."
"Finland and the United Kingdom have drawn conclusions from this and have established a single prudential authority for the whole sector."
"Article 105(6) of the Treaty stipulates that the Council can entrust the ECB with specific tasks relating to policies on the prudential supervision of credit companies and other financial companies, with the exception of insurance companies."
"Should the Council not use the Intergovernmental Conference to establish the necessary legal basis for the Council to be able to entrust the ECB with certain specific tasks relating to the prudential supervision of insurance companies too?"
"I must congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Kuckelkorn, for the tenacity with which he argues in favour of supplementary pensions and for these to become in effect a second pillar of insurance for old age."
"I shall conclude, Mr President, by pointing out that it amounts to saying that whilst we should not discard insurance products we must favour products which cover biometric risks."
"Mr President, Commissioner, if Europe is to grow, attract capital and create jobs, the single market for financial services must be turned into a reality."
"Up until now, it has mostly been a matter of words and all too few concrete measures."
"At present, the financial services market and, through this, Europe' s power to grow have been impeded by countless national regulations and administrative complications."
"These are detrimental not only to companies but also, of course, to Europe' s citizens."
"The development of the Internet is, and will be, of great importance to the provision of financial services across national borders."
"Above all, it is consumers who will benefit from this development because they will have greater choice and access to lower prices."
"We Liberals do not regard tax harmonisation as a prerequisite for bringing the single market for financial services to fruition, even if a degree of harmonisation may prove to be necessary to avoid harmful competition over taxes."
"The euro has stabilised economic development and provided better opportunities to reduce the costs of acquiring capital, something which benefits both companies and private households."
"It is my conviction that, if the EU is to be able to provide Europe' s citizens with growth and strength, then all Member States must participate fully in the EU project, that is to say, be members of EMU."
"Mr Romano Prodi' s statement today in a Swedish newspaper to the effect that Sweden could stay outside EMU is therefore both surprising from an economic point of view and doubtful in terms of the Treaties."
"The Commission' s Green Paper on liberalising complementary forms of pension protection is something we welcome."
"It is nonetheless important to emphasise that pension cover in Europe is characterised by national diversity and that there is no need to harmonise the various systems in order to create a single market."
"It is important that a large number of systems should exist side by side."
"This increases choice and diversity."
"However, it is desirable, in order to avoid double taxation, to introduce a minimum degree of harmonisation in regard to the Member States' treatment of supplementary pensions for tax purposes."
"I also consider that the Member States themselves should be able to determine what the system should look like, for example whether or not the care of relatives should be covered by pensions."
"This is an issue which can be resolved better at national level."
"In committee there was lively discussion on biometric risks."
"Views were put forward to the effect that only those systems which cover risks of this kind are to be included under the directive."
"We do not believe that this should be the case, especially in view of the need for small and medium-sized companies to be able to do business."
"Freedom of choice is emphatically a good thing."
"Finally, I want to congratulate Mr García-Margallo y Marfil and Mr Kuckelkorn for two important reports designed to create a competitive Europe."
"Mr President, where supplementary pensions are concerned, the crucial issue is whether one wants to provide pensioners with security in their old age or to reinforce Europe' s capital markets."
"These are not only two quite different goals, but it is also difficult to combine them in one and the same system."
"The Commission' s proposal and both the reports we are debating today give priority to the needs of the capital market."
"The hope is that the market-based pensions will then also prove to be good for pensioners in thirty or forty years' time."
"How matters will turn out, however, we do not know."
"If one considers how Europe has changed during the last thirty to forty years and acknowledges that circumstances are going to change just as much in the future, then one can see how uncertain such forecasts are."
"There is a large deficit when it comes to security and solidarity in the pensions area because the risk is so great and because there can never be enough security and solidarity."
"Supplementary assurances are therefore a problem."
"They are, of course, much less secure than a system of basic pensions which has been financed on the basis of solidarity."
"I also believe that supplementary assurances and supplementary pensions may be needed, but then their managers ought to be obliged to invest in such instruments as provide solid savings in the long term, instead of having short-term rates on the stock exchange and global financial capitalism determine how matters will stand for pensioners in the future."
"I also believe it would have been commendable if these supplementary pension systems could have been run as pension funds on the basis of solidarity under the aegis of trade unions, as happens in certain Member States."
"Even if these too are market-based, they offer much more in terms of stability and security than the privatised pension assurances."
"It now looks as if we are to have a liberal arrangement in the pensions field in Europe, and I shall therefore advise my voters to invest their surplus funds in safer instruments than private pension assurances."
"To young people I would say: pin your hopes on education and on developing your skills."
"And to older people I would say: acquire a nice, inexpensive place to live in the autumn of your years."
"We politicians ought to be putting our faith in a good, sound system of basic pensions."
"Mr President, the European Commission' s Green Paper has caused many to reach for their pens, so much so that in the motion for a resolution, the objective of the Green Paper has been lost almost completely."
"Similarly, the intention of the rapporteur, Mr Kuckelkorn, who has carried out a vast amount of work, for which I would like to thank him, is not expressed very well in the motion for a resolution."
"It is now up to us to see that an acceptable document is produced tomorrow during the vote."
"The principal aim is for workers, when they move to another Member State, to be able to transfer their supplementary pension schemes and continue to pay into them without forfeiting their pension rights and with a guarantee that their accumulated pension rights will retain their value."
"Unfortunately, the Commission has not really made any headway towards fulfilling this wish."
"We have a long way to go before the compulsory transfer of value between Member States will be a reality."
"The first obstacle we need to negotiate is the mutual recognition of supervisory rules."
"It is then important that an adequate distinction is drawn between pension funds and commercial insurance companies."
"A pension fund has an obligation to be generally acceptable."
"A full-value pension scheme covers biometric risks."
"Insurance companies do offer their participants a choice, and their products do not cover biometric risks."
"Since the risks covered are not identical, government inspection will also vary for pension funds and insurance companies."
"On account of this supervision, complete freedom of investment is justified in both cases."
"This leads on average to higher returns."
"We need to avoid creating a situation where the individual is forced, on account of significantly lower returns on pension funds, to enter the wild investment woods in search of their supplementary pension schemes, where the big bad wolf is after their money."
"The second obstacle is the levying of taxes within the Member States."
"Taking into account the fast approaching ageing of the population, it is desirable for fiscal systems to promote the development of supplementary pensions."
"The EET model, where premium payments are tax-free and the retirement payout is taxed, meets this requirement and is also common in most Member States."
"I hope that Parliament and the Commission will make the internal market for supplementary pension schemes a reality along these lines."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I would like to express my opinion on the single market for supplementary pensions."
"Firstly, I would like to express my agreement with the model based on the intergenerational solidarity of the basic state systems, to which are added the supplementary capitalisation systems."
"On the other hand, I would also like to express my agreement with what Mr Kuckelkorn says in relation to the correlation established between pension systems which cover biometric risks."
"We are not talking about systems for financial investment but about pension plans."
"On the other hand, we are also in agreement with the participation of workers and the urgent harmonisation of the tax provisions."
"Nevertheless, we have to clarify the basic concept of pensions in a way which includes the supplementary pension schemes which cover biometric risks."
"It is necessary to clarify, on the other hand, that the single system applies to every type of worker in the European Union; there are not only workers who work for themselves in the European Union but also many cooperative workers, fortunately."
"We must opt for collective systems, but not only company systems - something which is mentioned in the report - but also sectoral ones, taking particular account of SMBs, which have been mentioned by Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel."
"We must take account of the great difficulties which exist within the Union with regard to the development of supplementary systems."
"We therefore understand and support the regulatory and supervisory systems for the protection of the rights of participants, but we must put the emphasis on the areas where systems are still underdeveloped, in aspects such as providing information or implementing new plans."
"Finally, I would like to underline our support for the creation of a European pension fund with the participation of the different economic sectors and the pension providers."
"Mr President, the ageing of the population and the reduction in the numbers of people of working age, while real enough, have been put forward by the Commission and other Members as a reason to open up the way for pension funds for supplementary pension schemes."
"The dynamic of growth and job creation has run its course."
"The capitalisation mechanisms mean adapting retirement pensions to the single market and the introduction of the euro."
"Moving in this direction entails the risk of a system based on private insurance, which would gradually replace social security."
"Welfare and retirement pensions would no longer be rights but would be commodities subject to the laws of the market."
"The set pension fund strategy essentially aims to drain savings away toward the financial markets."
"A system of this type is very dangerous and deeply unfair as it benefits the richest people, those who can save money, and leaves the poorest with a pittance of a retirement pension."
"Mr Kuckelkorn' s initial report considered the retirement pension primarily as social insurance against certain life risks, rather than a process of accumulating capital."
"It has been radically changed, however, by the adoption of amendments unreservedly supporting the mechanisms of capitalisation."
"I cannot, therefore, approve this report which makes the Commission' s approach even worse."
"On the contrary, we think that a high level of social protection must be maintained, based on solidarity, regardless of financial profitability."
"The contributory system guarantees the rights of the employed and provides them with a pension, in the framework of national solidarity between the working population and the retired population, between generations, between men and women, between the public and the private sectors."
"The objective should be to obtain new resources and to upgrading the purchasing power of retirement pensions from contributions which could be raised from taxes on financial products at the same level as those which apply to wages."
"Employers' contributions should be linked to companies' employment policies and taxes set up on those which make people redundant."
"Mr President, as medical advances contribute to a steady ageing of our populations, the burden of pension provision throughout the Union becomes ever more costly."
"In the UK, as in the US, Chile and Singapore and, to a lesser extent, the Netherlands, the burden on the state and succeeding generations has been significantly eased through the successful provision of supplementary second and third pillar private and occupational pension schemes, involving funds which grow to provide pension benefits following the retirement of the individuals."
"Both pillars have the advantage of being resistant to demographic change, and third-pillar portable schemes, in particular, which are not restricted to single companies, enhance labour mobility and choice for the investors and are much more affordable to small and medium enterprises."
"I welcome the fact that there is widespread recognition in this House to extend these supplementary schemes throughout Europe, even if there are disagreements over their precise nature and the way that the funds are to be invested."
"The problem needs to be addressed urgently in my opinion, with demographic pressures in recent years already generating deficits in the pay-as-you-go schemes in France, Germany, Italy and Spain."
"It is even predicted that if the current trend continues some countries will be facing costs of up to 20% of their GDP in the next ten years for their pension liabilities."
"There are, of course, many risks with equity investments, but there are even greater risks to Europe with stagnant economies."
"Growing pension funds will dynamise our economies by providing large additional capital funds for investment not only in the EU, but also in developing markets, with greater prospects for future growth and returns on investment for our pensioners."
"In the case of defined contribution schemes, which give the investor a direct stake in the overall health of the national economy, there will also be a sense of participation in the country of that individual."
"The state scheme will of course remain the primary mechanism for basic provision in old age."
"But personal responsibility and choice will become the watchwords of success if the demographic challenges of the coming century are to be met successfully."
"That is why we should not be too prescriptive regarding the issues of biometric risks or investment strategies."
"We need a light-touch regulatory framework, with bilateral tax agreements, which will ensure the portability for those EU nationals wishing to work abroad throughout the Union, achieve a genuine single market in financial services and provide maximum choice to the European investor."
"Mr President, this report seeks to harmonise supplementary pensions in Europe."
"In fact, it seeks nothing less than to open up all European pension schemes to the financial markets."
"Indeed, it recommends the development of a truly single pension fund market by referring to the inevitability of resorting to capitalisation."
"It should be noted, by the way, that when the financial interests of the most powerful are involved, they are not slow to forget the principle of solidarity and to propose a single model."
"This report puts forward cynical arguments and seeks to give credence to the idea that only capitalisation would ensure better protection of low incomes."
"The truth is that it is not an attempt to supplement state pension schemes, but rather to gradually empty them of all substance."
"Those who are employed know full well, however, that a pension is theirs by right."
"They fought for this right, which is based on intergenerational solidarity."
"That is why they do not, under any circumstances, want to see their pensions gambled on the stock exchange."
"In several countries, powerful social movements have already opposed similar attempts."
"Their threats have to this day prevented the French government, for example, from introducing pension funds."
"This is in perfect harmony with past, present and future struggles, and it is in support of them that we shall be voting against a report that reduces this Parliament to the level of a lobby for high finance."
"Retired people need an adequate, stable and safe pension."
"Pension funds and the stock exchange will never be able to guarantee that."
"On this issue, as on many others, a choice must be made between increasing the profits of a few or satisfying the needs of all."
"Mr President, I would like to start by paying tribute to Mr Kuckelkorn, because he has drafted a courageous report in my opinion, given Germany' s rigid and inflexible pension situation."
"He clearly wants to take steps towards developing a European internal market for supplementary pension schemes."
"I think he deserves tribute for this."
"I myself come from a country where a very extensive second pillar of supplementary pensions exists."
"Almost 90% of the professional population in the private sector are in pension schemes which guarantee a wage-related pension."
"This also includes small and medium-sized businesses."
"With a capacity of over EUR 150 billion, the pension fund of Dutch civil servants is the largest institutional investor of its kind within the international capital market."
"Pension funds in the Netherlands are daring to take increasing risks in their investments."
"In 1999, nearly half of the pension money was invested in shares, albeit under strict prudential conditions."
"But the average return over the past five years has been around 15%, instead of the usual 4%."
"It has been shown that it is precisely the compulsory nature of participation in collective pension funds which encourages these excellent results."
"The fact that funds are spread over generations and risks means that the funds can invest in shares to such a high level."
"On balance, this yields a far better return for individual members, much better than they could ever achieve on their own via a savings plan or investment fund."
"Therefore, I must open Mrs Kauppi' s eyes and disprove her reasoning that individual workers would be better off making their own choices, even if they belong to the fortunate ones who do not have any hereditary diseases, who are young and male, because, unfortunately, Mrs Kauppi, we women are even worse off under individual schemes as we live longer than men on average."
"Consequently, I would strongly discourage you from formulating a principle of free choice at European level."
"If I were you, I would leave this to the Member States and the free market."
"As for biometric risks, other speakers have already talked enough about this."
"I fully endorse Mr Kuckelkorn in this respect and would argue that such a definition is very important because we are expecting a number of additional directives from the European Commission."
"Mr President, we are voting against this report advocating self-funded pension schemes."
"This system restricts employees who want to guarantee a retirement pension for themselves that will give them enough to live on, to make their money available to investment funds, trusts, insurance companies or other private financial groups."
"At the same time, it makes the value of pensions subordinate to the financial markets, in other words, to speculation."
"What is more, all those whose salaries are too low for them to be able to pay into a pension fund will be entitled only to a very meagre pension."
"Referring to demographic changes in order to justify this is a swindle."
"Productivity has increased tenfold in the last fifty years and if company owners and shareholders had not transformed the fruits of this productivity into purely private profit, it would now enable salaries to be higher and would guarantee appropriate pensions for everyone."
"If contributory pension schemes are having problems, it is only because there are fewer employed people in proportion to the number of retired people, because there are too many unemployed and because salaries are too low."
"So, if there is a shortfall in pension funds, States should take over by deducting the necessary amounts from the profits of industrial and financial groups."
"Mr President, the ageing of the European population means that we will have huge problems when it comes to footing the bill for our statutory pension schemes."
"Member States where supplementary schemes are under-developed compared to statutory pension schemes will feel the pinch most."
"Unfortunately, we are forced to note that this is the case for the majority of Member States."
"A developed collective system of supplementary pensions, compulsory if so required by the relevant Member State, considerably reduces the dependence on demographic factors and enables the pension fund, in the role of investor, to derive maximum benefit from the possibilities which financial markets have to offer."
"Needless to say, the objective of making employees more mobile and flexible within a large single European market and the euro zone will inevitably lead to interest in supplementary pension schemes."
"One of the philosophies underlying the European Union and the Monetary Union requires that the internal market should be used to the full."
"As such, you, as a worker, should be able to take your accumulated pension rights with you to another European country."
"To this end, we need to develop a legal framework at European level at the earliest opportunity."
"Why should a German employee, for example, have to wait ten years before he has built up a pension and a Dutch person only one year?"
"As such, this German person suffers a considerable handicap with regard to mobility."
"What is more, the fiscal treatment of pensions at the time when contributions are made and at the time of payout should be brought into line."
"Commissioner, you deal with taxes, what is the latest on this score?"
"I have to say that this parliamentary discussion seems to be more about a complete harmonisation than coordination."
"This, unfortunately, is at the expense of Member States which already have their house in order."
"One such country is the Netherlands, initially presented as a role model for all other Member States and gradually relegated to curiosity status."
"But the Dutch system is a worthy system which accepts old age, surviving dependants and vulnerable groups within the labour market as they are."
"The supplementary pension scheme is based on collective feeling and solidarity."
"This enables SMBs - and specifically SMBs with reference to the UK MEPs - to cover biometric risks at relatively low cost."
"Top of the list are payability and security, which is not the case for the proposals submitted by some MEPs."
"Mr Bolkestein, how do you intend to bring the discussion back to the crux of the matter, namely mobile pensions for mobile people?"
"Mr President, firstly can I say that the EMAC report is pretty good and I hope we do not amend it too much."
"The key word is ""supplementary"" pensions."
"We are not trying to relieve poverty or provide a basic income in retirement."
"The second point is that it is important that we provide decent pensions to enable citizens to move around Europe."
"So I welcome the emphasis on removing the restrictions on the investment of pension fund portfolios and support the objective of removing barriers to labour mobility."
"The key is to keep it simple or it will not work, it will not remove the obstacles."
"As Mr Tannock has said, there are demographic pressures upon us and it is in our interest to facilitate the development of supplementary pension schemes both around Europe and also in many countries within Europe."
"On the issue of biometric risks, which we have heard a lot about, clearly a pension by definition has one biometric risk, which is longevity."
"Once you start building on top of that, you are on dangerous ground if you make it a condition of a passport."
"What we need is to have a very simple proposition, and then let the market sort the rest of it out because that is what the market is for."
"The biometric risks problem means many different things to different people."
"We must try and get a simple product which is marketable and can be moved around this market, because if we do not, we will end up with a product that does not work at all that the different Member States cannot make use of."
"So the key is to keep it simple and make it work."
"Mr President, for how long will workers be forced to sacrifice one-third of their salary to government and state pension funds, in the hope of receiving a pension in their old age, while those government and state funds are so designed that they make pensions vanish faster than Houdini himself could have done?"
"Mrs Laguiller, the people trusted the states and the governments, especially the pledges made by left-wing governments, but they have been left with peanuts."
"Every day, thousands upon thousands of elderly people reach retirement age and ask their governments, ""Where are our pensions?"""
"And the governments reply, ""You are living too long and there is no more money left to give you"" , concealing the truth."
"And what is the truth?"
"The governments have squandered the funds and made off with the workers' salaries."
"Shame on the Socialist governments for failing to provide for workers in their old age!"
"Despite the fact that there may now be a way of safeguarding this capital - the sweat of the brows of the workers - by capitalising pension funds, we are told that we must not do this, because the national governments want to get their hands on private pension funds as well."
"It is time to change the tune. We must give to Caesar what is Caesar' s and to God what is God' s."
"Mr President, we are facing a difficult issue, as evidenced by the large number of speakers."
"I would like to extend warm thanks to Mr Kuckelkorn as rapporteur, for the huge effort he has made to achieve this report."
"I am slightly less pleased with Mr Kuckelkorn' s tabling of amendments, because he has tabled a great many and they go beyond the requirements of the current objective."
"I think that we should differentiate between the two Kuckelkorns."
"I believe that the systems we should pursue in Europe should be based on two principles."
"One of them is simply the statutory pay-as-you-go system and the other is the system of capital cover which is an extension of the former, it is just that the only problem we are facing is that all countries have very different starting positions."
"It is true that a country such as the Netherlands has managed to strike a fine balance between the two."
"Other countries have managed to do this to a lesser extent."
"Also, for example, countries where nearly all pensions are capital cover systems, such as Great Britain, do not meet expectations because, although the risks for the government are reasonably small, the cover for the retired is extremely modest."
"In England, if there is a hard frost, for example, people are unable to pay their bills."
"I do not think that this is the right way forward."
"First and foremost, we need to remember that this is about people and based on this, we must develop a system which makes sound pension schemes possible, and we must, as far as we can, leave this task to the Member States."
"We should keep intervention to a minimum."
"We need to bear our starting point in mind, namely that if people move from one country to another to work or retire, it should be possible for them to take their pensions with them. The Commission has always attempted to do this and I do believe that it has succeeded in its aim."
"I think that two issues still need tackling."
"Firstly, risks tied in with the second and third pillars should be sufficiently covered, because far too little has been said about this."
"Secondly, the first pillar should at long last be defined, as the first pillar in one country is quite different from that in another country."
"And if we could bring all of this a bit closer together, we would perhaps have far fewer problems than we have at the moment."
"Mr President, may I start by extending warm thanks to both rapporteurs, Mr García-Margallo y Marfil and Mr Kuckelkorn, for the reports they have drafted and the efforts they have made."
"In fact, could I also warmly thank all other speakers this evening - nearly thirty of them - for the comments they have made and questions they have asked."
"This is an important matter, both the action plan for financial services and the pension issue, and it is heartening to see so many speakers take part in the exchange of opinions."
"As far as Mr García-Margallo y Marfil' s report is concerned, I would like to note that, according to the Commission, it is an even-handed report which strikes the right balance between an important political vision and the technical measures required in order to make progress."
"Perhaps you will allow me to make a few observations in this respect. I hope, at the same time, to comment on the amendments which have been tabled."
"The Commission welcomes the attention which the report pays to the need for capital markets to function to optimum effect."
"In this context, I would also refer to Parliament' s request for streamlined rules for stock market access, market manipulation and revision of the investment services directive."
"The opening up of financial markets should, naturally, go hand in hand with an adequate level of consumer protection, and this was also requested this evening in this debate."
"They are thus parallel processes, with liberalisation on one side and consumer protection on the other, and these are the two objectives which you will find wherever financial markets are at issue."
"These are the European Commission' s twin objectives."
"We also have a few specific proposals in this respect."
"Firstly, we would propose the provision of better information on financial products for citizens."
"Secondly, we would like to see better and clearer dispute procedures for citizens who are dissatisfied with foreign financial dealers."
"Thirdly, we would propose better harmonisation for the present national consumer protection rules."
"The fourth proposal concerns electronic commerce, or e-commerce for short."
"Policy and legislation should make provision for e-commerce without creating unnecessary barriers."
"Our citizens, on the other hand, must experience the same level of confidence and protection for transactions on-line as they do off-line."
"Finally, an adequate supervisory structure is essential to guarantee the financial solvency of our institutions."
"Does this mean that the European Central Bank in Frankfurt will be given a central supervisory role?"
"The ECB itself is of the opinion that this is not necessary."
"There is in fact an alternative, to wit, a coming together of supervisory systems."
"At this juncture, Mr President, I would like to bring up a remark made by Mrs Randzio-Plath."
"It is an important remark."
"Mrs Randzio-Plath has picked up some noises from the OECD and mentioned the word mega-risk."
"Indeed, I think she is right to indicate the risks which can be inherent in financial movements."
"She has referred to large mergers which are taking place and, without necessarily sharing her view regarding these risks, I would also like to refer to statements made by Mr Lamfalussi, who is well-known within the European financial system, and who has also indicated the need to be able to cope adequately with the financial risks and system risks which are heading our way."
"This is a very important matter. I still believe that coordination, cooperation and harmonisation of supervisory systems are enough to withstand the risks, but, once again, in the interest of the case itself, I would like to draw the attention of Mrs Randzio-Plath and other members of this meeting to a report recently drafted by Mr Brouwer, second-in-command at the Central Bank in the Netherlands."
"This report was commissioned by the Economic and Financial Committee, which, as you are aware, is the gateway to the ECOFIN Council, and the report deals with financial stability."
"The report will be made available shortly."
"No doubt you will be able to find it on the Internet."
"This report deals with the issue which is close to Mrs Randzio-Plath' s heart and once again, I would strongly recommend all members attending this meeting to read it."
"Well, most of the points I mentioned a moment ago can be found in the draft report of the rapporteur, Mr García-Margallo y Marfil, and also in many of the tabled amendments."
"In sum, I would like to say that we will undoubtedly continue to discuss the nuts and bolts but as far as the main points are concerned, I do consider Mr García-Margallo y Marfil' s report as welcome confirmation of the Commission' s vision."
"I would now like to say a few words on the way in which a number of these measures need to be implemented, the need to take a close look at our legislative ethos and the way in which legislation is established."
"Everyone is currently in agreement that we need to drop over-complicated, fossilised legislation, in other words, rules which cannot keep pace with fast market development."
"Accordingly, the process by which the European Union, i.e. the concerted efforts of Commission, Parliament and Council, lays down rules should be quicker."
"But how exactly can this be done?"
"There are quite a few different ideas and quite a few misconceptions, because if Mr García-Margallo y Marfil tells me that the European Parliament does not want to give up any of the powers it has only recently acquired, then I naturally share his view."
"I myself have been a Member of Parliament for a long time, so I fully understand where Mr García-Margallo y Marfil is coming from."
"In fact, this is not the Commission' s intention, even if it was authorised to take decisions in this respect, which is not the case."
"Nonetheless, we need to proceed faster in order to lay down the necessary rules."
"I would invite the Members of this Parliament to come up with any ideas as to how we could speed up and enhance the process."
"Should we make more use of comitology procedures?"
"Should more weight be given to agreement reached between the institutions upon first reading?"
"At any rate, the Commission intends to keep Parliament and the competent committees informed of the agendas more quickly and more effectively, so that these agendas can be better harmonised and we can speed up the drafting of the required legislation."
"In any event, I would like to keep this Parliament informed of all the developments regarding the action plan."
"Every six months, we send a progress report to the ECOFIN Council and it seems to me that these reports could be used to exchange views with Parliament on this matter."
"Mr President, most speakers have expressed their thoughts on the issue of pensions and I would like to say the following on this matter."
"In its communication on pensions, the Commission has included proposals on three fronts."
"The first area is prudential rules for pension funds, and protecting pension scheme members should take centre stage."
"There is no question that rules could be introduced which could threaten the rights of future pensioners."
"This is beyond dispute."
"However, this does not detract from the fact that investment and management rules can also serve the interests of people other than pension scheme members."
"In fact futile provisions that inhibit the results of investments, do pension scheme members no favours and must be repealed for this reason."
"Secondly, the coordination of national tax systems is a condition for cross-border participation."
"Mrs Peijs has asked me when we are getting mobile pensions for mobile people?"
"Other Members too, such as Mr von Wogau and others, have talked about the need to enhance the mobility of workers within the European Union."
"As already stated, this does not require harmonisation (a word we need to use with discretion because it conjures up incorrect associations in certain Member States) so much as coordination."
"So it requires the coordination of tax systems which differ in terms of tariffs."
"This coordination is a precondition for cross-border labour mobility."
"The Commission is in the process of drafting a proposal, a general framework, intended to facilitate the payment of contributions by occupational pension institutions which are located in other Member States."
"This general framework has also been requested, of course, in this meeting by Mr Medina Ortega, for example, while Mrs Peijs has also indicated the need to set up this general framework."
"Moreover, I would like to refer to the constant jurisprudence of the Court of Justice."
"This jurisprudence has demonstrated that the restrictions which apply to cross-border contributions and premiums are at odds with the Treaty."
"The Commission' s third objective is to remove the obstacles which migrant workers are faced with."
"More than anything, and this is also underlined in the draft report - rightly so - we should facilitate the transferability of rights from one Member State to another, and this is also very much in the interests of employee mobility, of course."
"Mr President, concerning the motion for a resolution, I would first of all like to remark that this Parliament' s support is crucially important if we want to translate these proposals into specific measures."
"It was with great interest that I read the sterling report of the rapporteur, Mr Kuckelkorn, and the competent committees, a report that so far has covered an extensive and technically complex area."
"I did not fail to notice that Parliament is backing the lines of policy proposed by the Commission."
"With regard to the motion for a resolution, I would like to make the following brief comments."
"The motion presses for the general introduction of the tax levy model that relies on the taxation of the pension payout whilst providing for tax exemption for contributions to the fund and returns on the fund. The desirability of this model was once again underlined this evening by Mr Blokland, among others."
"Mr Blokland pointed this out and I share his view on this."
"This is also echoed in the motion for a resolution."
"Agreement on this approach would solve the problems of either double taxation or no taxation, which is what citizens and Member States are struggling with at the moment."
"However, I would like to point out that this issue, as is known, only and exclusively concerns the competences of the Member States and, as such, falls outside the scope of the European Commission."
"The Commission should ensure, however, if different systems continue to coexist in future too, that this does not have any adverse effects on workers exercising their right to mobility within the Union."
"Regarding the amendments tabled, I would like to stress one point in particular, namely the scope of the future proposal - as the directive is not yet finished - for a directive regulating the activities of occupational pension funds."
"In other words, the question is, and many Members attending this evening' s meeting have spoken about this, Mrs Kauppi, in particular: should this proposal, which we are about to disclose, provide for all forms of pension schemes or should it simply be restricted to pension scheme products which cover the members against biometric risks?"
"My answer to this is as follows, I hope it is clear: we need European prudential standards for all forms of occupational pension schemes."
"These standards will differ in certain aspects according to the risks actually covered by the institutions."
"But there is not one single technical reason why these different types of savings schemes could not be combined in one and the same directive."
"It would, in my view, be incorrect - and the European Union would impose artificial restrictions on itself - if the Commission were to restrict the directive to be proposed to pension schemes which only cover biometric risks and if it were to exclude other pension provisions which, although they are full pension provisions because they cannot be collected before pensionable age, should nonetheless still be excluded from the directive, according to a number of delegates."
"I believe that this is not right."
"I think that the European Union would not do itself any favours if the subject of the directive were to be limited to biometric risks and I can honestly see no reason why other forms of pension schemes could not be included in the same directive, as I pointed out a moment ago."
"Well now, Member States are thus given every opportunity to give certain pension products preferential treatment by using tax incentive measures, for example."
"They can also demand that the products offered on their market, even if the institutions offering the service are based in another Member State, meet certain social criteria."
"Employees and employers within one company or one sector are free to choose, according to the benefits and drawbacks of the products available on their market."
"In other words, there is still a large degree of freedom for the Member States to arrange the pension systems within their own country as they see fit."
"This freedom remains."
"The Commission' s ambition is to create, I repeat, one framework which liberalises the setting up and scope of pension funds for the benefit of all the members of such pension funds."
"Accordingly, we need to set up this legal framework within the European Union which enables businesses and future pensioners to choose the products on offer within a transparent market by institutions which are adequately supervised."
"Adequate supervision is crucial, as is liberalising the scope of pension funds."
"It is not up to the Commission to specify a pension product in every detail."
"Indeed this is a matter which falls under the subsidiarity principle, and the European Commission would not wish to do anything which could compromise this principle."
"Mr President, I would like to ask the Commissioner if he could also reply to my question."
"I have been waiting for a reply for one and a half hours now."
"I would, at long last, like to have a response to my question on cash management and the solution to this problem which is particularly hitting small and medium-sized businesses."
"Mr President, I would prefer to address Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel' s issue when I respond to the report on the internal market."
"This would, however, mean that Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel would have to stay even longer at this meeting."
"This is not such a bad thing, in my opinion."
"In the final analysis, many remarks made in this meeting will also be of interest to Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, but since she has reminded me of this question, which, as I have already said, I would have addressed at a later stage, let me just say that this is of course an issue pertaining to the internal market."
"It is true that small and medium-sized businesses are facing obstacles in their cross-border activities."
"The Commission is acutely aware of this."
"Needless to say, the scope of the internal market is intended to facilitate cross-border activities for small and medium-sized businesses."
"The new strategy for the internal market comprises one hundred or so measures, many of which will be beneficial to small and medium-sized businesses."
"But if Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel would like to approach me with specific problems relating to small and medium-sized businesses which are not covered in the new strategy for the internal market, I shall make every effort to address these points to her satisfaction."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"Strategy for Europe' s Internal Market"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0098/2000) by Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council: The Strategy for Europe' s Internal Market [COM(1999) 464 - C5-0212/1999 - 1999/2167(COS)]"
"Mr President, Commissioner, the report which I have the honour to present is the result of an extraordinary collaboration - which I am grateful for - between people and committees."
"Allow me to make two observations: the Committee on Legal Affairs has not accepted all the suggestions of the committee asked for an opinion."
"We were in complete agreement with most of them and they seemed to us to be very interesting, but we consider that this resolution was not the right place for them and that, by incorporating them, its message would be less clearly expressed."
"That has been my criterion for recommending a vote in favour of the amendments presented in this House."
"I therefore insist - and the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries is a good example of this - that they have not been included in the resolution, not because I reject their content, but because the message in relation to the internal market strategy had to be clearly expressed."
"What was that message?"
"That message stems from the position adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs in our resolution of 4 November 1999."
"If you will allow me, Mr President, I will concentrate on three ideas."
"The first concern of the Committee on Legal Affairs -and I hope this House will ratify it tomorrow - is the concept of the situation of the internal market."
"What does the internal market mean to European construction?"
"These days we hear the siren song of globalisation and together with that goes the idea that we are international."
"The internal market appears to have become very small in this new globalised economy."
"Nothing could be further from the truth."
"This document on the strategy for the internal market expresses this very clearly."
"The internal market is Europe' s platform in the world."
"The internal market embodies the key principles of a globalised economy with advantages for Europe in terms of competition."
"That is the first message of the Committee on Legal Affairs."
"We need to put the emphasis on the principles of the internal market: the principle of proportionality, the principle of mutual recognition, the principle of control of origin."
"These must be the great pillars upon which this strategy for the internal market is built."
"We will not make the headlines with this, but it is important nonetheless."
"The application and control of Community legislation is also important. The Member States must cooperate in this application."
"We must oppose procedures which are used too frequently, such as 'gold plating' ."
"We need to strengthen our infringement procedure, we need to consolidate it, make it more transparent and more accessible."
"We ask that decisions on the outcome of infringement proceedings be explained and that Parliament be informed of them."
"We ask that infringement cases be processed more quickly and that they be more effectively presented to the citizen."
"The second message of this resolution is that we need to make the present, rather disorganised laws, which the citizens see as a burden, into a genuine legislation, a coherent and clear framework of rules and regulations, without any overlapping or contradictions."
"These contradictions are seen by the citizen and by industry as burdens, as a lack of clarity in the message regarding the direction we are taking."
"Lastly, the third message is a change in the business culture in Europe."
"We need businesspeople who are more willing to take risks."
"To this end we will have to change certain laws, such as for example the European laws on insolvency in general, on the suspension of payments and bankruptcy."
"We need to put the emphasis on the creation of a genuine capital risk market."
"We need to convince young Europeans, as young Americans are already convinced, that the best option is not to join a large company, on a long-term basis, but to create new companies."
"In all of this, electronic commerce, the Internet and new technologies must offer a good platform."
"Finally, Mr President, to sum up, I hope that tomorrow, on voting for the resolution, Parliament will send a clear message."
"We are behind the Commission in this initiative and of course we want to participate in the whole process, permanently, cooperating, offering ideas and monitoring the situation."
"Mr President, once again the European Parliament must express its opinion on the Commission communication on the construction of the internal market, in this case, a new version of it."
"A proportion of its content affects the competences of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"It is these points which I wish to discuss specifically."
"Firstly, I would like to say that, in general, one of the criticisms levelled at previous versions of this documents no longer applies."
"The European Parliament' s resolution of 4 November 1999 said that the document was rather unspecific, that it did not contain specific actions."
"This new version does contain specific measures and proposals."
"Let us then analyse the content of these proposals, albeit in general terms."
"With regard to taxation, the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is that the Communication is not ambitious enough, especially when compared to previous documents."
"We are aware of the stumbling blocks encountered in relation to the tax package and that some of its chapters have been blocked, but in situations such as this large doses of political courage are necessary to push proposals forward."
"We notice a lack of such political courage in this document since the chapter on tax simply reproduces previous Commission commitments, and even leaves aside some of the European Parliament' s proposals."
"Secondly, in relation to the rules on competition, the Communication opts for deepening the process of reform underway, and this deserves our support."
"Finally, in the chapter on financial services, it should be highlighted that up to now important progress has been made but, as indicated in the recent single market scoreboard, there is still a lot to be done."
"Mr President, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, it is natural that I should speak about the problems which the strategy for developing the internal market may pose from a social point of view."
"We are starting with a European social model - which is a national model - and we are transforming the economic structure of that society."
"In doing so, we are concerned that the effort to liberalise should not transform the essence of the current European social model."
"An example of this can be found in an area as apparently banal as urban transport."
"If urban transport is not subjected to political considerations and the intervention of local authorities, for example, straightforward liberalisation could make it practically impossible for us to reach our workplaces."
"We have had examples such as the case of Venezuela where a strictly private system of public transport led to a profound social and political crisis in that country."
"Liberalisation presents other difficulties."
"For example, when public services and public companies are privatised and those public companies come to be controlled by a private sector which in reality replaces the state monopoly with a private monopoly, liberalisation may not come about effectively at all."
"Liberalisation by means of privatising public companies may end up consolidating dominant positions and private monopolies which in my opinion may offer fewer benefits than a monopoly conceived in the public interest."
"Another aspect - which we referred to in the recent debate on the Kuckelkorn report - is the need to coordinate social protection."
"Social protection in a single internal market cannot simply be left to subsidiarity."
"Lastly, cohesion also seems to me to be important."
"If there is no economic and social cohesion, if we do not balance the quality of life in the different regions of the Community, we may find ourselves in a situation where the European Union is an unfair European Union in which some regions will make more progress and others will be left behind."
"This is the basis of the amendments which Mrs Berger and I are presenting, representing the views of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"- (ES) Mr President, Commissioner, firstly I would thank the rapporteur for explicitly mentioning the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries, although we regret that it has not been included in the report."
"I say this especially, Commissioner, so that you can communicate to the Commission, and particularly to Mr Fischler, the fact that the common fisheries policy is one of the few areas of Community activity where until now very few steps have been taken in the creation of a genuine internal market."
"The lack of action is related to the original conception of this policy."
"The current Council Regulation No 3760/92 establishing a Community system for fisheries and aquaculture, provides for derogations in respect of the internal market, notably in Articles 6 and 7, which allow derogations from the principle of freedom of access to fishing grounds, so that Member States have the right of exclusive exploitation of their fisheries resources within a 12-mile coastal band, as well as a series of preferential fishing rights, through application of the 'relative stability' principle, which distributes national fishing quotas."
"At the same time it lays down restrictions on exercising fishing activities in certain areas known as 'boxes' ."
"These restrictions on the principle of freedom of action, which were originally intended to be temporary restrictions, have been extended and will be in force until 1 January 2003 as a mechanism to allow certain Member States' fishing industries to adapt to the rules of free competition in an increasingly open and globalised market."
"Over 20 years have passed and, as we are about to embark upon a general review of all aspects of the common fisheries policy which, for compelling legal reasons, must take place in 2002, it is now time, I believe, to examine whether the transitional period for adaptation to free competition provided for in the said regulation should be ended."
"In my opinion, the fishing industry and the common fisheries policy should also be subject to derogations in respect of the internal market."
"Therefore, the principles and fundamental freedoms enshrined in the Treaties should also be applied to fisheries, in other words, the framework of the common fisheries policy should be brought into line with the general legal framework of Community legislation."
"Mr President, on behalf of our Group I should like to warmly welcome Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi' s excellent report."
"As she said in her introduction, she has made the very wise decision to focus on what are the most critical issues for the creation of the single market."
"I want to focus on a couple of the principal points that she makes."
"The first one is the need to address, within the Union, the impact of legislation on business."
"It is particularly important that we ask the Commission to reinforce its activities, to ensure proper compliance cost assessment and to assess the costs on businesses of the new legislation."
"I say to the Commissioner that we do not expect this to be done as an after-thought, after all the departments in the Commission have developed legislation."
"It needs to be an integral part of the policy and regulation process."
"He must make sure that from now on that a central objective is to help the internal market to move forward."
"We were delighted to see a second point on the agenda at Lisbon."
"Our committee and, indeed, our Group has been emphasising, since this new Parliament started last year, the need to encourage the development of small- and medium-sized enterprises across the European Union."
"Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi' s report emphasises a number of key points such as the need to make business formation cheaper and quicker and the need to remove some of the barriers preventing entrepreneurs from benefiting from the risks of putting capital into starting up new businesses."
"I am disappointed to see that our Socialist colleagues are proposing that clause should be taken out of this resolution."
"I can assure them that we will vigorously oppose that tomorrow."
"I invite colleagues to reject that proposal."
"I conclude by confirming that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market will continue to press vigorously for the speedy completion of the internal market."
"I give credit to all our colleagues, across all political groups, for the speed with which we have dealt with the electronic commerce directive this week."
"I hope that is appreciated."
"I hope it will demonstrate that we are prepared to work with speed."
"I hope that, together, we can really make the internal market work as quickly as possible."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I feel nothing but appreciation for Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi' s clear draft report."
"It concisely outlines and highlights the key points from the Commission' s communication on the strategy to be followed for Europe' s internal market."
"I would like to highlight some of these points."
"The promised dialogue between the Commission on the one hand and business and citizens on the other is to be welcomed because the relationship between the Commission, the European Parliament and society should, after all, be interactive."
"In order to keep pace with the present breakneck speed at which technology is developing, it is not only desirable but essential to keep the dialogue going."
"So far, the average citizen has had insufficient insight into what drives the Union and what can be gained from European cooperation."
"This is why information campaigns are essential. After all, Europe cannot afford to remain a remote spectacle."
"Back to basics should be our motto."
"The e-Europe initiative praises the use and expertise of Internet and multimedia."
"This is very commendable indeed but, rather than just creating a frame, it is more important to give substance to education."
"I would like to repeat the words of the French President spoken at the official opening of this Parliament building and I quote: ""We must create a citizens' Europe in which each individual gradually comes to see that he or she has a role to play."
"We have a duty to build this great common house in which each individual nevertheless feels at home. A house in which everyone lives together, in a spirit of solidarity, but in which each individual retains his or her identity"" ."
"In order to meet these objectives, the residents need to get to know and get a feel for their house, or rather their home."
"In order to build a genuine internal market, we should, more than anything, concentrate on promoting the interests of small and medium-sized businesses."
"To this day, there are still too many obstacles."
"Companies' competitiveness and dynamism depend directly on a regulating climate which is conducive to investment, innovation and entrepreneurship."
"Finally, I can only echo the need for SLIM."
"Legislation must become simpler and must be written in a clear language."
"Superfluous legislation should be withdrawn."
"It would therefore be beneficial to draw up a scoreboard of laws which have been abolished."
"Mr President, I would like to speak on a point of order."
"During the debate, Mr Harbour referred to an amendment tabled on behalf of Mrs Berger and myself - Amendment No 2, paragraph 22(2)."
"If I am not mistaken, Mr Harbour said that he was opposed to our amendment."
"I believe that there has been a little confusion."
"In the Spanish version which I have there is no problem."
"The amendment is based on the German text, which causes some concern because it refers to the issue of share options."
"I imagine that in the English text which Mr Harbour has there is no problem either."
"The Spanish text simply says ""remove the barriers imposed on entrepreneurs capitalising on company value through the issue of share options on the stock exchange"" ."
"If this is the correct text, there is really no problem, in which case I would withdraw that amendment and simply ask for the German version to be adapted to what is said in the Spanish text."
"Mr President, many thanks for giving me the floor regarding an issue which is very dear to the Commission as a whole and myself, in particular, namely the new strategy for the internal market."
"To begin with, I would like to extend my warm thanks to Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi for the ardent support she has shown for the set of measures proposed by the Commission."
"The Commission feels confirmed in its intention thanks to this important vote of confidence coming from this Parliament."
"Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi has mentioned three topics."
"First of all, she stressed the importance of the internal market as a forum in the world, which is essential for the competitiveness of European industry and the European service industry, and she is absolutely right, of course."
"This is, in fact, echoed in Mrs Berger' s remarks, who stated that the internal market is not an old hat one can simply take off, the internal market is and will remain essential to European competitiveness as a forum in the world."
"Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi' s second remark highlights a number of inconsistencies."
"According to her, sometimes one does not know where one stands."
"This would be a serious shortcoming if it were true to this extent."
"Needless to say, the Commission attempts to establish internal consistency between rules, but it is, of course, possible for rules to be in conflict with one another in certain areas."
"If this were the case, then the Commission would be more than happy to rectify this situation."
"I would like to thank Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi and the other Members for their comments regarding specific inconsistencies between rules. This will enable the Commission to do something about this."
"Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi' s third remark concerns the change in culture."
"This is an important yet very difficult topic, which predominantly refers to the availability of risk capital, as Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi has also pointed out."
"There happen to be bankers in the risk capital industry who believe that Europe has the money but lacks the entrepreneurs."
"In other words, according to these bankers I spoke to recently, the bottleneck is not so much due to the availability of capital as to the availability of entrepreneurs. This is tied in with the economic culture."
"I happen to disagree with these critics."
"Responsibility lies with both camps."
"The bottleneck is the result of both the availability of risk capital, especially the cost of risk capital, but we are also, of course, lacking the sufficient entrepreneurship."
"This is down to Europe' s economic culture which still instils in us the belief that bankruptcy will stay with a young entrepreneur for a long time, while in the United States, as everyone knows, bankruptcy is taken far more lightly."
"I hence agree with Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi that something needs to be done to breathe new life into Europe' s entrepreneurial culture."
"Moreover, I suspect that in the light of developments, which are termed the ""new economy"" , an increasing number of, mainly, young people, young entrepreneurs, will be encouraged to start up a business."
"After having expressed my thanks once again to the rapporteur, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, I would now like to move on to remarks made by Mr Berenguer Fuster."
"According to him, the Commission should have more political courage, especially in the fiscal domain."
"My response to Mr Berenguer Fuster is: should the Commission have yet more political courage?"
"What the Commission is trying to bring about is already so hard to achieve."
"That does not just pertain to the topic that was under discussion earlier this evening, namely the coordination of taxes and tax legislation regarding pension contributions."
"It also concerns the taxation package formulated by my predecessor, Mr Monti."
"Moreover, during the discussion of the previous topic, Mr Lipietz remarked that he, and probably his group too, is not prepared to further liberalise the provision of financial services if the package, also known as the Monti package, is not adopted."
"I would like to oppose such reasoning which has no foundations in the real world."
"It would be an example of cutting off your nose to spite your face, if Parliament or the Commission were to say that they refuse to make further attempts to integrate the financial services if no progress were made in terms of the taxation package."
"This would not be the right attitude, in my opinion."
"Although Mr Berenguer Fuster has not said this in so many words of course, I would still like to take the opportunity to stress this point."
"I ask Mr Berenguer Fuster if he would like the Commission to have yet more political courage?"
"We are already struggling to achieve what we have proposed."
"I would like to see the Commission achieve what it has proposed to do first and then take it from there."
"Mr Berenguer Fuster has also said that a great deal still needs to be done in the field of financial services."
"And he is right, of course."
"Mr Berenguer Fuster is undoubtedly familiar with the action plan for financial services which was adopted on 13 May 1999 and which includes 43 objectives."
"We are in the process of achieving these, at least we are in the process of achieving those objectives that need to be achieved this year."
"I am hoping, on behalf of the Commission, to make certain proposals regarding pensions, for example - we discussed this topic a moment ago - but also regarding the opening up of markets for postal services, regarding the public provision of goods and services, public tendering etc., before the summer recess."
"We are truly active in the field which is dear to Mr Berenguer Fuster."
"I would now like to comment on a remark made by Mr Medina Ortega."
"He said that at present, there is a risk of state monopolies being replaced by private monopolies."
"I would like to assure Mr Medina Ortega that this is, of course, by no means the intention."
"Replacing a state monopoly by a private monopoly only makes matters worse."
"This is certainly not the intention of this Commission."
"What the Commission does intend to do, however, is to add substance to the decisions taken by the European Council at Lisbon, namely to free up the markets for gas, electricity, transport and postal services a lot faster."
"The Commission is trying to flesh this out and this also means that those state monopolies need to allow for more competition in the fields I mentioned a moment ago."
"But, I repeat, the prospect of replacing state monopolies by private monopolies is something which we do not exactly relish."
"I would then like to come back to the remarks made by Mr Harbour, who, like Mr Beysen and Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, was absolutely right to highlight the importance of small and medium-sized businesses and the costs related to running these businesses."
"The Commission is aware that, for example, the costs involved in establishing a business or a small business over here far outstrip the costs in the United States."
"To give you an idea of the cost difference, it takes an average of five days to set up a small or medium-sized business in the United States."
"In Europe it takes far longer, even as long as five months, a ratio of 1 in 30."
"This is, of course, directly reflected in the cost."
"If we then talk about culture, and I am addressing Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi once again, we need to try to do something about these establishment costs of small businesses very quickly, because otherwise we will naturally come off second-best in the competitive battle with North America."
"Finally, I would like to turn to Mrs Berger as I have already responded to Mr Beysen' s remarks concerning small and medium-sized businesses."
"I have quoted what Mrs Berger said earlier about the hat which you cannot simply take off."
"I like this metaphor because it is true that European citizens have the feeling that this internal market is already in place. They take it for granted and do not give it any further thought."
"This could not be further from the truth."
"The internal market is far from complete."
"We must - and the Commission does, in fact - work on it week in week out and defend it, because the internal market is subject to constant pressure, and the Member States fall back into old, protectionist habits which we need to fight."
"Mrs Berger was right to refer to directives which remain in the Council."
"We are all familiar with examples of directives which remain in a vacuum for five, ten or even fifteen years because they are not adopted by the Council."
"Let us hope that this will change."
"If you will allow me to highlight one aspect of it: we all hope, of course, that the difference of opinion which is keeping Spain and the United Kingdom divided over a well-known rock in the Southern half of this continent, will now be resolved."
"I read in an article in a Spanish newspaper that the issue is moving in the right direction. This would actually unblock half a dozen directives."
"We are all waiting for this moment."
"To sum up, on the subject of Echelon, I can assure Mrs Berger that this is completely unrelated to the internal market and does not form any threat to it whatsoever."
"Mr President, this concludes my remarks."
"Could I once again express my appreciation to the Members of Parliament and the rapporteur, in particular, for the important vote of confidence which we received from Parliament regarding the new strategy for the internal market?"
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"2001: European Year of Languages"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0099/2000) by Mr Graça Moura, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council decision: European Year of Languages 2001 [COM(1999) 485 - C5-0278/1999 - 1999/0208(COD)]"
"Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Graça Moura for a splendid piece of work and for the energy he has put into drawing up this report. I should also like to thank the Council for being so accommodating and the Commission for the role it has played as mediator, especially just recently."
"The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is very happy to support initiatives which may create greater awareness of the value of linguistic diversity in the European Union."
"It is important that the EU' s citizens should be encouraged to learn foreign languages early on in school and also throughout their lives."
"A knowledge of languages is important, for European languages are of great significance to European culture and civilisation, and people need good language skills in order to be able to find employment in EU countries other than their own."
"The programme for the European Year of Languages offers a splendid basis for providing information about the many different opportunities there are for learning foreign languages, and it is important."
"Mr Graça Moura' s proposal includes the 11 official EU languages, together with a number of other languages recognised by the Member States, including Irish and Luxembourgish."
"The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party also thinks that the programme should include other languages which are actually used in the various Member States, for instance Catalan in Spain and Frisian in the Netherlands."
"Finally, in the programme for the European Year of Languages, consideration is also given to the forthcoming enlargement of the Union, something which we in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party consider to be crucial to all EU programmes."
"On behalf of the Group, I can recommend supporting this programme."
"Mr President, needless to say, I too would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent and exquisite work."
"I would like to make a few minor observations regarding a European campaign which intends to teach Europeans languages from other communities."
"We are all convinced of the usefulness of this exercise, of course."
"But the thing that often goes wrong with European campaigns - and fortunately I have not been around long enough as a politician to be unaware how the ordinary citizen reacts to this - is that, very often, they are nothing but an attractive front, pretty to look at but insubstantial."
"I would therefore like to think that this campaign will offer something different, and that, more importantly, consideration will be given to why it is so hard for people in Europe to learn languages, and at what stages in their lives they are able to learn languages."
"I come from a bilingual country myself and I have met some people in that country who never learn the other language, despite the fact that they attend language classes, sometimes for twelve years, and are still unable to speak another language."
"This is a terrible observation to have to make."
"I therefore hope that in the course of this year of European languages, research will be carried out into the best language teaching methods and, more than anything, how Europeans can be encouraged to learn the language of the other Europeans using a modern and appealing method."
"Mr President, after I too have congratulated the rapporteur, Mr Graça Moura, who has done such a good job that it won the unanimous support of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, I would like to focus my attention on just one point, namely that in addition to the human, cultural and political advantages, the need to learn more than one language is also of considerable economic benefit."
"The report also highlights the findings of all the experts: having a good command of one' s mother tongue and learning classical languages, especially Latin and classical Greek, makes it easier to learn other languages."
"I would also add our own mother tongue to the equation."
"This great truth emerges from a fact rather unknown to most, that in the English language, for example, there are at least 75 000 words of Greek origin."
"I repeat, 75 000 English words derive from classical Greek."
"There are a similar number of words in the French language that derive from Greek, and the same is true of most other modern European languages."
"It is also certain that Latin is just as important for most European languages."
"The English sage, Francis Bacon, said that knowledge is power, so knowledge of the basic languages from which our modern European languages derive improves our general knowledge and reinforces European civilisation, which, besides its humanitarian value, is also a weapon for our survival and prosperity as Europeans in a globalised economy."
"Besides, the contemporary German professors, August and Werner-Karl Heisenberg, have characterised both classical and modern Greek as the mother and nurturer of human civilisation."
"I believe that revival of the teaching of Latin and classical Greek in middle education will also provide a cultural shield for the younger generations against the onslaught of the generally levelling effect of the American cultural message, so that only its positive elements are preserved."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur."
"The European Year of Languages is important and worthwhile."
"All the languages of Europe are equally valuable and worthy of respect in terms of culture."
"It could be said that the people who speak the same language share the same mentality."
"The mother tongue is not merely a tool of communication, it is in fact more than anything else, it is thought itself."
"Language is the most peaceful way of communicating."
"Independence is language and language is independence."
"The Kurds are a nation with no land or borders of their own, kept together only by language."
"Language is a powerful force."
"It is the most important bond for a nation."
"Large countries, and many smaller ones too, often tyrannise others through language."
"It is a means of occupation."
"The legislation regarding language in my country is among the most liberal in the world."
"We have seen how two different foreign languages have twice been proclaimed the official language; only at the beginning of last century did our language, Finnish, become the official one."
"That is why we have guaranteed the important status of minority languages."
"The multilingual nature of the European Union is thus a source of wealth."
"At the same time it is also the right of each citizen in each Member State."
"The multilingual nature of Europe must be preserved after enlargement too; there are no obstacles to this."
"It is wrong to think that a multilingual environment is costly and ineffective."
"Translation is not costly; it is the most effective practical instrument of peace."
"Mr President, in addition to congratulating the rapporteur, I would like to highlight in this debate that the idea for this celebration originates from the Council of Europe, an institution with a particular sensitivity towards the cultural and social aspects of the old continent, which, with its initiative of increasing the knowledge and use of more languages by Europeans, hopes to promote understanding and tolerance and bring citizens closer together."
"When we speak of European languages, let us not forget that this does not only mean the official languages of the Member States."
"In Europe, many other languages are spoken, some of them thousands of years old such as Euskera in the Basque Country or Gaelic, whose origins have been lost in the mists of time, and others such as Catalan, Galician and Alsatian, which is spoken right here in Strasbourg."
"This initiative should also benefit all these other regional and minority languages, and the bodies created by the Member States to organise participation in the European Year of Languages must also include representatives of these other languages, which are also European, and which are the essence and lifeblood of the wealth of our unity in diversity."
"Furthermore, the learning of languages leads to an awareness of our cultural diversity and contributes to the eradication of xenophobia, racism and intolerance, which forms part of our Community objectives."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the Commission and, at the same time, the rapporteur, Mr Graça Moura, for having permitted so many amendments, many of them open to broadening the scope of the Year and extending it to rural areas and the least favoured areas."
"However, I would also like to express certain concerns with regard to the economic restrictions."
"I would recommend that many projects be allowed since it is clear that cultural projects attract a lot of investment from Autonomous Regions and private initiatives which we cannot afford to lose."
"I would also ask, in this era when emotions often take precedence over good sense, that we do not support projects which are aimed at exclusion and the use of language to support positions which often seek to cause divisions between people, when the objective of this programme is to unite people."
"I would also like to see the European Union begin to take great care of languages which have no country, maternal languages which often have no school and no teachers; languages which are spoken throughout Europe, which no state accepts and which will never become official."
"I am referring, for example, to Ladino and Yiddish."
"These languages furthermore do not have any media of their own."
"Of the 150 languages which are spoken in Europe, we should make a list of those which are only transmitted from mothers to their children, which are only spoken in a domestic setting and which, currently, with the invasion of the media and with the official use of languages in schools, will have very few years to live."
"I would like this European Year of Languages to be opened up to them as well and that a space be made for them so that they may be considered in any other future programmes which may take place."
"Mr President, I should like to address my remarks on languages to my fellow Members, of course, but also to our interpreters, who enable this Parliament to function, to the rapporteur, of course, not for his work as rapporteur but because he is also a poet in this Parliament and, moreover, as I have discovered, one who speaks my mother tongue perfectly."
"What better rapporteur could there be?"
"When one is a new Member of the European Parliament, as I am, one finds oneself dealing with all sorts of things: chocolate, end-of-life vehicles, the qualified majority, dried beans, Spanish lentils, anything and everything."
"Then, suddenly, one finds that one is going to have to deal with something that gives Europe its historic and cultural depth, namely its languages."
"And when one looks back at the great periods in history, and I am thinking here of the Renaissance, that great age of trade and commerce, what remains of that era today are the cultural achievements, the artefacts of our heritage, and thus will it ever be."
"In terms of languages, Europe has known times when a single language predominated: Latin, and also French."
"Now it tends to be English."
"So what are we to tell our fellow citizens for this year 2001."
"Let me just briefly mention a few points."
"Firstly, that European unity may not mean linguistic unity."
"Next, that every language is deserving of respect and deserves to be promoted and defended."
"This is applicable to any amount of things: monuments, objects, you name it."
"Why should it not be the case for mankind' s best and most lasting achievement, i.e. his method of communicating with his neighbour?"
"And then, all languages are learnt within the family first of all."
"This is why we call them ""mother tongues"" , and no State, whatever it may be, may have the direct, indirect, explicit or implicit goal of destroying one of its mother tongues, or of allowing it to disappear."
"Furthermore, finally, without linguistic diversity, there is no Europe, because this is also one of the few, and perhaps the only, parliament in the world which operates in eleven languages, to the extent that occasionally we speak in this House for the purpose of being interpreted and not to be heard in the original."
"It is up to us to construct this dialectic of European unity and its linguistic diversity."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"Youth"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0100/2000) by Mrs Gröner, on behalf of the Parliament Delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council decision establishing the Community action programme for youth [C5-0116/2000 - 1998/0197(COD)]"
"Mr President, I am very pleased to add my support and my group' s support to this report."
"This report had a long gestation period."
"But the fact that we are still here so early in the morning is a tribute to the rapporteur' s work on this programme and, indeed, that of the Commissioner and the Portuguese presidency - which has shown itself to be committed to youth, to the voluntary service and to education in its broadest sense."
"The report we have ended up with now is more closely targeted, with an emphasis on social protection and, as the rapporteur has said, a more flexible approach than in earlier reports."
"We also have more money in the programme in recognition of its importance."
"We will always ask for more money."
"The budget is not enough."
"It is perhaps Parliament' s role to ask for more."
"But we can be pleased with the outcome."
"We can be sure that whatever money we have in this programme will be directed at youth and will, in the long-term, be money well spent."
"I agree with the rapporteur that this money and this programme will ensure that the efforts are targeted not just at some small sections of society but, as the Commissioner said in a previous report, at all sections of society."
"We must look to those who will benefit most and those who are in greatest need and who might otherwise be socially excluded."
"We are delighted that some candidate countries of Central and Eastern Europe will benefit as well."
"We can be pleased with our efforts and pleased with this report."
"In seven years' time we will look back at the youth of today who will have benefited from this report and be pleased that this was the beginning of real progress."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs Gröner for her splendid work and for the personal, almost passionate commitment she has shown in preparing the present report."
"I should also like to thank the Council and the Commission for contributing to our at long last achieving a good result."
"The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is very happy to support those initiatives which give young people in Europe opportunities to acquire knowledge, skills and qualifications which will help form the basis of their future development."
"The strength of the programme is, of course, that, by means of cross-national exchanges, it encourages young people to contribute actively to further European integration."
"It will also lead to understanding of the cultural and linguistic diversity within the European Union."
"I also think that the programme will ensure that the fundamental values upon which the European Union is founded will continue to be propagated."
"Through increased communication between young people in Europe, the programme will indirectly help combat xenophobia and increase respect for human rights."
"Finally, the Community' s action programme for youth also gives consideration to the forthcoming enlargement of the Union, something which we in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party believe to be of crucial importance to all EU programmes."
"I would recommend that we support this programme."
"Mr President, I also commend the report and thank Mrs Gröner for the excellent effort she has made."
"It is a very good report."
"Youth is the sector in our Community that is so often ignored."
"Indeed in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport it is the ""Cinderella"" sector of funding, as with sport."
"We hope that imbalance will be redressed."
"The insufficient commitment to youth affairs from the Council, when the European Parliament was calling for EUR 980 million, shows, in my view, this grave disparity and the lack of commitment on the part of the Council to a very important sector."
"The danger, in this regard, with the changes that are proposed, of combining two programmes - Youth for Europe and the European Voluntary Service - is that several good parts of both those programmes might be lost."
"I hope that does not happen."
"We should include the best parts of those excellent initiatives in whatever programme we formulate in future."
"The new Youth Programme emphasises the developing links with the youth of entrant countries."
"That is an excellent initiative."
"The bridges built between youth will be the bridges that eventually unite Europe."
"The agreement to constantly review the situation is an initiative that I welcome."
"When more funds are needed, budgets should not be cast in stone but be flexible so that they can be amended in the best interests of the deserving needs of youth."
"What more deserving cause could there be than supporting youth in the European Union."
"Mr President, I would like to join all those who have congratulated the rapporteur, Mrs Gröner, who has produced an excellent report, full of commitment, on behalf of young people."
"In her task she has enjoyed the very strong support of the members of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport. I offer them my thanks for their work."
"The Youth programme is crucial to the European Union, as you have all already said, because it is a unique programme, in which all young people, without distinction, can participate."
"I would like to reassure all Members who have spoken about possible sanctions."
"In the Youth programme and in the way it is implemented, there will be no sanctions against anyone, and that includes young Austrians, who will not be discriminated against."
"The programme has ambitious objectives, which are essential to the development of the idea of European citizenship."
"This programme will encourage and consolidate the continuation and development of innovative actions at Community level and will help to improve the quality of the action undertaken on behalf of young people."
"It therefore represents a useful instrument in assisting a policy of cooperation and will contribute to the process of European integration."
"In addition to ensuring that the programme is effectively implemented, I wish to make a commitment before this House that I will encourage a process of structured and regular cooperation with Member States, in order to work towards drawing up action plans that are up to the task of the challenges, and without which the programme would be less effective."
"Mr President, I wish to take this opportunity to talk about the youth policy of the future."
"In fact, I stood before you for the first time last September."
"I spoke of the White Paper on the European Union' s youth policy, which is a priority."
"I would now like to clarify the role of this White Paper and the role of political catalyst that youth policy must play in the future."
"I hope to prepare the White Paper on the basis of broad consultation with the different parties concerned and when I say the parties involved I mean above all young people."
"That is why, at the Youth Council on 23 November last year, I proposed to the Member States' Ministers for Youth that they hold national meetings of young people during the first half of 2000."
"This proposal was very warmly received by all the Member States and these meetings are being organised at the moment."
"Most Member States have already set dates for them and most of them have also assured me that these meetings will be open, with the participation of all possible parties including, of course, Members of the European Parliament."
"These meetings must allow young people to play an active role and to assert their aspirations, their expectations and their opinions, but also their recommendations for political action in the areas that affect them."
"The various national meetings will culminate in a huge European meeting which will be held at the beginning of October, under the French Presidency."
"At the same time as consulting young people, the Commission hopes to consult those responsible for youth policy at national level."
"The Commission hopes that these national authorities will be able to incorporate into their contributions the opinions and expectations of local administrations, which play a considerable role, I believe, in youth policy."
"In order to achieve this, the Commission will be holding bilateral meetings with Member States, followed by a discussion seminar with youth leaders."
"We will also rely on the various studies on young people, which will be financed under the Youth programme, and the study, already underway, on the status of young people and the situation of youth policy in Europe."
"Lastly, I would like to include the European Parliament in this exercise."
"The cooperation methods still have to be worked out, but I can assure you as of now that you will be invited to take part in the European meeting of young people and that I will keep you informed on a regular basis on progress in this matter."
"To conclude, I would like to emphasise the fact that the consultation process, particularly with regard to young people, will not be a one-off exercise, because the publication of the White Paper will constitute the second stage of this dialogue with the parties involved, and this is a dialogue that I would like to see established on a more permanent basis."
"Ladies and gentlemen, there is a considerable amount of work to be done, but it is exciting."
"As many of you have pointed out, we are not working for politics here, but for the future of our Union, and I hope that the debate launched by the publication of the White Paper will enable us to strengthen our capacity for joint action in order to implement a genuine strategy for developing the talents of these 80 million young citizens in the European Union, towards whom we have a great responsibility."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"Before the sitting is closed, I would like to thank the interpreters for their generous cooperation this evening, since we have exceeded the time allotted."
"(The sitting was closed at 12.45 a.m.)"
"Principles for recording taxes and social contributions"
"The next item is the report (A5-0073/2000) by Mr Knörr Borràs, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation clarifying Council Regulation (EC) No 2223/96 as concerns principles for recording taxes and social contributions (COM(1999) 488 - C5­0220/1999 - 1999/0200(COD))."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are discussing here today a subject of an extremely technical nature, of the type which, at first sight, appears to refer purely to issues involving the adoption and transposal of procedures and terminology within the European Union, which is the political framework to which they are to be adapted, as is the case with certain instruments in the statistical field."
"We are all aware, or at least I think we are, that it is important that statistical data is not only reliable, that is, obtained scientifically and rigorously, but also, above all, comparable."
"This is particularly true with regard to the shaping of the European single market, a context in which we require statistical data which is comparable and equivalent between the different Member States."
"I would even go so far as to say that this is even truer, if that is possible, in view of the enlargement of the European Union, a process in which the availability and comparability of information, particularly statistical and economic information, must be treated as absolutely crucial."
"I do not intend to dwell on the qualities of ESA 95 - the European System of Integrated Economic Accounts - nor on the progress which it represented in relation to the previous 1979 system, an issue which I spoke about in the House at the time of my report on the proposed Council Regulation amending the Regulation on the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure."
"What should really be underlined is that, in my view, we must firmly support a Commission proposal which, essentially with regard to an issue as serious as the budgets of the Member States, is inclined to give priority to the revenue actually collected rather than criteria such as the amounts due in the field of taxes and social contributions."
"It is common knowledge, or should be common knowledge, that there are occasions when administrations may record, as due, amounts which they will never collect, however many analyses of collectability are made, and this therefore leads to what is tantamount to a concealed falsification of the public deficit."
"This is a serious issue which has been debated."
"We should remember that in the Parliament of a Member State there was also a great argument between one of the candidates for the presidency and his opponent, and current President, in which the candidate, Mr Borrell, rightly condemned widespread use of the criterion of income which, since it had not been duly corrected, in reality amounted to a concealment of the deficit in the public accounts."
"Ending this type of practice requires clear principles, as the Commission proposes, which in addition allow, very correctly in my judgement, for the calculation of income with the option of using amounts collected or the amounts recorded in a tax document."
"This course of action by the Commission, which some people attack because in short they believe it does not once and for all end the practices of concealing deficit, in no way intends to distort the assessment of the amounts in the national accounts but, on the contrary, to arrive at the same figure in two different ways."
"One, in my view the more correct way, or at least the more academic way, is the criterion of income, with the corresponding provision concerning collectability, set out in paragraph (a) of Article 3 proposed by the Commission, and the other, set out in paragraph (b) of Article 3, is the criterion of cash receipts adjusted to take account of the time difference between the activity and the cash tax receipt at the end of the financial year."
"Both calculation procedures should inevitably lead us to the same figure, which will be the outcome of the tax in that financial year."
"I would also add that there is no other accounting method which would correctly record revenue in a budget."
"On the other hand, it is obvious that the option to use either of the two methods offers the advantage of a speedier adaptation on the part of those who choose one or other of the systems."
"Therefore, I consider that the Commission proposal regarding the treatment of taxes and social contributions in the accounts is both the most correct one and, from every point of view, is effective in view of the possibility that it can be applied immediately."
"Nevertheless, we believe that, in order to encourage Member States to gather statistical data, even aggregated data, concerning taxes on products, Article 3 of the Commission proposal should deal with this issue by establishing a similar mechanism for recording and adjusting such taxation."
"I therefore take a favourable view of the proposal and I congratulate the Commission."
"I would like to repeat that the proposal rightly stresses that we should give priority to the revenue actually collected rather than the taxes and social contributions due in the Member States, and allows these two methods of calculation, which make it possible for the systems used by the Member States to be adapted."
"A study of the Commission proposal shows that the treatment of taxes and social contributions should indeed follow the two proposed methods."
"Finally, I would also like to stress that, consistent with our opinion that the Commission proposal is more an amendment than a clarification and that, moreover, it affects basic concepts, instead of using the procedures under Article 2(2) of Council Regulation 2236/96 of 25 June 1996, for the adoption of changes to the methodology intended to clarify and improve the content of ESA 95, use should instead be made of the introduction procedure set out in Annex A of that regulation."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to ask you, and also the Commission, for your help."
"I would be grateful if you could please keep strictly to your speaking time, as our timetable is very tight."
"Although Commissioners can, of course, talk for as long as they wish, I would ask them to help me in this regard as well, so that we can finish on time."
"Mr President, a Europe that is functioning properly needs transparent and comparable statistical material on its Member States, not least with regard to recording taxes and social contributions."
"We have rightly reached agreements in this respect in the European system of national and regional accounts, ESA 95."
"On closer examination, it now appears that the information recorded on taxes and social contributions is not as precise as was hoped because it does not always correspond to the amounts actually collected or collectable for a particular assessment year."
"The aim of the proposal under discussion is to refine the recording procedure by applying a correction factor both to cash data and data evidenced by assessments and assessment registers."
"The PPE-DE Group agrees with the Commission proposal in this regard."
"Two questions still remain, however."
"In view of the fact that the proposal effectively contains an amendment to the ESA 95 Regulation and that is implicitly acknowledged by the fact that we are applying the codecision procedure, it does seem logical to grant the Member States a transitional period."
"The Member States also need time to adjust to new rules."
"We have therefore tabled an amendment on behalf of the PPE-DE Group and would ask our colleagues in the House and the Commission as well to support this amendment."
"A second question to the Commission concerns the amendments by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs regarding VAT as a basis for calculating the third source of own resources."
"I should have liked to hear the Commissioner confirm whether the Commission is indeed drawing up a proposal to amend Article 8 of the ESA 95 Regulation to the effect that all the Member States will, in the future, have an adequate legal basis to use ESA 95 for the calculation of the third source of own resources, that is to say, VAT."
"I should like a reply from the Commissioner and also, of course, a response from the Commissioner to our amendment."
"Mr President, firstly I wish to thank Mrs Thyssen for her gesture and for her defence of the amendment we are presenting."
"I also wish to thank and highlight the patriotism of Mr Berenguer and Mr Knörr."
"This patriotism is consistent because ESA 95 was adopted by the Socialist government, to whose party the former belongs."
"Having said this and leaving aside accusations which are truly libellous at the moment, I would like to defend the idea of an extended transition period of two years."
"Anybody who knows anything about accounting and who looks at this text with open eyes will know that this implies a profound change in the basic concepts and the data on the resources of the institutional sectors which affect financial companies, non-financial sectors, public administrations and private individuals."
"This change is a complicated change."
"As any expert knows, the estimations in accordance with ESA 95 require breakdowns which affect no less than 60 accounting categories."
"Secondly, this profound and complex change must be done in a gradual way."
"As Mrs Thyssen has pointed out, changing and adapting the accounting rules requires a certain amount of time."
"At the end of the day this would lead to a fair change because a sudden change would prejudice those States which have adopted the criterion of income, in other words, those which have, to a greater extent, complied with the regulation which entered into force in 1999."
"We are being asked to change a regulation which entered into force a few months ago."
"The PPE-DE' s amendment asks for the change to be introduced gradually."
"Mr President, I think we would all agree that, if we are to run the Community properly, we need a high-quality statistical base within the Community and the applicant countries."
"There has been a broad welcome in the House for this proposal and the apparent ability to give priority to the revenue actually collected rather than the more notional contributions which may be due."
"This is certainly a step forward."
"It seems logical to use the revenue collected as the basis for determining the actual percentage deficit."
"So far as the transition period is concerned, many of us will have sympathy with the need for some form of transition because, clearly, if you amend the regulations in such a way that you move from a system which is being used over a long period of time to a completely new system some time will be required."
"However, I hope that the countries of the Union will not use this as an excuse, if it is passed, but seek to implement the new system as rapidly as they can - in other words, two years should be regarded as an exception and as a maximum rather than as the normal ration for the job."
"On the treatment of taxes and social contributions, I agree with the rapporteur that this is a relevant way of doing the calculations and that we should take a favourable view of the criteria which the Commission intends to set because of the way in which priority is given."
"Overall, this is a useful step forward."
"I welcome the commitment of the Commission."
"I hope that we can work together and see this translated into Community law with suitable adjustments as soon as possible."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m."
"COM in bananas"
"The next item is the report by Mr Dary (A5-0093/2000), on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the Proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EEC) No 404/93 on the common organisation of the market in bananas (COM(1999) 582 - C5­0277/1999 - 1999/0235(CNS))."
", rapporteur."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if the Commission' s proposed reform of the COM in bananas, seeking to replace the current system by 'tariff only' , were implemented as it stands, it would lead to the disappearance of ACP producers in the short term and Community producers in the medium term."
"At the Seattle Summit and then at the Davos Summit, the people of Europe have been able to observe the inability of the WTO to reconcile financial priorities with their own priorities, which are living conditions, working conditions and the quality of the goods they consume."
"They would not appreciate it if their representatives not only called those values into question today, but actually went further and reneged, in passing, on the Union' s commitment to its ACP partners."
"The banana issue is a perfect example of the difficulties the Union is experiencing in establishing the European model the institutions evoke so often."
"In that connection the 1993 COM complied with four essential objectives: ensuring the free movement of bananas in the single market while maintaining reasonable prices for consumers, respecting the Union' s commitment to the ACP countries, maintaining Community preference for Union producers like Martinique, Guadeloupe, the Canaries, Madeira and Crete and, finally, respecting GATT obligations."
"Under constant attack since its adoption, this regulation eventually led to several WTO rulings against us, the latest in April 1999."
"Always quick on the draw, the United States immediately drew up retaliatory trade measures against Union countries."
"To comply with the WTO, the Commission is proposing to go over to a 'tariff only' formula, that is, eliminating quotas and introducing a flat rate tariff at an unknown level."
"As we know, this system has already been attacked by the majority of operators and producers from all geographic areas."
"We are right to question the grounds for an approach which involves changing the rules of the game in midstream, forcing producers to rethink their production plans and marketing forecasts. That has led us to identify reforms complying with the rules of international trade, but not just dictated by it."
"The stakes are high."
"Since 1993, the position of the Community producers has been constantly deteriorating."
"The same applies to many ACP countries, traditional suppliers."
"It is impossible for these producers to maintain fair competition with the great producers and operators in the international network."
"We should also remember that over 60% of the bananas consumed in the Union come from non-ACP third countries."
"It is not a question of practising protectionism, but rather of protecting the permanence of a certain method of production."
"It is not just the banana we are trying to defend, but a whole production network, which entire regions often depend on to survive."
"The margin of manoeuvre is technically narrow, but the choice of a reform model is political."
"We need to know what our objectives are."
"As I see it, the first priority is to defend the European model at the international level."
"That is certainly the position the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development unanimously adopted."
"Here I would like to thank all my colleagues very warmly for their effective cooperation on this issue, and Mr Westendorp and Mr Fernández Martín for their excellent work too."
"As there are no objective reasons for choosing 'tariff only' , I propose to retain the first option in the Commission' s proposal, the 'transitional' option, and implement it without moving on to 'tariff only' , but with a review of the operation of this reformed COM at the end of a ten year period."
"The ACP/European Union Partnership Agreement for Development, which replaces the Lomé Convention, provides for a ten-year transition period for the ACP countries, to allow them to conform as closely as they can to WTO rules."
"Why should it be any different for bananas?"
"I also propose ensuring that the level of quotas will not increase the oversupply already noted, and finally, aware that the third quota will henceforth be open to all, I propose increasing the minimum preferential access rate for ACP products to EUR 300."
"In any case, accompanying measures are essential to ensure the permanence and viability of Community and ACP production."
"I have some suggestions: regionalisation of aid, so as to correct the discrepancies observed between the various areas of Community production, establishment of a cyclone compensation measure, a marketing aid to re-establish the balance with the distribution network for dollar bananas, special support measures for organic production and finally, an acceleration of aid provision."
"I hope Parliament will follow the line proposed by the Committee on Agriculture, but we also need the understanding of the Council and the Commission."
"Of course, this is not a codecision procedure and the Commission, naturally, can reject all our amendments. At a time when a code of good conduct is being set up between Parliament and the Commission, is it judicious to fail to take account of our opinion, and is it reasonable for either the Commission or the Council to neglect the opinion of the people we represent?"
"Ladies and gentlemen, as we now have a new report before us and a new team here in the Chamber, I must repeat what I said at the beginning."
"I would like to ask for your help in making sure that we finish by 11.30 a.m., as that is when voting time begins, and we cannot overrun."
"So I would be grateful if honourable Members could please keep to their speaking time, and I would also ask the Commission to help out here, although they can of course talk for as long as they wish. That way we can finish on time."
", draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy."
"(ES) Mr President, I will be very brief. I simply want to say that, when the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy received Mr Dary' s report, after a detailed examination of the problems facing the banana industry, we came to the conclusion in our committee that the solution proposed by Mr Dary met the absolutely fundamental conditions for its success."
"Firstly, with regard to the international obligations of the European Union, not only towards the ACP countries, but also within the World Trade Organisation."
"As you know, the European Union has been condemned for its regime of granting licences for this product, but has maintained the viability of the quota regime proposed by Mr Dary."
"In fact, in the Commission' s current negotiations, it appears that the main suppliers would prefer this system."
"On the other hand, this is the system which best defends the principle of multifunctionality of agriculture, protects the European Union producers, also protects the developing countries, with whom we have a very special relationship, is sensitive to the protection of fundamental social regulations and the protection of the environment and, lastly, it is the system which best obeys the principle of consumer protection."
"For all these reasons, my committee voted in favour of Mr Dary' s draft report."
"Mr President, we all want to see the end of the 'banana war' , but the immense complexity of the problem deceives no one."
"Clearly the banana has become a political issue, with the dispute symbolising a certain conception of world trade, of a Europe which stands by and defends its decisions, its specific political nature and its commitment to the countries of the South."
"So on this issue - I know - the Commission' s task is not an easy one."
"It is torn between contradictory positions and I understand the difficulties encountered in trying to reconcile the various interests."
"But while I share the desire to put an end to a trade war which is poisoning transatlantic relations, this cannot be done at any price, abandoning without compensation the principles of justice and solidarity which guide the action of the European Union."
"I, for one - and there are many in this Parliament who feel the same - refuse to see Europe dictated to, even indirectly, by a handful of multinationals with colonialist attitudes and anachronistic social behaviour."
"I am sorry, too, that we have not fought for the retention of a specific quota for the ACP countries which alone guaranteed them access to the market."
"But the rapporteur' s proposal is satisfactory because it defends the quota system and rejects any automatic move to an exclusively tariff-based regime."
"So I thank him and I also thank Mr Fernández Martín for putting the committee' s point of view."
"Of course, the ACP countries know they must adapt to world trade."
"But let us give them time."
"Let us give them enough time, let us give them the means to produce their plants themselves, let us help them build their greenhouses."
"Let us encourage organic farming and, in ten years, believe me, the price of African bananas will have fallen to the level of dollar bananas."
"They will then become competitive."
"If we impose the brutality of an exclusively tariff-based regime too rapidly, bananas are going to taste incredibly bitter to thousands of small African producers."
"Mr President, the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on whose behalf I speak, broadly supports the report by Mr Dary and, in general, rejects the Commission' s proposal."
"The European Commission has made this proposal supposedly in a spirit of consensus but, frankly, having analysed it at length with the best will in the world, I cannot find a single reason to accept it."
"I take comfort in the fact that I am not the only one."
"The Commission' s proposal has not been well received by anyone, neither by the Community producers, nor by the ACP countries."
"It seems that the Council cannot easily accept it."
"Parliament does not like it either."
"What is even more serious however is that not even the United States like it."
"In this proposal, the Commission not only renounces the defence of Community interests and the interests of the ACP countries but has also, in my opinion, abandoned the minimum degree of neutrality required."
"The World Trade Organisation condemned the system of licences in force, which must undoubtedly be modified."
"However, the Commission proposes many other things."
"It proposes removing any type of quota, and I would like to ask: does it intend in the future to remove the system of aid to producers?"
"Has the Commission decided to begin the reform of the common agricultural policy with a reform of the COM in bananas?"
"After bananas, will other sectors fall?"
"When will we stop protecting Austrian white wines, for example,?"
"This clearly remains an open question within the WTO."
"However, after the experience of Seattle, I suppose that we should have learnt something from the point of view expressed by the developing countries and, especially, in this case, by the ACP countries, with whom we have commitments and obligations to fulfil."
"It is in defence of our obligations and commitments to the ACP countries that the amendments have been presented on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking for our 'shadow' rapporteur, Mr Vatanen, and I would like to mention that this is now the fifth time since 1993 and the introduction of the common organisation of the market in bananas that the WTO has considered the Community rules to run counter to international trade regulations."
"The banana controversy is a good example of how hard it is to reconcile the interests of the fifteen Member States, the Union, the ACP banana producing countries, European consumers and our trading partners."
"I congratulate the Commission for striving to reach a compromise that has regard to the various interest groups."
"It is right that the European Union should bear responsibility for seeing that European agricultural producers, including banana producers, earn a sufficient income."
"It is not right, however, that the EU and businesses operating within its territory should suffer annual losses of around EUR 400 million because of trade sanctions by the USA and Ecuador, which are a result of our violating the GATT agreement with regard to banana imports."
"I would like to express my concern regarding the consequences of Mr Dary' s report for trade policy."
"To adopt the report as it is could result in a strong reaction from our trading partners, as it does not even include the possibility of talks to ease access to the market."
"There is strong evidence that some Latin American countries will refuse to accept import quotas - at least not without the prospect of better access to EU markets."
"For this reason, I would appeal to you to support Mr Chichester' s Amendment No 38, which states that if the EU does not abolish import quotas it will at least indicate its intention to start official WTO talks on the future distribution of import quotas."
"The Union has lost the banana dispute in the WTO four times already and it cannot afford to lose a fifth time, for three reasons. Firstly, the continuation, despite the bans by the WTO, of the EU' s import quota system, which has been found to be discriminatory will lead to the continuance of trade sanctions costing hundreds of millions of euros."
"Secondly, if our trading partners receive permission from the WTO to even disregard intellectual property rights, the costs of sanctions will be enormous and could cause long-term damage to EU businesses."
"Thirdly, continued breaches of the regulations will hurt our image internationally in matters of trade, which might weaken the case for the European agricultural subsidy model."
"This, meanwhile, would have very serious consequences for the whole of European agriculture."
"It is high time we showed ourselves to be credible and mature trading partners, as waking up to the realities of the present will accord with our real interests in the long term."
"Mr President, the WTO has challenged our Community regulation on bananas several times and each time we have had to redefine the content of this COM and suffer the burden of the fines imposed on us as reparations for damage caused."
"It is certainly not easy to find a balanced response which would satisfy our four objectives, which are: supplying consumers at reasonable prices, guaranteeing a future to our Community producers, honouring the Union' s commitments to ACP countries and, finally, at the same time, presenting a case which cannot be attacked by the WTO."
"However, in the light of these four concerns, Mr Dary' s proposal is entirely apt, at least that was the feeling of Parliament' s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in unanimously supporting it, a quite exceptional occurrence for such a sensitive subject."
"In fact it seems to us that the choice of maintaining the import quotas plus preferential tariffs for the ACP countries for ten years, instead of six, would make it possible to plan for the future of Community and ACP producers, who face a form of competition tantamount to social and environmental dumping."
"That we are seeking elimination of any automatic movement to 'tariff only' should not be regarded as downright rejection of the measure."
"Our intention is to let the situation develop in a way that is economically and socially tolerable for our producers and those of the ACP countries, without damaging the openness of our market."
"So the European Union certainly has arguments to present to the WTO, so that this time our approach is recognised as valid."
"Of course, the Union may have difficulty determining the quotas in the immediate future, but is that exercise any more difficult than agreeing on adjustments to the customs tariff in the 'tariff only' hypothesis?"
"For my part I am convinced that the approaching start of the next WTO cycle should mean we can handle this issue positively in a more global context and for that I am counting on the Commission' s determination."
"Mr President, it is high time that we resolved this complex and long-standing issue once and for all."
"As we all know, there are many competing claims - the claims of ACP banana producers, Community banana producers, EU businesses which have been hit hard by US sanctions, the EU's role and standing in the WTO and, of course, the rights and interests of European banana consumers."
"It will not be possible to satisfy fully all these claims and therefore we have to accept a compromise."
"The Commission's proposal is a compromise between those who demand an immediate move to a tariff only system and those who wish to ignore the WTO rulings and stick with the flawed regime as it is."
"That is why the majority of the ELDR Group supports the Commission's proposal to continue a tariff-rate quota system for a transitional period before moving to a definitive tariff only system."
"The Dary report, on the other hand, is premised on the somewhat unrealistic notion that we can ignore rulings from the WTO altogether."
"It gives complete priority to the concerns of EU banana producers over the equally legitimate concerns of innocent EU businesses in other sectors suffering from arbitrary US sanctions."
"Most strange of all, it risks complicating matters so much further that the Commission, as stated in its proposal of November last year, will be obliged to move directly to a tariff only system."
"This would be exactly the opposite of the objectives of those who support this report."
"I have also heard that during the vote, which will take place either today or tomorrow, some may advocate referral back to committee."
"This would be an undignified act of foot-dragging which would do nothing to address the long-term issues at stake."
"We need stability for European and ACP banana producers and EU consumers."
"That can be done by rejecting this report and supporting the Commission's compromise proposal."
"Mr President, the common organisation of markets in the banana sector has allowed this sector, which is fundamental to the sometimes fragile economies of the ACP countries and the outermost regions of the European Union, to function."
"Less than seven years have passed since the entry into force of the COM on bananas, and the Commission is now proposing a profound modification of its operation."
"Furthermore, this has been preceded by disputes within the World Trade Organisation which have generated uncertainties and which have led to difficulties in its correct functioning for Community producers."
"For us, a transitional period until 2006, as proposed by the Commission, is not acceptable, and we should wait at least until 2010 before deciding on possible reforms."
"On the other hand, an exclusively tariff-based system is not coherent with the achievement of the objectives of the COM, given that it does not guarantee access to the market or the survival of the Community and ACP producers."
"The Commission proposes a quota of 353 000 tonnes and a possible increase in the event of a rise in demand."
"Given that the additional tariff quota is not consolidated, its quantity should be capable of being adapted to Community demand, not only in the event of an increase, but also in the event of a decrease."
"In any event, we should safeguard the Community preference and prevent any marginalisation of Community production."
"Lastly, special attention should be given to the development of the situation of the Community and ACP producers, who are already in a vulnerable position and will be even more so in a context of intense and open competition."
"The Commission must carry out a report in advance assessing the consequences of the application of any modification of the system in order to provide the due compensation for its negative effects on prices and incomes as a result of the increase in the global income in question."
"I would therefore, Mr President, like to offer my heartfelt congratulations to Mr Dary."
"We support his report."
"He has been generous with the amendments of the different political groups."
"Furthermore, I hope that the Commission will send a clear political signal which will take account of his points of view."
"Mr President, the reason we are having to express our opinion on a draft for the banana COM yet again, for the fifth time since 1993, is the relentless attacks on the Community regime by three large American multinationals. They dominate the world market in bananas and the WTO backed their interests after an appeal was lodged by the United States, which is also imposing very heavy unilateral sanctions on a series of our companies."
"But, in fact, almost 60% of the 4 million tonnes of bananas consumed annually in the European Union are supplied not by Community or ACP producers, but by Latin American third countries where the American companies run vast plantations under production conditions characterised by scant regard for social and environmental concerns."
"In traditional ACP countries and Union countries, which already have only a minority share of the European market, bananas are grown in small production units, usually family concerns, and in areas where there is no real possibility of alternative occupation."
"So they represent an essential element in the balance of the economic and social fabric of these fragile territories."
"After having driven the Ivory Coast to despair to allow five multinationals to lower their production costs to the detriment of cocoa producers, are we now going to grant three American multinationals the exclusive right to the world market for bananas, including the European market, ruining our own producers and those of our ACP partners into the bargain?"
"Are we willing to sacrifice production which means life or death to some of our territories for peace at the WTO?"
"Unfortunately, that certainly seems to be the route the Commission has chosen, with a short and dangerous transitional system and an exclusively tariff - and uncertain - formula as from 2006, which would imperil both ACP and European production and put the Community banana market under the control of a few large operators, able to set the profit margins through the commercialisation of dollar bananas."
"So the Commission' s proposal is in line with neither the interests of Community and ACP producers, nor the long-term interests of European consumers, because it actually encourages the emergence of a far from competitive market situation."
"That is why it has been unanimously rejected not only by our Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, but also by the ACP-EU Joint Assembly and the French Parliament."
"So I hope our Parliament will follow the Committee on Agriculture, and the European Commission will feel obliged to make new proposals to us, more in accordance with European interests and our cooperation with the ACP countries."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, seven out of every ten bananas eaten in Europe come from Central America via three multinationals, all with reduced customs duties of EUR 75 per tonne instead of EUR 850."
"We are giving the United States a marvellous present there!"
"Well, it is not enough!"
"The United States wants more."
"Technically, what does it want?"
"It wants the end of import licences, because the B licences give Community bananas and ACP bananas priority sales over dollar bananas."
"But, most of all and politically, the United States actually wants the monopoly of the future Eastern European market for their multinationals."
"What is Europe doing to face that challenge?"
"It is divided and getting bogged down."
"We are divided from our German friends."
"Indeed, because of the ancient links with the 1945 German diaspora to Latin America, Germany has eaten 100% dollar bananas since 1960 - though at first they were 'armband' bananas. So much so - it is an open secret - that the three American banana multinationals put their banana butter on SPD and CDU parsnips."
"But we are also getting bogged down in technical proposals."
"Thus the Commission proposes, before surrendering totally to the United States, a six-year transition period when, in essence, there would be three quotas, including the ACP quota and the dollar quota."
"From 2006, there would no longer be anything but a common customs tariff which would have equal impact on the bananas of the poor of Africa and the bananas of the rich, the multinationals."
"We could undoubtedly challenge that, and our excellent rapporteur, Mr Dary, does challenge it."
"He proposes that the respite of six years be extended to ten years."
"Another four years, Mr American executioner!"
"And we have tabled amendments too."
"We call for regionalisation of aid, because Guadeloupe is further away than the Canaries; quarterly payment; cyclone compensation; the maintenance of the ACP quota; historical guidelines for imports, instead of first come, first served."
"Well, all that is very fine, but the battle is elsewhere."
"The battle is for Community preference, first and foremost."
"We have to choose: either the Canaries, Madeira and the Antilles - or Chiquita."
"It is regional policy that is at stake."
"Do we want the outermost regions which depend 100% on bananas, like the Canaries, to survive, or do we want Dole and Chiquita to accumulate more wealth?"
"It is cooperation policy that is at stake."
"We have to choose: either Africa and the Lomé Convention, or the WTO."
"We have to choose: either Europe' s social policy and human rights, or the multinational slave-drivers who produce with social costs totalling 8% instead of the 42% social costs in the Canaries, Madeira or the Antilles."
"This is about protection of financial interests, because when OLAF disputes a few centimes of Members' taxi expenses yet is not interested in the annual present of two billion dollars from Chiquita, there is a problem."
"The United States was found guilty of two billion dollars' worth of fiscal fraud and it has changed nothing."
"When the United States alters its policy, we will discuss the mere 191 million for bananas."
"When the United States stops cheating for the benefit of Boeing, Kodak, Cargil and Ford, we will discuss bananas."
"In the meantime, we need long, global, political negotiations."
"We must talk about Iraq, Echelon, Serbia; put everything on the table."
"Sanction for sanction, retaliation for retaliation."
"The banana is a moment of truth."
"Europe can either surrender or stand up and be counted."
"There is a saying that bananas can be eaten from both ends."
"Does Europe want to stand up or be eaten from both ends?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we must put an end to the tug of war over a system that complies with the WTO Agreement."
"The EU has not exactly covered itself in glory in this almost endless debate."
"I respect the Member States' efforts to protect their banana producers against a considerable loss of income, but such considerations cannot justify persistently refusing to comply with agreements under international law."
"It should be our objective to create a market organisation consistent with the WTO dispute settlement body' s proposals as soon as possible, chiefly in the interests of companies which, because of the introduction of the COM in bananas, have been forced to accept financial losses which have threatened their very existence. This is also in the interests of those who have been hit by the punitive tariffs imposed by the United States."
"No one should underestimate the adverse impact of export restrictions of this kind on the economies of export-oriented countries, and above all on related jobs."
"This is an area where some Member States are indulging in protectionism at the expense of others."
"We pay subsidies to banana producers, we have to grapple with punitive tariffs, and we have to pay excessive banana prices in our supermarkets."
"Those Member States who want to continue with these restrictions have to recognise that they are partly to blame for the current situation, because they have quite simply forgotten to make structural changes in the field of banana production."
"The lack of competitiveness of EU banana production cannot be allowed to justify a refusal to accept uniform and non-discriminatory access to the European market."
"Mr President, Commissioner, it falls to me to summarise the problems of the COM in bananas in just a few minutes."
"That is a considerable challenge and one which makes no sense unless we understand what is really at stake in this issue. It has been a source of conflict for at least a decade, both at the trading level - between the operators - and at the institutional and international level."
"The reason for that is simple."
"The banana is now one of the great basic human foodstuffs and control of the trade clearly has a geostrategic dimension."
"This is a tropical fruit marketed in the Northern hemisphere and its distribution is also a fundamental part of North-South cooperation."
"The real question we face is whether or not the European Union can succeed in organising, within its own market, a juxtaposition of flows from the producer regions of Europe, the ACP countries and Latin America."
"Today we are debating a proposal from the European Commission which, by providing for an automatic swing towards tariffs, will lead to the ineluctable disappearance of production in European regions, which currently represents 25% of our market supply."
"Such a development would be contrary to the actual purpose of regional policy and the common agricultural policy - the two pillars of the European Union - and we do not want that under any circumstances."
"So we must resolutely set the prospect to one side by adopting the Dary report. I congratulate and thank Mr Dary."
"For those fundamental reasons, and to protect the interests of consumers on the European market by maintaining a juxtaposition of flows from the Union, the ACP countries and third countries, in the context of genuine and sustained competition based on an adequate number of operators, we ask you to accept all the proposed amendments."
"Failure on this sensitive banana issue would be an admission of weakness on the part of the European Union and would represent a very strong and rousing signal, exploited by all opponents of the common agricultural policy to oppose the social, family and multi-functional agricultural model."
"It is our duty to preserve everything the Union stands for, especially on the eve of its enlargement."
"Mr President, the defenders of the interests of the multinationals in this Parliament have not studied the subject of bananas properly."
"They have not studied it properly because they talk about the multiple decisions of the World Trade Organisation and Community violations of international law."
"In fact, so far the World Trade Organisation has only declared two extremes incompatible with international commercial law."
"The first is the partnership system which linked the importing of non-Community bananas with that of Community bananas."
"Community regulations on bananas were modified to comply with that decision."
"The second refers to the incompatibility of the exemption in favour of ACP countries within the Community system."
"In other respects, the Community system is wholly in accordance with community rules, international law and the rules of the World Trade Organisation."
"The problem is that in this case the Commission has been more papist than the Pope and, as Mr Fernández Martín has pointed out, more in favour of free trade than the multinationals themselves."
"In other words, at the moment the Commission wants to throw out the banana with everything else - it wants to throw out the baby with the bath water. It does not remain within the strict limits of compliance with our international obligations, but it is taking a political decision which would lead - as Mr Fernández Martín pointed out - to the dismantling of the whole of our Community agricultural policy."
"The Dary report, the Westendorp opinion and the Fernández Martín opinion ask the Commission to adapt so as to conform to international law, not to go beyond what it is laid down by the World Trade Organisation, to negotiate and, furthermore, to take account of the fact that, if we give in on this point, we are going to give in on other more important points, such as the maintenance of social and environmental policy requirements on a global level, which is how we stand internationally."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the European Commission' s proposal on the reform of the banana sector is negative, unacceptable and disastrous for the agricultural sector in the outermost regions and the ACP countries affected by it, which, of course, supply 40% of the Community market."
"I have put this so strongly because, if implemented in the terms which have been laid out, it would lead to the sinking of the economies of thousands of families who live off this very special activity on Community islands such as the Canaries, Madeira, Guadeloupe, Martinique and Crete, not forgetting the producing areas of the ACP countries."
"It would therefore lead to social and economic deterioration in regions which are already least favoured and suffering serious and permanent difficulties with their development, with horrendous difficulties in terms of conversion and which are vulnerable to the uniform and homogenous commercial measures which are taken at international level. In my opinion, the European Commission has given in to such measures, incapable of recognising the regional agricultural reality and diversity of the countries of the Union and the need for a genuine policy of solidarity and cooperation with the ACP countries which, until recently, were colonial territories of countries which now form part of the Union."
"Therefore, it is a good thing that the Commission is receptive to the report by Mr Dary, who I congratulate, and the amendments tabled, which are intended to achieve the following: correct the imbalances created by globalisation and persuade the Commission to be sensitive to the problems of banana-producing families, not to submit to imports with single customs tariffs and to fight where necessary to maintain, for a reasonable period, its commitment to the citizens and the agricultural organisations involved."
"For many of us, bananas are a national issue, since they are related to our history and our culture."
"Mr President, it is important for this House to approve Mr Dary' s report, as the Commission proposal to introduce a tariff only system for banana imports by 2006 is unacceptable."
"The flat-rate system that the Commission intends to introduce would cause producers in the outermost regions of the European Union, such as Madeira and the ACP countries, to go bankrupt."
"Furthermore, the fiasco at the last World Trade Organisation meeting demonstrated that the WTO is in no position to meet the expectations and demands of the public and of consumers in certain respects, such as product quality, environmental protection, training, social conditions and worker protection, as is evident from the report."
"If our policies are to be consistent with our declarations of support for the ACP countries and for the development of the outermost regions of the European Union, we cannot allow agriculture in those regions and its future development - in which the production and export of bananas play a major part - to be squeezed by waves of dollar bananas from the large plantations that banana multinationals own in Latin America."
"It is against this background that we are supporting most of the amendments in the report, which we also contributed to. I have in mind in particular the call for a transitional period of not less than 10 years, and which should not imply a move to a tariff only system, as the Commission should assess the impact of the new situation on prices and on the income of banana producers in these regions, so as to ensure that compensatory aid can be adjusted, based on the principle of guaranteed income for producers."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the long run, we cannot swim against the tide of free and fair world trade with the common organisation of the market in bananas."
"We ourselves also have to observe the rules that we signed up to when the WTO was founded."
"By infringing them and thus triggering sanctions, we are already blocking access to the major US markets - and also increasingly to Latin America' s markets - for whole sectors of our economy."
"We will be jointly responsible for large numbers of lay-offs in these sectors if we as the European Union do not change our stance."
"That is why we - and I am now speaking on behalf of a significant minority in the PPE Group, which could be a majority the next time - support the Commission' s position."
"Following a transitional period, a tariff of EUR 275 per tonne is to be introduced for bananas from third countries, from which bananas from ACP countries would be exempt."
"This will protect the essential interests of the ACP producer countries."
"However, the Achilles' heel of the Commission' s proposals is the lack of sufficient protection for the interests of banana producers within the European Union, essentially in the peripheral regions and the overseas departments."
"They are up in arms about this omission - particularly our French colleagues, and I assume the same applies to Portugal and Spain."
"Commissioner Fischler, things are not as the officials in your directorate-general perhaps claim - and I would also like to address this comment to Mr Lamy."
"The arrangements for EU banana producers are not as good as they might be."
"There is still a need for a political compromise here."
"The structural measures envisaged in Title III of the Regulation on the common organisation of the market in bananas need to be considerably strengthened."
"If we made just 10-20% of the total punitive tariffs of EUR 400 million, that is to say EUR 40-80 million, available as agriculture budget appropriations, instead of diverting it for other purposes, we could help our banana producers a great deal."
"I call on the Commission to improve the structural measures and so open up the way for a compromise which is fundamentally in accordance with your proposals."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first I would like to present my compliments to the rapporteur, Mr Dary, because he has chosen the path of resistance and not renunciation on this complex issue."
"Indeed, we find the Commission' s new proposal unacceptable, because it makes unacceptable concessions to the multinationals of Latin America."
"Is there anyone in this Parliament unaware of the role played by these multinationals in financing American campaigns?"
"Is anyone here unaware that the food safety conditions involved in the production of these bananas are dubious to say the least, and the social conditions are dominated by total disregard for the rights of men, women and children?"
"Who can ignore that by bending to the diktat of the United States - under cover of the WTO - the European Union would throw 35 000 of its own nationals in the Canaries and over 30 000 in the French overseas territories out of work?"
"Because, ladies and gentlemen, adopting a 'tariff only' system after a transitional period of six years, as the Commission proposes, would truly condemn our producers to failure and despair."
"That is why, like Mr Dary, I urge the maintenance of quotas and I oppose automatic passage to the tariff system, because, for my part, I refuse to sacrifice our producers in Martinique or Guadeloupe on the altar of a liberalisation beyond all regulation."
"Ladies and gentlemen, let us make no mistake, if Europe surrenders on the banana issue today, it will surrender on sugar or rum tomorrow, and the next day it will have to abandon its social model and its development policy."
"That is why I want to tell Commissioners Fischler and Lamy, in all seriousness, that, while I understand their legitimate desire to put an end to this dispute, they cannot do it at the expense of the poorest citizens in the European Union."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the banana regime of the European Union has already been condemned four times by the World Trade Organisation."
"After the United States, Ecuador has also now obtained permission to take retaliatory action for an amount of USD 200 million."
"Let us not forget that such punitive measures serve absolutely no purpose at all for our banana producers, but have extremely negative effects on European industry and employment."
"Therefore, we cannot afford to be condemned like this again."
"We must now come to an arrangement as quickly as possible that complies with the rulings of the WTO, with the promises made to the ACP countries and which is in the interests of our producers and consumers."
"That is not easy, but the present system is untenable."
"We must, therefore, urgently find and accept a compromise and a more liberal attitude."
"In view of the fact that the Commission proposal, in my modest opinion, meets these requirements, I shall support it."
"Commissioner, I too remember the European Union introducing a regulation in 1993 on the organisation of the market in bananas, so as to ensure protection of outlets and income for Community producers and to guarantee the exports of the ACP countries to the Community market."
"Although they do not produce a single kilo of bananas, the United States has complained to the WTO about the Community banana import regime."
"Their one aim was to defend the interests of their great banana companies which are effectively ravaging Latin America and which already dominate over 70% of the world market."
"In 1999, the WTO panel, orchestrated by the United States, condemned the Community' s import licences system."
"The Commission has submitted to that verdict by amending the market conditions to end up with a 'tariff only' system in 2006."
"The implementation of this new regulation, which actually goes beyond the WTO ruling, would call into question the distribution of Community and ACP products and would aggravate an already fragile social situation, especially in the French Overseas Territories where the selling price of bananas had already fallen below 3 francs in 1998 and was less than 2 francs in 1999."
"I am glad the Committee on Agriculture has rejected not only the amendments championed by the intermediaries of the American multinationals, but also the Commission' s proposals."
"I entirely approve of the Dary report which opposes the automatic move to a 'tariff only' system and which defends the principles which presided over the establishment of the common organisation of markets, especially Community preference."
"By adopting the Dary report, we will be sending the Council and the Commission the clear signal that our Parliament is determined to defend the interests of Community and ACP producers, to make the WTO recognise that the preferential agreements constitute development aid instruments."
"Our vote will also express our rejection of any compromise with the United States that would sacrifice the Community and ACP producers to the profit of the dollar banana."
"Mr President, I would like to start by putting some questions to the Commission in the person of Commissioner Fischler."
"Why is it that for the banana trade you are advocating pure and simple liberalisation with effect from 2006, whereas in the case of meat, milk and cereals, which absorb 68% of EAGGF Guarantee Section resources, you refer to the special characteristics of European agriculture, as the Commission did in Seattle?"
"Surely it is unacceptable to be applying two different sets of criteria."
"Is the Commission not guilty of double standards here?"
"Are bananas the poor relation of agricultural production in the European Union?"
"Should the European agricultural model not be used to safeguard banana production in the European Union which will certainly be threatened by the liberalisation being proposed?"
"Is there also a plan to liberalise trade in meat, milk and cereals?"
"Will the Commission yield to the more radical approach adopted by the United States at a time when the Americans are significantly increasing their support for agriculture?"
"Is no attention being paid at all to the fact that bananas are the main agricultural product in four outermost regions which are amongst the 10 most disadvantaged regions in the European Union?"
"What is the relevance of Article 299(2) of the Treaty, which provides for special treatment for the outermost regions, to the proposal to amend the Regulation on the COM in bananas?"
"The multi-functionality of European agriculture, which is a key aspect of the European agricultural model I have already mentioned, needs to be reflected in this reform, since in Madeira, for example (the region that I represent in this House) the environmental aspect of agriculture is as important as, or even more important than, its economic aspect."
"If banana production were to cease on the island of Madeira, it would represent an enormous environmental catastrophe as well as a serious loss of income for thousands of families."
"Furthermore, as we saw in Seattle, the new round of WTO negotiations should be a genuine development round."
"For this reason, we can justify giving priority to bananas produced in the European Union and in the ACP countries when we reform the common organisation of the market in bananas and this would be perfectly legitimate."
"And it is only by maintaining import quotas that we can achieve this objective, which is perfectly compatible with World Trade Organisation rules."
"Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, banana production has a special significance in certain less developed countries, signatories to the ACP agreements, island regions such as Crete, and, in particular, outermost regions such as Madeira, the Canary Islands, Martinique and Guadeloupe."
"We are not talking about fully developed regions in the centre of Europe which have countless alternatives when faced with changes in market conditions, and where the common agricultural policy invests most of its resources."
"For this reason it is not possible for us to accept radical changes in the Community' s trade policy in this field unless we take full account of its regional impact and unless we take the necessary measures in this field in terms of economic and social cohesion."
"The Lisbon European Council instructed the Commission to present as quickly as possible practical measures aimed at implementing the Commission' s report on the application of Article 299(2) in relation to the outermost regions."
"Agriculture is absolutely vital to many of these regions, which are hoping that the Commission will act swiftly and decisively to maintain regional conditions for agricultural development."
"Mr President, I believe that these Commission proposals will mean that a number of African, Caribbean and Pacific countries will go out of business."
"That will lead to poverty and even more deprivation."
"Yes, we have to simplify the system."
"It is far too complicated at the moment."
"But I believe those countries need time to diversify properly and that is why I would agree with a ten-year transitional period."
"Chiquita, Dole and Del Monte, who produce in Latin American countries, have not seen their production levels go down since 1993. Their access to the market has not gone down since 1993."
"All they want to do is get more access to the market at the expense of the ACP countries."
"Yes, we have to find a solution."
"Producers in the UK are being held to ransom by the USA."
"We must not let ACP countries go to the wall just to save companies in the EU."
"This is not just about bananas; it is about trade with developing countries overall."
"I am quite aware of the inconsistencies in the common organisation of the market in bananas and associated relations with the WTO."
"It is difficult to take into account the various requirements and follow a policy which will favour the weakest parties and supply a high-quality product at affordable prices."
"Having said that, it is not that I do not think it is possible, as put forward in the Commission proposal, to adopt, as of 2006, a system which does not impose quota restrictions or tariffs on ACP countries or any other countries."
"Postponing this until 2010 would not make much difference, although that would undoubtedly give us more time to find less damaging solutions."
"The Commission' s proposal is too similar to the proposal of the Council of Ministers, which does not consider it necessary to allocate part of the budget to a policy of cooperation and protection of the Community' s primary producers in accordance with WTO negotiations."
"Rather than adapting to the WTO system, we should endeavour to reform it without giving in to blackmail by US multinationals which make a profit out of exploiting poor countries."
"We are all aware of the illiberal acts of these multinationals, which are destroying and corrupting both people and the environment."
"The challenge should be to reform the WTO."
"The Seattle Summit and the huge public demonstrations made the need plain."
"We must reform the WTO, without adversely affecting development and protection policies for poor countries, small producers and craftsmen, but, as per the Dary report on facilitating access to the market for fair-trade organisations in order to invest in environmentally-friendly and socially viable farming practices."
"This should be the European Union' s policy."
"Mr President, I speak from three perspectives."
"That of external trade, where I believe the European Union should uphold progress towards a liberalised world-trade order; that of industry, European industry, where jobs and industries are at threat from sanctions and they are innocent victims of these sanctions; and I speak from the perspective of a UK Member of this House who is tired of receiving letters of complaint from companies whose business and whose workers' jobs are at threat from the sanctions through no fault of their own."
"I regret various aspects of this Dary report."
"I have to say that this timescale of ten years is wholly unrealistic and unreasonable."
"I regret the attempt to cling on to quotas and to interfere with trade in that way."
"Of course, I also regret proposals for higher rates of tariff, which is another intervention in trade."
"The amendment, which has been put down in my name and others, calls for a negotiated settlement of this dispute, which is World Trade Organisation compatible."
"That is essential."
"We have been down this road several times now and innocent companies and jobs are at risk and being threatened as a result of our failure to come to grips with this situation."
"I support the Commissioner's efforts."
"He has a difficult task."
"I have to say that I cannot think of anything more reasonable or pragmatic or sensible than the amendment which a number of colleagues have supported me in submitting."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, like many of my colleagues in the Group of the European People's Party, I reject the Dary report, but there are also some amendments that seem very reasonable to me."
"I have in mind above all Amendments Nos 33 and 34."
"Amendment No 33 calls for financial support for ecologically sound farming in third countries also."
"Amendment No 34 calls for fair trade bananas to be supported regardless of their country of origin."
"By the way, I think it is a shame that the Greens are not taking part in this debate and also highlighting these aspects."
"But through these two amendments this House is clearly indicating that it also wants a global approach, and there are certainly small producers who behave in an exemplary fashion, not only in the traditional ACP countries and in the EU, but also in Latin America and in the non-traditional ACP countries."
"In Ecuador, 60% of banana producers are small producers with less than 20 hectares, and they are suffering from unjustifiable discrimination."
"The world is not just black and white, as some people would have us believe, and the Latin American countries have been quite justified in their complaints to the WTO about our common market organisation."
"That is why contradictions exist within the Dary report, which, on the one hand, advocates a global approach and support for fair trade bananas throughout the world, but, at the same time, continues to create difficulties of this kind for small producers in Latin America."
"I consider fixing the quotas for ten years to be a step in the wrong direction, and I believe that the Commission was already going the right way before this."
"To my mind, they could have moved rather more forcefully towards liberalisation, but they were going in the right direction."
"I would of course be delighted if Mr Chichester' s amendment, which I have also signed, were to be accepted, but I would like to tell Commissioner Fischler that even if this amendment is not accepted, Amendment No 5, which was accepted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, will give him the remit of coming up with a workable compromise acceptable to the WTO."
"That is why I believe that the Commission will, in any case, have a mandate to negotiate, including a mandate from Parliament."
"Mr President, Commissioner, at this point in the debate I am not going to enter into a discussion of the Dary report, nor discuss its fundamental points, but I do wish to say that the official position of the PPE Group is in support of the entire Dary report."
"That is the official position."
"Commissioner, your proposal does not accord with the objectives nor resolve the problems being suffered by the banana industry and politically it is not worthy of our producers. Mr Schwaiger recognised this a moment ago."
"Nor does the Commission' s proposal comply with our international commitments."
"However, the most serious problem is that, immersed in difficult negotiations with the World Trade Organisation, we are showing publicly, in black and white, where our weak points lie."
"Therefore, Commissioner, I ask you to listen to this Parliament - not simply to hear us - and to take note of the directions indicated in the Dary report and the opinions of the two competent committees."
"This Parliament is sending you a very clear political message, unanimously from the committee responsible in this area, and I hope that this House will support it by a majority."
"Judging by the great political sensitivity which you have always shown, I am sure that you will understand that message."
"Furthermore, I am sure that you will find a viable route in the direction indicated."
"Therefore, Commissioner, act politically, find a solution and listen to this Parliament."
"This is not the time to fail to take account of this House."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank you, Mr Dary, for your wide-ranging and appreciative comments on the Commission' s proposal to amend the common organisation of the market in bananas."
"By way of introduction, I would like to stress that the Commission takes a positive view of the principles behind many of the amendments, such as the system of historical references for the allocation of quotas."
"In fact, these reflect our discussions with the WTO complainants and the ACP producers."
"However, the Commission believes that we should not amend our proposal at this delicate stage in the discussions, and I therefore have no alternative but to reject your amendments."
"I would like to give my reasons for this rejection area by area."
"The first area is the deletion of references to a tariff only system and an automatic move to such a system after a certain transitional period."
"I will make no bones about it: the main objective of our proposal is to bring the COM in bananas into line with WTO rules."
"The most important part of the proposal is the introduction of the tariff system after a certain transitional period."
"On the other hand, this requires agreement with interested parties on the management of tariff quotas during the transitional period."
"The Commission firmly believes that your wish to replace the tariff system with a permanent tariff quota system will only lead to renewed attacks in the WTO."
"In addition, I would like to point out that the proposal already includes a request to the Council to empower the Commission to enter into negotiations under Article XXVIII of the GATT, so there is no need to refer to this in the regulation."
"The second important area is the issue of managing tariff quotas."
"The Commission is attempting to negotiate with the principal suppliers about allocating tariff quotas on the basis of historical references."
"It would not be advisable to additionally define the individual options until these discussions have been concluded."
"Furthermore, with regard to the demand that the tariff quota administration system should not have an adverse effect on operators and producers already present on the market, I must say that if we have to modify the whole COM now, there can be no guarantee that things will stay exactly as they were."
"That really would be demanding the impossible."
"Our discussions have also covered other alternatives for managing quota C. However, the Commission believes that it would not be appropriate at present to modify its proposal for auctions in relation to quota C, because auctions of this kind are, in any case, a reliable method of allocating licences."
"The third area, which relates to quotas, is the extension of the period for maintaining the quota system to at least 10 years."
"The Commission considers that extending the period in this way would reduce the credibility of the central theme of our proposal, which is that the COM in bananas should be brought into line with the WTO rules as soon as possible."
"As we explained in the explanatory memorandum, the quickest way to do this is through the tariff system."
"The Commission has proposed the transitional period because it gives time for producers within the Community and in the ACP countries to prepare for the new system."
"Furthermore, if we moved automatically to a tariff only system, there would be no point in having an interim review or an appraisal at the end of the transitional period."
"With regard to the tariff preference for ACP countries, the Commission believes that EUR 275 per tonne is sufficient to secure access to the Community market for these countries."
"A higher preference would also lead to renewed attacks in the WTO."
"If the higher preference limited Latin American countries' access under quota C, this could be interpreted as if we wanted in practice to introduce a special ACP quota."
"I shall now turn to the special support measures for our own producers in the European Union."
"As I have already said, the principle aim of the Commission' s proposal is to bring the COM into line with the WTO' s final ruling."
"The final ruling does not affect our intra-Community support system."
"Furthermore, I would like to point out that this is a deficiency payment system, which means that it has a built-in guarantee. If prices fall, subsidies automatically increase."
"My last point is about measures giving equal access to organic and fair trade bananas."
"There are already horizontal measures in place guaranteeing equal access for organic bananas from third countries and organic bananas from the Community."
"In addition, the European Union can grant subsidies for the production of organic bananas under the agri-environmental measures envisaged in the development plan for rural areas."
"Measures to support sales of organic bananas can be financed under national and regional programmes."
"Fair trade bananas would also come under the horizontal measures for fair trade, which, I hope, will soon be adopted on the basis of a Commission communication to this effect."
"As you know, this communication is not just about fair trade bananas, but about fair trade in general."
"In addition to the possibilities I have just mentioned, it is also possible to provide support for developing production of organic bananas and also of fair trade bananas in the ACP countries under the Regulation establishing a special framework of assistance for traditional ACP suppliers of bananas."
"The Commission is grateful for the wide-ranging discussions that have taken place here today."
"Even if it feels unable to accept Parliament' s amendments because of the current international situation, I must say that the whole dossier has been handled very constructively and comprehensively in the various committees that have contributed to the Dary report and in the recent hearing held by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m."
"I shall suspend the sitting until the President arrives."
"(The sitting was suspended at 11.25 a.m. and resumed at 11.30 a.m.)"
"Vote"
"Madam President, at the appropriate moment, I would ask you, pursuant to Rule 161(1) of the Rules of Procedure, to request that the rapporteur and the Chairperson of the Committee on Budgetary Control explain their position in relation to the coherence between the explanatory statement and the resolution that we are voting on."
"Madam President, Mr Barón Crespo, Chairman of the Socialist Group, also directed a comment to me."
"Last Monday we did indeed have a wide-ranging discussion in the Committee on Budgetary Control on the admissibility of this question, and on whether, as chair of the committee, I should make use of Rule 161."
"Almost every member of the committee spoke on this."
"I myself have several times looked into the connection between the resolution, as it now appears in the compromise, and the explanatory statement, which reflects the rapporteur' s position and is her responsibility."
"I established the connection, and I said in the clearest terms that the language in the explanatory statement before us is very harsh."
"Nevertheless, I do not think I should comment on the style and choice of words in a censorious way, because I would then have to do the same for every explanatory statement."
"As I see it, there is a factual connection and I therefore decided not to reject this explanatory statement and informed the committee accordingly."
"Madam President, I tabled this amendment, along with 37 colleagues from the European People' s Party, because I was appalled at the way the media had exploited the explanatory statement which, as everyone should know but obviously does not, is the responsibility of the rapporteur and in no way commits the House."
"I was struck by the contradiction in tone between the explanatory statement and the content of the resolution. They are radically different."
"That is why I tabled this amendment."
"Having said that, I think you are right, Madam President, to declare it admissible because the vote this amendment involves is not a vote for or against the explanatory statement, but is simply intended to highlight the distance between that explanatory statement and the resolution."
"After the explanations given by both Mrs Stauner and Mrs Theato, who has stated publicly in the clearest possible way that the explanatory statement is only the responsibility of the rapporteur and in no way commits the House, I consider the amendment no longer necessary, and that is why I am withdrawing it."
"In other words, Mr Barón Crespo, you will take over Amendment No 5, on behalf of your Group, pursuant to Rule 139 of the Rules of Procedure."
"Is that correct?"
"Yes, Madam President, and furthermore, I would be grateful if, on such a sensitive issue, the rapporteur could speak on the basis of the question, as she is required to do."
"Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I shall support Mr Barón Crespo' s proposal."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Barón Crespo, I have not specifically reiterated this point, but I am sure you will realise that when I was drafting both the resolution and the text of the explanatory statement I was very acutely aware that they needed to be in accord with each other, and I have really searched my soul about this over the last few weeks."
"I did not think it was necessary to say this again explicitly, but if you wish I will gladly do that."
"I like to think that I am sufficiently conscientious and intellectually able for you to assume that I would have considered this long and hard, and that I am happy to take responsibility for this and to face all the consequences that you seem to be threatening me with."
"on Amendment No 5"
"Madam President, just so that things are clear, I withdrew the amendment because I considered it unnecessary, but as it is being voted on I obviously support it and I invite my friends to do the same."
"After the vote on Amendment No 5"
"Madam President, although some people are pleased at the decision that has been taken, this creates a very dangerous precedent."
"Whenever, in future, there is an explanatory statement which some in the House do not like we have established that every time we will be able to vote against if we wish to do so."
"We had a problem when we had to prepare the voting list, which was that we could not find the amendment tabled by the Greens, the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Group of the Party of European Socialists and the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party for point 5."
"I do not know whether it is possible to have it read out so that we have the chance to adopt a position on it."
"Madam President, there are two amendments tabled to Mr Kuhne's report which propose to postpone discharge for Parliament."
"These amendments make reference to the Secretary-General."
"If either of these amendments is adopted, will you, as President of Parliament, assume full political responsibility for their content and take the consequences if the demands set out in them are not met by the deadlines."
"Mr van Hulten, as President, I take responsibility for declaring these amendments admissible."
"I am not expressing an opinion on their content."
"Parliament has not yet voted on them."
"The problem facing me is whether they are admissible or not."
"I am telling you that I sincerely and honestly believe, after examining the position, that these amendments are admissible."
"If they are voted through they will obviously be implemented, like everything else we vote for."
"on Amendment No 4"
"Madam President, we have an amendment before us which allegedly sums up the substance of two observations by the Court of Auditors very concisely."
"If you think it is necessary, I can read out the full wording of these observations, although personally I would prefer not to."
"I just wish to say that I am opposed to this amendment, because I really do not think it serves any useful purpose for us to include tendentious summaries of official documents in our parliamentary documents, even if said summaries are tabled by the chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"on Amendment No 1 from the Greens/ALE Group"
"Madam President, Point 6, on which we have to vote in this amendment, stipulates a deadline of 15 May."
"If we were to accept this, we would be contradicting a paragraph that we agreed earlier."
"Earlier on, under Paragraph 10 of the proposal for a decision to be precise, we agreed that we wished to see options for buildings management and a financing plan, taking into account the situation on negotiations, by 1 July."
"We have already agreed on this, and this was also unanimously agreed in committee, because we accepted that this was only possible if we took account of the situation on negotiations."
"If we were now to set a deadline of 15 May without taking account of the negotiating situation, we would not only be agreeing to something which it was agreed in committee simply cannot be done, we would also be contradicting something that we have already agreed upon."
"I therefore appeal to the Greens to withdraw this point, failing which I would recommend that you vote against it, so as to ensure consistency with the rest of the decision."
"Madam President, this is a compromise amendment which was negotiated among groups and then, of course, examined by the various groups last night."
"Our Group supports this compromise amendment with, however, the exception of one word: ""plus"" - ""plus proportionnelle""."
"Presumably the English version is ""more proportional""."
"We cannot accept that word."
"However, under the Rules, it is not possible to ask for a split vote on a compromise amendment."
"I note that if Amendments Nos 100 and 101 were both to be adopted, it would come to exactly the same text as this compromise amendment, except for the problematic word ""more""."
"As I know that colleagues in other groups had exactly the same problem with this word, I would suggest to friends and colleagues that it might be appropriate not to accept the compromise amendment but to vote instead in favour of both Amendments Nos 100 and 101, which are compatible, and that would achieve precisely the result desired by many people."
"Thank you, Mr Corbett."
"But I have to apply the rules."
"A compromise amendment has been put before me."
"Mr Brok, could you respond to Mr Corbett' s remarks, and say whether you agree to change the compromise amendment?"
"Madam President, we would like to keep the compromise amendment."
"I put the question to Parliament."
"Are there any objections to our putting this compromise amendment to the vote?"
"I thought that was the case."
"Madam President, I think it is fair that it be put to the vote."
"However, my Group and many others will vote against it in order to support Amendments Nos 100 and 101, which will achieve almost exactly the same effect with the slight improvements."
"Yes, Mr Corbett, but I have to ask Parliament if there are any objections to my putting the compromise amendment to the vote."
"Madam President, this amendment has been tabled under the Rules of Procedure and it should be voted on accordingly."
"If it is rejected, we can then switch to the rules suggested by Mr Corbett."
"That is the simplest approach."
"Let us have a vote on the amendment, and if it is rejected, we can proceed as Mr Corbett has suggested."
"Excuse me, Mr Brok, Rule 130 of the Rules of Procedure is very clear."
"It says that if there are any objections to putting a compromise amendment to the vote, the President of the European Parliament must leave it to the wisdom of the House."
"I am only following the Rules, just as I should."
"(Parliament decided not to put the compromise amendment to the vote)"
"on Amendment No 118 from the Greens/ALE Group"
"Madam President, there seems to be a lack of correspondence between the different linguistic versions of Amendment No 118."
"The French version simply refers to ""les autorités compétentes"", whereas the English version refers to ""the competent devolved authorities"" which, in English, has a more significant meaning."
"We established our voting lists in favour of this amendment on the basis of the French version."
"However, I understand that the original version is, in fact, the English one, in which case, unless the word ""devolved"" in the English version can be removed, I will recommend my Group to vote against this amendment."
"Madam President, the French text takes precedence."
"Right, thank you for making that clear."
"on compromise Amendment No 227"
"Madam President, your services were informed yesterday that we would not sign this compromise amendment."
"on Amendment No 174 from the PPE Group"
"Madam President, we wish to request a split vote, first on the term ""four-fifths"" and then on the rest."
"Actually, a split vote on the original text is scheduled, that is, if the amendment is rejected."
"Are you withdrawing this amendment, in which case we will hold a split vote on paragraph 29?"
"Is that right, Mr Brok?"
"Madam President, if we were to do that here, we would not need to present the oral amendment on Paragraph 29."
"So it would be easier to do that here."
"So what you want, if I have understood properly - and I also want to check with the rapporteurs - is for us to vote on paragraph 29 with an oral amendment."
"Is that right?"
"Madam President, I have the highest regard for Elmar Brok, but in this case he is mistaken."
"The only point of the compromise amendment was to add the word ""continuing"" in English or ""anhaltend"" in German to ""serious"" , which is ""schwerwiegend"" in the German version."
"That is the old text."
"We have not agreed on the four-fifths majority, so it is just too late for this now."
"We cannot split this again now."
"If the amendments are withdrawn, I will take the vote on the original text."
"Now, on the original text of paragraph 29, I believe I had a request for an oral amendment from one of our rapporteurs."
"So I will give him the floor to present his oral amendment and then we will have a split vote and roll-call vote on paragraph 29."
"Mr Dimitrakopoulos, if you would like to present your oral amendment, Parliament will decide."
"Madam President, the oral amendment consists of adding the word 'continuing' to the second part."
"That is clear."
"Are there any objections to putting this oral amendment to the vote?"
"Madam President, this interesting idea simply takes up in oral form the compromise amendment that has just been rejected."
"It is not really in order with our normal procedure."
"Are there twelve Members against putting this oral amendment to the vote?"
"(More than twelve Members rose to oppose the vote on the oral amendment)"
"Madam President, I would like to say just one thing to the Group of the Party of European Socialists. It has subsequently voted against or withdrawn its name from all the compromise amendments that it had signed, without informing us of this."
"I do not think that this is a reasonable way to do business or how we should treat each other!"
"Madam President, I must refute what Mr Brok said."
"A number of compromises were made and we respected those compromises, except in two cases where there are problems, as we sometimes find when we take compromises back to our various groups."
"I proposed a solution in both cases."
"In this case, we informed your services yesterday that we would not be signing that compromise amendment."
"Thus, it should never have been tabled in our name."
"It may have been a compromise between the ELDR and the EPP Groups, but it was not a compromise which we signed."
"before the final vote"
"Madam President, I would like to make a political declaration on behalf of my Group in relation to an issue which I believe has left a nasty taste in the mouths of all the groups in this House: the vote on paragraph 3, on the composition and distribution of seats in the European Parliament."
"My Group will vote in favour of the Dimitrakopoulos/Leinen report, but I propose that the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, in its wisdom, be charged with the task of finding a solution to this issue, because it is enormously sensitive throughout this House."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"President."
"I warmly congratulate our two rapporteurs, Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen."
"(Loud applause)"
"Mr President, I would have been tempted to follow the example of Mr Cox and abstain from the vote on Mrs Stauner' s report, but, in all honesty, I have to say that before I left to come to Strasbourg, some pensioners asked me what I was going to do here."
"When I told them that my tasks included voting on the postponement of discharge, which we are discussing today, they asked me to remind the President of the House that the pensioners and their party, which I represent, consider that expenditure takes up too great a part of the European Parliament' s budget."
"They therefore call for expenditure to be halved and the resources freed up in this way used to increase the pension funds of the 15 Member States, which have been in serious difficulties for too long now."
"- The Liberal Group today supported the amendment tabled by Jean Louis Bourlanges of the Group of the European People's Party, which called for the resolution to be separate from the explanatory statement."
"By way of explanation, consider the following quotes:"
"""One might conclude that the Commission had decided in some fields to draw a veil over and forget past events."
"The Commission has sought to distract the public attention from unresolved internal problems in the present by making glib and bombastic promises for the future."""
"""The Commission apparatus which wielded excessive power even under President Santer has now become even more powerful; moreover it is all too often dominated by coteries""."
"By any standards these comments are excessive, unfair and, in the context of the discharge procedure, wholly unsuitable."
"On the final vote on the resolution we were faced with three choices today: to vote in favour, to vote against or to abstain."
"We chose to abstain and this requires explanation."
"To vote in favour of the Stauner report is to vote for postponement of granting discharge which, all things considered, we believe should be granted now."
"As we explained in the Budgetary Control Committee, our preference was to vote ""yes"" to reform but ""no"" to visiting on this Commission the sins of its predecessors."
"In the Liberal Group we have been consistently in favour of many of the elements in the Stauner report such as access to documents - it is a duty of the current Commission to provide access to documents."
"But the political question remains - is this the moment and is this the issue for an apparent public stand off between Parliament and the Prodi Commission?"
"We think not."
"If we do not vote in favour of the report it is because we want to indicate a preference to do business on reform now rather than later because we believe, on the evidence to date, that this Commission is a reformist Commission."
"Voting against the report would merely have the effect of sending the report back to the Budgetary Control Committee without a clear expression of what happens next and by what means."
"We are against such an approach."
"So we have chosen to abstain."
"This is a motivated abstention rather than an indifferent one."
"Our Group preference was to have voted to grant discharge while promoting reform which we accept is also the view of the European Commission."
"Unfortunately, today's choice did not allow for such an option and so we have chosen to abstain."
"The French Socialist delegation has voted for Mrs Stauner' s report postponing the granting of discharge for the financial year 1998, because it resulted from a compromise by our political group with the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party."
"This resolution reflected the desire of the majority of members of the Committee on Budgetary Control to break the deadlock over Mrs Stauner' s proposed report in the committee, but also in the European Parliament, which was putting our institution' s relations with the Commission onto a defiant footing."
"The French Socialist delegation is glad a majority was achieved to pass Amendment No 5 highlighting the slippage between the resolution put to the vote and the explanatory statement."
"By that vote, Members have reaffirmed that only the rapporteur is responsible for the explanatory statement."
"The proposed report Mrs Stauner submitted to the Committee on Budgetary Control caused consternation far beyond the members of the committee itself."
"Indeed, the proposed document bore little relation to the discharge procedure, which is about approval of the accounts for the financial year and the propriety of the expenditure."
"The resolution put to the vote in Parliament today presents a catalogue of reasonable demands and recommendations to the Commission."
"The postponement and the response time given to the Commission allow it to answer the questions from the Committee on Budgetary Control within the set time."
"They leave the Committee on Budgetary Control sufficient time to prepare a report which will rule effectively on the implementation of the 1998 budget by the Commission."
"- (IT) The delegation of the Democratic Left to the European Parliament, of which I am chair, voted against the Stauner report on the 1998 discharge because it does not agree with the basic line taken."
"The report does not focus on the Commission' s actions during 1998, to which the discharge relates, pursuant to Article 205a and Article 206 of the Treaty and Article 89(5) of the Financial Regulation, but is lingering over alleged cases of fraud, most of which occurred in the early nineties during the terms of previous Commissions."
"The Prodi Commission has undertaken a vast reform, which is necessary in order to modernise the European civil service and to reorganise its structures in preparation for the many challenges which it will have to face over the next few years."
"We, too, are convinced that reform of the budgetary control and programme management procedures is essential, for these systems have proved to be inadequate."
"Indeed, it is necessary to ensure not only that past cases of fraud cannot be repeated, but also, and above all, that the level of management errors identified by the Court of Auditors in its annual report is greatly reduced."
"In any case, it is not by attempting without fresh proof to reopen disciplinary proceedings which have now been concluded that we will achieve a thorough, effective reform of the Commission."
"It should be recalled that 80% of Community funds are managed at national level, and improving the financial management of the European Union budget could not therefore be contemplated without the cooperation of the Member States."
"Furthermore, we fear that behind this unjustified vicious attack lies an attempt to use such incidents to undermine and sabotage not just Commission actions but the work of the European institutions in general."
"We cannot therefore support the perpetrators of these schemes, and, for this reason, we voted against the report."
"Kuhne Report (A5-0097/2000)"
"- (NL) In view of the inadequate management with regard to the buildings and personnel policy contracted out, as mentioned in the Kuhne report and in the report by the Financial Controller, we are of the opinion that discharge to the European Parliament in respect of the implementation of the 1998 budget must be postponed."
"The European Parliament must operate the same high standards with regard to its own management as are required of the Commission."
"We are convinced that discharge can only be granted to the European Parliament in respect of the implementation of the 1998 budget, provided that specific measures are taken to buck this deplorable trend once and for all."
"We are very much in favour of a specific action plan through which such mismanagement can be prevented in the future."
"Dimitrakopoulos/Leinen Report (A5-0086/2000)"
"Mr President, I would like to underline that no one in Parliament will agree with every single item and every single paragraph of this important report."
"That is clear."
"The overall message that we are giving to the IGC is that this Parliament wants the IGC to be ambitious, to think long term and not short term and to address all the issues that need to be addressed if a Union of nearly 30 Member States is to be able to function effectively."
"We have put a large number of suggestions on the table."
"Clearly, not all of them will be taken up in the form which this Parliament has advocated."
"But we know that."
"We think it is right that the IGC should look at these issues, look at them seriously and come up with appropriate solutions that will enable the Union to work."
"My Group, as you know and as Barón Crespo has just said, has some reservations on particular points."
"They relate, in particular, to the composition of this Parliament, where unfortunately attempts to reach a compromise position fell down at the last minute."
"We must come back to this issue and put forward a proper proposal on a matter which is of direct concern to this House."
"I am confident that we can do that."
"We were very near to a compromise agreement."
"We should be able to crack this one."
"We are happy to vote for the report, given the circumstances, and with the reservations I have just described."
"Mr President, I have voted against this report."
"I say this with regret."
"I have voted against this report for almost the same reasons that Mr Corbett has voted in favour."
"I have the same objectives: an ambitious Intergovernmental Conference which deals with the real issues and looks to the long term."
"I believe that this Parliament is sending a confused message to the Intergovernmental Conference through this resolution."
"Reading it will not give a true idea of the message that Parliament wanted to send in relation to this Intergovernmental Conference."
"Therefore, Mr President, while I am in absolute agreement with many of the things said in the resolution, I disagree with many others and regret, for example, with regard to an issue as important as the Court of Justice, that the resolution essentially fails to provide for the necessary reform of this institution, nor does it provide suitable clear guidelines in this respect."
"For all these reasons, I regret, once again, to say that I have voted against."
"Mr President, we are opposed to the Dimitrakopoulos/Leinen report because it proposes an integrated, centralised, rigid model of Europe, which is the opposite of our Europe and which can only block enlargement."
"We find three points in this report particularly harmful."
"The first is the federalisation of the institutions, by making qualified majority voting in the Council and codecision with the European Parliament the general rule, introducing transnational European elections, and strengthening the powers of the Commission in an attempt to turn it into a European Government."
"The necessary but unacknowledged counterpart of all these measures is the marginalisation of the national democracies."
"The second is making a constitution out of the Treaties and adding a restrictive European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights, gradually subjecting the peoples to texts which go far beyond them and which will be imposed on them, without any of them, individually, being able to escape that."
"Thirdly, the totalitarian drift of so-called European democracy, with the introduction of mechanisms, in particular making the application of Article 7 of the EU Treaty more flexible so that a Member State can be suspended, mechanisms, then, which will give a handful of leaders authority to operate a thought police across the continent, even against peoples expressing themselves democratically, as in Austria."
"One of the most controversial points that arose during the debate was the contradiction between the anticipated proliferation of Members of the European Parliament because of enlargement, and the ceiling of 700 Members the Treaty of Amsterdam has imposed on our Parliament."
"That limit was chosen to make the European Parliament resemble a national one, but all it does today is set the countries against each other, as none of them will accept a reduction in its quota of Members, and that is understandable."
"The Europe of Nations Group proposes putting an end to these conflicts by breaking through the ceiling of 700 Members."
"Why not a European Parliament of 1000 Members?"
"It could work in variable geometry formations and its originality would have a powerful impact on the imagination."
"Mr President, I shall endeavour to explain myself clearly."
"I voted against this report and I was not alone in doing so."
"We did so with conviction on behalf of the European regionalists of the ALE."
"We form part of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, but by taking this position we wanted to express our disillusionment over what is being discussed here today."
"This agenda is, of course, too restricted."
"Europe is very ambitious when it comes to enlargement, which is a good thing, but it is not ambitious enough to provide a real democratic structure that emanates from the regions and the people."
"We regret that all amendments that serve to incorporate this dimension into Europe have been rejected."
"We have had to conclude that, contrary to our expectations, the power of the large states will increase and the power of the European Parliament and the possibility of our regions being represented within it, will decrease."
"We therefore hope that the IGC will prove successful in getting vigorous reform under way."
"We had to vote against because we do not fully identify ourselves with the structure of this democratic Europe."
"Mr President, like many others in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I have voted against this report for many reasons, but above all for three reasons."
"First of all, it is not, as many perhaps believe, federalism which is now a salient feature of Parliament' s attitude but, rather, centralism."
"It is the big States which are obtaining more power, those and the central institutions."
"There is no trace of decentralisation and the redistribution of power and no sign of any substance being given to the subsidiarity principle."
"Secondly, no adjustments are being made in anticipation of enlargement, which is perhaps the most serious feature of all."
"If a Union of 28 Member States is to be successful, it must obviously have a flexible structure."
"There must be clear definitions of powers in regard to what is to be decided centrally, what is to be decided in the Member States and what can be decided at regional level."
"There is nothing of this, however."
"If such a large Union is to be a real success, a large proportion of the decisions now made centrally must clearly be decentralised to a lower level."
"Otherwise, the whole system will implode."
"Thirdly, this is no democratic, constitutional process but a case of a power game behind locked doors."
"I have therefore voted against."
"Mr President, I express my disappointment at my Green colleagues and my own group, because I was left with no opportunity to vote on two key amendments on the common, foreign and security policy."
"One was an amendment on the arms industries and arms exports and the other was on nuclear weapons."
"It was very important for us to have an opportunity to say whether nuclear weapons play a role of any kind in the future of the common, foreign and security policy."
"Unfortunately, my Green colleagues deemed these amendments unnecessary, which raises the question whether the Greens are changing their policy on nuclear weapons and on the arms industries."
"I voted against the report itself, because I feel that more centralisation means less safety for smaller Member States, less democracy, less involvement of people at a local and national level."
"This is not in the interest of the ordinary people of Europe."
"A new constitution for Europe that overrides national constitutions, a legal personality for the European Union and, of course, more militarisation: this is not the kind of Europe I want."
"I want a de-militarised Europe, a democratic Europe where the people have the real say, not bureaucrats."
"Mr President, I voted for Amendment No 100 to the Dimitrakopoulos/Leinen report on the European Parliament' s proposals for the Intergovernmental Conference, which, I regret, was not adopted by the House."
"It laid down that elections to the European Parliament should be held as soon as possible using the same lists of candidates in all 15 Member States, that is to say genuinely European lists."
"I feel that this amendment is based on a point which brings the citizens much closer to Europe and the European Union: the citizens who are called on to vote realise that the candidates are the same throughout the 15 States, and this would show them that Europe does exist and that there is a reason for its existence."
"This is why I voted for this amendment."
"Mr President, I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution although I did not agree with the individual points."
"I regret that, at the end of the day, only 238 Members voted for the text, and I would like to ask those responsible for the running of this House to check whether the procedure followed really made sense."
"To my mind, the fact that so many amendments were tabled is a sign that there had been a failure to reach sufficient agreement beforehand, and the fact that not even the compromise amendments were adopted is a sign that we were not yet ready to vote on this in plenary."
"I would also ask you, Mr President, to raise this vote in the Bureau, and to consider whether we cannot arrange matters differently, so that we avoid a mammoth voting session like this, which has lasted two and a half hours."
"And I am sure that in the end there was not a single Member here who could understand what this was all about."
"We should make sure we do not have procedures like this in plenary in future!"
"Mr President, although I am broadly in favour of the Dimitrakopoulos report on the Intergovernmental Conference, I abstained on the final vote."
"In fact, in the course of one paragraph - paragraph 32 - the scope of which will certainly have escaped the majority of Members, the door has been opened to calling into question the current status of public services in the context of international trade negotiations, especially WTO negotiations, without the agreement of a Member State. This is proposed on the pretext of amending article 133 of the Treaty and, in fact, making it possible to break the principle of the agreement of all the States in establishing the position of the European Union as regards services, investment and intellectual property rights."
"The rejection of Amendment No 57, which would have removed this ambiguity, therefore leads me to abstain on the text although, I repeat, I support its main thrust as regards the IGC."
"And I am quite sure the IGC will not retain the current wording of paragraph 32."
"Mr President, I voted for the Dimitrakopoulos report, although I do have some reservations about it."
"The Dimitrakopoulos report does not go far enough for me in terms of EU federalisation and integration."
"I believe that we should go much further, and move more determinedly, towards federalisation and away from nation states, towards the regions and the peoples of Europe."
"I hope, even if the omens for this Intergovernmental Conference are not the best, that there may still be an opening here or there."
"I am enough of a realist to know that this is a gradual process."
"That is why I voted for this report and I hope that we will take many more such steps in the near future."
"Mr President, I abstained in the final vote for several major reasons and also some minor ones."
"It was difficult for me to support the resolution because it mixes the worst in with the best."
"On the other hand, I did not want to vote against a resolution which probably represents the best the European Parliament can do at the moment."
"The obvious conclusion seems to me that Parliament itself still has a long way to go to meet the profound aspirations of the majority of European Union citizens."
"Moreover, the rejection of two compromise amendments during the sitting bears witness to the difficulty of finding representative majorities, as does the rejection or acceptance, by the narrowest of margins, of institutional measures of the highest importance."
"To take just one example, Parliament was only able to maintain a compromise on the composition of the Commission with difficulty, but truth obliges me to state that the compromise incorporates two contradictory ideas."
"We have passed a resolution actually stating that the number of members of the Commission should be limited, as long as it is not."
"Is that really a very sensible position for a Parliament to take?"
"Ainardi, Bakopoulos, Eriksson, Figueiredo, Frahm, Koulourianos, Meijer, Herman Schmid, Seppänen and Sjöstedt (GUE/NGL), in writing."
"We, Members from different parties in the GUE/NGL Group, have not voted in favour of the report concerning the European Parliament proposal for the IGC."
"We oppose the development of the European Union towards a state with superior powers to those of the Member States in all aspects of policy, as the report in practice advocates."
"Instead of transforming the EU into a state, we are of the opinion that the Union must be democratised."
"Democratisation of the European Union must be achieved through a decreasing of the Commission's power, the introduction of openness and transparency to the legislative practices of the Council, and strengthening of the role at EU level of the national parliaments."
"We further protest against the report's advocacy of the militarisation of the EU."
"We insist that the EU remain a civil organisation and that the non-aligned countries' special status be respected."
"We are of the opinion that the Intergovernmental Conference must reconsider the construction of the EMU, reassessing the currency union's lack of democracy and its right-wing policies."
"We demand that the stability pact be reconsidered and Article 56 of the Treaty be rewritten in order to bring the ECB under democratic control."
"We reiterate our condemnation of the failure to submit the EMU project to referendum in all of the Member States."
"- (DA) The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament today voted against the report by Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen on the European Parliament' s proposal for the IGC."
"We consider that in insisting on a broad agenda, the European Parliament is not facilitating what should be the main task of the IGC, namely that of resolving the outstanding institutional problems regarding the composition and voting rules of the Council, the Commission, the European Parliament, the Court of Justice and the other institutions, and so making enlargement possible."
"The European Parliament ought instead to take up the important task of ensuring that the essential issues which need to be resolved are debated in such a way that Europe' s citizens are involved and can form their own views on the important subjects being debated."
"The EU should build on a common political will to achieve the overriding objectives relating to peace, the environment and prosperity in Europe, focusing on the interests of its citizens."
"The debate in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, which adopted the draft report with a very small majority, plus the fact that more than 200 amendments have been tabled for consideration in plenary, show that this report cannot contribute to creating a common basis for the IGC."
"Despite the fact that we do not consider that the European Parliament should propose all these amendments to the Treaty, we have elected to adopt positions on the individual points, as will be evident from our voting."
"However, we would like to draw particular attention to the points which we think the IGC should concentrate on."
"As regards the composition of the European Parliament, we have voted for calculation of the number of Members from each Member State according to a sliding scale so that the European Parliament' s composition reflects the size of the individual States, populations as well as the fact that there are benefits to be had from making the European Parliament more representative by enabling the different political viewpoints in the individual countries to be represented there."
"As regards the composition of the Commission, it is important that all States have the right to a Commissioner with the same rights and obligations, particularly as in our opinion, the Commission must continue to enjoy the right of initiative."
"When it comes to the voting rules in the Council, we consider that a balance must be maintained between the interests of the small and large states. This can be achieved by laying down requirements for a certain number of votes in the Council which must, at the same time, represent a simple majority of the total population of the Union."
"We are open to discussing increased use of qualified majority voting, although we do not consider that it should be the rule."
"Each particular instance of a transition to qualified majority voting must, however, be analysed and debated thoroughly and a balance struck between what is fundamental as far as the individual Member States are concerned and the need to make cooperation work."
"It is especially important that this matter be discussed on an on-going basis with Europe' s citizens."
"All Member States must demonstrate the political will to make cooperation work."
"It is this will and the desire for common solutions which the EU must also build on in future."
"We are not, therefore, worried that, following enlargement, the EU will be paralysed unless a thorough reform of the Treaty is carried out now."
"In parallel with the IGC, the Member States are discussing a common European security and defence policy."
"These discussions are far from complete, and we do not think that the European Parliament should table amendments to the Treaty before the outcome is known."
"We continue to believe that the EU should not be an actual defence alliance."
"In this area, the EU must focus in particular on conflict prevention and civil crisis management."
"Also in parallel with the IGC, the creation of a Charter of Fundamental Rights is being debated."
"We would like once again to stress that we want a charter in the form of a political document and that it should not be raised at the IGC with a view to incorporating it into the Treaty."
"- (ES) The process of enlargement which the European Union has started has brought it to a crossroads and its ability to continue making progress will depend on the direction it takes."
"It can therefore be said that the IGC, which is charged with proceeding with the institutional reforms which will make enlargement possible, holds the future of the European Union in its hands, since it has to decide between the minimal reform laid down in the Treaty of Amsterdam and the broad reform which will allow the Union to accept the countries which are preparing for accession and pursue its task in favour of respect for human rights, peace and social justice."
"Therefore, given that we are at a crucial moment in the process of European integration, it was appropriate for Parliament to send a message indicating what it understood to be the key points of the reform."
"In the Dimitrakopoulos-Leinen report which we have just approved and which I have voted in favour of, Parliament indicates that we have to make further progress and that, to this end, we have to give the European Union the necessary means to complete the shared project of peace and well-being initiated 50 years ago."
"Let us hope that the IGC is aiming sufficiently high for the great challenges facing the Union and that it follows that path which Parliament has set for it."
"The Committee on Constitutional Affairs adopted an amendment seeking to add the following sentence to Article 289 of the EC Treaty:"
"'In the case of the European Parliament, it shall decide, by an absolute majority of its members, on the location of its seat and of all its meetings' ."
"I would like to point out that this issue is not on the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference. The IGC' s principal aim is to reform the institutions in preparation for enlargement."
"Furthermore, the issue of the European Parliament' s seat is covered by a Court of Justice ruling of 1 October 1997 and laid down in the protocol on the seat of the institutions annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"That ought to be enough to ensure that this question is never raised again."
"To those who envisage building a Europe where the places of work and decision making are concentrated on one site only, I say that today, more than ever, we must build a democratic Europe, close to all its citizens."
"The very identity of Parliament and the powers it claims depend on that."
"As a French Socialist Member, I am therefore very much opposed to any proposal that would call into question the Strasbourg seat of the European Parliament."
"Madam President, that is why I have voted against this motion."
"- (SV) Enlargement of the European Union is one of the most important issues for the future of Europe."
"The aim of the present Intergovernmental Conference is to prepare the EU for this enlargement. If enlargement is to be implemented successfully, certain institutional changes are required."
"The EU must become more efficient and more democratic, and a balance should be maintained between the small and large countries. Moreover, it is important that the Intergovernmental Conference should be concluded before the end of the year so that the process of enlargement which has been embarked upon is not delayed."
"The report on the Intergovernmental Conference is the European Parliament' s contribution to that conference."
"It discusses both the necessary institutional reforms, about which no conclusions were reached in the Treaty of Amsterdam, and a number of additional questions which must also be dealt with prior to enlargement."
"We, the Swedish Members, Mr Pierre Schori, Mr Jan Andersson, Mr Göran Färm and Mrs Ewa Hedkvist Petersen, support the main features of the report, but we would highlight the following points on which, to some extent, we have different opinions, which is why we abstained from voting in the final ballot."
"The role of the European Parliament is to represent the people in the Union."
"Enlargement means more States' representatives in Parliament."
"If an efficient decision-making procedure is to be maintained, there must be a change in the way the seats are distributed."
"We advocate a ceiling of 700 Members of the European Parliament."
"The number of seats allocated to each country is determined through a system of degressive proportionality on the basis of the country' s population."
"Should a system with a single European constituency be introduced, the number of Members should not be increased."
"A new weighting of votes in the Council is a prerequisite for successful enlargement of the EU."
"It is important that the solution should be a permanent one and not need to be changed in connection with any future enlargement."
"It ought to strike a balance between the principles of, on the one hand, 'one country, one vote' and, on the other hand, 'one citizen, one vote' ."
"An alternative would be for the weighting of votes in the Council to be calculated on the basis of the root of the population in the individual countries."
"We believe that each Member State should have a Member in the Commission."
"The Members of the Commission work for the whole Union and are important if a consensus between the Member States is to be achieved."
"The Commission should therefore be able to draw upon knowledge and experience from all the countries in the Union."
"In that way, the legitimacy of the Commission would also be strengthened."
"The task of protecting the Union' s interests against fraud is to be carried out by the individual Member States' institutions and not by a supranational authority."
"It is nonetheless important and desirable that there should be European prosecutors in each Member State and that they should cooperate."
"Unanimity in the Council must be required in questions of a constitutional and fundamental nature, as well as in questions affecting general security and defence policy."
"Closer cooperation between at least a third of the Member States cannot apply in the case of defence cooperation."
"EU cooperation is, in the first place, a civilian European project and ought to be distinguished from military cooperation."
"The Member States have different backgrounds where military alliances and neutrality are concerned."
"We made great progress in Cologne and Helsinki by preparing ourselves for preventive crisis and conflict management."
"It is therefore important that the Treaty should reflect the difference between civilian and military cooperation."
"Military aid of a kind which places countries under obligations to each other has no place in the EU' s Treaty."
"We are not prepared to dispense with the veto in regard to military cooperation."
"- The agenda of the IGC has now been set by the Member States."
"We now know its general scope, and it is clear that much of the content of this resolution, regardless of its merit or lack of it, has nothing to do with it."
"While Parliament is fully entitled to be aspirational, it is a mistake for us not to have focused our input into what the IGC is actually going to discuss and decide."
"I fear that not doing this will damage Parliament's reputation and standing, and will not be as helpful to the IGC as it could be."
"- (EL) The citizens of Europe, especially workers, farmers, small and medium-sized enterprises, women, the young, the nouveaux pauvres, all those who suffer under the policies of the EU, are already voicing their anger and disagreement, some more forcefully than others, with the choices being made by the European Union."
"Unfortunately, instead of heeding the anxiety and supporting the claims of all these classes of society, the resolution on the Intergovernmental Conference kow-tows to capitalist forces and adopts the decisions made by the monopolies to militarise Europe and intervene in third countries, including militarily, in order to limit further still the national independence and the grass-roots sovereignty of individual countries."
"With the Single European Act and the Treaties of Maastricht and Amsterdam, the ÅU is now beginning, under the pressure of enlargement and the new order, to address issues which it was unable to solve at previous intergovernmental conferences."
"Despite proclamations to the contrary, what we have before us is an integrated plan of attack by capitalist forces on the democratic, social, collective and personal rights and freedoms which workers have fought hard to acquire within the context of bourgeois democracy."
"The European Union is being used by imperialists and multinationals as a battering ram to break the people' s resistance and make them give up their fight for a better tomorrow."
"The efforts being made, supposedly in the name of democracy and the ""effectiveness of the institutions"" , seek mainly to serve the interests of monopolies and they will inevitably be opposed by the workers and people of Europe."
"What is the implication behind generalising the majority voting rule by introducing majority voting, in terms of both the number of States and the number of EU citizens, if not complete indifference to, and degradation of, the interests of the ""smaller"" countries, of the less developed regions, of the weaker classes of society and of the working and grass-roots classes of the EU in general?"
"How else are we to interpret the abolition of a country' s right of veto when its vital national interests are at stake?"
"What is the point of rotating Commissioners' nationalities and not rotating the presidency of the Union if not to exile a supposedly small country from the centre of power for long periods of time so that it is basically unable to defend its interests and the interests of its people, insofar as they can be defended within the framework of the European Union?"
"What is the point of limiting the number of MEPs, despite the increase in the number of Member States of the European Union, if not to silence those voices which criticise capitalist forces and their plans and promote political processes which brook no alternatives and which are confined to vapid changes of power which pose no threat to capitalism?"
"Why is the role of national parliaments being eroded by substantially limiting democratic scrutiny?"
"Why is the weighting of votes in the Council being changed for the benefit of the large countries, at the expense of smaller countries?"
"There is only one conclusion to be drawn from the EP resolution, which the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece will be voting against, and from the Commission' s recent proposals."
"The people of Europe can once again expect no good to come out of this Intergovernmental Conference."
"They alone can defend their rights by conducting their own fights, fights which the EU will face in ever more acute form, ever more dynamic form, despite all its efforts to mislead, pull the wool over everyone' s eyes and sugar the pill."
"Fights which will lead to coordinated action by the peoples of the EU, to a strong, pan-European, grass-roots front opposed to the EU and its policies and fighting for a different sort of Europe free from rulers, exploitation and war."
"The institutional changes envisaged with a view to the enlargement of Europe, whether relating to the composition of the Commission, the weighting of the representation of the Member States or qualified majority voting, do not answer the basic questions we face ten years after the fall of the Berlin Wall about the kind of Europe we live in."
"European Union policy detaches the most developed regions from any sense of solidarity, accelerating the break up of multinational federations."
"It imposes forced privatisation."
"Above all, it leads to the policy of a pyromaniac fireman in the Balkans, where all the political, social and environmental consequences still have to be reckoned up."
"The stability plan for South-East Europe is a failure: the declarations of loyalty to NATO by the governments of Eastern Europe do not prevent the European Union treating them with contempt and imposing anti-social policies on them."
"We must build a Europe capable of enlarging towards the East and the South, to all peoples who democratically express the wish to join."
"A genuine public debate, involving all the peoples in drawing up a charter of rights and a common plan for society, would allow us to make progress towards that."
"That is why we have voted against this report."
"I am sorry I could not vote in favour of the report which contains the European Parliament' s proposals for the Intergovernmental Conference, despite the efforts made, especially by the rapporteur, Mr Dimitrakopoulos, to humour small Member States and look after their interests to some extent."
"It is inadmissible to seek to cut the smallest national delegation, the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg' s, by a third, without giving any details about reductions to the large delegations."
"There are other excesses in this veritable shopping list. I denounced them yesterday in my speech and Parliament has adopted them, in particular as regards the composition of the Commission and the decision-making procedures."
"Unanimity cannot be limited to constitutional decisions."
"It is completely unrealistic and utopian to think that the members of national parliaments will ratify a treaty which contains such dismantling of their rights, as useless as it is unacceptable, and such a veritable castration of the national parliaments."
"The Intergovernmental Conference is not intended to increase the powers of the Union; the point of the operation is to improve the functioning of a Union enlarged from 15 to 26 or even 30 Member States."
"Through these excesses a majority of this Parliament has done Europe a disservice."
", in writing."
"(SV) The Intergovernmental Conference is an historic opportunity for Member States to transform the EU into a democratic, open and efficient organisation, which is why we regret that the governments of the Member States do not have the political will to carry out an in-depth reform of the Union."
"We therefore welcome the fact that Parliament wishes to accept the challenge to reform the Union along these lines, but we wish to clarify our position as follows."
"A Union of 25 to 30 Member States cannot operate in the same way as a Union of 15 Member States. Instead, we need both an overview of the institutions' working methods and a clearer distribution of labour between the Member States and the EU."
"The EU can only function efficiently and democratically if it deals exclusively with cross-border issues and leaves other issues to be resolved mainly at national level."
"The difficulty for the Intergovernmental Conference is to find a delicate balance between the desire to create an efficient and democratic Union and the need, at the same time, to reflect the historic balance of power between small and large Member States. In other words, it must be borne in mind that the EU is a Union of both peoples and States."
"On this basis, we think it is important for the present Intergovernmental Conference to establish the size of the Commission at one Commissioner per Member State."
"With regard to the distribution of power in the Council, the Commission has proposed a system of 'double simple majority' voting on certain questions. This means that a majority is required from the Member States, but also that these States should represent a majority of the citizens if a decision is to be implemented."
"This is important from a democratic perspective in view of the fact that, in this way, the voting clearly reflects the will of the people."
"The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party supports the Commission' s proposal but would emphasise that small countries should not be placed at a disadvantage."
"Parliament ought to have 700 seats, distributed among the population on the basis of a degressive proportional scale."
"We are well disposed towards trying out a new system involving European lists, which means that elections for a limited number of the 700 seats could take place within the context of a single constituency."
"We are aware of the fact that European parties at present have little support among our citizens, but we believe that a supplementary system involving European lists would, in time, lead to an increased European identity."
"An EU of approximately 25-30 Member States will lead to more countries wanting to exploit the opportunity that exists for a number of them to go further than others in certain areas of policy (so-called closer cooperation)."
"We do not think it is appropriate to see this as a permanent solution to the problem which will arise when the EU is enlarged."
"The risk entailed in a Europe 'à la carte' is that the whole integrity and basic idea of EU cooperation will be lost."
"The solidarity between cooperating States would be in danger of becoming fragmented, something which might have very undesirable consequences for the Union as such."
"Flexibility of this kind ought to be seen, rather, as a temporary alternative for countries which are not yet ready, or sufficiently well prepared, to enter into deeper cooperation."
"The wording in the Treaty of Amsterdam about closer cooperation is therefore an adequate and acceptable solution."
"Too many parallel concentric circles create a system which is difficult to supervise."
"The Union' s common objectives should be promoted within the context of such cooperation, and no Member State should be excluded from participating."
"We welcome the EU' s increased opportunities to pursue a credible foreign and security policy so that the EU can assume increased responsibility when it comes to solving conflicts in the vicinity of the EU."
"At the same time, we would emphasise that this development ought not to lead to our having two parallel and competing organisations for resolving conflicts."
"It is therefore important to emphasise that the development concerned must take place in the context of close cooperation between NATO and the EU and that representatives of these organisations must sit down together as soon as possible and agree upon a satisfactory distribution of labour."
"- (PT) Once again, the European Parliament finds itself compelled to adopt a maximalist position on the institutions, a position bereft of any realism."
"As usual, it is going all out for an unfettered federalist approach."
"This is reflected in the proposal to almost totally eliminate the unanimity rule, to make the codecision process the norm, to institutionalise the European political parties, to create a European electoral club, to integrate the Western European Union, to strengthen Europol, and, to constitutionalise the Treaties in a far-reaching way."
"These are ideas from which we have always unequivocally distanced ourselves and will continue to do so."
"However, this report also proposes new and unacceptable ideas."
"On the pretext that it is necessary to adapt the institutions to the prospect of enlargement, it is now being suggested that there should be a disproportionate strengthening at various levels of the decision-making powers of the large countries and an intolerable reduction of the decision-making powers of the small- and medium-sized countries. All this suggests and implicitly encourages the creation of political inner cabinets, which are totally unacceptable, and which will make it easier to achieve 'enhanced cooperation' ."
"We are, of course, opposed to such ideas."
"At the same time, if the European Parliament approves a report like this, it will appear to be indifferent to situations which are obviously urgent, such as the need to overcome or at least mitigate serious democratic deficits; the need to modify the monetarist principles - in particular the Stability Pact - which are the root cause of today' s social scourges such as unemployment and unstable employment; to change the Statute of the European Central Bank so as to ensure greater transparency and appropriate controls and limits on its powers; and to make the existing principle of economic and social cohesion a reality, which is a vital step in creating a Europe of the future based on solidarity."
"The European Parliament could demonstrate its worth by adopting these policies."
"But if it opts for the proposals contained in the Dimitrakopoulos-Leinen report, this will suggest that it is becoming increasingly remote from the people it is supposed to represent."
"We will therefore be voting against the report."
"- The complexity of the IGC process inevitably requires a complex response from the European Parliament."
"The Dimitrakopoulos/Leinen report covers a wide range of issues which could be considered in the framework of the IGC which is taking place over the remainder of 2000."
"The debate which has begun between Member States is reflected in the points of view expressed within the European Parliament, as is the tension over the scope of the IGC."
"The European Parliamentary Labour Party believes that it is imperative to conclude the IGC before the end of 2000 in order to leave the EU fully prepared for enlargement."
"In order to achieve this, we believe that the scope of the IGC should be restricted to ""tidying up"" the outstanding points from Amsterdam, plus a small range of other issues."
"EPLP Members voted in accordance with this approach, reflecting our concerns over the following areas:"
"There are doubts over the practicability of a European top-up list from 2009 of 10% of MEPs to be elected on a single European constituency."
"We have concerns over the workings of a European Public Prosecutor's office whilst being concerned to protect the Union's interests and resources against fraud throughout Community territory."
"Likewise, the legislative measures in criminal matters in respect of fraud damaging the interests of the Union will need to be carefully constructed."
"The EPLP believes that unanimity cannot solely be restricted to constitutional items, as issues including tax and social security must be dealt with at national level."
"Constitutionalising the Treaties and division into two parts is not acceptable to the EPLP, and the same concerns about unanimity apply here."
"The EPLP wishes to see a Charter of Fundamental Rights, but until the content of the Charter is determined, the question of giving it binding legal force should be left open."
"Whilst greater coordination is required at European level over our airspace (i.e. Eurocontrol), service provision should remain at national level - the Commission has never suggested a single agency and Eurocontrol already exists to coordinate."
"The Commission has not previously called for the establishment of a single European air traffic control agency and the request in this report is superfluous."
"- (SV) As representatives of the Swedish Christian Democrats, who view enlargement towards the East as being clearly the most important issue for the EU, I wish to make the following remarks before the Heads of Government and State discuss the European Union' s powers and forms of decision making at the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference."
"1) There ought to be one Commissioner per Member State (paragraph 10)."
"This is about the Commission' s legitimacy and future and about its being able to claim popular support."
"2) There ought to be at least six Members of the European Parliament per Member State and, thereafter, a degressive proportional system as at present (paragraph 3.2) and not, as the Committee on Constitutional Affairs proposes, only four Members per State, followed by a strict proportional system."
"This is required if it is to be possible to mirror the political breadth and diversity in each Member State."
"3) There ought not to be any pan-European lists or single European constituency (paragraph 4)."
"So as not to make the distance between electors and elected representatives still greater, the Member States should remain as constituencies."
"4) 700 should not be set as the upper ceiling for the number of Members of the European Parliament (paragraph 3). Instead, a certain flexibility should be possible, depending upon the number of Member States in the EU."
"5) No EU financing of parties which operate at European level should be introduced, nor should any democratically dangerous and arbitrary suspension procedure (paragraph 6)."
"6) Decisions by qualified majority voting in the Council should not be taken on the basis of a simple majority from the Member States."
"Instead, it ought to be a two-thirds majority (paragraph 8), and this in order to win legitimacy."
"7) A decision as serious as that of suspending a Member State from the EU should require the unanimous agreement of the other Member States and not, as proposed by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, the agreement of four-fifths of the Member States (paragraph 29)."
"8) Social protection should not be regarded as an issue of Community interest (paragraph 42). In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, this ought instead to remain an issue to be legislated on at national level."
"9) The financing of the EU should not be completely independent of contributions by the Member States (paragraph 44.4)."
"10) Respect for neutral States' solutions in the field of defence policy and for their right to make their own decisions should be clearly upheld within the framework of the CFSP (paragraph 34)."
"11) To make it easier for citizens of the Member States to know which institutions are responsible for what, the principle of subsidiarity (to which there are unfortunately no references at all in this report) should be integrated into the Treaty in such a way that the EU' s powers are concentrated upon clearly defined, cross-border core issues."
"The national parliaments and local authorities should play an important role by ensuring that the principle of subsidiarity is respected and by monitoring governments' action in the Council."
"- (SV) When the European Parliament today stated its position on the Intergovernmental Conference, I advocated solutions which also provide for the interests of the small Member States."
"The trend within Parliament towards less understanding of smaller countries' needs will increase the antagonism between Parliament and the Council of Ministers."
"I am concerned that there is no desire to find a balanced solution regarding the weighting of votes within the Council of Ministers and regarding the number of Commissioners who should provide for the interests of both large and small Member States."
"Through my Group, I have tabled an amendment aimed at guaranteeing that all of a particular country' s nationalities and regions are represented in Parliament."
"I also supported the proposal which emphasised the right of regional ministers to participate in meetings of the Council of Ministers on matters which fall within the scope of their autonomy."
"However, I would express my satisfaction at the fact that so much attention has been devoted to the way in which the EC Court of Justice operates."
"The Intergovernmental Conference must now give consideration to Parliament' s constructive proposals."
"I am extremely surprised at the proposals which would give Members of the European Parliament the right to participate in the appointment of the judges."
"Finland supports the proposal that the Commission might be given a mandate to conduct trade negotiations in regard to services and immaterial rights following decisions in the Council with a qualified majority."
"When the Council in this way reaches a decision about a negotiation mandate, Parliament' s consent ought to be requested."
"Otherwise, there will be a loss of democratic and parliamentary control over the trade negotiations."
"Since I do not consider the report to be in earnest with regard to the demands for decision making in the Council, to the way in which judges are to be appointed and to the number of Members of Parliament, I voted against the report in the final vote (238 votes in favour, 147 votes against and 73 abstentions)."
"Because the report is far-reaching in its scope and because there is considerable disagreement about it, Parliament' s point of view will be of little significance."
"That concludes the vote."
"(The sitting was suspended at 2.02 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"I would just like to ask whether Mr Berlusconi' s name was included by mistake in the attendance register in the Minutes of yesterday' s sitting."
"I do not remember Mr Berlusconi being present."
"Mr Frassoni, the department responsible will, of course, check up on this in the simplest way: we will ask Mr Berlusconi or his assistants directly whether he was present yesterday."
"Mr President, with reference to Mr Frassoni' s intervention, we sent a letter to President Fontaine this morning."
"We, too, would like to know how Mr Berlusconi, who is tied up in an electoral campaign in Italy, came to be included on the attendance list; we would like to know the identity of the joker who played this trick, which is in appallingly bad taste, or whether there is something going on which has nothing to do with politics."
"We therefore asked the President of the Parliament, Mrs Fontaine, to carry out an internal enquiry, which we hope will take place during the mini part-session at the beginning of May."
"This is certainly a most regrettable incident, Mr Fiori, and I hope that the internal enquiry will shed some light on the matter."
"Topical and Urgent Debate"
"The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance."
"Iraq"
"Mr President, it is very important to point out that sanctions are themselves a form of warfare."
"They are targeted at the most innocent civilians, at the innocent people in societies, especially children, the most vulnerable."
"The sanctions on Iraq have become a weapon of mass destruction against the helpless people there."
"Over 200 children die there every single day."
"This is not acceptable."
"We cannot allow this to go on."
"Denis Halliday, who resigned his position as Director of the UN Humanitarian Mission in Iraq in protest at the sanctions, confirmed the UNICEF statistics that 5 000 to 6 000 children die every month as a direct result of sanctions."
"Mary Robinson, the High Commissioner for Human Rights, has been speaking out against sanctions for a long time."
"She said you cannot expect her to condemn human rights abuses in other parts of the world and let the United Nations itself be responsible for what is happening in Iraq following the sanctions."
"In February Mr Hans von Sponek, the United Nations humanitarian coordinator in Iraq, followed in the steps of Mr Halliday when he also resigned in protest at the on-going sanctions and the bombing of the Iraqi people."
"Within hours of his resignation, the head of the World Food Programme in Iraq since January 1999 also resigned in protest at the sanctions."
"These resignations must cause the world community to reconsider the justification for the continuing sanctions policy and also the bombings."
"I would like to point out that 70 Congressmen sent a letter to Bill Clinton in the United States asking him to lift the embargo, asking him to de-link economic sanctions from the military sanctions that are currently in place in Iraq."
"It is not just here in Europe that people are concerned, but right across the world."
"If anyone looked at the very good documentary by the world-famous journalist, John Pilger, they would see what is happening there."
"Can we allow this to go on without saying something about it?"
"It is a blatant violation of international human rights laws."
"The sanctions are targeting the most vulnerable in society and making them suffer yet, at the same time, the elite in that society and the people who are part of the Saddam Hussein regime do not suffer from the sanctions."
"It is the ordinary people who suffer."
"We cannot allow this to go on."
"It is not right and the US Congressmen who sent the letter to Bill Clinton are quite right: we have to de-link economic sanctions from the military sanctions that are currently in place."
"We also have to address the bombings that are taking place without any UN mandate."
"That is absolutely unacceptable."
"A whole family was wiped out by these bombings, as shown in Mr Pilger's documentary."
"This is something we cannot ignore and we must push for an end to this inhumane policy."
"Mr President, firstly let me say to my colleague and friend, Ms McKenna, that there is nothing in what she said that I do not agree with."
"No Member of this House can remain unmoved by the harrowing situation in which so many Iraqi people find themselves."
"The facts have been presented by respected international bodies such as UNICEF."
"We have no reason whatsoever to doubt their veracity."
"There are shortages of essential foodstuffs and agricultural infrastructure resulting in severe nutritional deficiencies."
"Iraq, once one of the most economically advanced countries of the region, is being reduced to underdevelopment."
"But let there be no illusion as to the role of the Iraqi regime in the suffering of its people."
"The consistent refusal by the regime to fully implement United Nations resolutions has led to a situation where the sanctions remain firmly in place almost ten years after the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq."
"Furthermore, the refusal of the regime for five years to accept the oil-for-food programme has certainly contributed to the humanitarian situation."
"We, in Parliament, are well-intentioned towards the people of Iraq and are serious in our desire for a peaceful and lasting solution."
"We must concentrate our efforts on convincing Iraq to implement the United Nations resolutions."
"We must make it very clear in this forum that United Nations resolutions are legally binding on all members of the United Nations."
"The European Parliament must not be seen to undermine the legitimacy of such resolutions in any way."
"Any such action would be grist to the propaganda mill of the Iraqi regime."
"It is within the power of the regime to have the sanctions imposed by the United Nations lifted."
"To date, the regime most regrettably has preferred to allow its people to be threatened by disease and starvation than to respect international law."
"Full implementation of Resolution 1284 obliges Iraq, among other things, to cooperate with the Red Cross in overseeing the repatriation of detainees."
"Let us recall that last January this House voted unanimously a resolution calling on Iraq, as a minimum, to provide answers to the Red Cross as to the whereabouts of the missing Kuwaitis for which there is documented evidence."
"I too have met some of these people."
"I have shared their suffering with them."
"Let us clearly understand that is a tragedy in itself."
"We are caught between a rock and a hard place."
"It is heartbreaking to see innocent children being sacrificed by their own leaders for purely personal, political motives."
"Mr President, during these last few days, Parliament has been watching an extraordinarily powerful documentary on the effects of the sanctions on Iraq, and I would like to thank Patricia McKenna for this."
"Civilians, men, women and children are dying because of the sanctions."
"I will not repeat the figures, for we are all aware of them and they have been quoted many times in this Chamber."
"But what a contradiction. What a tragedy."
"In the name of the protection of human rights, the rich, powerful countries of the West are killing communities and starving them to death."
"During the war in Yugoslavia, American aircraft continuously bombarded towns, killing civilians."
"It is better to tell the truth and admit that the interests of the United States take precedence over those of communities."
"Today, we are going to vote on a motion, a very important motion for a resolution calling for an end to the sanctions, an end to the embargo."
"I feel that we must then act in order to give practical effect to our resolution."
"There is no doubt about the fact that it is important for Iraq to change its policy and that the existing arms must be monitored and decommissioned, but, in this regard, there is abundant documented evidence that the nuclear and chemical weapons have already been decommissioned."
"And that is essential."
"However, I also feel that a clear policy must be developed for the decommissioning of nuclear weapons where they exist in the Middle East."
"For example, Israel is full of nuclear weapons and no one is asking Israel to decommission."
"Unfortunately, even the resolution called for by Egypt was not supported by the European Parliament in Cairo."
"We must do everything possible to free this world from the nuclear threat."
"Today, I would also like to pay tribute to Dennis Halliday - mentioned by Ms McKenna as well - who was responsible for the oil-for-food deal."
"In a world of hypocrites and careerists, Dennis Halliday had the courage to speak out over the implications of the sanctions on the Iraqi people and to condemn the lies of the United States departments."
"Saddam Hussein is certainly responsible and guilty, but we are also incurring a great deal of responsibility and guilt in continuing with a policy which maintains the population of a country in extreme poverty, a population such as the Iraqi people, with a rich history and culture, a population made up of people, women, children, who want to live."
"I hope that when the embargo imposed on Iraq is lifted, this will be the end of all embargoes everywhere throughout the world."
"This is important for all of us."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, here we are debating a tragic issue - a source of shame to all of us - and Mr Ford is not here. Not one of Parliament' s noble spirits is here, and yet the sanctions against Iraq are already ten years old, ten years!"
"People think the war, the missiles and the gassings are over, but the filthy effects of this war, which was never clean, go on."
"There is still bombing in the North and in the South."
"Cornfields are being burned in a country which invented agriculture; date palms are being burned daily."
"In the Strasbourg newspaper yesterday, there was an interview with a priest who risked his life just to go to the Babylon area, in Ur."
"For people who go there, taking ambulances and medicines, like me and the National Front, Iraq is a vast concentration camp."
"18 million women, children, old people, men, a whole Arab people, are being held captive in their own country by the West, with millions of deaths every day, hundreds of children dying, a systematic, scientific, meticulous, planned, cynical, perverse genocide."
"It is not just their bodies which are under attack by being deprived of food, milk, meat and fruit."
"Their minds are under attack as well."
"There are no books. Even pencils are banned, on the pretext that their graphite could be used as coolant in the nuclear power stations."
"There are schools but there is no paper."
"There are doctors, but there is no medicine."
"There are hospitals, but there is nothing inside them."
"It is perverse."
"They were promised food in exchange for oil."
"But they are asked to practically give their oil away and then buy food."
"Ladies and gentlemen - especially Members who are not here - by what right is this happening?"
"Do not keep silent!"
"Do not be accomplices!"
"UN officials are resigning."
"We should not have to go there in thirty years time, like the Belgians in Rwanda, and say sorry, or like the Holy Father, who is prostrating himself all over the place."
"The honour of Europe depends on our speaking out for these young Arabs, for this great people being consigned to the night."
"It is all very well being afraid of imaginary dangers in Vienna, but it is in Baghdad that the violation of human rights is taking place."
"Let Washington' s Nebuchadnezzar let these people go, these slaves in their own country."
"They must be released from this poverty."
"I appeal to your consciences!"
"Europe is denying itself!"
"Just as people kept silent about Spain in 1936, just as people kept silent about the camps, they are keeping silent about Iraq."
"There is no time to lose; this people could cease to exist."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to act quickly."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament will shortly be voting on a joint resolution and that is certainly not just because we are determined to have a clear conscience and actually condemn the perpetuation of sanctions which have never achieved their goals, as everyone agrees."
"It is also because we think there is a real possibility of preventing a new risk of military force being unleashed there, given the experience of our colleague, Mr Buttiglione, who has been to Iraq and has alerted us to the fact that there is currently a significant risk of renewed bombing."
"He had the opportunity of meeting representatives of the Iraqi government, from whom he was able to obtain a commitment to respect the United Nations resolutions."
"So he undertook to ensure that Parliament would send a strong signal to the Iraqi people, given that its government agrees to implement the United Nations resolutions."
"We have committed ourselves to ask for the immediate lifting of sanctions."
"That is the purpose of this joint resolution and all the groups have agreed that, to show Parliament' s unanimity on this distressing issue, there should definitely be no amendments."
"Mr President, I can only endorse the speeches that have just been made, especially Mr Morillon' s."
"We certainly cannot continue to accept this situation."
"But we can feel gratified that we are voting in Parliament today on a resolution on the situation in Iraq which has, for the first time - and I hope we will take advantage of this to change our style a bit - won the approval of almost all the political groups."
"That unanimity is reassuring, because all the signatories to this resolution are in agreement on the essential point. That has happened because we all now know that the essential point is a certain concept of humanity, relations between peoples, values - in short, civilisation, the heart of Europe' s identity."
"Mr President, this resolution clearly calls for respect for the UN resolutions, especially Resolutions 687, 688 and 1293, and also Resolution 1284 on which we are seeking clarification."
"I would mention, too, that only two members of the Security Council voted for it, against the advice of the three other members who abstained."
"Mr President, this does not mean we are releasing the Iraqi regime from its responsibilities and obligations."
"It means that, for the first time, the international community is being asked to show consistency with its own principles, because the various UN committees agree that these resolutions have been virtually all applied by the Iraqi regime, except for some minor points of interpretation or detail."
"And here I differ slightly from Mr Collins."
"The fact is the discrepancies between Iraq and the international community do not justify maintaining the embargo."
"Remember, the Iraqi people are innocent."
"But it is they and not their rulers, who were never democratically elected, who are now paying the price of these sanctions in human lives."
"Mr Hans von Sponek, the former head of the UN Oil for Food Programme, mentioned by Ms McKenna just now, said that, as a human being, with a heart and a soul, he could no longer tolerate what he was seeing in Iraq."
"He decided to resign."
"The disproportion between the constantly reiterated demands of certain members of the Security Council for the sanctions to be ruthlessly maintained and their consequences for the Iraqi people is - I am weighing my words - truly terrifying!"
"UNICEF estimates that half a million children have died as a result of nine years of sanctions, to the utter indifference of the civilised world."
"It must be remembered that the rules of war involve respect for civilians."
"The right of coercion over populations - it must also be remembered - should not lead to the right to starve them."
"That is also one of the great principles of Western civilisation!"
"Mr President, our resolution is very consistent."
"It calls for respect for all the UN resolutions first and foremost, clarification of Resolution 1284 and, consequently, the lifting of sanctions and constant vigilance against the Iraqi regime, respect by all for the rules of the UN Charter, including the members of the Security Council who are carrying out military action contrary to international law and, finally, the search for a global political solution."
"Mr President, that is the only way dictatorships can really be weakened and concord between all the peoples of the region promoted."
"For once, Europe must speak with a European voice!"
"Mr President, Mr Morillon has already explained my Group' s position, which is in favour of this joint resolution."
"For my part, I would refer to the procedure which seems to me in this case to be important."
"This is a debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance, which has been devalued insofar as we are not getting a declaration from the Council, as Parliament had requested, on including this point as a Council declaration."
"I would like to say that, without presenting any valid argument, this attitude on the part of the Council seems to me to show a lack of respect towards Parliament, especially when Parliament offers the Council the opportunity to make any declaration on any subject, as laid down in Rule 37."
"It is truly contradictory that this Parliament cannot obtain a Council declaration on an issue as sensitive as this."
"Therefore, Mr President, I would like to say that my Group intends to ask the Committee on External Affairs, at its next meeting, to present, pursuant to Rule 42, an oral question to the Council so that the Council will reply."
"If this initiative is not successful, my political group will present, pursuant to the same article, an oral question to the Council so that the Council really takes seriously the worries and concerns of this Parliament and really does what is laid down in the Treaties, that is to say, to inform and cooperate with Parliament in all those areas which affect and concern the citizens of the European Union."
"Mr Salafranca, you and those who are of the same opinion as yourself could also make the Conference of Presidents aware of your views."
"The Conference of Presidents is shortly to meet here in Strasbourg in order to establish the programme for the forthcoming part-sessions, and it could issue a request along the lines that you have suggested."
"Mr President, I am as concerned as anybody in this House about the suffering of the people of Iraq as the result of sanctions but also of the actions of their own government."
"We should all remember that sanctions are sometimes better than the alternatives that we may have to consider."
"If we are to support this resolution then Iraq must most definitely honour its obligations under all the United Nations resolutions."
"We, as a Parliament, must stand by our resolution of January this year, calling for the release of all Kuwaitis and other non-Iraqi nationals who are still imprisoned in Iraq."
"I had the opportunity to visit Iraq last month."
"I met the families of the Kuwaiti prisoners."
"I can tell you that fathers do not forget their sons, brothers do not forget their brothers, children do not forget their fathers; nor should this House."
"We should remind Saddam Hussein that he must honour his obligations to the international community and we shall then honour our obligations to Iraq."
"Mr President, the Commission shares the concern expressed during this debate."
"It regrets Iraq' s decision not to accept United Nations Security Council Resolution 1284."
"As Mr Collins and Mr Morillon in particular have pointed out, this decision delays the application of the new instrument of control and hence the relaxation of sanctions."
"We think the Oil for Food Programme is still the best short-term solution to ease the suffering of the Iraqi population, and the Iraqi government should reverse its policy of non-cooperation and comply with all the United Nations Security Council resolutions, as has been said."
"Since the Gulf War, the Community has been the principal source of humanitarian aid to Iraq, with at least EUR 240 million provided to reduce the considerable sufferings of the Iraqi people."
"And we could have done even more if the Iraqi government had not imposed restrictions on the activities of non-governmental organisations, hindering the delivery of humanitarian aid in Iraq."
"Given the situation we cannot pretend that humanitarian aid can do any more than alleviate some of the effects of this awful economic and human situation in the short term."
"The economic situation in Iraq can only improve as economic activity develops after sanctions are lifted. This involves engaging the Iraqi government, perhaps more than we are doing today, in a dialogue on the implementation of the Security Council resolutions."
"In this regard, we agree with the draft resolution."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place this afternoon at 5.30 p.m."
"Chechnya"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"(B5-350/2000) by Mr Markov, Mr Vinci, Mr Papayannakis and Mrs Ainardi, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on Chechnya;"
"(B5-0363/2000) by Mrs Malmström, Mr Haarder, Mr Maaten and Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on Chechnya;"
"(B5-0366/2000) by Mr Oostlander and Mr Posselt, on behalf of the PPE­DE Group, on Chechnya;"
"(B5-0375/2000) by Mr Sakellariou and Mrs Krehl, on behalf of the PSE Group, on Chechnya;"
"(B5-0387/2000) by Mrs Schroedter, Mr Cohn-Bendit and Mr Gahrton, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on the armed conflict in the Republic of Chechnya."
"Mr President, Parliament has been dealing with the situation in and around Chechnya for some time."
"We have followed with concern developments in the fundamentalist Islamic forces' attempts to split Chechnya away from the Russian Federation."
"We are categorically opposed to any form of terrorism and we support the fight against terrorism in every country in the world."
"I believe that the territorial integrity and sovereignty of every country is an inviolable and fundamental principle."
"However, for several months a war has been raging in Chechnya which none of these arguments can justify."
"I spent over six years of my life in Russia and have very close ties with that country."
"So I feel it all the more that Russia is totally overreacting in its use of military force in the Chechen conflict."
"I find it totally unacceptable that we are witnessing violations of international humanitarian law by the Russian army."
"It is a matter of deep regret and profound concern to me that militaristic thinking has now again taken hold in Russia."
"It has long been recognised that military might never permanently resolves any conflict, and this needs to be remembered now."
"It is high time that this war ended and that a political solution to this conflict was found, no matter how difficult and complicated that might be."
"Furthermore, an enormous effort is required to restore this devastated region for the people who have lost all their possessions in the war and to make it habitable once again."
"In the long term, this is the only way to remove this focus of conflict."
"My Group supports this motion for a resolution, and we consider it essential that this Parliament, in conjunction with the members of the Russian Duma, should seek means of restoring peace in Chechnya without delay."
"Mr President, ten days ago, the UN' s Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, returned home from a visit to Russia where she was to investigate the situation in Chechnya in regard to human rights abuses."
"Mary Robinson obtained limited access."
"She was not allowed to meet the Russian President and was treated in a most humiliating way."
"In her report to the UN' s session on human rights in Geneva, Mrs Robinson reported on individual testimonies concerning very serious crimes which had been committed in Chechnya."
"The witnesses she had met had told of murders of civilians, summary trials, executions, rapes, torture and kidnappings."
"Domestic affairs can never be pleaded as an excuse for atrocities of this kind."
"We have a global responsibility to defend basic rights."
"Abuses of these cannot - must not - be seen as internal matters."
"The UN' s High Commissioner must continue to be supported in his work."
"The European Parliament has, on a number of occasions, expressed concern about the situation in Chechnya."
"We support the Council of Europe' s decision of last week to suspend Russia if no appropriate measures are taken."
"For a liberal, considerations of trade and short-term benefits cannot come before the defence of human rights."
"We would therefore react vigorously to these atrocities, but we also see it as very important to cooperate with democratic forces in Russia and with the new government."
"We therefore hope that we can organise a joint delegation from the European Parliament and the Russian Duma to travel to Chechnya and, there on the spot, engage in discussions, conduct investigations and bring about a dialogue."
"We presume that Russia will be of assistance and allow the delegation to travel freely."
"We also hope that the EU can eventually contribute to a reconstruction programme in the region."
"Mr President, what has happened in the war in Chechnya has shocked us all."
"A guerrilla war is being fought without the civilian population being spared, in fact, the civilian population is also suffering the dreadful atrocities that can occur in wartime."
"The first war in Chechnya may have evoked sympathy from us as a battle for autonomy and independence and setting things right in their own territory, but we now have to say that, although this war really ended quite well for the Chechens, the intervening period was not used to best advantage and Chechnya became a country of complete chaos, where kidnapping was commonplace and where the citizens were no longer safe."
"At one stage, Chechen generals even invaded Dagestan, an action which merited absolutely no sympathy whatsoever."
"This illustrates that there are various movements within Chechnya."
"On the one hand, there are the military who tend to play the Afghan card or count on Iran for support."
"The other two groupings seek more of a political solution."
"One of them is seeking a solution more in terms of what we in Western Europe would also wish to achieve and the other is again seeking to strengthen relations with Russia."
"Mr President, the President of Chechnya has limited control over the troops in his country."
"We are pleased to hear that Maskadov does not support the actions of his military."
"We are also delighted to hear that the Russians are at long last admitting to the fact that Mr Putin is contacting the Chechen authorities indirectly."
"We have also noted hat the Council of Europe has adopted a position in this regard."
"We know from the Russian delegation that was here until yesterday that this has hit them exceptionally hard and we spoke about it with them in detail."
"We have also heard that there is the possibility of a joint parliamentary delegation undertaking a fact-finding mission on an ad hoc basis under the best possible conditions with a view to looking around the territory of Chechnya wherever it sees fit to do so."
"A mission of this kind must take place soon and I believe it is important that in the resolution tabled on the basis of the liberal text, an amendment is included to this effect."
"Mr President, we support an exceptionally brief resolution in that regard, perhaps even the briefest ever made in this House, consisting of the first two recitals of the liberal resolution, followed by the recital in which the decisions of the Council of Europe are mentioned."
"We shall vote against Article 1 because once again it involves support for this statement and we could substitute a better statement of our own."
"We shall willingly support Article 2 of the liberal resolution and then Amendment No 2 as well which refers to the joint parliamentary delegation which may be more useful in the future, because it is the future that we must concern ourselves with here."
"The delegation will have to examine what can be done to preserve the defence of human rights in the region, but also examine what we can do in the future to help Chechnya become a democratic constitutional state."
"Who knows whether with help from the European Union and Russia, a Stability Pact for the Caucasus region can ever be achieved."
"Mr President, for these reasons we support this resolution, which initially was not to our liking, but which, at the moment, provides the best basis for a statement from this House."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not want to repeat what the three previous speakers have said, with which I totally concur."
"In addition, my colleague, Mr Swoboda, will also say a few words about the reasons behind this war.There is a very broad consensus within this Parliament condemning both the war against civilians in Chechnya and the terrorism which started in Chechnya, and this same consensus applies to the desire to maintain good and special relations with Russia."
"On the other hand, we are determined not simply to stand by and watch whilst Russia violates one international convention after another in this war in Chechnya."
"We support the proposal from Mr Lukin, the Co-President of the Interparliamentary Delegation of the European Parliament and Russian Duma to send a fact-finding mission to Chechnya to gather information on the ground."
"We want to make use of this information at a later stage, that is after the delegation has returned, as the basis for a major debate in this House, involving the Council and the Commission, and leading to the adoption of a really well founded resolution."
"For this reason and this reason alone we, the Group of the Party of European Socialists, urge you not to adopt a motion for a resolution today - which would in fact bring the total to seven - and instead wait until we have the information we need for an in-depth debate resulting in a joint resolution."
"Mr President, firstly I would like to say that, through political pragmatism and through loyalty to the work that we do with the other groups in this House, we will support a joint resolution which basically supports the decision of the Council of Europe and the sending of a joint delegation from the Duma and the European Parliament."
"We must also say that we do not share this kind of silence on the part of the European Parliament which is spreading to all these issues like a low mist which obscures everything."
"We have even noted that the Council of Europe itself is showing more courage than this Parliament."
"What has happened in Chechnya is shameful, the crushing of a whole people, and it is also shameful that this House has had to listen to 'Mr CFSP' talking about issues such as 'the proportionate use of force' or recommending that the Russian authorities lessen the intensity of the conflict."
"What is a proportionate use of force in a case such as Chechnya?"
"What proportion are we talking about?"
"This is unacceptable."
"What is meant by lessening the intensity of the conflict in Chechnya?"
"Perhaps stopping the massacre of women and children?"
"Perhaps stopping the bombing of hospitals?"
"Please explain this to us."
"Of course, we still believe that there is sufficient reason to suspend the partnership and cooperation agreement on the basis of the human rights clause."
"I would like to end by saying that I fully agree with what Mr Cohn-Bendit said in this House: in this Europe and this World which we want to build, let us have no more masking of attacks on entire peoples on the grounds of their being internal matters."
"There is no such thing as internal affairs in this world we want to build."
"Either we have human rights or we do not have human rights."
"Mr President, our Group firmly supports the short resolution tabled by the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, which largely goes back to a proposal on our part, because we want to see threefold solidarity: solidarity with the people of Chechnya, which is still imminently threatened with genocide, because that is what all this is about, together with energy interests."
"Just now we heard about the issue of maintaining order. The history of the twentieth century is littered with strong men who used secret services and other means to create chaos so that they could then present themselves as a force for law and order."
"Let there be no mistake, we should not let Mr Putin get away with that."
"We must not allow the people of Chechnya to become victims of a genocide motivated principally by raw materials interests."
"Secondly, we want to show our solidarity with our colleagues on the other side of the River Ill, with our colleagues in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, who have taken a courageous step and who we should not lag behind in fighting for human rights."
"Thirdly, we would like to demonstrate our solidarity with the Russian people, because the war in Chechnya is threatening to become an instrument of nationalism, which will be used to lever out the rule of law and freedom of the press, which are still very weak in Russia, and to turn the clock back in that country."
"Anyone who wishes to defend the Russian people must work to ensure that attempts to remove press freedom, as evidenced by the Babitsky case and by many other cases, do not succeed, and that Russia continues on the path towards greater freedom and towards closer links with the European Union."
"That is why we must say a resounding 'yes' to steps against these wrongdoings and why we believe that it is important for representatives of this Parliament to visit Chechnya as soon as possible, following the example of the Council of Europe and the UN Commissioner for Human Rights, Mrs Robinson."
"This joint delegation needs to set off without delay."
"It would be a great step forward if this succeeded."
"And, as I have already said, it is vital for us to make it crystal clear that we back human rights for the people of both Chechnya and of Russia."
"We wish to help both peoples and both peoples have the right to advance towards freedom and towards taking their proper place in the international community."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, foreign policy needs to be based not only on fundamental moral values and principles, but also on success in achieving its aims and objectives, and this should not be confused with opportunism."
"I therefore support everything that has been said here about condemning the barbaric war being waged by Russia, which is a war that recalls the darkest days of the Soviet Union."
"What we want to see is a new Russia, not a seamless transition from the Soviet Union, but a new Russia."
"To my mind, it very much remains to be seen whether the new President Putin can guarantee this, certainly on the basis of what we have seen so far."
"So there is no alternative to condemning this war and saying that although we certainly condemn terrorism we regard Russia' s reaction as being totally disproportionate, inappropriate and unacceptable."
"That is what we should condemn."
"But we should not fool ourselves into imagining that in this case we simultaneously want to achieve something important for peace in Europe and throughout the world as whole, that is to say a dialogue with Russia and ultimately a partnership with Russia."
"Unfortunately, Russia is only accepting this in words, not in deeds."
"That is why I think it is important that this interparliamentary delegation exists."
"It is the job of the Council Presidency and the Commission, whilst at the same time defending moral values and condemning this war, to endeavour to ensure that we support those forces which are all too poorly represented in Russia, but who nevertheless wish to pursue a European path, a path towards a European partnership, a partnership with the European Union."
"This is the formula we need: condemnation of the war and a visit by the delegation, after which we must take whatever steps are necessary."
"And if those steps have to be harsh ones, then we should, in full awareness of the facts, not shrink back from taking them."
"Mr President, once again we are discussing the situation in Chechnya."
"In the last few days the Commission and the Member States have held several meetings with their Russian counterparts: the ministerial troika with Mr Putin and Mr Ivanov on 7 April in Moscow, and the Cooperation Council with Russia, last Monday in Luxembourg."
"During these discussions, we have reiterated our main demands: cease-fire and political dialogue, access for, and presence of, international and humanitarian organisations, and independent inquiries into any human rights violations."
"All these demands are also in the European Parliament' s resolution and the recommendation from the Council of Europe' s Parliamentary Assembly."
"As the European Parliament has emphasised, the Russian authorities have failed to respond satisfactorily to these requests."
"All that can be said is that Mr Ivanov finally accepted the European Union and ECHO embassies at the last Cooperation Council."
"Recent discussions in the Council of Europe, the Committee on Human Rights in Geneva and this Parliament reflect growing concern amongst the European public."
"For our part, we support the United Nations Human Rights Commissioner, Mary Robinson' s request to Russia to set up a broad independent committee of inquiry into any violations of human rights, based on recognised international criteria."
"Last Monday' s General Affairs Council stressed the importance of maintaining an open and frank dialogue, including on this subject, with the Russian authorities."
"We think Russia should pursue implementation of the partnership agreement in terms of its elements - I do mean all its elements - and provide more concrete results than we have at this stage."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place this afternoon at 5.30 p.m."
"Human rights"

"(B5­0389/2000) by Mr Van den Berg, on behalf of the PSE Group, on Zimbabwe."
"Jewish prisoners in Iran"
"Mr President, what is the purpose of this joint resolution?"
"Surely it is to establish a proper and public judicial process against the thirteen members of the Jewish community in the Southern Iranian town of Shiraz?"
"The European Parliament in no way disputes the right of the Islamic Republic of Iran to react against foreign attempts at espionage and where the burden of proof is decisive, to punish them accordingly."
"The point is, however, that the arrest and imprisonment of the thirteen Jews from Shiraz up to now has been a real caricature of a normal judicial process, a process that the constitution of the Islamic Republic itself actually provides for."
"What fundamental objections are we actually raising against the judicial action taken by the Iranian authorities?"
"To start with, a variety of scarcely plausible accusations have been levelled at the accused."
"For example, proselytising against Islam and the joint teaching of boys and girls, a violation of the customary separation of the sexes in education in that country."
"The latest accusation was scarcely credible to the orthodox Jewish community in Shiraz."
"Finally, the official accusers raised the almost stereotypical subject of spying for 'America and the Zionists' , which means the state of Israel."
"And so these thirteen Jews are being threatened with the death penalty."
"And remember, this has been the case for over a year as they were arrested in March 1999."
"The whole affair in the meantime smacks of the unremitting power struggle between the reformist camp around President Khatami and the conservatives around revolutionary leader Khomenei - by trampling on a defenceless Jewish minority of about 30 000 people."
"What position should the European Parliament take in this tough, domestic political struggle with regard to the specific case of the thirteen Jews from Shiraz?"
"Of course, it goes without saying that we should support those Iranian powers that publicly declare that they are striving for a society based on the rule of law and human rights and who are open to contact with the West."
"This fundamental choice involves, at the same time, not giving the hard-liners in the Islamic Republic any excuse to undermine this promising path of reform."
"Our amendment in paragraph 5 is based on this very consideration."
"Iranian fundamentalists will immediately attack the European request to Teheran to support the complete abolition of the death penalty - note that this is a provision that runs directly counter to Islamic law, the sharia, as a renewed attempt at the pernicious westernisation of their own Islamic Republic!"
"And, in their view, the abolition of the sharia is equivalent to the abolition of the present Iranian form of government."
"In short, this addition does nothing to support the case of the thirteen Jews from Shiraz."
"The European Parliament must not, therefore, give ammunition for propaganda in this matter of life and death to the ultra-conservatives in Iran, who, in the last few years, have quite simply been pushed onto the defensive by Khatami and his followers."
"What we have in mind is a clear legal settlement of this tragedy, ending we hope with the release of all prisoners."
"That would really add a happy chapter to the almost 2500 years of history of the Jewish community in the land of the Persians."
"God willing, that is what we shall see!"
"Mr President, the trial of thirteen Iranian Jews accused of espionage has opened today in Teheran."
"The trial is taking place behind closed doors."
"These people have been in prison for months under conditions we know virtually nothing about."
"Their lawyers, some of whom are state appointed, were only allowed to look at the files the day before yesterday."
"There is no guarantee of the right to a defence."
"I am afraid this may only be a mock trial. Yet the charge is so serious it could lead to the death penalty."
"When the case started, we had the privilege of hearing some leading government dignitaries publicly call for the prisoners to be put to death straight away."
"This case, which was built up from nothing - I think we are all convinced of that - has mobilised international public opinion powerfully."
"With strong feeling all over the world, including in Strasbourg today, the international pressure has had some impact because the Iranian leaders have softened their position, in particular announcing that most of the accused would no longer be appearing on the charge of espionage, tantamount to execution."
"Three have been freed on bail. Finally, the court announced this morning that the trial was being adjourned until 1 May, which is a step forward, at least."
"But some of the accused are still facing the death penalty and the others face heavy sentences."
"The government' s various changes of attitude illustrate their embarrassment very well."
"They were incapable of stating the charges clearly until the very last minute."
"It is also clear that the outcome of this trial partly depends on how the Iranian political situation evolves."
"In the last parliamentary elections, in February, the reformist tendency defeated the conservatives who include the most extremist elements."
"So this trial is starting at a significant moment: on the one hand, Iran is signalling openness and progress, on the other, the conservatives are trying to hang on to power by every means at their disposal."
"There is consequently a risk that this case of the thirteen Iranian Jews will be used by one faction against another, in step with domestic conflicts."
"Justice has little place in that kind of battle, and human rights even less."
"So it is imperative that we react."
"The European Union is based on the values laid down in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights."
"As a member of the UN, Iran should be applying them too."
"That is why we must demand the release of the prisoners: the thirteen Iranian Jews, but also the other eight Moslem prisoners and the students we know absolutely nothing about."
"We must also call on the Union governments to do the same."
"We also demand that observers be permitted to attend the trial, because public hearings are fundamental to holding a fair trial."
"Finally, we must make it absolutely clear that the development of our relations with Iran will be subject to respect for human rights in that country."
"Mr President, Commissioner Lamy, ladies and gentlemen, since 1979, fifteen Jews have been executed in Iran. The charge was espionage, but their real crime was being Jewish."
"Today, a new trial is starting in Shiraz, in the South."
"Thirteen Jews and eight Moslems have also been detained for a year in Iranian jails, facing death by hanging."
"The youngest is only sixteen years old."
"Back in September, Parliament resolutely called for respect for the fundamental rights of these prisoners in terms of a fair, just and public trial, with their own lawyers and with international observers present."
"When the more moderate elements won the last elections, we thought our call had been heard."
"But now there is this parody of a trial, a summary procedure behind closed doors before a revolutionary court presided over by a single judge, and a cleric at that."
"As for observers, so far Teheran has not granted any visas."
"In other words, we are disappointed, disappointed and alarmed."
"We are continuing to insist that the international community be able to follow the proceedings from start to finish."
"Furthermore, at the request of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, the European Parliament is urgently calling on the Council to send an official delegation to visit the prisoners."
"There is no such thing as an internal matter where human rights are involved."
"Our feelings are as strong as our concern."
"We must make ourselves perfectly clear."
"Iran' s possible return to the bosom of the international community has a price today."
"We hope the Council and the Commission will rally unequivocally to our position."
"We must remain intransigent on this point - human rights are not negotiable."
"Mr President, Commissioner, if voices other than ours had not been raised in the last few days, to give the Iranian Government a warning, thirteen Iranians charged with espionage just for being in touch with relatives in other parts of the world would, at this very moment, be facing trial behind closed doors under summary procedure, leaving them no chance of their most basic rights to a defence being guaranteed."
"You have just heard confirmation, from Mr Sylla, that this planned mock trial is at least going to be adjourned for a few days."
"That means there is the utmost justification for dealing with Parliament' s second joint resolution on this issue under urgent procedure."
"It also means there is a chance this resolution - expressing our indignation - might be heard in Iran, where the results of the recent elections have raised the hope of progress there on fundamental human rights. As everyone who has already spoken has said, it is our duty to ensure that those rights are respected."
"Mr President, when we learned a few months ago that thirteen Iranian Jews had been imprisoned a year earlier, we were concerned for their fate."
"At that time, in an effort to reassure us, the Iranian Government told us it was not a racist trial because many Moslems had also been arrested and indicted on the same charge along with the thirteen Jews."
"But the trial opening today only involves the Jews. They are being tried separately from the Moslems charged with them, which proves, if proof were needed, that this trial - which we are told is to be adjourned - is no genuine trial."
"You will remember, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, and it has been mentioned, that some Iranian Jews were arrested for spying for Israel a few years ago."
"They were put on trial for it and hanged."
"Who are the accused?"
"We should point out that they include a cobbler, a cemetery caretaker, a boy who is not even sixteen yet, and two old men."
"It is hard to understand how these people are endangering Iranian democracy."
"What are they supposed to have done?"
"No one really knows!"
"We do not have the right to know what they are supposed to have done."
"A letter to a family in Israel may have been enough to set this case in motion."
"In a previous resolution and in repeated letters supported by the President, we asked to be allowed to visit the prisoners."
"That was refused."
"We then asked to meet the families who are not sworn to secrecy, as far as I know."
"That was also refused."
"We asked - in a unanimous resolution - to be able to attend the trial."
"Up to now that has been refused."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we must recognise the immense risk run by these thirteen people and strenuously reiterate our requests to send observers to this trial and be given access to the evidence in the case. We must also make clear our intransigence on relations with Iran."
"I hope we are not going to wake up, some day soon, and find that these thirteen people have been executed because they were Jewish."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance wholeheartedly supports the joint resolution that will be put to the vote today."
"I agree with all the previous speakers."
"But I also support the massive protests that have been taking place for some time throughout the world in connection with this affair, such as today at 6 p.m. in Brussels in front of the Iranian embassy."
"Today is a special day, 13 April 2000, the date of the so-called 'trial' ."
"In 1979, 1993, 1998 and 1999, resolutions were sent from the European Parliament to Iran, but what happened to them?"
"Via Amnesty International, Jewish families and organisations, we learned that, on 8 March 1999, thirteen Iranian Jews and Muslims were arrested and detained."
"The youngest is sixteen years old and the oldest forty eight."
"The reason: espionage."
"Yet again."
"Requests have been made to send letters, but to no avail."
"The Israeli Minister for Foreign Affairs, David Levy, sent a letter to various ministers, including the Belgian Minister, to point out that these people are in no way guilty of spying."
"They are Hebrew teachers and perform religious rituals, among other things."
"Three of the thirteen have been allowed to choose a lawyer and the others have had lawyers forced upon them."
"I heard today at 11.30 a.m. that the forum of Jewish organisations in Belgium says that there will not be a trial."
"The Jewish communities are afraid."
"What is likely to happen?"
"People disappear, they are locked up, but for how long? Either that or they are used for cattle trading."
"It is very worrying and must be followed up."
"I hope that Iran will act wisely and responsibly and not with hatred."
"Mr President, we should be clear that already some 17 Jews have already been executed in Iran for charges of espionage, which basically involves no more than contacting anyone in the outside world, certainly anyone in Israel or the United States."
"That seems to me an unacceptable position for any country that claims to respect human rights."
"These 13 who were arrested were arrested in secret; nobody knew of their whereabouts for two or three months."
"In addition, these 13 were all religious leaders or leaders of the Jewish community."
"Therefore, we can only interpret this trial as a deliberate attack on the Jewish community in Iran."
"We know that there will not be a free trial; it will not be open to the public and we have no idea whether these people will have representation."
"Let us send our message very clearly from this Chamber. If Iran claims to respect human rights, trials like this should never be allowed to happen."
"- (EL) Mr President, we were most satisfied to see President Khatami' s forces of modernisation strengthened during the recent elections in Iran."
"At the same time, however, hopes were raised that there would be an acceleration in the processes of democratisation, respect for human rights without discrimination on the grounds of gender, religion or nationality and stronger dialogue with the European Union."
"Unfortunately, the case of the 13 from the Jewish community, including a sixteen-year-old boy, is yet another link in the long chain of prosecutions, usually on trumped-up charges, intolerance and discrimination against minorities living in Iran."
"Greece has started using its good relations with Iran to wage a campaign and to take steps to rescue the 13."
"We are using diplomatic channels to try and ensure that the death penalty is not imposed or, more to the point, is not carried out."
"We feel that such an occurrence would put both relations between Israel and Iran and stability in the already sensitive Middle East to the test, which is why the European Parliament must send a strong message to Iran today, a message stressing the need to respect human rights, respect the international conventions which Iran has signed and grant a moratorium on the death penalty."
"Akin Birdal"
"Mr President, Turkey is now standing at a crossroads."
"It can choose the past, it can choose oppression and barbarity, or it can choose the future, freedom and humanitarianism."
"Akin Birdal has now been imprisoned for such a statement, in spite of his ill-health."
"We are faced with a country which apparently fears its own citizens so much that it is willing to violate the most basic human rights and place the unity of the state above the freedom and rights of the individual."
"We must say to the Turkish Government that the policy which the country is conducting belongs to the past."
"This type of behaviour does not belong to the future, where we hope that human rights will be foremost."
"Such a country will never achieve the unity which it desires."
"My advice to Turkey must be: choose the future and free Akin Birdal and his colleagues."
"Mr President, in Helsinki, the EU countries confirmed Turkey' s status as a candidate state."
"The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party supported this proposal."
"We hope that we shall one day be able to welcome Turkey into the Community."
"We believe that this message gives an important signal to the Turkish people."
"But - and it is an important but - before negotiations can begin, a good many changes are required in Turkey, especially with regard to human rights."
"Many of us had hoped for improvements in this area."
"It is therefore all the more distressing to study all the reports about atrocities which arrive on an almost daily basis."
"Turkey has signed international agreements on human rights but, as has become bitterly apparent to journalists, writers, human rights activists and opposition politicians, these are not observed."
"We in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party wish especially to express our concern about the chairman of Turkey' s Human Rights Foundation, Akin Birdal."
"He had scarcely received a just trial and had been sentenced on flimsy grounds."
"Following a period of freedom, he has again been imprisoned and is being denied the proper medical care he needs following the severe injuries he suffered in the attempt on his life in 1998."
"He must be released immediately."
"In the EU, we are proud not merely to be an economic club."
"The EU is a Union founded upon values, respect for human rights, democracy and the principles of the constitutional state."
"Everyone, both existing and future members, must respect these criteria."
"Unfortunately, Turkey still has a long way to go."
"Mr President, during the debate the day before yesterday with the Council and the Commission, I mentioned the savage reaction of certain Turkish leaders to the fear that the European Union might try to interfere in internal Turkish affairs on the Kurdish question, at the very moment when a new path to membership is opening up for Turkey."
"I can only repeat here as firmly as possible what I said in Ankara on my last visit there."
"The European Parliament has no intention whatsoever of allowing the micro-nationalist miasma which has just drenched the Balkans in blood to develop in Turkey."
"Turkish public opinion need have no fear of our being tempted to encourage any separatist claims whatsoever."
"On the other hand, the values we subscribe to include respect for human dignity the world over and the right of European citizens to keep their roots in their native soil and in the culture of their upbringing."
"At any rate, that is my interpretation of minority rights."
"We are not trying to tell anyone what to do, but we must constantly reaffirm that the European Union - as Mrs Malmström said - is not just about creating wealth at home. There are many of us in this House who believe we must go on building Europe to promote and uphold its fundamental values, in the spirit of the founding fathers."
"That is the purpose of the draft resolution we will be voting on shortly."
"Mr President, two weeks ago, we met Akin Birdal in Ankara at the offices of the EU delegation."
"These were his words to us then: ""For five months we have had a new Turkey."
"Now that the country has acquired candidate country status, we see opportunities for democracy and freedom in our country."
"In addition, the internal armed conflict has ceased and our relations with Greece have improved"" ."
"Those were Akin Birdal' s words."
"Akin Birdal was free at just that particular time because of what was termed 'ill health' ."
"However, he would shortly be forced to return to prison if he were too healthy."
"He also, of course, forfeited the right to be chairman of the Human Rights Foundation."
"His so-called crime was that he had spoken about the Kurdish people on World Peace Day."
"Because of this crime, and in accordance with Article 312 of the law in force, he was sentenced to one year' s imprisonment and ordered to pay fines."
"Akin Birdal is a gentle and peaceful man."
"He still suffers from the after-effects of the attempt upon his life in the spring of 1998."
"In the course of our conversation, he said that he wanted democracy and a peaceful solution to the Kurdish question and that he saw the value of EU membership."
"He also commented on how important it was to abolish 152 laws and articles which limit freedom of expression and cause so many people to be put in prison."
"Mr Birdal was re-imprisoned the day after our conversation and after we had spoken with Prime Minister Ecevit about him."
"What we are seeing in this case is how an undemocratic system imprisons, persecutes and oppresses democrats."
"That is why, in our resolution, we are demanding that measures be taken swiftly to guarantee freedom of expression, reform the judicial system and release all political prisoners."
"Mr President, the previous speaker made it easy for me because he spoke in detail about Akin Birdal who was the leader of the human rights organisation in Turkey and who is mainly known for calling for a peaceful solution to the Kurdish question."
"In 1998, he survived an assassination attempt by right-wing extremists, but since then his health has greatly deteriorated."
"He is now in prison again, at the very time that a number of our MEPs visited Ankara."
"From Mr Schörling' s statement, it appears very clear that this is in no way coincidental."
"It is real provocation."
"Through this kind of action Turkey alienates itself from Europe."
"The gulf becomes deeper instead of the other way round."
"If Turkey wishes to heed our call, then it can only respond by releasing Mr Birdal because this is out-and-out provocation."
"This is not the only instance of human rights violations that concern us."
"I understand that a press bureau in Amsterdam has been ransacked and that this was formally sanctioned by the Belgian judiciary."
"In the meantime we also know from incidents in Belgium who is really behind this."
"Human rights are unambiguous, human rights are the same everywhere and Turkey must also be aware of that, otherwise it will never become a Member of the European Union."
"Mr President, once again we protest and call upon the Turkish Government to release a prisoner who is guilty of the desire to live in a country where democracy, rights and freedom are truly respected."
"Akin Birdal is not a Kurd."
"He is a Turk, a man of peace, condemned for speaking out about the Kurdish issue and calling for an end to this dirty war."
"His imprisonment is the product of an illiberal legal system, the abolition of which Turkish democrats are fighting for, a legal system which has made hundreds and hundreds of citizens suffer."
"No one who has met him could forget his smile and gentle nature. And yet he has had to endure great suffering."
"This is not the first time he has been arrested and an armed attack has been made on his life; he escaped with his life, but he was unable to leave the country and was rearrested."
"Leyla Azan is still in prison, and so are thousands of Kurds."
"When will this end?"
"There is no justification for the behaviour of the Turkish Government."
"The KWP has stopped fighting and its leader, Mr Öçalan, is calling from jail for peace, reconciliation and recognition of the cultural identity of his people."
"The European Union has accepted Turkey' s candidacy and now the Turkish Government must respect our agreements and conventions."
"We must explore every possible avenue, save military interventions and embargoes, starting with a refusal to sell Turkey any more arms, so that, at last, democracy and freedom can be established in Turkey."
"Tibet"
"Mr President, from all accounts, the human rights situation in China has deteriorated considerably."
"This is especially true of Tibet, where, for the time being, the Dalai Lama' s reasonable five point plan has no chance of finding its way onto the agenda."
"The European Union cannot continue to turn a blind eye."
"The United States presented a resolution on the violation of human rights in China at the fifty-sixth session of the UN Commission on Human Rights."
"We are extremely concerned by the fact that the Council of the Union has also not yet announced its intention to support this resolution, and this may not be coincidental, since the EU-China dialogue on human rights is at a complete standstill."
"We call for an end to this policy of turning a blind eye to events in China, and for the European Union to join the American initiative without worrying about losing choice economic opportunities, and to cease this silent and tolerant stance towards the continuous violations of human rights in China, and, in particular, Tibet."
"Europe is laboriously and extremely inconsistently shaking off her lethargic attitude to the horrors taking place in Chechnya."
"I sincerely hope that she will follow the example of the United States and, at last, wake up to the human rights situation in China."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, two weeks ago an interparliamentary conference on the human rights situation in China was held at the European Parliament in Brussels."
"We Members of the European Parliament agreed, together with the Foreign Minister of the Tibetan government in exile, the US government official responsible for Tibet and members of national parliaments, that it is time we put an end to shady compromises with China for the sake of maintaining purely economic relations."
"The Chinese are still refusing to enter into a constructive dialogue with His Holiness the Dalai Lama, and political repression is on the increase."
"People are being mercilessly persecuted, and religious freedom and freedom of speech are being curbed."
"Tibet' s culture and identity are being systematically obliterated."
"These continual violations of the most fundamental human rights must now become an issue."
"The United States needs the support of the European Union at the 56th UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva."
"The European Union must use its inherent authority to work for human dignity and minority rights."
"If it takes the first step, other countries, including the candidate countries, will certainly follow suit."
"My own group, the Group of the European People's Party, is firmly convinced of this."
"Commissioner Lamy, Europe needs to stick its head above the parapet."
"The Commission and the Council belong at the head of a movement fully supporting the Dalai Lama' s five-point peace plan."
"Point one: Tibet must become a peace zone."
"Point two: China must finally renounce its policy of expulsion."
"Point three: democratic civil rights must be guaranteed for all minorities."
"Point four: Tibet' s culture and environment must be protected."
"Point five: genuine negotiations must take place on Tibet' s future autonomous status."
"Commissioner, all our economic agreements with third countries need to be based on the same premise: respect for human rights."
"You demonstrated in Seattle, Commissioner Lamy, and I was there to see for myself, that you know how to build bridges."
"How did a Tibetan delegate put it?"
"""We will survive because of your moral support, but above all because of your solidarity"" !"
"Tashi delek!"
"Mr President, as you are calling on each Member in his own language, perhaps you could address me in Bavarian!"
"Eight years ago I was rapporteur on Tibet."
"In 1992, I presented a motion for a resolution that was unanimously adopted by the European Parliament."
"It is with some dismay that I have realised today that eight years later the same motion for a resolution could be presented on the same grounds, lamenting the same poor, nay appalling, conditions in Tibet."
"The Tibetans' human rights are being trampled upon and their cultural and spiritual heritage is being threatened with complete extinction, especially in Tibet itself."
"Nature and the environment are being polluted and damaged to an extent never seen before."
"Millions of Tibetans have no human rights, let alone civil rights. Above all, they have no right of assembly, no freedom of association, and no right to freely practise their religion."
"For this reason we are calling on the Chinese Government as a matter of the greatest urgency to seek a political solution for Tibet through discussions with Tibet' s political and religious leaders, on the basis of the proposal made by His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama."
"Mr Mann has made it unnecessary for me to reiterate this."
"But I would like to stress this point: if a people is prepared to fight for its autonomous status without questioning borders and without separatist tendencies, then we should really be supporting them, as they are setting an example for our own European Union model!"
"Mr Sakellariou, unfortunately, the seriousness of this subject prevents me from responding to your introductory comment with some Bavarian humour."
"This subject is so serious that I think it would be out of place."
"A great many people are involved here."
"Mr President, today we are discussing Tibet, but we have also discussed Chechnya, Kurdistan and Taiwan, and we will continue to do so."
"In my opinion, the reason for this is that when we talk of human rights, we always focus on individual rights and too often disregard the rights of peoples."
"The fundamental right of self-determination is all too often ignored, possibly for reasons of political convenience."
"It may be easier to act in defence of a person who has been wrongfully imprisoned, tortured or denied freedom of speech than in defence of an entire people."
"But this is the crux of the matter: until the right of self-determination is declared and applied everywhere, we will continue to witness such situations and we will continue to debate and adopt resolutions, but, as Mr Sakellariou said, sadly, nothing will change."
"We must change our perspective completely and progress from the protection of individuals to the protection of peoples, for it is not fair for the inhabitants of East Timor alone to be able to exercise this right: all peoples must have the facility to exercise this right if they so desire, from the Sahara to Chechnya, from Taiwan to Kurdistan, and, of course, in Tibet."
"I am sure a large majority of the House agrees with you."
"Death penalty in the United States"
"Mr President, as I am sure you are aware, at the moment there is much talk of the reform of the urgent debates, and there are certain influential members of the larger groups who see these debates as unnecessary and consider our resolutions to be somewhat superfluous."
"And yet I would argue that no topic more than the death penalty in the United States has proved that this type of humble debate can, over time, play a major role."
"Things are changing in the United States."
"I would not presume for a moment to think that this is entirely due to the European Parliament, but I feel that it is partly the result of the attention constantly paid to the matter by our institution."
"I do not see the motion for a resolution that we are about to vote on as simply yet another resolution, but as further proof that things can change."
"Moreover, I believe that the three elements which are highlighted as positive in this resolution - the stances adopted by Janet Reno, the governor of Illinois and the U.S. Justice Department - should be brought to the attention of the Americans."
"From this point of view, I feel we can congratulate ourselves."
"Mr President, you could say that there is something of a feeling of helplessness in standing here yet again and talking about the death penalty in the USA, since it is certainly not the first time we have discussed it, not even the first time during my short period in Parliament."
"Most recently, we discussed the Mumia Jamal case, and now it is the Juan Raul Garza case, among others."
"However, these men are just examples as there have been so many that you could say that the USA, in its legal policy, is almost waging war against its most destitute and most marginalised people."
"In this way the USA has brought itself into line with China, Congo and Iraq."
"You may well feel that it is strange to sit in a near half-empty chamber, apart from the visitors, and discuss such an important subject, but I think it is a subject which we must continue to take up, and I would ask the Member States to also respond to it here, to respond swiftly and in no uncertain terms to this so-called friendly state which repeatedly violates the most basic human rights."
"Mr President, the European Parliament has, on various occasions, approved texts which state that the death penalty is an assault on human dignity, on human rights and it is a great pity that we have to establish once again that the death penalty still exists among our American friends and that, regrettably, the number of executions is increasing - there have been 350 since 1990."
"What I find particularly distressing is the fact that young people as well, people under 18, can also be sentenced to death, and even the mentally handicapped can be sentenced to death."
"Those are particularly depressing aspects of the text now before us."
"Every execution is an irreversible act and that makes it so extraordinary."
"In the case we are discussing here it was not life imprisonment that was imposed, but the death penalty, and that is on the basis of facts that were not proven beyond any doubt."
"For that reason even the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights asked for time to re-examine the case and to be able to issue an opinion, and it also asked that no date be set for an execution."
"We must urge the Americans to act not only in this specific case, but to ensure that the death penalty is abolished in their country."
"Together with a few other countries where democracy is a long way off, they are the only ones where the number of death sentences is rising."
"This is by no means an enviable record."
"Our Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party has repeatedly argued in favour of the abolition of the death penalty, not only in this specific case, but in general."
"More specifically, I would ask our American friends to abolish it once and for all."
"Mr President, we should be clear as to why this resolution today is so important."
"Firstly, we all know that there is a wave of judicial executions across the USA - over 600 since 1977 - but this would be the first federal execution since 1963."
"Secondly, it is important because this is the only case since executions resumed in 1977 in which the evidence of unsolved, unadjudicated crime in a foreign country has been used to secure the death sentence."
"Juan Garza's death sentence came as a result of murders in Mexico, which he was never charged with."
"Thirdly, there are 21 prisoners currently in federal death row: 14 are black, 5 are white, one is Asian and one is Latino."
"We know that in state trials black defendants are four times more likely to be sentenced to death than white defendants."
"Fourthly, Governor Ryan of Illinois, as we have heard already, has imposed a moratorium on the death sentence in his state because of its appalling record of wrongful convictions."
"When we bring all those factors together we see that the death penalty in the US is an arbitrary process and is fundamentally a racist process."
"That is why we constantly demand that the death sentence should not be carried out in the US."
"In this case it is particularly important because it is a federal execution and will be the first since 1963."
"That is why we urge President Clinton to grant clemency in this case and a moratorium on federal executions."
"There is a presidential campaign under way."
"In a presidential campaign executions, regrettably, become a political football in the US."
"President Clinton has the opportunity - he is not standing for re-election - to make a stand on this issue today."
"Mr President, I join with previous speakers in demanding the immediate and unconditional abolition of the death penalty in the United States, and everywhere else in the world."
"The death penalty is a political arm used by the American Government apparatus to settle accounts with militants like Mumia Abu Jamal."
"Like the whole prison system, it is also an instrument of social discrimination because Afro-Americans, ethnic minorities, and more generally the poor, are far more at risk than others of being condemned to death."
"It is also a penalty whose irreversible character makes any reparation impossible if a mistake is made - and mistakes are often made."
"A government which makes legal assassination one of the pillars of its justice system is infinitely more criminal than those it claims it is protecting society from."
"The death penalty expresses all the barbarity of a society organised in a way that also condemns so many children and adolescents, even in the richest country in the world, to die from drug use or insecurity, actually from material and moral poverty, simply because they had the misfortune to be born in a poor area."
"On a planetary scale, that barbarity condemns millions of human beings to die of hunger or disease when they could easily be cured - but they are not cured because they do not get the medicine they need."
"In rising up against the death penalty we also rise up against all that barbarity, against the barbarity linked to permanently organising society so that all the wealth is concentrated in the hands of a minority and the great mass of humanity is condemned to poverty."
"- (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the death penalty was abolished in Portugal over a century ago."
"So for the Portuguese, being opposed to the death penalty is inherent in our culture."
"I would like to remind you of another reference: the US Declaration of Independence, an inspirational text which defines the three rights on which the United States war of independence was based: ""the right to life, to liberty and to the pursuit of happiness"" ."
"Some two hundred years on, the right to life has still not been fully recognised in the US legal system and this deserves a strong reaction on our part."
"Mr President, my Group firmly supports this resolution."
"We owe a debt of gratitude to the USA for defeating two totalitarian regimes, for defeating national socialism and communism, and for establishing democracy and the rule of law throughout our continent. Nevertheless, the existence of the death penalty in the USA means that they could not join either the Council of Europe or the European Union."
"That means that we should tell even such an important partner as this one, in no uncertain terms, that they should finally abolish the death penalty at individual state level and all the more so at federal level."
"The American election campaign could provide a unique opportunity to send a strong message about this."
"Sad to say, just the opposite has happened, and the candidates are vying with each other in a populist way on this issue."
"However, we believe that the Atlantic Alliance is founded on democracy and the rule of law, so that the right to life should form the centrepiece of the legal system in both the USA and in Europe."
"That is why we want to state unequivocally in our Charter of Fundamental Rights that we support the right to life and that we are opposed to a culture of death as typified by the death penalty."
"Zimbabwe"
"Mr President, this short debate takes place against a background of increasing tension in Zimbabwe."
"All of us who speak should remember that every word of our speeches and the resolution will be eagerly read in Zimbabwe within the next 48 hours by all sides."
"We must, therefore, all encourage Zimbabwe to move towards elections in May."
"The old parliament was dissolved on 11 April and President Mugabe pledged at the EU-Africa Summit in Cairo that the elections would go ahead."
"It is therefore worrying that constituency boundaries have yet to be set."
"This could take up to three months."
"I hope that, when the elections are called, observers from Europe will be invited to Zimbabwe to monitor the proceedings."
"This would show real transparency."
"It is not for Europe to meddle in the internal affairs of any nation."
"African countries must work together to consolidate their future."
"However, the old Lomé Convention made democracy, human rights and the rule of law a requirement for development aid."
"The new Partnership Agreement goes further and asks for good governance."
"All we ask is that disputes of any kind be settled through courts and not in open conflict."
"I particularly highlight land issues."
"Zimbabwe has much to gain from the Partnership Agreement and urgently needs aid and debt relief."
"Much of this could go to rural areas for agreed land resettlement."
"It is disappointing that Zimbabwe feels the need to be involved in the war in the Democratic Republic of Congo at a time when precious resources could be spent on domestic requirements, such as education and health."
"We all look forward to the rule of law being strengthened and a democratisation process fully operating under an independent judiciary to allow civil society to express its wishes through a fair and open press."
"The Zimbabwean people must be given a chance to choose their future."
"Mr President, in the last few decades Southern Africa has formed the subject of much attention in this House. We have fortunately been able to witness a democratic regime that seems to function well coming to power in South Africa."
"At the moment we are receiving very alarming reports from Zimbabwe."
"There are clear signs that democracy in that country could be in jeopardy."
"The court rulings were ignored."
"I sincerely hope that the ruling that was taken about an hour ago, that the police must act against those occupying the farms, will not be ignored this time, as was unfortunately the case with other court rulings."
"What is more serious is the fact that innocent people are being beaten for no apparent reason."
"The only possible reason for this is that they oppose the government of President Mugabe."
"All this, Mr President, is a recipe for anarchy and a threat to democracy that could endanger the entire region."
"We therefore believe that elections must be held as quickly as possible, preferably under the supervision of international observers so that everyone can be satisfied that they are held as fairly as possible."
"Land reform is necessary."
"There are many landless farmers and unemployed people in Zimbabwe."
"It must, however, take place lawfully."
"Above all, it should not occur along racial lines and it must certainly not be the case that holders of political office of whatever party be given priority in the distribution of land."
"Finally I should like to say something about the war that is currently raging in a certain part of Africa."
"I agree with Mr Corrie that the money for this war could be better spent on development in Zimbabwe, on education, training and health care."
"One can think of a whole range of things."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by expressing my confidence in the people of Zimbabwe."
"These people have, over the last few years, shown that they deserve our confidence."
"Zimbabwe is a country which, since independence in 1980, has steadily chosen the path of peaceful development under the leadership of President Mugabe."
"Not only in the economic sphere, but also politically, with a degree of press freedom in which the leadership of the country has also not been spared from criticism."
"As one of the leading SADEC countries it was at the forefront of the battle against apartheid in South Africa."
"It would be particularly sad if this country of all countries became the victim of war, racism and civil strife."
"Zimbabwe does, of course, still have considerable problems, but the European countries and the Union will continue to assume their responsibilities as partners of Zimbabwe in jointly tackling the problems of poverty, ill health and under-development."
"These problems will not be resolved by letting the Zimbabwean army fight in the Congo."
"The country cannot afford such a drain on its resources, as is evident from the economic situation."
"Neither will the occupation of the land of white farmers resolve the problems."
"Land reforms can be introduced through legal channels by a lawful government, and a lawful government comes to power after normal elections."
"These have been announced for June at the very latest."
"I hope that nobody will use the current problems as a pretext - by exaggerating and increasing these problems, for example - to postpone the elections and heavily influence the spontaneous development of this movement."
"In my view, Zimbabwe deserves our confidence."
"The population has chosen the path of development."
"I hope that nothing whatsoever is done to put an abrupt end to this."
"With this in mind, we support the resolution."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I should like to agree with the comments made by my fellow MEPs."
"I believe that we have a reasonable common position."
"Land reform is one of the most important issues throughout southern Africa, so it is therefore not surprising to see that it is again being exploited by Mugabe to his advantage, just prior to the elections, exactly as he has done in previous elections."
"After all, this issue is so important for so many black and poor people."
"The elections are therefore necessary."
"The rule of law is necessary."
"You need to have faith in the people and in the law for the system to function properly."
"I support what other speakers have said about the SADAC countries who will no doubt be looking upon this situation with great concern and who are undoubtedly working behind the scenes to maintain a democratic climate."
"It is also true that they are continually pressing for the withdrawal of troops from the Congo."
"Could the Commission and the Council help us, as the European Parliament, to remain involved as observers at these elections, because if things go wrong in Zimbabwe, there will be more trouble in the region."
"After South Africa and the democratic government there and the sound developments that have taken place in the region, we very much need to see the positive side."
"Let us express our complete confidence in the Zimbabwean people and wish them successful elections for 1 June."
"Mr President, it is five to midnight in Zimbabwe."
"Everything points to the country sitting on a volcano that could erupt at any minute."
"In the run up to the elections, Mugabe will not hesitate to use violence against his political opponents."
"At the beginning of this month, peaceful demonstrators were attacked by his followers while the police looked on."
"What is more serious is the fact that the demonstrators were arrested and the attackers left alone."
"Similarly, Mugabe will not recoil from provoking anarchy and racial hatred by encouraging the illegal occupation of white farms."
"Whites are being systematically intimidated and driven from their land through violent means to punish them for their support for the opposition and to buy the votes of the landless farmers."
"The government systematically disregards the rulings of the Supreme Court."
"In fact, the public prosecutor warned that any attempt to remove the occupiers could lead to civil war."
"It is clear that Mugabe, who has become unpopular through his mismanagement of the economy and his exploits in the Congo, intends to do everything necessary to stay in power."
"Some people even fear that he is inciting the chaos in order to be able to proclaim a state of emergency and postpone the elections."
"At long last, the European Union has this week threatened to suspend aid if the President does not keep his promise of free and fair elections."
"But it is already clear that the elections have been rigged."
"A quarter of the names on the electoral lists are fictitious or duplicates."
"The President is still not allowing any foreign observers in."
"What else has to happen before structural aid is suspended?"
"I would urge the Council and the Commission not to wait until it is five past midnight."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is a shame that this resolution was not adopted at the March part-session, just as I think it is a shame that the recent EU-Africa Summit did not tackle this subject head on."
"These are subjects which should be at the forefront of political action by the European Union."
"We cannot hide the seriousness of what has been going on in Zimbabwe for many weeks now."
"The fact is that Hitler is on the loose again - Hitler is out and about again there."
"It should not go unnoticed that the leader of the band that is encouraging these arbitrary acts in Zimbabwe chose the name Hitler as his own name."
"He is a gentleman by the name of Chenjerai 'Hitler' Hunzvi."
"We know that the instigator is the President of Zimbabwe himself, but the leader of the movement took this name, a name that we know all too well from the horrors of our own history."
"This is what is happening in Zimbabwe."
"That is why we have to take more vigorous action."
"The chaos, the threats and the intimidation taking place in that country are unacceptable and it is also unacceptable that this is being encouraged by the person holding the highest office of state, the President of Zimbabwe himself."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Lamy."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m."
"World education forum"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B5-0355/2000 by Mr Miranda and others, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left;"
"B5-0357/2000 by Mr Andreasen and Mrs Sander, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party;"
"B5-0371/2000 by Mrs Banotti and Mrs Pack, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats;"
"B5-0380/2000 by Mr Van den Berg and Mrs Kinnock, on behalf the Group of the Party of European Socialists;"
"B5-0384/2000 by Mrs Lucas and others, on behalf the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance"
"on the World Education Forum."
"Mr President, The World Education Forum in Dakar is a follow-up to the first conference of Education for All held in Thailand eleven years ago."
"There has been some progress but, unfortunately, not enough as yet."
"As we speak there are 125 million children in the world who do not go to school."
"There are 880 million illiterate adults, two-thirds of whom are girls and women."
"The Community is the largest donor to many of these countries."
"It is regrettable that we are not sending our highest official to attend that conference on behalf of the Community."
"We also regret that there has not yet been a communication on children's rights from the Commission."
"A prominent African leader made a very pertinent comment."
"He said that education is the only existing vaccination against AIDS."
"One of the main problems with providing education in many countries is the catastrophic effect AIDS is having on the lives not just of children, many of whom are orphans because they have lost one or both parents."
"In several of the African countries which I recently visited, I was informed that in order to have one teacher, the colleges must train three, because by the age of 30 so many teachers are already dead from AIDS."
"This underlines the seriousness of the problems."
"Many of these children who are not in school are working."
"Future plans for education programmes and commitments on the part of the donors to the developing world will have to take this into consideration."
"Unfortunately, only 2% of the aid we send to these developing countries is actually being spent on education."
"We hope very much that this conference will raise the issue again and bring to it the urgent attention that is needed."
"Mr President, for about ten years I have been involved with campaigns to promote education throughout the world."
"A hundred and twenty-five million children, mainly girls, do not receive any education."
"I am extremely pleased that I am now a Member of the European Parliament and can take specific action and that in this resolution all Groups are saying that the EU development cooperation budget should be doubled."
"We are not talking about more money for the development budget but about redistribution within that budget."
"According to Commissioner Nielson, we spend 5% on education as a whole and an estimated 80% of that on primary education."
"Because I am also rapporteur for the budget for the year 2001, I hope that we as a Parliament, in consultation with Commissioner Nielson - who has, moreover, said that he wants to move in this direction - will be able to double that budget next year."
"That would really be a concrete step forward, because so much of the money that we spend simply does not reach the poorest people and is not a step towards real development."
"Finally, we cannot develop others, they must develop themselves, but this is a wonderful opportunity to help them and Parliament, together with the Commission, will soon be able to translate this resolution very specifically into real action in the 2001 budget."
"Mr President, it is incredibly sad and, in fact, humiliating for us all that, in the year 2000, there are still children who do not receive any basic education or schooling at all and that there are still adults - almost a billion of them - who cannot read or write and who are thus also prevented from participating in the political and democratic life of their society."
"It is, of course, also a waste of human resources that this is the way things are."
"Unfortunately, it is also those countries which most need educated people to participate in the democratic development of civil society which lack resources for education."
"As has been mentioned, the world' s governments agreed in 1990 that steps should be taken to ensure that everyone received a basic education by no later than the year 2000."
"At the Copenhagen Summit, the deadline was changed to 2015."
"Now, a new summit looms, namely the World Education Forum in Dakar, Senegal in April."
"We know that education is the key to combating poverty, promoting respect for human rights etc. We cannot accept a situation in which the deadline by which everyone is to receive a basic education is moved forward once again."
"I am pleased with this resolution."
"I hope that the decision will be a unanimous one and that the clear message will be: ensure you establish a specific framework for a global action plan for prioritising educational needs in the world."
"Make resources available."
"This is also our message to the Commission."
"Mr President, the recent Euro-African Summit in Cairo has made poverty one of our central concerns."
"As the author of the general report on poverty approved in the Bahamas by the EU-ACP Joint Assembly a few months ago, I would like to say that the fight against poverty must become one of our objectives and, in many cases, our main objective."
"In this context, education, together with health, is the tool with which we can implement an ambitious programme to win the fight against poverty in the world."
"Education is a universal human right and the key to sustainable human development. It is the basic responsibility of the States and, above all, an achievable objective if we mobilise the necessary resources."
"For this reason, we are supporting this initiative and we urge the Commission to mobilise the necessary budgetary and economic resources and to adopt the relevant institutional initiatives so that this objective may be achieved."
"Mr President, I want to preface my remarks by saying that whenever there is lack of respect for children' s rights, there is violence."
"And the first form of violence is failure to provide education."
"Children from families with problems suffer and often do not have access to proper education."
"They will have far less chance of success in life and the conditions are all present for their children to experience the same situation."
"So it is time to prioritise prevention and by creating a different family framework finally make it possible to avoid pointless social and individual suffering and implement a real policy of inclusion, socialisation and education from birth."
"We need to invent new responses and new social attitudes."
"It is our duty to take an interest in these children, particularly the girls, because in some countries they are still regarded as domestic slaves."
"The importance of the early years and education must be recognised in order to provide young people with forms of self-expression other than rebellion due to deprivation in childhood."
"Human beings are born in a state of dependency."
"Defenceless, babies have no duties. They cannot have any."
"Duties follow awareness and awareness awakens with education."
"So in parallel with the implementation of processes to promote literacy and education in general, we must also engage in some collective thinking about the living conditions of children in the various countries, especially in urban areas, and assist in projects to look after street children in third world countries, and also in our own countries, developing pilot schemes inspired, for example, by the family pre-school proposed by ATD Quart-monde."
"It involves reaching out to families and helping children within the family, as well as cooperation and funding to help families in difficulty, especially single-parent families and vulnerable children."
"In fact it is our duty to launch an extensive review of the education of children on our planet if we want a better future for all."
"Mr President, the Commission has participated actively in the Forum' s preparation process through the 'Education for All 2000' evaluation and the regional preparation meetings, particularly the one in Johannesburg in 1999. The Commission will be represented at the Dakar Forum by the director-general for Development."
"In line with these international commitments, Community investments in education have primarily targeted basic education and primary education, especially in the context of cooperation with the ACP countries."
"Thus, a majority of the education programmes financed under the 8th EDF have been devoted to primary education."
"The funds allocated to this heading represent 80% of the total amount devoted to education."
"The Commission has incorporated the recommendations of the Jomtien Conference on Basic Education into its policy and, in the framework of indicative national programmes, 35 ACP countries out of 71 have made education a priority."
"However, I have to specify that, while a balanced approach means prioritising basic education, as has been said, other levels of the educational system must not be neglected as a consequence."
"We agree that the effectiveness of our approach on education requires very close coordination between the Community and the Member States as well as with the other backers."
"But we believe we must also establish a dialogue with civil society and that will be the Community' s approach to supporting national education action plans in ACP countries."
"We are also pursuing the target of eliminating disparities affecting people by the year 2005, in line with the OECD Development Aid Committee' s strategy and the conclusions of the European Union' s social affairs summits."
"My last point is the question put by Mr Van den Berg on the doubling of the basic education budget in 2001."
"In our view, the Community and the Member States should all allocate more resources to education overall and to basic education in particular."
"Nevertheless, we also know this cannot have the anticipated effect unless the recipient countries have the necessary absorption capacity and the resources to ensure the sustainability and durability of the system."
"Consequently the answer is not 'no' , but it is not entirely 'yes' either."
"We think the issue needs to be examined country by country to ensure adequate analysis adapted to each case."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Lamy."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m."
"Taiwan"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B5-0347/2000 by Mr Collins, on behalf of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group;"
"B5-0356/2000 by Mr Haarder and others, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party;"
"B5-0372/2000 by Mr Jarzembowski and others, on behalf the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats;"
"B5-0388/2000 by Mr Nogueira Román, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance"
"on Taiwan."
"Mr President, the elected Vice-President of the island of Taiwan has been called ""the dregs of the nation"" by the government in Beijing."
"Extra troops have been sent to the Chinese province of Fujian, which lies across the water from Taiwan."
"This elected Vice-President, Annette L, said last week that although Taiwan and the mainland are very close to each other geographically, they had become distant relations over the course of history."
"China reacted furiously."
"Lü had shown her true colours as an extremist and incorrigible agitator for the independence of Taiwan."
"According to Beijing, with her poisonous words she wanted to stir up her Taiwanese comrades to hate their fellow countrymen in the mother country, i.e. Beijing."
"Lü said that these slanderous comments reminded her of the way in which the Kuomintang had treated her - during the long dictatorship of this party she was imprisoned for five years - and that she is only interested in improved relations with Beijing."
"That is indeed the case."
"We know Annette Lü and the new President of Taiwan Chen Shui-bian."
"Their election is the crowning glory of the democratisation process in Taiwan."
"Is that a threat to China?"
"Yes, indeed, after all it is clear that the Chinese people are quite capable of building a democratic system with respect for human rights."
"The Taiwanese have shown that."
"For the old man in Beijing the internal developments in Taiwan must be a nightmare."
"Do they really think their threats will bring results?"
"Beijing' s behaviour confirms our opinion that the future of Taiwan lies in the hands of the Taiwanese themselves."
"As Europeans we do not need to interfere."
"Our business is to ensure that this great and independent island is properly represented on the world stage, at the World Health Organisation, the World Trade Organisation, and such like. The idea that Beijing could represent the Taiwanese in such organisations is absolutely ridiculous."
"It is extremely important for this Parliament to forge closer links with the elected representatives in Taiwan."
"Democratisation in that part of the world is also important for Europe."
"China will only be able to be reunited if both Taiwan and the mainland adopt democracy, human rights and the rule of law as their guiding principles."
"Mr President, Commissioner, as European Parliament observers, my colleague Georg Jarzembowski and I were able to follow the presidential elections in Taiwan on 18 March on the spot, 'live' as it were."
"On the basis of numerous conversations with various parties and visits to the polling stations, we satisfied ourselves that the election was free and democratic."
"We had the impression that the elections in Taiwan were marked by a mature awareness of democracy amongst the population."
"This was evidenced both by the high turnout, which, as compared with the presidential elections, had risen by 6% to 82%, and by the result itself."
"After a very long period of supremacy by the party in government up to that point - a period lasting over 50 years - the political scene has been revitalised."
"The opposition candidate was elected the new President and, for the first time in Taiwan' s history, a woman was elected Vice-President."
"These results alone mark a historical turning point."
"The people of Taiwan viewed any attempts by outsiders to influence them with enormous sensitivity."
"The result was primarily an expression of the internal policy debate, and the newly elected President, Mr Chen Shui-bian, based his election campaign almost entirely on internal issues, and the high-profile, aggressive and provocative noises emerging from the People' s Republic of China, from a variety of sources, had, if anything, the opposite of the desired effect."
"Nevertheless, everyone involved was aware of the circumstances."
"Chen Shui-bian was also elected because the previously governing Kuomintang party was split by the presence of two candidates."
"However, the Kuomintang still has a majority in the Taiwanese Parliament."
"Chen Shui-bian is very well aware that a radical pro-independence policy would have been condemned to failure."
"The region needs security and stability."
"The only way to achieve reconciliation and lasting peace is through positive cooperation and a constructive dialogue between mainland China and Taiwan."
"Healthy relations are also needed for economic development."
"We therefore welcome the fact that both sides in this conflict are seeking a peaceful solution."
"In this respect we welcome Chen Shui-bian' s initiative to commence bilateral talks, and we also welcome the cooperative approach announced by the People' s Republic of China."
"The PRC is officially endeavouring to reach a peaceful solution, subject, of course, to Taiwan renouncing its efforts towards independence."
"Our resolution is intended to further democracy in Taiwan, but the People' s Republic of China is taking it as an affront."
"That is why I seriously ask myself whether we should not perhaps adopt a different approach, based on reconciliation instead of polarisation."
"Mr President, thank you very much for letting me speak for the second time today."
"The recent presidential elections, which not only observed all democratic norms but also marked the end of the 50-year rule of the Kuomintang, secured the presidency for Mr Chen Shui-bian."
"The newly elected President reflects Taiwan' s democratic maturity."
"This makes the behaviour of the People' s Republic of China all the more worrying for us, as before, during and after the democratic elections in Taiwan the Republic did not cease to make in some cases totally unacceptable threats towards its little brother."
"I realise, of course, that the People' s Republic of China does not understand the word democracy."
"Nevertheless, there is no need for them to start panicking just because democratic elections are taking place in a neighbouring state."
"Unfortunately, democracy is not infectious!"
"Mr President, like you, we are delighted that the people of Taiwan have been able to express a democratic choice for the second time."
"As the Union has stated through its Presidency, most recently in July last year, in principle we are in favour of one China, but we also want the tension which breaks out from time to time between Taiwan and the People' s Republic of China to be resolved peaceably within a constructive dialogue."
"We call on both Beijing and Taipei to take the path of dialogue as quickly as possible."
"We are encouraging intensification of economic relations with Taiwan and we think that should happen if, as we expect, Taiwan joins the World Trade Organisation."
"Finally, we note the request in your draft resolution, also mentioned by Mr Knörr Borras, for an information office to be opened in Taipei."
"We are hoping to do that, but we have not set any timetable because we have other priorities in Asia and worldwide, and you know how limited our resources are in this field, so we are forced to make choices."
"We hope to open an office, but it is not one of our priorities at the moment."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m."
"(The sitting was suspended at 5.25 p.m. and resumed at 5.30 p.m.)"
"We shall now proceed to the vote on topical and urgent subjects of major importance."
"Relating to the joint resolution on Iraq"
"Mr President, there is a drafting error in Paragraph 2 of this resolution."
"I would like to propose - and this is in fact correct in the German version - that we should forward this resolution to the High Representative for the CFSP."
"But it then continues: ""forward this resolution ... and the governments of the Member States"" ."
"I would like to propose an oral amendment so that it reads ""and the governments of the Member States, of the United States and of Iraq"" ."
"This is an oral amendment."
"Are there any objections?"
"If there are no objections, Mr Sakellariou' s motion will be adopted."
"Mr President, I should like to clarify whether this resolution is compatible with the resolution that we passed in January of this year, drawing attention to the problems of the prisoners of war who are still in Kuwait, or whether this resolution is to be taken as contradictory to our resolution of January of this year?"
"Mr Perry, your objection is political, not procedural."
"Mr Sakellariou tabled a motion; nobody opposed it and so the motion has been adopted."
"Mr President, this morning we had a debate on whether or not, in future, the House should meet in plenary on Fridays."
"A possible justification cited in favour of change was that the agenda is generally relatively uninteresting and that something should be done about this."
"For that reason, and in order to establish whether a quorum is guaranteed on Thursday afternoon when there is an interesting agenda and very important votes, I request that you establish the quorum."
"Mr Markov, you cannot make this request on your own."
"The request has to be made by 32 Members."
"If this request is made by 32 Members, I can check on the quorum."
"Thirty-nine or 40 Members appear to have stood up, and so we must check on the quorum."
"Mr President, given that agreement was reached on this subject, I find this a rather crude method of avoiding such an important vote."
"Mr Naïr, the method may be crude as you say, but the problem is that, according to the old Rules of Procedure, a certain number of Members could request the quorum and then leave the Chamber."
"The current rule is that whoever requests the quorum has to remain in the Chamber."
"Other Members could have requested the quorum and then not voted."
"Consequently, all this may well be crude but it is just a touch more practical."
"Mr President, I think it is terribly sad that when we are about to take such important votes some people are trying to obstruct this."
"I have heard that some Parliamentary staff worked until 4 a.m. so that we could vote on the Dimitrakopoulos/Leinen report."
"I would like to sincerely thank those staff on behalf of my Group, and, I hope, on behalf of all of us."
"They work very conscientiously and we should be just as conscientious when it comes to voting!"
"(Loud applause)"
"Thank you, Mr Swoboda. However, this is a possibility provided by the Rules of Procedure, and any Member has the right to avail himself or herself of it."
"Mr President, I think we should vote."
"Just one comment if I may: I understand that on various occasions colleagues may want to test the quorum."
"Would you ask the President to invite the Committee on Constitutional Affairs to consider a change to the Rules so we can check it electronically?"
"Mr Cox, do you really think we can make this change to the Rules of Procedure now?"
"Mr President, I can understand the reasoning behind not being able to do it electronically, because you cannot check whether everyone uses their card."
"I can understand why you would have to take a head count."
"I would like to know exactly how many people you counted in the chamber today?"
"Straight in front of me I can see at least four people, just in this row here, who are Group staff - not Members."
"How can you, from up there, see exactly which people are Members and which are staff and what the actual figures are?"
"Ms McKenna, the services of our Chamber are quite familiar with us Members, and also with the collaborators who are authorised to enter the Chamber: they recognise each and every one of them very well."
"If you are in agreement, I would like to proceed with the vote."
"Other Members are asking for the floor, but if we continue we will be opening a debate which is completely unrelated to the matter in hand."
"Let us proceed to the vote."
"Relating to the joint resolution on Chechnya"
"Mr President, I rise to speak about the vote on the Chechen resolution."
"During the debate and also during the efforts to agree on a compromise amendment, it emerged that there is a large majority who are of the same view as regards policy and substance."
"It can only be a matter of tactics if, at this stage, having adopted six resolutions already, we say the same thing, or virtually the same thing, once again without any serious debate with the Council and with the Commission."
"For this reason I would like to make this appeal to Members in the other groups: first of all, let us send the joint delegation to Chechnya."
"Everyone has agreed to this specific proposal."
"And then, when the delegation has returned, we can hold a major debate on Chechnya in conjunction with the Council and the Commission, and at the end of that debate ....."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"At the request of Mr Sakellariou, the motion for resolution B5-0350/2000 has been withdrawn."
"Vote (continuation)"
"Mr President, I wish to request a suspension of the sitting in accordance with Rule 69(2) and I wish to ask the Commission if their attitude towards the amendments has changed following this vote."
"No, it has not changed."
"In that case there is no need for us to hesitate any further."
"I therefore request that in accordance with Rule 69(2) the vote on the legislative resolution should be postponed."
"I am requesting this in my capacity as committee chairman and in agreement with the rapporteur and the various political group chairmen."
"(The matter was referred back to the committee responsible)"
"Report (A5/0069/2000) by Mr Lagendijk, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the communication from the Commission on the stabilisation and association process for countries of South-Eastern Europe [COM(1999) 235 - C5-0124/1999 - 1999/2126(CNS)]"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Report (A5-0059/2000) by Mr García-Margallo y Marfíl, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission communication on implementing the framework for financial markets: Action Plan [COM(1999) - 232 - C5-0114/1999 - 1999/2117(COS)]"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Report (A5/0053/2000) by Mr Kuckelkorn, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the communication from the Commission ""Towards a single market for supplementary pensions - results of the consultations on the Green Paper on supplementary pensions in the single market"" [COM(1999) 134 - C5-0135/1999 - 1999/2131(COS)]"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Report (A5-0098/2000) by Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council: ""The Strategy for Europe's Internal Market"" [COM(1999) 464 - C5-0212/1999 - 1999/2167(COS)]"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Mr President, since this voting session is a continuation of the lunch-time voting session, would I be correct in thinking that the few roll-call votes in which we have participated this afternoon will count as part of our daily count, and that this has direct relevance to the earlier vote on whether we had a quorum or not?"
"Perhaps you could let me know later."
"Mr President, I just wanted to ask why we are not voting on Ethiopia now."
"Mr Swoboda, the vote is scheduled for tomorrow morning."
"Mr President, now the vote is over, I would like to come back to the issue of a quorum."
"I do not think you would need a head count unless you did a test with cards and got below what is required."
"It would save time if you tried that first."
"For example, today there were 226 in the first vote after the issue of the quorum was raised."
"If there had been a check with cards, maybe we could have avoided the problem of having a head count."
"Ms McKenna, this is not an issue that can be resolved right now in this Chamber."
"Both your interventions - this one and the one you made earlier - have been recorded."
"We will have to evaluate whether it would be appropriate to amend the Rules of Procedure."
"It is not an issue that we can deal with now."
"Mr President, I voted for the definition of the ""Youth"" Community action programme, as agreed in the Conciliation Committee, mainly because it will finance and implement the European voluntary service programme, which has a large number of young people involved in community actions, including the provision of assistance for the elderly."
"Having said this, I would like to put forward a suggestion for future discussions on the ""Youth"" project and point out something which concerned me in the vote, although the report was adopted, and that is the definition of the word ""youth"" ."
"Mr President, do you feel young?"
"I think you are saying that you do."
"In my opinion, it would be appropriate to establish that ""young"" means those who are young at heart, and therefore give those who are no longer young in years but who are young at heart the opportunity to take advantage of these services."
". (PT) We have been discussing this programme for too long, with all the consequences that that delay implies, as all this effort has not been reflected in the budget agreed in the conciliation procedure - EUR 520 million for seven years, whereas the European Parliament' s original proposal was for EUR 980 million - which is quite frankly less than the programme requires."
"On the other hand, whilst the accession of the candidate countries will give more young people access to the YOUTH programme and there will be an even richer exchange of experience, I have some doubts about whether the budget for the programme is enough to guarantee the success of this initiative."
"Although the initial phase of this programme has been positive, its scope is very limited, as it relates to just one facet of the youth policy that we need, which should actually tackle the various issues affecting young people - such as education, employment, housing, health and culture - across the board."
"The references to ways of solving the problems of discrimination and to the age range for participation in the programme - 15-25, although there are some exceptions - are also inadequate, given that the average age for completing higher education is very close to the upper limit, which should be raised to 30 years."
"Lastly, it is important to strengthen the role and obligations of the bodies responsible for promoting the programme in each Member State, to make sure that it is promoted as efficiently and as quickly as possible."
"- I was disappointed to see that in the decision of Parliament and Council establishing the ""Youth"" Community action programme, reference to the family has been removed in final conciliation negotiations."
"This reference, which was accepted by the Culture and Youth Committee as well as Parliament, referred to the need to examine the role of the family among those factors which have promoted and hampered the social integration of young people."
"The importance of the family in promoting or hampering social integration among youth is clearly recognised within society today, as well as through various studies."
"The Council of Europe, in its report Coherent and Integrated Family Policies, states, ""Families play a primary role in socialisation because they communicate the values, standards, customs and behaviour of the social groups to which their children belong"" ."
"It is inexcusable that this reference to the family has been removed."
"In a report designed to assess and support our young people in the best possible way, the deletion of reference to the family, the single most important influence in a young person' s life, is incomprehensible."
"- I wholeheartedly endorse Mrs Gröner's recommendation to approve the agreement reached with the Council on European youth action programmes."
"The previous youth programmes, Youth for Europe and the European Voluntary Service, will be grouped together in a general medium-term programme which will run from 2000 until 2006, as the European Parliament has demanded."
"A longer-term programme will ensure young people have the opportunity to benefit from such schemes for a guaranteed time."
"Every participant will also have full access to health services and social security, therefore allowing as many of our young people as possible to become involved."
"Although the funding of these programmes of EUR 520m is well below our original demand of EUR 980m which is necessary for new Member States after enlargement, there will be a possibility of increasing this figure, following extra demands on the budget by enlargement."
"These programmes will certainly benefit our young people and give them invaluable opportunities to learn about themselves, about others and about Europe."
"Not only is this crucial for their personal development, but in a fiercely competitive world it will vastly improve their chances on the job market."
"Increasing our young people's skills has always been one of our priorities and we must continue to support this aim."
"Our young people are Europe's future."
"We must encourage them to learn about others and about the European Union, as well as developing their own values, ideas and skills."
"It is important that they are able to participate in voluntary work abroad, school exchanges and learning languages."
"Funding for these types of programmes are a fundamental step towards this objective of opening the eyes and minds of our young people and preparing them to be part of a flexible, skilled workforce."
"Our society does not have enough confidence in young people."
"In my political life I have always been struck by the fact that the future of young people and their concerns are not at the heart of public debate, and neither the political world nor the power of the media really tries to help young people."
"That is especially true in Normandy, the region I represent, where too often youth is associated with deviance and delinquency, forgetting the vast majority of young people who work, dream, love and live, the bearers of all our hopes."
"The European 'Youth' initiative is a first step in that direction, and bears witness to a growing awareness of young people in the EU institutions."
"But it is essential to maintain this effort over time if it is to bear the desired fruit, in the interests of young people and therefore of Europe."
"So I am convinced that other initiatives, especially aid to youth associations, should be massively encouraged and financially supported by the European Union."
"Graça Moura report (A5-0099/2000)"
"Gasòliba i Böhm (ELDR)."
"(ES) Mr President, we would like to express our satisfaction on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party at the approval of the Graça Moura report on the European Year of Languages 2001."
"We believe that it is a magnificent initiative on a European level to dedicate a special year to languages in Europe, to knowledge of them and to the recognition throughout the whole of the European Union of the importance of languages as a reservoir of cultural and historical wealth and an expression of the very identity of the societies which make up the Union."
"We have supported this report but there are two aspects which we are not happy with. I am referring to some amendments which we have presented, both on behalf of the Liberal Group as well as the group of MEPs headed by Mrs Ferrer, in order to incorporate in a clear and specific way the official languages which are recognised in the Member States so that they may participate directly and in an institutional sense in the development of the European Year of Languages."
"This amendment has not been taken up, and we regret the line followed by the European Commission, with the participation of the Member States, because it leaves aside, at risk of marginalising it, a form of participation which is particularly important in this field."
"I would like to remind you that this Parliament recognised Catalan as a European language and gave it a specific personality."
"It is this language, together with others, which must be taken into account in the application and celebration of this European Year of Languages."
"Mr President, I voted for the establishment of the European Year of Languages 2001."
"This is, without any doubt, a major, positive step, although, in my opinion, every year should be a year of languages."
"It is of paramount importance for the European Union that the citizens of the 15 States learn to speak the languages of their fellow citizens of the European Union."
"I would like to take this opportunity to call for language teaching for the elderly to receive just as much attention and funding as language teaching for young people, which receives an extensive amount of aid."
"In this respect, the elderly are all too often forgotten and they would love to visit the other States of the European Union."
"Mr President, I would like to give an explanation of my negative vote on the report on the European Year of Languages."
"Firstly, language occupies an important place in European civilisation and culture, irrespective of numerical considerations regarding the size of the population."
"This statement is thoroughly valid for lesser-used languages."
"Secondly, the target year for this decision is 2001;"
"European citizens could become proficient in other languages as is shown by the fact that all people who speak minority languages, without exception, have in common an excellent training in this field."
"All of them are already bilingual."
"It is completely wrong to exclude minority languages from this initiative."
"It is regrettable that this House has not accepted the important services that lesser-used languages could contribute to the success of this initiative."
"I am glad the European Parliament and the Council have agreed to make 2001 the European Year of Languages."
"In a European Union of fifteen Member States, committed to enlargement, with eleven official languages and a multitude of regional languages, it is actually very important to make the citizens of the Union aware of the advantages of understanding and speaking other languages and of the many opportunities that exist for learning to do so."
"Speaking a language other than one' s mother tongue undoubtedly broadens the mind."
"So, from primary school and kindergarten, children should be encouraged to start learning languages, as an instrument to raise awareness of cultural diversity."
"Some European countries, especially the Scandinavian countries, already have very advanced policies in this field and the resulting advantages are evident."
"This practice needs to be disseminated to the other Member States."
"Of course, we must ensure that this knowledge is not confined only to the better off in society."
"Boosting the learning of foreign languages will bring European citizens closer together by giving them the means to communicate, and thus get to know each other and forge the links to make the concept of European citizenship a reality."
"Opening up to other cultures and finding out about the traditions of our European neighbours are essential ways of combating intolerance and racism engendered by fear of the unknown."
"At the practical level, it needs to be made clear that the European Year of Languages is in fact a joint European Union/Council of Europe project."
"To show that, it would be better for the two partners to use an identical logo and slogan."
"The same concern for visibility and transparency leads me to support the creation of an interactive Internet site so that people can access useful information about the project."
"I am in favour of people being multilingual, but I am sorry we are not trying to develop the teaching of Esperanto in parallel."
"It is a language with European roots and easy to understand, but also rich and subtle."
"As an auxiliary language, it can provide one means, amongst others, of facilitating communication between all European citizens."
"I therefore regret that it is not mentioned in this proposal."
"The undersigned members of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left agree entirely with the point of view of both the Commission and the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport that language is a rather crucial component of human communication, whether it be the spoken or written language, sign language or body language."
"There are people who prefer Esperanto as a form of communication across national borders."
"There are also professional jargons, different dialects in one and the same country and minority languages which are now being recognised by democracies."
"It is also important for posterity to carry out research into languages which are dying out."
"In short, we believe that an understanding of the importance of language is invaluable and that the European Union ought to be acknowledging this beyond the mere one year of the present campaign."
"We hope that this view of ours is also shared by the Council and by national parliaments both within and outside the Union."
"The sums proposed by the Commission (EUR 8 million) and by the Committee (EUR 10 million) are too modest, in our opinion."
"It ought to be possible to spend the proposed sums of money on other things, for which reason we are completely abstaining from voting."
"- (NL) I am pleased with the report by Mr Graça Moura, the rapporteur, and I am grateful to him that my amendments have been adopted."
"In the frame of this European Year, most of the amendments aim to establish closer cooperation with the Member States at all levels of policy, not only at national level but also at regional and even local policy level."
"An essential requirement for this is that the Member States earmark sufficient funds to set up activities that can then be cofinanced by the European Union."
"If not, the European Year of Languages is likely to remain a PR exercise, just a lot of hot air."
"The second aim of my amendments was by means of the activities set up in the context of this European Year to pay special attention to socially vulnerable groups, migrants and semi-skilled and unskilled workers."
"This is something very close to my heart: learning to have an active command of foreign languages should not become the umpteenth barrier to the integration of this target group, a privilege for the already privileged members of our society."
"Foreign language learning is indeed the key to integration."
"A third series of amendments that I have tabled concerns the availability of language courses and accessibility to them in the respective Member States."
"It is an open secret that this situation differs greatly from one Member State to another."
"Smaller Member States with a correspondingly small language area must ipso facto make much greater effort, whereas in the larger Member States and larger language areas respectively the economic incentive is not so great."
"The Member States are therefore inherently asymmetrical in this regard."
"I hope that the Council will endorse this initiative and that we shall be able to start the specific activities as soon as possible, because there is a lot to be done."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, giving Europeans the best training for the future, from their earliest youth, whatever their origin and level of education, above all means giving them the ability to speak languages other than their mother tongue."
"Haute-Normandie has one of the youngest populations in France, but also one of the highest levels of youth unemployment."
"Speaking another European language can clearly be a key to success for those young people."
"Making 2001 European Year of Languages will make Europeans aware of the linguistic diversity of the European Union. It is an excellent decision and has my full support."
"But I do not think we should only devote one year to this aim. Lasting commitment is needed."
"Indeed, it is our duty to be ambitious and to demand that all our young people are able to speak another language fluently, offering them bilingual education whenever possible."
"In this respect, IBIS (Institut Bilingue Interuniversitaire de la Seine), which first saw the light of day in Haute-Normandie, is most exemplary."
"I am convinced that other operations of a similar nature should be massively encouraged and financially supported by the European Union."
"Dary report (A5-0093/2000)"
"Maes (Verts/ALE)."
"(NL) Mr President, we not only voted with enthusiasm for this report, but also for the amendments that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development tabled."
"We are sure that in our partner countries of the ACP, substantial investments are being made in order to be able to compete with regard to quality on the world market."
"The problem, however, is the price."
"Many of these countries are still battling with excessively high costs and I believe that a long transitional period, which I would insist on, is very important for these countries."
"I think our ACP partners will also be pleased with the outcome of this vote."
"- The British Labour members have a strong commitment to the producers in the Caribbean and wish to see an early settlement of the dispute within the WTO."
"These are delicate negotiations and at this stage the UK does not rule out an eventual tariff only system."
"This is the context in which we have supported the Dary report while being against Amendments Nos 6 and 7."
"- (NL) It is clear from the debates once again that there is still considerable disagreement in the Union about the length of the transitional period, the level of the quotas and the system for granting licences."
"The vote on the Dary report has demonstrated once again that the European Parliament does not respect the internationally agreed trading rules."
"It is unacceptable that in the Dary report again a transitional period of ten years is proposed, without putting a definitive ruling first."
"Taking account of the internationally agreed trading rules within the WTO, the GATT Agreement and the internal market strategy of the European Union, we should be arguing in favour of introducing a tariff only system as quickly as possible."
"We could possibly agree provisionally on a tariff quota ruling that is WTO compliant, but on condition that a date is specified on which the tariff only system will be introduced."
"Belgium has always argued in favour of the immediate adaptation of the banana regime to comply with the WTO, but with a concession to the ACP countries."
"Preference should indeed be given to a tariff only system because this option respects the trading flows best and is most clearly WTO compliant."
"The vote today is a sham because the real decisions have been taken in secret deals between the great capitalist groups of the United States and the European Union. Their banana war is just one aspect and, like banana production, just one factor in a complex of conflicts of interest."
"This war, which is presented as a conflict between producer countries, Latin American and dollar area countries against Lomé Convention countries and European overseas dependent territories, is actually a war between capitalist groups."
"Three large American capitalist groups, including Chiquita, the new name for the notorious United Fruit, dominate the dollar banana and are supported by the American Government."
"Behind the producer countries the European Union is claiming to protect, however, there are some large families of wealthy French-Creoles and, indeed, powerful English and French groups."
"Our position is this: while we do not want to give the mighty dollar banana sharks any awards, neither do we have any intention of providing backing through our votes to the smaller sharks protected by the European Union."
"However, it is essential to take measures to protect the small producers who work their own plantations without exploiting anyone, and for them to be guaranteed a decent minimum income, regardless of market fluctuations."
"We demand protection for agricultural labourers, who should not be the victims of the commercial war raging on the world market."
"If a guarantee fund is created, it must underwrite the wages of these workers and the incomes of small producers, and not allow banana magnates to increase their wealth just to invest it in other, more profitable, sectors."
"- (FR) This report gives us the opportunity to welcome the European Parliament' s becoming aware of the need to defend the banana producers of, on the one hand, the ACP countries (to whom we have made commitments in the course of renewing the Lomé Convention) and, on the other hand, the outermost countries of the Community."
"Although the WTO' s dispute settlement body condemned certain key elements in the competitivity of ACP operators, the validity of the principle of tariff quotas has not been challenged in any way."
"The fact is that we are, as is often the case, witnessing the overzealousness of the Commission which, in the context of the negotiations initiated within the WTO, has gone too far."
"In attempting to reconcile the contradictory interests of all parties, in the end it has not been able, or has not wished, to achieve this."
"It therefore seems curious, to say the least, to note the paradox of acknowledging that operators are all in favour of a tariff quota system, while adopting the solution of a single rate system!"
"We therefore congratulate Mr Dary and the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development who are attempting to restore a little order to the Commission proposal which we find simply unacceptable as it stands, because it is selling off Community interests for the benefit of American multinationals whose manufacturing standards are obviously not comparable with EU standards."
"While it may, admittedly, be quite laudable to seek to obtain the most advantageous prices for consumers, we must still be able to compare like with like, particularly in terms of manufacturing conditions (social legislation, child protection)."
"We must therefore ensure that we do not tend towards harmonising these social conditions of manufacturing to the lowest common denominator, and, instead, let us pursue, as a priority, the objective of better product quality, without GMOs or pesticides or anything else."
"Developing better quality products will cause a consequent increase in demand, and thus in the volume of production, with a concomitant reduction in prices!"
"After years of difficulty due to the economic crisis in industrialised countries and the decline in the economies of Eastern Europe, the Commission' s solution would be likely to cause the untimely disappearance of these producing countries whose economies would not, for want of time, be able to restructure and diversify production."
"It is clear today that, without actively seeking confrontation, the EU must champion its own point of view, a position which is all the more tenable as present and future European consumers represent a major proportion of the banana market."
"We are therefore satisfied with Mr Dary' s report, even if we feel it does not go far enough, particularly in terms of the ACP tariff system, the transition period extended beyond ten years, and the definition of a new system for the allocation of import licences, or additional European aid."
"- (SV) The EU' s system for importing bananas - which the WTO panel declared to be discriminatory on 7 April 1999 - must be reformed."
"There is justification for showing consideration for banana producers in the ACP States and in the extremely peripheral areas of the Union, but there is no reason for special treatment in the field of trade."
"Import duties and production subsidies are incompatible with our liberal values."
"In our view, it is only through a system of free trade that long-term, sustainable, global economic development can be created."
"For that reason, the Commission' s proposal for a rapid transition to a system with fixed uniform rates of duty is a step in the right direction."
"Lagendijk report (A5-0069/2000)"
"Fatuzzo (PPE-DE)."
"(IT) Mr President, it was with great pleasure that I voted for this measure on the communication from the Commission on the stabilisation and association process for countries of South-Eastern Europe."
"This is one of the measures adopted in this Chamber which I have most appreciated, for I am sure we all remember the serious problems which arose in this area just over a year ago during the NATO military intervention."
"I feel that the only way to prevent wars is precisely to be closely aware of the tangible problems of other peoples."
"In all probability, it is only this initiative and those which will be approved and supported by the European Parliament which will truly succeed in preventing disasters in this region and any other regions that find themselves in a similar situation."
"In this communication from the Commission, the European Union sets out its claim to impose itself as protector on the countries of South East Europe."
"But throughout the century which has just ended, that region of Europe has known nothing but suffering because of that claim, whether made by rival European powers or by a Western Europe which likes to think it is united."
"While it is easy for the rapporteur to denounce nationalism and local chauvinism, which are indeed intolerable, who can forget that the great European powers have always played on these nationalisms, setting them against each other according to their interests as great powers?"
"The economic and political rivalries between European powers have led to two world wars: the first started in that region and the second was particularly destructive there."
"As to the newly united Europe, it has principally distinguished itself first by contributing to the carve-up of former Yugoslavia, and then by bombing Serbia and Kosovo."
"As the entire current situation illustrates, that war has further aggravated the situation in the region, both in material terms and in terms of relations between communities."
"Under the circumstances, entrusting the stability of this region to the European powers is the same as having the wolf look after the sheep."
"Our vote against this report expresses our opposition to the past and present policies of the European powers."
"I am delighted to welcome this report calling for the European Union to play a leading role in the context of the stability and association pact for the countries of South-Eastern Europe."
"People are always saying that South-Eastern Europe is the European Union' s crisis-riven back yard."
"The political context in this region is extremely sensitive and came to a climax in the Kosovo conflict."
"That conflict demonstrated the potential political effects of instability on the neighbouring States, threatening to destabilise the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), Albania and Montenegro."
"Other countries in the region like Bulgaria and Romania have also suffered serious economic repercussions."
"It is easy to see that the European Union has every interest in the stabilisation of the region and that interest will grow with future enlargement."
"The European Union was traumatised by its powerlessness in the face of the process of violent disintegration at work in the Balkans."
"It was incapable of doing anything likely to stop that disintegration because it lacked a common political will for action, but it also lacked a political approach and appropriate instruments which would have allowed it to manage the crisis effectively at the international level."
"It can be said that the Balkan crisis was a turning point which had the effect of stamping a decisive orientation on European defence and security policy."
"The decisions of the European Councils of Cologne and Helsinki on creating military and civilian capabilities for independent European Union crisis management are proof of that."
"The outcome of the Cologne Council was the establishment of the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe on 10 June 1999, a pact involving not only the Member States of the European Union and, of course, the countries of the region, but also the United States and Russia."
"The pact is part of the global stabilisation approach the European Union has been developing since 1996."
"The stabilisation and association agreements to be signed by Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Albania are the keystone of that approach."
"Negotiations are currently taking place with Macedonia."
"Croatia, where positive political changes have recently occurred, should be involved in the near future."
"These agreements constitute an entirely new contractual framework for the countries of the region; they draw great inspiration from the institutional arrangements and conditions attached to the European agreements linking the European Union with the CEECs."
"These agreements are individually tailored to take account of the specific situation in each country."
"They hold out the prospect of long-term integration into the European Union on the basis of the Treaty of Amsterdam and in compliance with the Copenhagen criteria."
"Above all, they give the countries of this crisis-riven region an important political signal and a definite incentive."
"These agreements also encourage stronger regional cooperation, which seems to me indispensable to the creation of an axis of stability in the region."
"García-Margallo y Marfíl report (A5-0059/2000)"
"Fatuzzo (PPE-DE)."
"(IT) Mr President, I also voted for the measure on the Commission communication on implementing the framework for financial markets: Action Plan, because it is clearly important for the European Parliament, the Commission, the Union and the Council to make progress in terms of competition, using networks and electronic money, which are the latest forms of economic activity."
"I would have been happier with my decision to vote for the measure if it had included the intention to present every pensioner with a computer when he draws out his first pension payment."
"The elderly need to familiarise themselves with new commerce techniques as well as young people."
". (PT) This report comments favourably on the Commission' s proposal for an action plan on financial markets, the objective of which is to liberalise capital markets."
"It is also in line with the Lisbon Summit, which declared that this and other liberalisation programmes should be speeded up."
"But the truth is that this process increases financial instability and encourages concentration of capital markets and financial institutions, and for this reason we are opposed both to the position adopted by the Commission and to the rapporteur' s position."
"However, with a view to introducing specific measures to combat the volatility of capital markets and to control capital movements in the EU, especially those of a speculative nature, and also with a view to minimising the risk of financial crises, we attempted, by means of an amendment to this effect, to persuade the Commission to include in its action plan corresponding concrete measures. These included, in particular, the presentation of a report on the introduction of a tax on capital movements, especially speculative movements."
"We regret that our amendment was not approved."
"The resolution tabled by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is certainly much better than the original version, and I want to thank the rapporteur, Mr García-Margallo y Marfil."
"However, I have not been able to vote for it because it still contains inconsistencies after the plenary vote."
"Thus, as regards the idea of the creation of a commission for stock exchange operations, I recommend a green paper on the establishment or gradual creation of such a commission, preceded by a feasibility study."
"Moreover, the subsidiarity principle requires that, at a time of remarkable boom in the craze for cross-border investments in securities, we bear in mind that the interests of the issuing companies and investors will be better served by proximity of supervision and monitoring of international investments, with more efficient channels for cooperation between the monitoring authorities."
"Supervision of the securities markets can be carried out better by people close to the markets and with in-depth knowledge of them."
"In this context, comparison with the commission in place in the United States, the SEC, is particularly inappropriate, because the SEC is the corollary of a financial system resulting largely from a segmentation of the profession between commercial banks and investment banks, and in Europe we have chosen the universal bank model, which has strengthened the role of the banks in the European financial system."
"It would be equally aberrant to include the stock exchange listing rules in the remit of such a commission, when at most it should ensure respect for them."
"The establishment of a pan-European equity listing would also be aberrant."
"Harmonised yet competitive listings guarantee a diversity of investment products."
"A pan-European listing would make it impossible for national stock exchanges to concentrate on niche markets and would restrict opportunities for specialisation which may emerge from a competitive situation, even though it is convergent."
"Instead of focusing on the listings - already largely harmonised anyway - to the detriment of diversity, we should emphasise rapprochement or even harmonisation of existing dealing systems and environments should be emphasised."
"On prudential supervision, I made a direct appeal to the Commission and the Council yesterday not to cling to the crazy idea of entrusting supervision of all the credit establishments in the fifteen Member States to the European Central Bank."
"Governments control banking activities, hence the need for financial sector supervision by government authorities, not the European Central Bank."
"I have not voted for paragraph 26 which is mostly incomprehensible in French anyway."
"Kuckelhorn report (A5-0053/2000)"
"Fatuzzo (PPE-DE)."
"(IT) Mr President, considering that we are discussing supplementary pensions, the representative of the Pensioners' Party could not let the occasion pass without explaining why he voted for this measure."
"I am convinced that the future of pensioners can only lie in supplementary pensions. These pensions should, however, be optional and replace compulsory State pensions, which are a veritable sieve and lose water from all sides."
"When we cook spaghetti, which is a delicious Italian national dish, we use a colander, a container full of holes which drains the water off the spaghetti."
"Well, instead of a colander, we could use the national State schemes, which, I am afraid, also lose water from all sides, except that, instead of water, it is the hard-earned money of all the working citizens which drains away."
"For this reason, we must replace the national State pension schemes with private supplementary and alternative pension schemes."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of Amendment No 39 by mistake."
"In fact I reject it for the following reasons: this amendment is based on the assumption that neither the Commission report nor the European Parliament' s Kuckelkorn report give any impetus towards structural reforms in the Member States of the European Union as regards reforming retirement pensions."
"The opposite is true of course."
"Right now there is a considerable need for reform in Member States' retirement pension systems."
"I therefore believe that any impetus given by the European Union and by the European Parliament will assist debate in the Member States, where we still have more questions than answers."
"(PT) We voted against this report because we consider that in content it differs little from the Commission' s proposal, which aims to put social security totally in the hands of the financial markets, thus weakening or even replacing state pension schemes by stock market speculation. This makes it quite clear what the ""modernisation of social protection"" agreed at the Lisbon Summit is meant to be."
"As we stated in the amendments we tabled, creating a single market for supplementary pension funds is not an adequate response to future demographic problems. What we need are expansionist economic policies which help to create permanent jobs, thus expanding the pool of contributors to the state pension fund."
"The state social security system, which is financed on a solid footing independent of commercial interests and financial profitability, and which is based on a spirit of solidarity between generations, is in a position to guarantee the right to a dignified retirement and to security in old age for workers who have paid contributions to state pension schemes."
"I spoke yesterday on the Kuckelhorn report as draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Women' s Rights."
"The committee expressed an opinion on the outcome of the consultation on the Green Paper on supplementary pensions in the single market, just as it did on the Green Paper itself."
"We believe this very broad consultation should rapidly conclude with a proposal for a framework directive to ensure the development of a genuine single market in supplementary pension funds, under the second and third pillars."
"The first pillar, covering biometric risks, must still continue to be the cornerstone of social protection in the European Union."
"The targeted directive we are seeking for the second pillar of supplementary pensions should, in particular, define the context for eliminating obstacles to free choice of pension fund, free movement of persons, free provision of services and double taxation."
"As regards taxation, the only acceptable solution is one based on the principle that contributions should be tax deductible, at least up to a certain ceiling, and that supplementary pensions paid out should be taxable in accordance with the income tax legislation applying in the countries of residence."
"As regards the controversial question of whether supplementary pension systems should cover biometric risks, I want to point out that, from the fiscal point of view, pension funds which do not cover these risks cannot be discriminated against as compared with those which do cover them, it being understood that the need to cover these risks depends on the extent of the first pillar in the various countries."
"Subsidiarity and free choice require this."
"Prudential rules must not be disproportionate to ensuring that the funds are secure."
"They must be differentiated according to whether a scheme is internal or external to the enterprise."
"They must allow managers to determine the best investment strategy."
"In the absence of agreement on certain essential points, I am unable to vote for the general framework."
"I regret this all the more as almost all the relevant conclusions from the Committee on Women' s Rights and my recommendations are included in the motion for a resolution, in particular those considering that"
"as regards supplementary pensions too, the preservation of acquired rights is essential when a spouse interrupts or abandons his or her work in order to devote himself or herself to his or her family or look after close relatives who are in need of assistance;"
"for the purpose of calculating pensions, certain periods devoted to the upbringing of children or care of family members ought to be taken into account;"
"it is desirable to provide for the possibility of continued voluntary or optional insurance to preserve and improve pension rights and guarantee a right to payment of the capital under certain conditions."
"We should obviously take advantage of this opportunity to ask the Member States to implement more consistently the principle of equal pay for equal work, because wage discrimination against women has repercussions on women' s pension levels."
"Any legal or contractual provisions infringing the principle of equality of treatment of men and women should be invalid."
"Finally, I want to reiterate my long-standing demand - disregarded by the Commission for many years - for revision of the existing directives on equality of treatment of women and men in terms of social security, in the same way as it applies in legal and professional systems."
"And let us not forget assisting spouses, those millions of invisible workers, the large majority women, on whose behalf this Parliament has demanded an upgrading of the half-hearted 1986 directive to give assisting spouses proper status and compulsory membership of social security schemes, especially pension schemes."
"On 28 March President Prodi and seven of his colleagues met with members of the Committee on Women' s Rights, the European Women' s Lobby and the Equal Opportunities Consultative Committee. I hope he and the committee responsible will now stop ignoring those demands of the European Parliament I have just mentioned."
"Palacio Vallelersundi report (A5-0098/2000)"
"Mr President, I also voted for the Communication: ""The strategy for Europe' s internal market"" , despite the fact that the text did not include the opinion drafted by Mr Medina Ortega on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, page 20 of which states that from the point of view of social security, the ideal of supplementary pensions requires the creation of a genuine European social security system - and I repeat, European social security system - to replace the current approach, which is based on the harmonisation of national systems."
"I am not, therefore, alone in hoping that, tomorrow, the 15 governments will at last decide to take social security and pensions in hand at European level, for this is the only way to prevent the current breakdown of the systems."
". (EL) According to its communication, the Commission intends over the next five years to continue the same internal market strategy, but to apply it more strictly and extend it to new areas."
"Not only does the European Parliament report support this approach, it also calls for the relevant measures to be speeded up."
"The starting point for the proposed objectives are what are typically referred to as the 'enormous benefits' of the internal market."
"However, no explanation is given as to who will benefit from, and who will suffer under, this procedure."
"Without doubt, the only outcome of all the measures to implement the principles of free establishment and free provision of services, the measures to liberalise the markets, the measures to promote the free movement of goods and the numerous concomitant laws is to strengthen the huge multinationals whose potential to extend and mobilise on new markets at greatly reduced costs has been facilitated and which have benefited from deregulation measures. These multinationals have seen their profits increase and their position consolidated."
"Unfortunately, the same does not apply to small- or medium-sized businesses in small Member States, where much stiffer competition has resulted in an increase in the number of bankruptcies, shrinking business and job cuts."
"The problem for these companies is not, of course, that they are 'hampered in exploiting the opportunities afforded by the internal market' ; their problem is precisely the measures used to implement the internal market, the principles which constitute the EU's competition legislation and the reduction in demand in the middle and lower classes as the result of anti-grass roots austerity policies."
"And, of course, the solution does not lie in venture capital and the financial markets, which increase the risks for most small businesses, due to their limited resources, but in a different economic development policy which supports productive investment, increases demand and makes it easier for small businesses to trade."
"The report calls for new, improved arrangements for companies by 'simplifying the legal, administrative and fiscal environment' and for 'laws... which do not involve costs and other burdens for businesses which would otherwise lose their competitive advantage over foreign competitors' ."
"In other words, even less accountable capital transactions and even fewer legislative specifications."
"At the same time, there is not a word about workers' rights, about the fact that fewer obstacles mean less protection under labour legislation and less accountability during mass redundancies, mergers and transfers."
"It is not by chance that neither the individual Commission proposals nor the European Council guidelines make any reference to the need to limit these phenomena, control speculative movements of capital and impose a tax and other measures on capital."
"The report calls for greater liberalisation of sectors such as the pharmaceutical market and a reduction in the tax burden on employment, thereby proving that the measures being taken are paving the way for greater liberalisation of and less accountable capital transactions and profits with exceptionally dangerous consequences for the entire social protection system."
"The report under discussion is fully in line with the anti-grass roots economic and social policy exercised within the framework of the single internal market and EMU and we shall, of course, be voting against it."
"The sub-text of Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi' s report is recognition of the deadlock between national governments, which fail to transpose Community law when it does not serve their interests, and companies, normally the principal beneficiaries of the single market, which have to be convinced of the benefits through information campaigns and 'incentives' ."
"In the light of the success of earlier campaigns on the euro, the results of these are still to be established."
"This is another illustration of the 'soviet-style' procedures of the Community institutions which are now trying to invent the new consumer and the new businessman, after the new citizen of the Ludford report."
"So while the rapporteur supports companies, especially when faced with the difficulties SMEs encounter because of 'administrative obstacles' and complexities, I have considerable reservations about certain provisions in the final text."
"The report underlines the vital importance of making infringement procedures faster and more efficient and 'welcomes the proposals to the Intergovernmental Conference' along those lines. Because Community centralisation is failing to demonstrate its validity and its contribution, we are now forced to insist on repressive procedures, where cooperation would have made it possible to draw up flexible rules more easily acceptable to those involved."
"Then, the Commission should, and I quote, 'pay special attention to creating internal-market mindedness' in national governments, 'while monitoring national implementing measures' ."
"When we know the political context surrounding officials in Community institutions, this desire to brainwash officials in our governments alarms me."
"Finally, the report regrets that the advantage to businesses of treating the whole of the EU as a single market rather than as a collection of national markets is not always apparent to them."
"To remedy this lack of awareness which is additional to administrative obstacles and consumer behaviour, the report envisages 'mass information campaigns similar to those conducted in the case of the euro and incentives to encourage the private sector not to treat partners from other Member States unfavourably' ."
"These points do not seem to undermine the confidence of this House in the chosen Community construction model. People are going to be made happy, whether they like it or not."
"That concludes the explanations of vote."
"COM in milk"
"The next item is the report (A5-0081/2000) by Mr Pesälä, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products (COM(1999) 631 - C5-0339/1999 - 1999/0254(CNS))."
"Mr President, Commissioner, this is indeed a matter of an amendment to a Regulation by means of which competence would be transferred from the Council to the Commission."
"With this amendment to the Regulation, the Commission would be empowered to amend the list of goods not covered by Annex 1."
"The Commission already has this power in the area of agricultural produce, such as grain, sugar, rice and eggs."
"It would be logical if this power were extended to cover milk products."
"This would be the case as a result of the amendment."
"When we consider that funds set aside for aiding exports will dwindle in a couple of years from EUR 587 million to EUR 415 million, as a result of WTO agreements, it would be a good thing if the Commission had the power to examine the list of goods."
"There are many goods for export that also contain substantial amounts of non-milk products, such as yoghurt containing sugar and fruit, and yet dairy products attract export subsidies."
"This being the case, the question here is very much one of logic, allowing us to proceed in the same way as with grain, sugar, rice and eggs."
"It is also very much a question of budgetary discipline, of being able to observe budgetary discipline consistently in the years to come, as appropriations for exports grow scarcer."
"There has been some discussion that the transfer of power from the Council to the Commission might not be such a good thing."
"My own view on this, and on such situations as this, is that it is what we call a zero-sum game."
"We must be logical and adopt the right use of power and the right course to do our job as well and as consistently as possible."
"This has nothing whatsoever to do with shifting the balance of interinstitutional power."
"I think it is rooted in common sense, and a very far-reaching sense of consistency."
"In my opinion, in the future, when prices and situations change rapidly in the world markets, this is the way we should be able to progress with regard to practical matters and react quickly."
"I believe the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is also unanimous on this."
"This amendment to the Regulation must be made."
"It will be a very good and positive move for everyone, and agricultural and dairy producers in particular."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to start by very sincerely thanking Mr Pesälä for his statement, but I must say straight away that the thrust of my comments is somewhat different."
"We have a slogan in German which says 'Milk cheers up tired chaps' ."
"But you can also just say 'Milk cheers you up' , because we now have some women in key positions in the Commission and that is why I would like to put on record my view that the Commission is now cheerfully planning to abolish export refunds for milk products too."
"The Commission is empowered to delete goods eligible for export refunds under the COMs for cereals, sugar, rice and eggs, for example."
"In the case of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty the list has been amended in this way."
"My question is this: is the Commission now seeking carte blanche for other products?"
"I know that the Member States have taken widely differing views of this, not least in Council meetings."
"Is this really what is intended for the entire milk sector?"
"I would be grateful if you could give me a couple of answers in a moment, when we consider whether this really is efficient."
"The Commission text indicates that additional administrative options are to be created, so as to facilitate more precise selection of those goods for which export refunds are to be granted."
"Would the Commission not agree that in this context the expression 'efficient use' is rather euphemistic?"
"What does 'efficient' mean in plain language?"
"In this case, ""efficient"" quite simply means abolishing export refunds for milk products."
"In practice it means that, for example, no export refunds will be granted for the milk part of fruit yoghurt."
"So I would like to ask if there is not a danger that without the milk export refund component export refunds for yoghurt will be reduced."
"Do you have real calculations and reliable figures for this? What will the situation be then?"
"The rapporteur, Mr Pesälä, has, of course, already pointed out that this will also hit other products."
"There are also other export products, such as cakes and pastries, which contain milk components."
"So it sounds rather crazy to me if, on the one hand, we say that we must reduce costs while, on the other, it is possible, because more milk will remain on the market,that additional costs will have to be met for storage and so on."
"As I see it, excess production in the milk sector is likely to get worse rather than improve, and this gradual increase in minimum market access and the simultaneous reduction in the maximum export refund are rather contradictory."
"I am sure that you will be able to explain this in your statement in a moment."
"I believe that in terms of market policy there is no urgent need for this, and I can therefore see no reason why I should happily vote for this procedure or why it should be in the interests of the people I represent."
"I think I might find it rather difficult to explain to the farmers at home."
"So I would like to ask once more - is the abolition of these export refunds really unavoidable?"
"Of course we agreed at the Berlin Summit that savings would have to be made, but surely in the right place."
"I am sure that you will be able to give us some answers in a moment."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank you very sincerely, Mr Pesälä, for your report."
"So what is this all about?"
"The proposal is to transfer to the Commission the power to amend the list of processed products containing milk products which are eligible for refunds."
"As the rapporteur has already explained, the Commission already has this power for cereals, sugar, rice and eggs."
"Planned total expenditure for export refunds for goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty have been reduced from EUR 610 million in budget year 1999 to EUR 551 million in budget year 2000."
"Why?"
"This year, for the last time, we can exceed the WTO upper limit of EUR 475 million by the amounts not used in 1999."
"In the next GATT year, total permissible expenditure will be limited to EUR 415 million by the WTO system, and it will no longer be possible to carry amounts forward."
"Let us compare: last year we had EUR 610 million, and next year will only be able to spend EUR 415 million."
"We believe that it would have been unwise to make this enormous change from 600 to 400 in one go."
"So we have introduced an interim stage this year."
"Our WTO commitments and budgetary discipline mean that we have to adopt a selective approach."
"That means that we can no longer grant export refunds for products where this is not essential to maintain their competitiveness. And that, Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert, is exactly what you were asking about."
"We want to be in a position to adjust the list in accordance with destinations and sales opportunities, so that in future we can use the maximum permissible amount of budget appropriations to export a maximum volume of milk products."
"You gave yoghurt as an example, and it is a good one, as it demonstrates how illogical a system can be."
"At present, the situation is that if any sweeteners or other additives are added to a yoghurt, it is not covered by Annex I to the Treaty."
"If it is a pure natural yoghurt, that is made from milk and nothing else, then it is a milk product and it is not classified as a good not covered by Annex I to the Treaty. So we have not been paying export refunds any more for natural yoghurt for years, but we still have to grant them for flavoured yoghurts."
"Is that logical?"
"Surely you can see that."
"We really are not in the business of putting the thumbscrews on agriculture; this is about being able to react appropriately to short-term market requirements."
"So this proposal will, in future, make it possible for the Commission to adapt the list of goods eligible for export refunds swiftly, but the Member States will be involved as it will come under the management committee procedure."
"In conclusion, I would like to say that I find it discriminatory if milk only cheers up tired chaps."
"Why not 'weary women' as well?"
"That concludes the debate."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m."
"COM in milk"
"The next item is the report (A5-0074/2000) by Mr Maat, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products (COM (1999) 608 - C5-0047/2000 - 1999/0246(CNS))."
"Mr President, during the two months I have been working on the report, I have discovered that feelings run high on the subject of school milk in Europe."
"There have been many responses from schools throughout the European Union and also from school children."
"I found that remarkable in itself."
"There has also been much discussion because the Commission says let us go over to joint financing, which means reducing the European contribution."
"Many schools reacted particularly to this point and I have also noticed among my supporters that people wondered whether things would turn out all right for school milk, whether it would keep going as an instrument?"
"In that regard I must say that I was very fortunate as a new Member of Parliament that, in dealing with the budget for 2001, Parliament in any case adopted my proposal to increase the school milk budget from EUR 53 to 83 million."
"The proposal now before us in the report that was unanimously accepted in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development - I would stress 'unanimously' - and it was particularly gratifying that all parties in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development support the report - boils down to the fact that more money is needed, EUR 96 million in fact."
"That does not come entirely within the budget, but the reality is such that, in view of the change in the dairy market, this small difference could also perhaps be found in the dairy budget."
"It is also for this reason that I would urge Parliament most strongly to support the report on school milk, because there is every reason to do so."
"It is remarkable how casual we in Europe sometimes are about food."
"It is always there and in itself is no problem."
"But it is clear that school milk has an added value for the dietary pattern of children and contributes to a better diet, particularly in urban areas."
"This has been borne out by studies."
"The European Commission has also commissioned a study."
"I did find it to be rather limited, on the basis of a desk study, but in view of the considerable interest in Europe there is every reason to continue the regulation."
"There is extra money for education in the field of the Internet, the electronic superhighway and there is more attention paid to the environment and much attention to safe living and to social conditions and within this we should not neglect a sound policy on the proper use of food and undoubtedly on milk as well."
"For these reasons, and to see whether this regulation could be brought more up to date, I am pleased that the report has also been accepted in this sense in the Committee and I hope it will also be in Parliament."
"There is an expansion in the number of products that can be used in the school milk regulation."
"I am thinking of drinking yoghurt, low-fat cheese, skimmed milk and in this regard valuable amendments have been tabled by my own Group, and also by the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, among others by Mr Pesl for Scandinavia."
"Many specific proposals have been made and that means that in this way we can adapt the school milk regulation in a better way and integrate it better into the current dietary pattern."
"That in itself makes for a stronger case."
"Anyone who thinks that the school milk regulation will rescue the dietary pattern is wrong."
"You must also be realistic."
"If this report is accepted by this House, every year about EUR 12 will be spent per child on subsidies for school milk and that is peanuts in my view."
"This can easily be justified socially within the budget and in respect of a sound nutritional policy."
"Mr President, on the basis of the information provided I shall wholeheartedly recommend this report."
"I should like to thank the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for their unanimous support, that bodes well for the vote in this House."
"I should also like to thank the Commission for its willingness to provide the necessary information and also for preparing the report."
"I hope it will lead to a constructive position with regard to the implementation of this report."
"I understand that in any case the Council of Ministers will meet next Monday."
"It would therefore be an appropriate moment if Parliament were to approve this report and the school milk regulation."
"Mr President, at the request of Mr Cunha I am presenting our statement on this debate on the school milk scheme."
"For more than 20 years, the European Union has been financing the free distribution of milk in primary and secondary schools."
"In recent years this action has amounted to an average annual expenditure of some EUR 90 million for more than 300 million litres of milk, benefiting around 10 million children and young people, or nearly 20% of eligible schoolchildren."
"There are two main reasons justifying this measure and why it should continue."
"The first is its social impact, as it ensures a minimum balanced diet for many children and young people who otherwise would not have access to one."
"The main beneficiaries are children and young people from disadvantaged social classes and poorer districts in both rural and urban areas."
"The second reason is that, as there is a structural surplus in the market for milk products, this measure also represents an incentive to dispose of milk in a far more useful and constructive way than by distributing it, denaturing it or exporting it to third countries at even greater cost."
"It is a pity that the European Union does not have more actions of this kind for other products, instead of dumping them on international markets by means of subsidies which are sometimes twice their price on those markets, which makes it difficult to understand the alleged objective of budgetary savings."
"The United States, which is famous for having a more individualist outlook with less solidarity, spends nearly 9 000 million dollars a year on distributing foods to schoolchildren, i.e. 100 times more than the European Union."
"And the European Union is now proposing to move away from 100% financing and is proposing 50% cofinancing, which will especially penalise less wealthy countries like Portugal."
"As a Portuguese national, I would be shocked if a measure of this kind were to be approved while my own country held the presidency of the European Union."
"Mr President, Mr Maat has committed himself most impressively to the issue of school milk."
"That is a good thing."
"I myself am a great supporter of school milk."
"In fact, I think that not only children but adults too should drink more milk."
"I regret therefore that there is no fresh milk available at the Parliament building in Brussels."
"I do hope that Mr Maat' s next battle will concentrate on making fresh milk available in Brussels."
"Having said that, I do not support Mr Maat' s proposals."
"In the evaluation report on the school milk regulation that the Commission itself quotes, it says that if you only take account of the explicitly stated objectives of the regulation particularly to maintain and increase the consumption of dairy products and promote the sale of surpluses, the positive effects are marginal."
"Nevertheless, on 10 December, the Commission decided not to withdraw the measures but to halve the subsidy."
"I have asked the Commission a number of questions in this regard."
"I asked Commissioner Fischler to what extent this measure corresponded with the subsidiarity principle."
"I believe that this measure could be implemented perfectly well by the national parliaments and that national MPs would be quite able to do so."
"I am also not convinced about the scientific basis as far as certain aspects of public health are concerned."
"Moreover, when dealing with public health, the Commission must make a proposal on the basis of the chapter on ""Public Health"" in the Treaty."
"Nor is it clear to me in the school milk regulation how much will be spent on administration costs."
"It is such a small proportion of the overall milk production that I feel that this weighs particularly heavily on the European Commission budget."
"I am also not sure what the financial consequences will be after enlargement."
"I am not an opponent of school milk as such but I do object to the way we are going about it."
"I believe that the Commission must confine itself to the core tasks and leave other matters to the Member States."
"I support the Commission proposal but not the proposals of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Maat for a good report and good cooperation, namely in his raising the issue of public health."
"Until now the basis for pricing has favoured fattier products."
"There was strong unanimity in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the need to change the basis for pricing so that less fatty products might benefit more from this aid."
"It has been an excellent signal from the EU to the heart of the people for decades now, and we have been able to get it across via children, school pupils, schools and homes."
"In that respect it has to continue, and, as Mr Maat said, be brought up to date and this issue, which is in the common good, should be promoted."
"Amendments Nos 9 and 10 specifically move the proposal towards a direction where less fatty products would be treated along the same lines as fattier products."
"Mr President, I am pleased to have the opportunity of speaking in the debate and I congratulate the rapporteur for his work."
"One clear result, of course, of the proposal before us to curtail or remove this subsidy on school milk will be decreased availability of milk and a drop in the consumption of milk in schools."
"I ask you sincerely: is that what you want to see happening?"
"The nutritional aspect is surely the central element here and the continuation of the consumption of milk by schoolchildren is what we should be working towards."
"The proposals before us definitely militate against that."
"Can I suggest to you what might happen as a result."
"There are two possibilities."
"Children will switch to consuming non-nutritional products or, God forbid, we will move closer towards a situation where children will have to pay for milk consumed, thus discriminating against poor children from deprived communities."
"We all acknowledge the aim here."
"It is to cut milk subsidies."
"But to use schoolchildren as the means towards that end is a sinister way to go about it, especially in a world that is becoming far more health-conscious by the day."
"This is the age of non-GM food and organic products, and the proposals before us represent a major step backwards."
"Let us be clear. Several Member States will not operate this scheme at all if the present subsidy is withdrawn or decreased."
"That is the reality of the situation."
"This would be a catastrophe, not only for the health of schoolchildren - our future citizens - but to the viability of communities also."
"I come from a part of Wales, where GDP per head of the population is less than 75% of the European Union average, in other words, an Objective 1 area."
"I am not proud of that."
"It is an indication of our deprived status."
"Cutting the subsidy, however, would make my community even poorer, a community whose farmers have lost 80% of their income in 2½ years."
"This is not the European Union that I thought my nation had joined."
"We were looking to a Europe of cohesion that seeks to bolster its deprived communities and help its poorest citizens."
"There is also the misconception that Member States will somehow foot this bill and make up the deficit on the basis that it is their responsibility to deal with health and social policy."
"Can I tell you that my Member State, the UK, is already prevaricating on the provision of additional money for Wales and for Scotland to match European funds, a point that I and my colleagues have already highlighted previously in this Chamber."
"This is not unique to my nation."
"Sadly, it affects other nations as well."
"Farmers then are told to diversify, to become multifunctional."
"These are the buzzwords now in the European Union."
"Yet they have already diversified."
"They have already become as multifunctional as humanly possible."
"It is time we rewarded them, particularly in the peripheral and deprived communities of the European Union."
"Cutting this subsidy would destroy an industry already on its knees."
"We need to give a window of opportunity to these people and provide them with the assistance to sustain themselves as they undoubtedly face the most difficult period economically they have ever faced."
"It is clear to me that the proposals before us are not merely a means to curtail the subsidy, but rather, in the event of a lack of participation by Member States in the wake of the subsidy cut, to terminate it entirely."
"This continued erosion of the milk industry is, I am afraid, part of a general trend that we are witnessing throughout the agricultural industry."
"Without people farming in our villages and communities, there will be no rural communities; nobody left to service the needs of those of us that sometimes visit rural areas for recreation."
"The process of amalgamating farms and the buying-up of farm units by consortia pushing up prices unrealistically is already well advanced in my nation of Wales and is becoming the sad pattern in other regions and nations as well."
"I believe we should call a halt to this general erosion of our rural communities."
"At the present moment in time, that requirement transcends the need to cut milk subsidies."
"Defending communities is far, far more important."
"We must keep our milk farmers farming and the communities where they earn their living as viable entities."
"The Agricultural Committee deserve every support in this regard."
"Mr Maat has done well in a very difficult situation and I wish him every success."
"Mr President, Mr Maat' s report quite properly defends the right of millions of European children to receive subsidised milk in school."
"The Commission is proposing to reduce the level of Community aid, by amending the regulation on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products."
"The choice of cofinancing involves the risk that certain Member States might be reticent about supporting the project, mainly because of financial constraints, and the effect would be to reduce the amount of the available budgetary appropriation and thus establish discrimination between European schoolchildren."
"Milk distribution in schools contributes to the maintenance of consumption of milk products, and those same milk products are vital to healthy nutrition for children, so that they can grow up healthy."
"Subsidising milk means teaching children balanced eating habits at an age when lifelong eating patterns and tastes are being formed."
"That role finds particular resonance in this age of eating disorders and unhealthy diets."
"For example, the increase in the number of obese children in Europe as a result of the culture of sweet, highly coloured fizzy drinks is alarming."
"Must we remind people that milk provides a crucial part of our protein, calcium, vitamin and mineral requirements?"
"It strengthens the capacity of young children who drink it to protect themselves against diseases caused by nutritional anarchy."
"Mr Maat rightly mentions the way eating patterns change with our changing lifestyle."
"Increasingly young people go off to school without eating any breakfast or without having any milk in their morning meal."
"Nor do we forget that some children from very deprived backgrounds skip breakfast for financial reasons."
"These children are exposed to dietary deficiencies and have difficulty concentrating at school."
"The Commission is washing its hands of all this, while heading up lots of other programmes that cost a great deal more."
"Why undermine the very one which affects the health of European children?"
"At a time of upheaval in the role of our schools as a training workshop for life, the distribution of subsidised milk ..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, first of all I should like to congratulate the rapporteur for bringing forward a report that not only looks at the problem but puts forward new ideas for the future."
"In many countries and areas - such as where I come from in Northern Ireland - young children might not have had the opportunity to have that nourishment and that nutritional support supplied by milk if it had not been for the milk provided to them in schools."
"I also hope and trust that they will begin to appreciate and to continue to drink milk."
"One thing which amazes me, especially when the agricultural community and dairy farmers are going through such difficult times, is that people are prepared to buy many other products and pay substantial amounts of money for them, but they are not prepared to pay the same amount of money for milk, either for themselves, or for their children."
"Milk provides a very healthy and balanced diet, something we should all support."
"The European Union should take that on board."
"It is good value for money."
"We do not always achieve that."
"We are in a situation in Europe at the moment where we are pouring millions of euros into the agricultural industry, yet the farmers have never been worse off in their lives."
"We have to go back to the drawing board and ask ourselves what our priorities are."
"I want to thank Mr Maat."
"He has challenged us to look to the future, not just in relation to milk itself, but also to milk products and ways in which we can encourage children to drink milk."
"Mr President, for years I have been calling for the school milk scheme to be changed."
"I think it is complete nonsense."
"It is totally wrong from a nutritional point of view and it is impossible to administer."
"Currently, full-cream milk is fully subsidised, semi-skimmed milk is semi-subsidised and skimmed milk receives no subsidy."
"The aim of schemes such as this is to do away with surplus stocks, and since full-cream milk contains the most butterfat, it receives the highest subsidy."
"We should instead award subsidies per pupil."
"I would have preferred it if we had set milk prices lower so that we could abolish the bureaucratic milk quotas."
"In the longer term we must change the EU's agricultural policy so that we can put an end to artificial excess prices and surplus stocks."
"However, the school milk scheme is one of the better schemes."
"It is not just beneficial to farmers."
"The scheme is also to the advantage of children and their parents, especially if it is changed so that it offers subsidies to low-fat products."
"Children do not need so much fat."
"Furthermore, a scheme with subsidies per pupil would be much easier to administer."
"There is an enormous amount of administration involved in the present scheme."
"I have received many complaints from schools which cannot work out how to administer the scheme."
"It is a real science calculating the fat percentages in milk and cheese."
"The schools often end up having to pay back large sums."
"It is not that they are out to cheat; they simply cannot work out how to administer the scheme."
"I think, therefore, that we must vote for the amendments of my good colleague and friend, Niels Busk."
"The scheme which he is recommending is administratively and nutritionally the only correct one."
"Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Maat, for his report, which I support in its entirety."
"And thanks as ever for the usual good work of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"I would also like to thank my good colleague and close friend, Freddy Blak, of the Socialist Group, for his support for my amendment."
"The school milk scheme concerns health and nutrition."
"Children and infants must learn healthy eating habits, and milk, with its protein and calcium content, is a very important part of this."
"On behalf of the Liberal Group, Mr Pesälä and I put forward three amendments which basically aim to make the school milk scheme a lot easier to administer, but which also seek to make the scheme more flexible with regard to the products which are subsidised."
"There are various traditions relating to which dairy products are consumed, and the scheme is simplified by awarding the subsidy on the basis of a quarter of a litre of milk per pupil per school-day."
"For products other than full-cream milk, the subsidy should be calculated on the basis of low-fat solids or a maximum butterfat content of 50%."
"In this way the scheme takes account of the differences in the milk traditions which exist in the different Member States."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the Commission proposal to henceforth fund the school milk programme by means of 50% cofinancing has evoked a furious response in the Council and in Parliament."
"As soon as the term cofinancing is mentioned in terms of agriculture, people' s hackles rise."
"Many see cofinancing as the renationalisation of the common agricultural policy."
"The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is also against the Commission' s plans."
"With such a viewpoint, Parliament can make the most of it."
"Will we read in the newspaper tomorrow ""European Parliament in favour of school milk subsidies - to the rescue of the dairy sector"" ?"
"Are we not kidding ourselves and the sector with this attitude?"
"Is massive opposition to cofinancing in the interests of the sector in the long term?"
"I do not think so."
"We shall have to make do with the financial package established in Agenda 2000 and to deal with the enlargement of the Union."
"If agricultural policy is not changed we shall not be able to pay for it."
"The Union should develop its policy within this context."
"The main question here is, how can we operate as efficiently as possible with the limited resources of the European Union?"
"Must we continue to burden the agriculture budget with a school milk programme of about EUR 90 million a year?"
"Is it not more sensible to seek possibilities of financing such programmes elsewhere?"
"If we wish to guarantee the agricultural sector a reasonable level of support, then that is urgently required."
"If we do not do that, then the Commission will undoubtedly try in other ways to remain below the agricultural ceiling."
"What do you think about a reduction on the direct income supplements?"
"Those who are against cofinancing bring such painful economies a lot closer."
"We do not wish to be part of that."
"Relieving the EU budget by means of creative solutions, such as cofinancing, seems to us a better option for the agricultural sector itself."
"Finally, I agree with the objection to the fact that school milk is distributed to people at meetings in this building who certainly do not need it."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank Mr Maat very sincerely for the effort he has made to present a balanced report on the Commission proposal."
"You will have seen from the debate that the school milk scheme is a very sensitive issue indeed, on which there are many different shades of opinion, and that means that he certainly did not have an easy job."
"Some of the amendments proposed in Mr Maat' s report in effect totally reject the Commission proposal."
"I cannot therefore accept the amendments in question, which are Amendments Nos 1, 5, 6, 7, 10 and 12."
"I am still convinced that the cofinancing proposed would promote the commitment of state and municipal authorities - and that of school authorities and the dairy industry - which is, in turn, a prerequisite for the success of all of these efforts."
"It is quite simply wrong to say that the level of aid will drop from schoolchildren' s point of view."
"The level of aid will remain the same, only the source of funding will change, and no one can seriously maintain that aid is only good if it comes totally from the Community budget."
"I am also quite happy to concede that there are health, nutrition and social policy objectives here."
"But there is one point I wish to make, and this is also the reason why a particular Treaty article has been taken as the legal basis here: in the field of agricultural policy, we can only justify aid that leads to additional sales."
"If the real objective is to take social policy or health policy measures, then these should be financed under health and social policy and not, as it were, through the back door."
"Amendments Nos 2, 4 and 9 are designed to cover a broader range of milk products under the scheme."
"In this respect the Commission would like to maintain the existing scheme, in which the selection of subsidised products is a matter for the Commission."
"Although I cannot therefore accept these amendments, I have no problems with the underlying message, which it is worth conveying, and that is that the current range of products needs to be reviewed, and I will ensure that this issue continues to be dealt with and discussed in the Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products."
"Lastly, Amendment No 3 is in the form of a statement, so that I do not think it would be appropriate to incorporate the text into the regulation."
"As regards the practical side of the proposal, I fear that this amendment would lead to varying levels of support in different Member States and to dramatic fluctuations in the level of aid within a short time."
"And as I am sure that no one would want that, it would be better to keep the existing provision, which is clear, based on objective criteria and which guarantees general stability."
"For the same reasons, I am unable to accept Amendments Nos 8 and 10, which are designed to link the level of aid to milk components other than fat."
"Finally, Amendments Nos 8 and 9 are intended to make it clear that the aid will be paid for a fixed quantity of milk per schoolchild per day."
"This would essentially mean maintaining the existing position, so that is in fact another argument as to why these amendments cannot be accepted."
"Thank you for your attention."
"That concludes the debate."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m."
"Vertical Restraints"
"The next item is the report (A5-0077/2000) by Mrs Thyssen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on draft guidelines on Vertical Restraints (C5-0009/2000 - 2000/2003(COS))."
"Mr President, this debate on the guidelines on vertical restraints is the last in a series of four on an extremely technical subject, for now anyway."
"Industry is all too aware of the importance of the Community competition policy for its operations, but let us also not forget that fair, enforceable and sound competition rules also affect the consumer."
"I have the impression that for people who are not familiar with the competition policy, the whole question of vertical restraints between companies seems a rather strange business, but the fact is that a large proportion of daily distribution is made, managed and organised on the basis of the rules of vertical restraints."
"I did intend, Mr President, to provide my colleagues with a bit more information on this subject, but I can now see how few people are in the Chamber and I think I should not waste your time and the interpreters' time on this."
"The Commissioner knows the subject and the Members who are still to speak on this matter know at least as much as I do about it."
"I shall therefore just say that I think that we as a Parliament, and as the rapporteur on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, can say that it is a good thing that the Commission draws up guidelines and that it publishes them."
"The Commission is the European competition authority par excellence and everyone and certainly legal security will benefit if it explains its new policy in detail beforehand."
"Secondly, I hope the Commission will incorporate the comments listed in the report by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which I shall not repeat here, in the final version of the guidelines that will soon be published and I should also like to hear that from you personally, Commissioner."
"I should now like to ask a few questions."
"First of all, are we going to receive the evaluation which we asked for after three or four years of new policy in the sphere of vertical restraints?"
"Secondly, when can we expect the proposals for a new policy for the horizontal agreements, a new policy that has also been announced by the Commission?"
"Thirdly, the automobile distribution contracts for the time being fall outside the new policy, but the regulation for this sector expires in 2002."
"We can expect an evaluation to be made this year by the Commission."
"When will we receive it and has the Commission already consulted the automobile distribution sector and particularly the small distributors?"
"Fourthly, despite everything, we still have a very fundamental question, a question that we have repeatedly raised in vain and I must therefore repeat it again here; why has the Commission nevertheless opted to apply the new policy immediately also to those sectors where the competition policy, as it was hitherto organised, operated perfectly well?"
"In conclusion, Mr President, I should like to thank those Members - unfortunately they are not here in the Chamber - who also dealt with this subject in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, not only for this report, but also for the three reports that preceded it."
"I wish to inform those who tabled amendments, that is, amendments tabled on behalf of the PSE Group, that I have unfortunately had to reject those amendments by reason of their content as I explained earlier in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and secondly, because these amendments had already been tabled at Committee level and rejected one by one."
"Mr President, I should finally like to apologise for the fact that I cannot be present at the vote tomorrow morning, but Mr von Wogau will replace me here as rapporteur, if necessary."
"Mr President, Commissioner, my colleague, Mrs Thyssen has produced some excellent work and I wish to congratulate her on it."
"In this connection, I myself would like to comment just on the relevant production markets and the guidelines for interpretation regarding how market share is determined, especially from the point of view of cooperation agreements in the petrol station business."
"These issues cause problems, at least in my home country of Finland, and in other small Member States."
"Guidelines on vertical restraints should be designed to help us see clearly and accurately when the seller' s market share in the relevant product market exceeds the 30% threshold to be applied."
"Regarding cooperation agreements in the petrol station business, the draft guidelines to be applied do not at present take sufficiently clear account of the special features of that industry' s market and delivery agreements."
"The 30% market share limit provided for under the Block Exemption regulation will cause problems relating to equal treatment for existing petrol stations, at least in Finland."
"Applying the new ruling might lead to situations where, for example, we will be inspecting in a different manner the contractual obligations regarding cooperation in the petrol station industry that are otherwise comparable in every respect with each other as far as their direct effects are concerned if the market share of one company exceeds the 30% threshold."
"It is important to define unambiguously the relevant markets referred to in Article 3 of the Block Exemption regulation."
"The guidelines have not defined sufficiently precisely how the market share of a manufacturer and a wholesaler should be determined."
"I feel this is especially problematic."
"As this is a matter of regulating the right of competition in an industry in which competition takes place among brand names, the guidelines should clearly state that calculating market shares should always involve studying each stage of delivery separately."
"In addition, the guidelines should indicate unambiguously that the 30% threshold in the relevant market has been calculated to take account of sales of the supplier' s own brand to the retailer or distributor."
"Mr President, I am pleased that you knew I was here and that I was going to speak. You know that I do not usually speak too long."
"I will simply explain the amendments presented by Mr Berenguer, who is unable to attend."
"These are Amendments Nos 2, 3 and 4."
"Amendment No 2 deals with the possibility of freeing the distributor by means of the return of contributions once the contract has finished."
"The formula used is contained in section 147 of the Commission guidelines on this subject, which is known as the investment depreciation period."
"The possibility should exist, in certain circumstances, of freeing the distributor by means of a reintegration of the investment."
"In other words, the distributor should not be permanently bound by the initial investment of the producer."
"Amendment No 3 refers to the setting of prices by the producer - the resale price - in certain cases, such as the launch of the product."
"There are certain cases in which this setting of the resale price can be justified."
"This is referred to in sections 38 and 39 of the Commission guidelines, but it is clear that, in certain cases, we have to provide flexibility and we are sure that the Commission will understand this."
"Lastly, Amendment No 4 refers to the protection of producers against pressures applied by the distributor to force them to extend the contract."
"We are talking about exclusive contracts, sections 131 et seq."
"Finally, these amendments are simply intended to be a reminder of certain specific aspects, but it is clear that both the guidelines proposed by the Commission and Mrs Thyssen' s report move within boundaries which are reasonable and practical."
"We hope that the Commission will administer these guidelines in a flexible way so that, on the one hand, market competition is guaranteed and, on the other, we do not create situations of enslavement or limitation of economic activity with regard to the distributors."
"Mr President, as we are short of time I will make my statement telegram style."
"First of all, many thanks to you, Mrs Thyssen, for your excellent report."
"Second, my thanks also to the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for supporting this important reform project."
"The draft is an important step in the reform of competition policy in respect of vertical restraints."
"Since the Green Paper was published in 1997, the development of the institution of vertical distribution restraints has gone through various phases, including most recently the adoption of new Regulation 2790 on the application of Article 81(3) of the Treaty to categories of vertical agreements and concerted practices."
"As you know, the Commission is taking this policy as a basis for a decisive switch from a traditional approach based on formal criteria to an approach based on the analysis of economic impacts."
"The objective of this is to re-establish freedom of contract for the great majority of companies and to simultaneously improve the protection of fair competition for the benefit of consumers."
"Furthermore, in answer to your question, Mrs Thyssen, as to whether there will be a review, the answer is yes, there will indeed be a review of the guidelines after four years."
"With regard to your question about horizontal measures, the Commission is currently drawing up a set of guidelines relating to this horizontal cooperation agreement."
"A first draft of these guidelines will then be transmitted to the European Parliament before it is published in the Official Journal."
"It is very likely that this will happen before the end of April."
"I am delighted to report that the European Parliament and the Commission have worked together closely and constructively on this issue."
"Mrs Thyssen' s report demonstrates once more that this will to cooperate is making a valuable contribution to various relevant aspects of the reform process."
"That concludes the debate."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 9 a.m."
"(The sitting was closed at 8.20 p.m.)"
"Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting"
"The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, I should like to say that I cast a vote in error yesterday afternoon on the question of referring the bananas issue back to committee."
"We in this Parliament risk setting ourselves on a course which will fail to help the banana growers and, at the same time, will continue to inflict grave injustice on small enterprises engaged in producing things like bath products and ..."
"..."
"I therefore wish I had cast my vote the other way."
"I wish that to be placed on the record."
"We will include this in the Minutes, Mr MacCormick."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Mr President, I only wanted to report my presence for the Minutes."
"I will not be signing the attendance register as I am leaving in one hour, but I wanted everyone to know that I am here."
"We can all see, Mrs Van der Laan, that you are here."
"It will be included in the Minutes."
"Vote"
"Mr President, we were somewhat confounded yesterday by an action of a Member of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, but I think that what I am about to announce will not come as a surprise to anyone here, as I explained at length on Monday what I am about to request. In fact, you have also received several e-mails and I have also written to the Conference of Presidents on the matter."
"The fact is that according to Members of various groups, the agenda on Fridays is too light, as a result of which many Members genuinely believe that their time can be spent more productively elsewhere."
"Consequently, there are few of us here today and we cannot guarantee that our electorate is adequately represented here."
"We therefore believe that a choice needs to be made: either we need to give more substance to Friday' s agenda or to abolish the Friday sitting."
"In this context, I wish to ask for the quorum to be checked."
"I think that we all know the rules by now."
"Mrs Buitenweg, you cannot request this on your own."
"Such a request must be made by at least 32 Members."
"I will check if there are sufficient Members present who wish to check the quorum."
"I notice that more than 32 Members have made this request."
"We will have to establish whether there is a quorum."
"You will undoubtedly know that there is a quorum if one third of the MEPs are present in the Chamber."
"(The number of Members present was counted)"
"I note that there is no quorum and that the vote on the Pesälä report will therefore take place in the next part-session."
"Mr President, firstly I would like to ask you to determine an exact figure and to carry out an electronic check during the roll-call vote so that we know who is here and who is not."
"Secondly, I would like to say that I share the concern of my colleagues who want to upgrade Fridays."
"I am always here as a member of the so-called ""Friday Club""."
"I also want to upgrade Fridays, but through work and not through sabotage."
"Mr Posselt, the Rules of Procedure, which I have followed to the letter, are very clear on this and do not allow the electronic voting system to be used."
"They also specify that the outcome of the vote shall not be made known."
"It is up to the President to establish that there is no quorum."
"Report by Mr Maat (A5-0074/200), on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 on the common organisation of the markets in milk and milk products [COM(1999) 608 - C5-0047/2000 - 1999/0246(CNS)]"
"Mr President, I am pleased to say that I, together with a number of other colleagues from my Group, fully back the initiative which Mrs Buitenweg has taken."
"Needless to say, we do not aim to sabotage the work. This is why we announced this action a long time ago - the Conference of Presidents were made aware of it six weeks ago - and neither is this any reflection on today' s agenda, of course."
"I think that the outcome of the quorum count is sufficient reason for the Conference of Presidents to revise the agenda for 2001, but at the moment I would like to ask you the following: according to my interpretation of the Rules of Procedure, the request for the quorum means that none of the votes can take place."
"If this is not the case, Mr President, I would ask you to check the quorum before we proceed to vote on the Maat report."
"(More than 32 Members rose in support of this request)"
"(The President established that there was not a quorum)"
"Mr President, I have been trying to catch your eye for a while now."
"I note that the Members who are now asking for the quorum to be checked are the Dutch Members, or a number of Dutch Members, who do not usually attend."
"Mr President, we have checked when exactly these people are present on Fridays."
"It appears that, evidently, no Friday is important enough for these people to turn up."
"They have had their little pleasures, Mr President."
"They were able to appear on radio and television last week."
"Mr President, is that the only way they can think of to sabotage our work here, by soiling the nest of so many other Members who, just like me, are trying to do a decent job here today."
"Mr President, I cannot accept this and would like to offer my apologies as I feel ashamed on their behalf."
"I would also like to say to these Members, if they had worked like I have in recent months and if they had been given the mandate from the electorate personally, they would behave differently today."
"I notice that a few other Members would like to be given the floor on this point of order."
"We should, however, bring this to a close very shortly."
"I am now giving the floor to Mr Schulz."
"Mr President, I will not actually speak for very long, but, so far, if I disregard the comments made by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, only those in favour of the process have been allowed to speak."
"We do have individual opinions within our Group."
"The delegates in the Socialist Group are not unanimous here."
"I would therefore like to speak as someone who is against this process."
"I would ask the Members who this morning requested that the vote be postponed in the absence of a quorum to consider the following: if you want to reform the Rules of Procedure, which are indispensable in this House, if you want to improve our working practice, you cannot achieve this through impulsive actions; instead you must initiate a full debate on reform of the House."
"The delegates who are here this morning, who have done their work, who spent yesterday evening preparing for the work to be carried out today, are being punished here today, by a spontaneous action, for the fact that not everyone in Parliament has done their homework."
"I do not think this is fair to these delegates!"
"Finally, I would ask you to consider the following, and I am addressing this to my colleagues in the Greens and in the left-wing Groups of this House, who have the somewhat remarkable impression that through the Rules of Procedure you can change the free mandate into an imperative mandate with a duty to be present for all votes. That is nonsense!"
"You will never be able to compel a freely elected delegate to take part in a parliamentary session or a vote if that delegate does not want to."
"This is why I consider this morning' s action to be impulsive, although it did perhaps serve a purpose, but, in terms of highlighting the key issue, it was quite unhelpful!"
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, I feel that we are making rather a spectacle of ourselves. I am reminded of the priest who berates his parishioners because other people do not come to Church."
"We are here to work and those who are not here to work are preventing us from doing so."
"Mr Schulz is right."
"This is completely immoral."
"Secondly, Mr President, I would like us to get on with the debate. Even if the fact that we do not meet the quorum means that we cannot vote, we can still debate."
"Thirdly, I would like to point out the absurdity of the Rules of Procedure and ask the President to see that the matter is referred to the relevant Committee, for our Rules of Procedure state that the quorum cannot be required if less than 32 Members are present."
"Therefore, if there had only been 29 Members present we could have voted and no one could have stopped us, but, because there are more than 32, we cannot vote!"
"This is absurd, and we are making a spectacle of ourselves in front of the whole of Europe."
"We cannot go on like this."
"Mr Bourlanges, I can perhaps put your mind at rest by informing you that I will, of course, refer this morning' s matter to the Bureau."
"Needless to say, we will discuss this matter."
"I think that goes without saying."
"For the rest, as President, I am at your service at the moment and I, together with yourself, need to apply the Rules of Procedure to the best of my ability."
"I still have many requests from Members to speak."
"I am now giving the floor to Mr Medina Ortega."
"Mr President, since there will no doubt be another quorum vote, I would like to remind the President and the Members of this Parliament that, during a quorum vote, it is not permitted to leave the chamber."
"Four MEPs have left the chamber."
"The practice often consists of asking for the quorum and then leaving the chamber."
"I would ask you, Mr President, to remember this and not to allow any MEP to leave the chamber while a count of those Members present is taking place."
"Mr Medina Ortega, we need to straighten a few things out."
"We are now working within the Rules of Procedure."
"Since the start of the new parliamentary term, it has been defined very clearly that every Member is allowed to leave the Chamber."
"If, however - and this is according to the Rules of Procedure - one of the 32 Members who have requested a quorum leaves the Chamber, they will still be included."
"The doors will remain open."
"This is the quorum provision as it stands at the moment and this is the one I am applying."
"Mr Bourlanges said that we carry on voting if there are fewer than 32 Members in the Chamber."
"This is not the case."
"The Rules of Procedure stipulate that if there are fewer than 32 Members in total present in the Chamber, then there is no vote."
"Mr Posselt, there are many points of order to cover."
"I am giving you the floor for the last time."
"Mr President, I think it is genuinely important."
"I appeal to the delegates to end their demonstration."
"They have made their point, but now it is a matter of hunger in Ethiopia and we must vote on it."
"Motions for resolutions (B5-0345/2000, B5-0348/2000, B5-0360/2000, B5-0392/2000, B5-0395/2000) on the famine in Ethiopia"
"Mr President, I am very sorry but we did announce this action six weeks ago - it has not exactly appeared out of the blue."
"We have given everyone, including the Presidents, the opportunity to change the agenda if this was considered necessary."
"Nobody acted upon this. I have not heard of any action to change the agenda, even on the part of the Members who are now complaining."
"This action, the quorum action, will continue, not only today, but every Friday in Strasbourg, until we have achieved our goal."
"One of the options is a full Chamber, because one thing that creates the bad image which Mr Bourlanges is talking about is people signing up here and leaving without doing their work."
"I have also done my homework and I do not want to mention any names, but we will be able to do this in future."
"We will challenge the quorum for each item on the agenda today. This will cause some irritation."
"It seems more sensible, therefore, to move all votes for today. We then do not need to continue with this and we can carry on with the debates and ask the Commissioner important questions."
"Mrs Van der Laan, I understand that you would like the quorum to be checked."
"According to the Rules of Procedure, a vote is to be taken on this."
"We need to check whether there are 32 Members who wish to support you."
"(More than 32 Members rose in support of this request) (The President established that there was no quorum)"
"Mr President, irrespective of whether this action was spontaneous or premeditated, it is still an act of sabotage by the anti-Strasbourg lobby."
"I, too, noticed Members leaving the Chamber during the count."
"This behaviour does not contravene the Rules of Procedure, but it is contrary to the notion of fair play and the proper functioning of Parliament."
"(Applause)"
"I am just so tired of being accused of not wanting to do my job because I am taking part in this action."
"If this Parliament is to be taken even a tiny bit seriously in Europe - and it is touch and go whether it will be, given that only 50% of citizens voted at the last European Parliament elections - then it must take itself seriously, and we are not taking ourselves seriously by sitting and discussing cases when there is nobody here."
"That is not a serious way of doing things."
"If Parliament has to work on Friday, then people must be here."
"What we are asking for is simply confirmation of whether we are observing Parliament' s own rules."
"That can hardly be called frivolous."
"Mr President, the action which was taken is permitted by the Rules of Procedure, and therefore, those who, like me, acted in this way take political responsibility for it."
"I do, however, consider that it is not right to criticise those who use an instrument which was adopted by democratic vote, such as the Rules of Procedure, for purposes which all may not support, but which are nevertheless permitted by the rules which we have established for ourselves."
"If the rules had been different, we would have acted differently."
"I would ask, rather, why it is that many Members voted in favour of working on Fridays in Strasbourg and yet are not in Strasbourg today."
"It might have been better and made more sense to vote not to work on Fridays: in fact, I put it to you that to vote in a certain way and then act differently is a display of blatant disregard for our institution."
"Mr President, with regard to Mr Medina Ortega' s intervention a few moments ago, which you responded to by saying that his interpretation was incorrect, I must tell you that your reply was not correct either."
"Please do not ask me to name any particular Member, but I guarantee that some of the 32 members who voted in favour of the request for a quorum are no longer here."
"Therefore, some of the 32 Members have violated the Rules of Procedure."
"Report by Mrs Thyssen (A5-0077/2000), on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the draft guidelines on vertical restraints [C5-0009/2000 - 2000/2003(COS)]"
"Mr President, you will understand that I would like the quorum to be checked, but I think that there are clearly not enough people present."
"I would therefore suggest moving all planned votes to the next sitting and proceeding with the discussion with the Council."
"This is not the way things are done."
"You can ask for the quorum to be checked but the vote is on the agenda."
"Would you like to get the quorum checked now?"
"(More than 32 Members rose in support of this request) (The President established that there was no quorum)"
"Mr President, two points on the Rules of Procedure: the first is that I would ask you, the chair, not just to look to the left, but to kindly look to the right also to see if anyone here wishes to speak."
"My second point is an appeal to the delegates. The point which is currently on the agenda, night flights, gives us the chance to carry out a roll-call vote."
"If you want that, and I consider it very reasonable, we should carry out this vote."
"Mr Mayer, I can assure you, it is not just me who casts my eye through the Chamber."
"I also have people behind my desk who help me in this activity."
"We can monitor all corners of the Chamber."
"I actually think that I have not made too bad a job of it."
"Concerning night flights, these will be discussed in a moment."
"We will see how the point on the agenda unfolds."
"I am now giving the floor to Mrs Flesch."
"Mr President, I am indebted to my esteemed friend, Mrs van der Laan, for making it clear, the last time she adopted a position, that she and her friends intended to repeat the manoeuvre every Friday morning of a Strasbourg part-session."
"I am grateful to her for clarifying the purpose of this action and I agree with Mr Jacques Poos' comments."
"I would also like to express my disappointment at the absence from the Chamber this morning of Members whom I believed to be as concerned as I am for the interests of the town of Strasbourg."
"Mr President, I would just like to ask all those who stood up to request checking the quorum what they think of the fact that, thanks to their action, we are not now going to vote on emergency aid measures for Ethiopia. In all honesty, I think we need to make journalists aware of what we think of this kind of action."
"Everyone is, of course, free to act as they like."
"Information and communication"
"The next item is an oral question to the Commission (B5-0008/2000), on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, on the EU' s information and communication strategy."
"Mr President, the Union is faced with major tasks and its further development depends to a great extent on what we do here and now."
"Enlargement to include the countries of Eastern and Central Europe is the biggest challenge in the Community' s history, and if we do not tackle the issue correctly now, we are putting a lot at risk."
"It is extremely important that we explain to the Union' s citizens, and the citizens of the candidate countries, what the Union stands for."
"An information and communication strategy must, therefore, be high on our agenda."
"I am looking forward with great interest to hearing your answer, Commissioner Reding, because I know that information is also of great interest to you: an interest which we share, moreover, because we are both journalists by profession."
"I believe that we also have the same interest in the Union' s communication and information activities being organised in as close proximity to the citizens as possible and in our applying the policy so that the various groups in society get the information which they most need."
"The keywords are coordination - partly when it comes to sharing information between the Commission and the Parliament - decentralisation, targeting and optimum exploitation of the available information technology."
"I am curious as to how the Commission will go about the task. I imagine that the Commission' s offices in the major European cities will be involved and that they will be assigned tasks and responsibilities and given resources to contact and inform the public at large."
"The experts, the authorities and those who are genuinely interested in the EU should not have problems getting information, and I must admit that I am a little sceptical when I hear about an ""interinstitutional"" library in Brussels or similar central functions."
"I would much rather that the Commission' s office in Copenhagen was a little more accessible."
"It is the Commission' s local offices, in cooperation with Parliament' s local offices, which must meet the man on the street, the man who always thinks that Brussels is so extremely far away."
"He must understand that Brussels means all of us together, as Commission President Prodi put it."
"It is a very difficult task because, in my opinion, the gap between the citizens and the institutions is wide, and with the major challenges which the Union is facing the task will become no less great."
"Enlargement, the Commission' s ambitious 5-year plan, the Commission' s plans for reform, the Intergovernmental Conference: there is a lot to provide information about, and I think that this is an urgent matter."
"I believe that you share many of my views, Mrs Reding."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Andreasen for his question since it gives me the opportunity to express the extent to which I share his views, as, indeed, I emphasised during my hearing before this House last September."
"It is true that there is a gulf between the citizen and Europe."
"It is true that we have all, not just the Commission, but also Parliament and the Member States, made many mistakes in our information policy in the past."
"We must all, not just the Commission in isolation but the Commission in collaboration with the Member States and with Parliament, proceed to examine the matter in depth and develop a new information policy."
"Moreover, let me tell you quite explicitly that I have taken careful note of the problems which exist."
"I must tell you, too, that there are some things which are working well; it is not all bad."
"For instance, we have just started up 'Europe direct' , a new access facility for citizens looking for information about Europe."
"We have our Euro-info-points and information outlets in the Member States, which, generally speaking, are very successful."
"Along with the honourable Member, I admit that we might be able to improve the way they operate, and I shall indeed make every effort to achieve this."
"The honourable Member also mentioned modern technology."
"Obviously, the new information policy which we are going to be implementing will have to optimise the use of all the information and communication possibilities which this new technology makes available to us."
"In my opinion, one of the major mistakes of the past, in our information policy, was the fact that this was often top-down information identified, wrongly, I must say, as propaganda."
"That must be taken into consideration."
"We must take the psychology of the public into consideration and we must ensure that dialogue is established."
"Moreover, I would draw your attention to the fact that my fellow Commissioner, Michel Barnier, and myself, have initiated dialogue on the Intergovernmental Conference which is to follow this new approach, i.e. making contact with the public, with young people and opinion formers, and discussing matters with them, and also approaching locally, regionally and nationally elected representatives on behalf of the Commission, not to make fine speeches, but to discuss things with them and to gain some idea of their general expectations."
"I am, of course, counting a great deal on Parliament to play its part in this citizen information campaign. Parliament is the body which is closest to the citizens, and if all the Members of the European Parliament fulfil their task of informing citizens - and I shall assist them as much as I possibly can to do so - this will enable us to change mindsets."
"We have once again started to work within an interinstitutional working party on 'information' , in which Parliament is represented, and as part of this work, which is a tripartite effort involving the national states, the European Parliament and the Commission, I plan to present a communication to you in the near future outlining a new approach which I shall first present to the Commission, some time before the summer, and which I shall then discuss with you."
"I cannot give you any details at this early stage of the actual proposal, as it is still being drawn up, but I can assure you that the main pillars of this new approach will be decentralisation, subsidiarity, closeness to the citizens, the coresponsibility of the European institutions and the national administrations and also the increased participation of civil society."
"I also think we must all clarify our respective roles."
"Obviously, the Parliament' s role is different to that of the Commission."
"I am deeply convinced that Parliament' s special role must continue."
"Any collaboration in the field of information must allow for the specific character of each institution."
"It is possible to cooperate without the parties involved losing their own identities, but we should nonetheless all work in the same direction and we must know that the closer we are to the citizens, the greater our chances of being comprehensible, credible and effective."
"In order to do so, we must seriously examine the way we are organised, the instruments and procedures we select, what is being done at the various levels, at institutional, national and regional level, and how tasks are divided between the three institutions."
"We must also, openly and objectively, look at our own way of working and examine how we can avoid repeating the mistakes of the past."
"That, Mr President, is what I wanted to say for the time being. Obviously, the discussion is only just being initiated and will not be completed today, because in the very near future we shall be presenting a communication on our new information policy which we are going to discuss in detail with you."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Commissioner Reding for her response to Mr Andreasen."
"We have a very committed commissioner in Commissioner Reding."
"She has a really tough task on her hands but I am sure that she will get the full support that she recognises that she needs from the European Parliament."
"I find myself totally supportive of this motion in addressing the information deficit of the EU."
"The information deficit is actually more serious than the democratic deficit that we often talk about."
"In a sense, the information deficit and the democratic deficit are part of the same problem."
"In the recent past, we have had the Oostlander report in 1993 and the famous Pex report in 1998."
"They have analysed the problem, suggested improvements, but sadly little has been achieved."
"I wish Commissioner Reding well in getting on with this problem."
"This week I had a visitors' group from the Winchester Probus Club, mainly retired people and, in general terms, well informed about world affairs."
"However, you could write what they knew about the aims of the EU on the back of a one euro note."
"Before anyone tells me that euro notes do not exist, it would not make any difference: they could not write anything."
"When I speak to British groups, I often start with the question: do you want to be in the European Union?"
"The immediate response I got this week was: ""No""."
"Five or six years ago, the response would have been: ""Yes, but we do not want too much interference""."
"This situation is getting worse."
"I know that it is a particular problem for the United Kingdom, but it is not exclusive to the United Kingdom."
"It is getting worse right across Europe."
"We only have to look at the turn-out in the European Parliamentary elections to see that."
"Why is this so?"
"Why this lack of enthusiasm for the EU?"
"To begin with, we must remember that the best advertising in the world will not sell a poor product."
"Even if you have a first-class product, if you do not market it properly it will not sell."
"We must make sure that the product is good first and then make sure that we advertise it effectively."
"I fear we are doing neither."
"There can be no doubt that, when history is written, the greatest achievement of the 20th century will be seen to be the creation of the EU."
"It has delivered peace and prosperity for half the continent for half the century."
"Now the other half of the continent is queuing up to get in, yet my constituents want to get out."
"I am not an expert in marketing;"
"I know there are no simple solutions; I certainly know more propaganda leaflets are not the answer."
"Let me just suggest a few possibilities."
"What happened to President Prodi's idea of a rapid rebuttal unit?"
"If it is in existence, it does not appear to be very effective."
"If they are giving answers, can I suggest that they e-mail their answers to the MEPs as well, so we can use the information, not just to the press, who often just spike it."
"The Commissioner said quite rightly that new technology is good."
"We must make more and better use of it."
"We must make sure that our website address is known. we could maybe spend some of the Socrates money giving every student in Europe a computer mouse mat so that they can see the website address of the European Parliament."
"With the plethora of new TV channels, with digital TV, have we got anywhere with a Parliamentary TV channel?"
"I can watch the US Senate on television gavel-to-gavel. But not the European Parliament."
"We must emphasise the good-news stories of when we help the citizen."
"We have a Committee on Petitions that addresses a thousand petitions a year."
"When did the information departments of the Commission or Parliament last attend a meeting of that committee?"
"When did they past publish any of the good news that comes from that committee?"
"Finally, I have to address the problem of Parliament in Strasbourg."
"I am not anti-Strasbourg."
"I am certainly not anti-France."
"I understand that Strasbourg was the symbol of peace and unity of our continent, but that was a symbol of the 20th century."
"In the 21st century, I am afraid it is a symbol of waste and inefficiency."
"I ask Parliament, Commission and the Council of Ministers to address that problem."
"Mr President, Commissioner, firstly I would like to thank you for your interest and dedication to the European Union' s information activities."
"We have known you for many years and we know of your commitment and dedication, not only to what we could call the European cause, but also to ensuring that the European cause really reaches the citizens."
"In your political activities you have always paid special attention to the most sensitive groups: young people, elderly people, the workplace, and you paid special attention to the media."
"We support the general lines which you have put forward here and which will be specified in the document which you will present and which the European Commission must approve next June."
"You have mentioned two aspects which I would like to stress: the regional dimension and efficiency."
"The aim of the information policy is to reach the citizens."
"In order to do that properly it is necessary to take account of the regional dimension, because it is one of the fields which is a subject of great sensitivity in terms of society and its problems."
"Therefore, so that the citizens may understand and participate in European construction and not see it as a superstructure reserved for politicians and technocrats, it is essential that the work of providing information is done at the level of the regional institutions and in conjunction with them."
"This goes hand in hand with efficiency."
"In your review of information policy, I would ask you to bear in mind the experience of certain Member States."
"For example, during the euro campaign, there was an agreement at the time between the European Commission and the government of a Member State."
"That government' s decision was to commission an information campaign on the euro from a very important advertising agency."
"That advertising agency made some very nice advertisements and hundreds of thousands of leaflets were distributed."
"However, that it is not the way to reach the public, nor is it efficient."
"It is perhaps very pleasing to the government, which gets to make fine speeches, and to the relevant Minister, who gets to appear on the television and in the newspapers, but that does not reach the public."
"Therefore, it is necessary to ensure the maximum possible degree of decentralisation."
"Mr President, those of us who represent Scotland in this House were very grateful when this year the Parliament decided to make its office in Edinburgh permanent."
"The Commission has long had an office there."
"The Commissioner has mentioned the importance of national regions, as well as the states, in its communication policy."
"I am sorry to say that this week it has been announced that The Scotsman newspaper is closing down the office of its Brussels and European correspondent."
"It is rumoured that BBC Scotland is about to remove its special correspondent from Brussels."
"That would be a disaster."
"It is not just the Commission and Parliament which need to think about their role."
"Our own media also need to look seriously at the problem of adequately reporting to their citizens the issues of Europe."
"May I mention one other sad case, which is of importance in the area of information and communication."
"I want to draw attention, yet again, to the case of the Italian language lecturers."
"New developments in the case have shown that the quality of openness in information and communication by the Commission on this sort of issue leaves much to be desired."
"In these proceedings it is vital that the interested parties are fully informed by the Commission, but the practice fails to honour that ideal."
"There has been some evidence this week that the former Commission has actively misled parties in cases of this kind."
"During the current Parliament, I have had a number of assurances that the Commission is serious about upholding rights derived from Community law on behalf of lecturers in all issues involving non-discrimination."
"That really must be taken seriously."
"It is a point about openness, about being ready to communicate what is going on and about informing people how seriously we take rights arising from Community law and how seriously we take the need to demonstrate to our citizens and our public the importance of what is accomplished here."
"I am glad that the Commission and Parliament have helped to make information available in Scotland and I wish our own media would do likewise."
"Mr President, a distinction must be made between information and propaganda."
"Mr Prodi' s Commission has started off badly with regard to information."
"I have heard that last autumn it issued an instruction to the national Commission offices to focus on the reporting of political information in place of the former citizens' information service."
"This means information and propaganda from above."
"Actually, this means the spread of propaganda, not information."
"The Commission has started off badly in the most important area of information reporting, that of public accessibility."
"The Commission has issued a draft for a directive on public accessibility, which, by any common yardstick, is an untenable document, more conducive to secrecy than increased public accessibility."
"This is the Commission' s line on information policy insofar as it concerns public accessibility."
"Public accessibility is just as important as information."
"It offers our citizens and the media the opportunity to have hands-on access to documents themselves and draw their own conclusions, instead of being dependent on those of the Commission."
"There is a very obvious discrepancy between the official documents themselves and the conclusions being drawn."
"The documents state that the European Union' s crisis management troops are not a European Army, but the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, says that whatever you call it, it is one."
"In an information context such as this, it is important to have access to the documents and draw one' s own conclusions, as the documents do not always spell things out clearly either."
"In addition, the way Parliament disseminates information must be criticised."
"Parliament has its own information offices, but the Finnish office apparently has no money to buy copies of the EU Treaty, which would allow Members to familiarise themselves with its contents in their office at Parliament."
"It has one Internet connection."
"To this extent, we could conclude that the officials working in Parliament' s own information office do not know what is going on in Parliament, although Parliament has excellent Internet connections."
"To all intents and purposes, it is a war of propaganda that is going on here. In many respects, it is also a civil war."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like once again to point out that Commissioner Reding has announced a dramatic change in the information strategy of the EU and has thus made it clear that there are deficiencies, that fresh efforts must be made and that we must make this issue a focus of our concerns."
"We thank you for this."
"Secondly, I would like to point out that we too must ask ourselves whether this morning' s initiative to prevent voting was a positive information and communication strategy for Parliament outwardly as well as inwardly?"
"I do not think that it was!"
"The homework which we have to do we must do ourselves and we must not confuse information and communication within the framework of our work with self-promotion."
"It is a matter of Community promotion and not self-promotion."
"In this regard we should all resolve to understand that one of the causes of the problems of the political parties and of the institutions is a problem of communication and information."
"We, and I say that very clearly, the institutions of the European Union, the European Parliament and the delegates cannot bear sole responsibility for providing information on Europe."
"Without the support of the Member States, without the support of the public representatives at borough, county and national level, without the support of all the institutions, we will not get directly to the citizen, because either we are here doing our work or we are involved in communication and information processes with our citizens."
"We cannot do both at the same time within the meaning of Maastricht and Amsterdam!"
"Commissioner, I am waiting for your master plan, your schedule, your specific measures for implementation."
"The public mandataries, all persons and institutions who receive money from the EU, should be involved in this implementation."
"We must increasingly involve the visitor groups and also two areas of activity which, in my opinion, are in your sphere of responsibility, i.e. schools and youth, and the staff in the offices of the Community institutions must be equipped accordingly."
"Please submit to us a specific plan of action and a schedule."
"Thank you, Mr President. I would like to express my heartfelt thanks for the commitment of those Members who openly support our action and are willing to further a new policy which will, of necessity, be innovative."
"In any case, this is the impression I gained from the comments of the honourable Members."
"May I first answer Mr Perry."
"He said that the situation is getting worse."
"That is a very negative way of seeing things."
"Probably, the honourable Member is right."
"I just hope the situation is not getting worse everywhere."
"That would be terrible."
"But if it is getting worse anywhere, we have to take that very seriously."
"We cannot just say that it is getting worse and not do anything."
"We have to act."
"The new information programme which is going to be set up and which will integrate all the actors at regional and national level will do a lot of good for the future information policy."
"Mr Perry has addressed three specific points."
"Firstly, the website address should be better known."
"I know about this problem."
"On 3 April we launched the new access facility - Europe direct."
"We will be distributing information about this site to schools and local authorities."
"Regarding a Parliamentary TV channel, the Commission would not object if Parliament proposed such an activity."
"However, I leave that initiative to Parliament."
"Regarding the Committee on Petitions and creating publicity about it, the last time this was done was when I was president of that committee."
"I consider it very important."
"There are colleagues in this Chamber who sat with me on that committee some years ago."
"It is the committee most concerned with the Europe of the citizen."
"If Parliament decided to take action vis-à-vis the citizens by utilising the Committee on Petitions, you can rest assured that the Commission would support it."
"(FR) Like Mr MacCormick, Mr Gasòliba i Böhm touched on a major issue related to the fact that centralising the provision of information is not viable."
"If information were to be issued solely from Strasbourg or solely from Brussels, it would not reach the public."
"I am absolutely sure that, if we want to bring Europe closer to the citizens and the citizens closer to Europe, there must be a regional dimension to the information policy at all levels, including information relating to the euro."
"In practice, the euro cannot be introduced by means of a television programme."
"We must not forget the importance of television but, in addition and above all, we have to keep the people at grassroots informed - to approach the people and talk to them."
"And there are a great many information outlets available to us in our regions, towns and villages which can play a very significant role in this."
"It would be a mistake for a policy to be managed solely by an advertising agency and not implemented at grass roots level in consultation with the citizens directly concerned."
"I am in total agreement with Mr Gasòliba i Böhm when he says that we must integrate this regional dimension into our information policy and, when I discuss the issue with the competent national politicians, I will ensure that this is taken into account."
"(EN) Along the same lines, I say to Mr MacCormick that I find it regrettable if the Scottish media no longer report what happens in Strasbourg or Brussels."
"Of course, I cannot intervene in that respect."
"It is a private decision of the media."
"In any event it is important for all actors, including Members of the European Parliament, to intervene with the media so that they enhance their reporting about Europe."
"Every time I meet with organisations of journalists or organisations of editors, I ask them to give more coverage to the European political level."
"The information office in Edinburgh will not be closed."
"So at least regional policy in this area will continue."
"(FR) Mr Seppänen said that there has been inadequate provision of information to the public and that the Prodi Commission has been too concerned with political propaganda."
"I hope that the honourable Member is wrong and that the provision of information will not ultimately be perceived in this way."
"In any case, the channel which I will announce in the written statement, which I am in the process of drawing up at the moment, is dialogue and direct contact with the citizen."
"I would like to make it quite clear, once again, that the provision of information to citizens is not the exclusive responsibility of the Commission."
"I am convinced that this information service can work properly only if there is close cooperation between the three institutions in question."
"If we do not cooperate, we will fail miserably."
"(DE) I thank Mr Karas for regarding the ways and means with which we will, in future, tackle information policy as a positive approach."
"I strongly agree with him that everyone must take a look at themselves to see where we have gone wrong."
"I have no intention of going into the problems of the information policy of Parliament."
"The parliamentarians must do that themselves, but we should all carry out Community promotion together."
"Mr Karas has quite rightly said that we need the Member States."
"That is also one of the focuses of the new information policy which I would like to introduce in the future."
"We need not only the Member States, but also the associations, regional and national politicians."
"Without them there is no way that we can get our information across."
"There must therefore be a concerted action between the institutions and between the people in our regions, in our States."
"I know that this is easy to say and difficult to implement."
"But unless we at least make a start, then nothing will happen."
"I hope, therefore, that on the basis of the new information policy, which I would like to introduce, this aspect of citizen participation and citizen responsibility for Europe will be strongly emphasised."
"(FR) Mr President, I cannot bring about a revolution single-handed."
"Clearly, I need a large number of soldiers and aides, and I need you, each and every one of you individually, to assist me wherever you have influence or responsibilities in this new information campaign."
"This is a joint effort. It is a great challenge, but I know I can count on your support."
"(Applause)"
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"This is probably the first time I have heard delegates referred to as soldiers, but we know what role we are playing here."
"The debate is closed."
"Mr President, in the heated debate on the matter of the quorum I did not get a chance to speak before about my motion for the Rules of Procedure."
"Yesterday, there was a question from Mr MacCormick on the postponement of the vote on the COM for bananas."
"I share the concerns of Mr MacCormick."
"We requested the postponement so that we could remain involved as a Parliament in the communication process with the United States within the WTO."
"Had we voted in accordance with our Rules of Procedure, we would no longer have been involved."
"That is how it was, Mr MacCormick - he is no longer here."
"I would like this to be recorded."
"It is to do with the fact that we as a Parliament no longer have the right to codecision in the agricultural sector and so we had to choose this path."
"I am taking note of this."
"This will be taken care of."
"I am now giving the floor to Mr Beysen on a point of order."
"Mr President, I have noticed with some degree of satisfaction that the subversive action staged by some of the Members with a view to sabotaging procedures has ground to a halt."
"This will probably be because they have come to realise that they cannot count on the support of at least 32 delegates."
"I would just like to say, Mr President, that some strange selectivity is being practised here, that certain Members stage little acts and, after the act is finished, they leave and the game is over."
"I did want to point this out because Parliament should not be mistaken for a kindergarten, and this is the feeling I will have when I leave this Chamber today."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start the debate."
"Let us not enter into discussion."
"I will tell you what the Rules of Procedure are so that we all know where we stand."
"I am now giving the floor to Mr Van Hulten."
"Mr President, our action is not finished. I simply want to refute that our sole aim would be to disturb proceedings."
"What we do want is to make sure that this Parliament can work more effectively and be more credible for the next five years."
"This is what we are doing. We hope that we can count on the support of all MEPs to arrange the agenda in such a way as to actually make this happen in future, as you explained so well on television this week, Mr President."
"Mr President, I may have been accused of being subversive, but other people appear to disregard the Rules of Procedure. A request to test the quorum should not be made at the start of the debate but when we vote."
"Mr Speroni, let us be absolutely clear about this."
"According to Rule 126(1) of the Rules of Procedure: ""Parliament may deliberate, settle its agenda and approve the Minutes of proceedings, whatever the number of Members present"" ."
"We will shortly proceed to the vote (details will follow), and we will then see what happens."
"I am presiding over the meeting according to the agenda as it is before us."
"I am now giving the floor to Mrs Gebhardt and I hope we will then proceed to the next item on the agenda, which is night flights."
"Mr President, I would like to ask a question, tongue-in-cheek, in the style of Loriot."
"Where are they then? Where are they then, those who say that we should do proper work here, who are always putting the question about the quorum and, when we are doing the real work here, are absent?"
"Where are these 32 and more who stood up before and who will stand up again, but who now, when we are discussing matters, are no longer here?"
"I would really like to know what kind of nonsense this is?"
"Night flights and excessive noise"
"Mr President, to get back to the root of the problem, it has now been established by the various different institutions responsible for assessing disamenities and their impact on the people that the people' s greatest concern is noise pollution. This is completely understandable if we consider that the majority of European citizens are exposed to uncomfortably high levels of noise."
"Under these conditions, the European institutions' delay in legislating is highly regrettable, particularly the Commission' s failure to propose practical measures to combat noise and to set limit values for noise exposure."
"A Green Paper was presented in 1996 and nothing else has happened since."
"It is true that the noise problem is largely due to transport, particularly road transport, but air transport is a factor which is also giving increasing cause for concern."
"The peak levels of noise during take-off and landing are specific to air transport and, of course, this problem is exacerbated by the effect of the noise at night, for it must be admitted that night flights, or rather aircraft taking off and landing during the night, make sleep almost impossible in some areas near airports."
"What has been done to regulate aircraft to date?"
"Standards were last established by the International Civil Aviation Organisation in 1977."
"Therefore, there has been no progress in this area for 23 years, and it is clear that aircraft replacement policies are not in any way motivated by the introduction of more stringent standards, to the extent that our aircraft are extremely outdated."
"The recent Commission communication on air transport and the environment defines a noise reduction strategy based both on economic factors, such as improving air traffic control and airport access, and on fostering progress in technology."
"This is a good strategy which will limit the increase in noise pollution, but in my opinion and, I would argue, the opinion of a good number of Members, it will not allow us, in the short term, to reach our objective which is that nobody is exposed to dangerously or uncomfortably high noise levels."
"Faced with this situation, a number of countries and regions have taken steps to restrict access to airports at night."
"Unfortunately, they have not been very organised about it, with the result that some firms, particularly courier and freight companies, have reacted badly - to my mind, dangerously."
"They are threatening to relocate and this is creating economic insecurity in the regions concerned."
"I therefore feel that harmonisation at European level is imperative."
"Of course, this does not mean demanding uniformity, for regional differences must be taken into account, but there must be a common core in the approaches of the different Member States of the European Union."
"I also feel that the organisation of night air transport activities, which are inevitably going to be noisy whatever the level of technology employed, is certainly something which must be restricted and coordinated."
"I therefore call upon the Commission to take action in this area."
"I made no contribution to this morning' s debate and, with your permission, I would like to say a few words now regarding the vote."
"Personally, I would prefer a vote in which a large number of Members take part to a vote which takes place at noon on Friday in which only thirty or forty Members participate."
"Frankly, that distresses me, for a resolution voted in by only a small number of Members carries very little weight."
"I took part in this morning' s action and I did not appreciate criticism from Members who interpreted it as an anti-Strasbourg manoeuvre."
"I am not at all against Strasbourg: quite the opposite, and I have proved it many times, despite the fact that I am Belgian."
"I do not wish to see Strasbourg cease working normally from Monday to Friday."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Lannoye for this initiative and for launching the debate in this Chamber on this very important matter."
"One of the goals of the Commission communication 'Air transport and the environment - towards sustainable development' is precisely to launch the debate on the suitability of establishing a Community framework for decision-making procedures concerning the operational restrictions to be imposed on airports in the Union for environmental reasons."
"In the course of this debate, which will be held in the different institutions, the Council of Ministers and Parliament will have the chance to express their views on this communication, both in general terms and with regard to specific aspects such as night flights."
"As pointed out in this communication, the Commission does not see how uniform and restrictive rules governing restrictions on use, which would apply to all Community airports, as would be the case, for example, for the general ban on night flights, could provide the most balanced solution to the issue of noise pollution attributable to certain airports."
"The Commission is of the opinion that decisions should continue to be taken at local level."
"However, it also considers that a common framework is necessary to coordinate the procedures adopted in order to reach these decisions so that when a region decides to ban night flights, for example, it does so in the same way as a similar region somewhere else."
"And this framework could make it compulsory for all the interested parties to be consulted, stipulate an appropriate timeframe for adaptation to the new restrictions and establish a common basis for assessing the efficiency in environmental terms of the envisaged measures restricting operations."
"I would also like to touch on the subject of hushkits."
"With regard to speeding up the withdrawal of the noisiest aircraft, the Commission is committed to the work currently in progress within the International Civil Aviation Organisation on drafting a new standard on noise and rules for the withdrawal of the noisiest aircraft."
"If, as we hope, all goes according to plan, this work will result in the 33rd Assembly of the ICAO adopting new, binding international noise regulations in September 2001."
"Compared with the hushkits regulation, which is content to put a freeze on the current situation for aircraft whose certificate has been renewed, genuine international rules requiring the progressive withdrawal of these devices would have greater effect in terms of environmental protection."
"Meanwhile, in view of the United States' refusal to back down over the hushkits regulation, the provisions of this regulation on banning the attachment of these devices will enter into force on 4 May next."
"Given that the provisions governing the banning of aircraft registered in third countries will only come into force on 1 April 2002, the Commission' s interpretation of the conclusions of the 33rd assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organisation will provide all the elements necessary to decide whether it is appropriate to replace the hushkits regulation with rules for progressive withdrawal adopted at international level."
"All this is in the pipeline. The Commission is working on it and would like to thank Parliament for its cooperation on this matter."
"I have received four motions for resolutions in accordance with Rule 42(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The vote will take place after the debate."
"Mr President, noise pollution caused by aircraft is a very topical issue."
"We talked about hushkits not so long ago."
"I understand from the observations made by the Commissioner that the regulation as it has been laid down will enter into force on 4 May next."
"Mr President, it is not only hushkits which are causing us considerable concern."
"In broader terms too, we have to establish that, on account of the increase in air traffic, noise pollution is growing at an alarming rate, especially for citizens who live near busy airports."
"At night time, in particular, this level of pollution is out of all proportion."
"The number of night flights should therefore be significantly reduced."
"But what is meant by night?"
"At Düsseldorf airport, night falls at 10 p.m., according to Mr Florenz."
"We in the Netherlands are far more flexible in this respect. Night does not set in until 1.00 a.m. and we do not actually term it night, we refer to it as the brink of night."
"Mr President, whatever time we are talking about, it means that we need a coherent approach to noise pollution caused by the transport of civilians and freight by air, as the individual Member States are applying very different rules."
"These lead to the direct and undesired effect that airports start to compete with each other. They reason that as long as they are flexible enough, they will get a lot of freight traffic."
"But, at the end of the day, it is the people living near airports who suffer."
"Mr President, so what needs to happen?"
"First of all, all noise pollution, including pollution generated by aircraft, must be tackled at source."
"This means thorough research into low-noise engines."
"This means bans and international standards."
"But it also means that we need European framework legislation which ensures that measurements are taken, standards set, zonal structures put in place in the same way for all European airports."
"What we are asking for - not for the first time, in fact, we did this two and a half years ago in connection with the report on noise pollution which was supported by the late Mrs Carmen Diez de Riviera - is this legislation."
"Commissioner and Mrs Reding - you are representing Mrs de Palacio at the moment - you are saying that this is extremely difficult, but I am not asking you for a ban, or even a night ban."
"What I do want is to keep the discussion around this issue going and to continue where Parliament left off before."
"It was our own amendment, tabled on behalf of the European People' s Party."
"Let us thus fight for a European directive which, thanks to Mrs Loyola de Palacio' s new impetus, ensures that we - at long last - can give our citizens what is theirs."
"That is peace and quiet at night, but this also implies a proper zonal structure, insulation and sound legislation in Europe."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the airline industry has become a growing as well as a thriving industry within the Union."
"This undoubtedly brings many benefits, but there are also many drawbacks."
"I would like to make it clear straight away that, if Europe does not intervene, aspects such as quality of life, the economy and social factors will very much be in the balance."
"The key question is, do we want our citizens to enjoy a good night' s rest, and even day' s rest and, secondly, are we able to give them just that?"
"If you will allow me, I will dwell for a moment on the problem of noise pollution suffered at my own country' s national airport, an airport which, by the way, many of you frequent very regularly."
"The noise pollution at Zaventem has exceeded the permitted levels for a long time."
"The quality of life - and sleep - of the people living in the vicinity is appalling by any standard."
"The solution to this problem has caused great uproar in Belgium and in my government."
"As you know, the Belgian Government embraces people from the blue, green and red sections of the political spectrum."
"Well, when the green Minister had the audacity to propose a complete night ban, all of a sudden, Belgium was not big enough for the fierce discussion which followed."
"Commissioner, you may be red and green in your heart, and I can assure, this is what I am."
"I too want to continue to promote life and the quality of everyone' s existence as the supreme good."
"This is all well and good on paper, but this can be very difficult to implement in practice."
"What is worse?"
"Having a very difficult or bad night' s sleep, day in day out, or suddenly losing your job and your income?"
"Indeed, the parcel company at Zaventem had threatened hundreds, if not many more, redundancies."
"All of a sudden, the trade union and employers joined forces."
"Belgium has meanwhile come up with a solution: a combination of measures which involves a restriction of noise at source, strict supervisory measures and a number of infrastructural planning measures, such as offering insulation to the houses affected."
"It is an improvement, but not a solution."
"Too many people continue to suffer from excessive noise in their bedrooms."
"Nonetheless, Belgium, in tandem with other Member States, has taken on a pioneering role in this discussion and the question is then, will that country, with its businesses and people who work and live there, suffer as a result?"
"We can only avoid this if night flights and noise pollution are tackled at European level."
"This is, in fact, what we are asking for and I am delighted to see that people of all political persuasions in this Parliament are asking for the same thing. I therefore hope that the Commission will be receptive to this."
"Europe will need to resolve the false dilemma that exists of having to choose between the economy and social and environmental considerations."
"We would like a standardised method to measure noise pollution within the Union."
"In this connection, we would also like uniform standards and an effective costing rule."
"In addition, we would like criteria which determine when a night ban should be instituted within the Union."
"In a recent communication from the Commission on air transport and the environment, an initial strategy has already been outlined."
"This is to be welcomed, but it is not enough."
"Firstly, this does not solve the current problem, as Mr Lannoye has already pointed out."
"Secondly, this is simply a communication, but we want hard legislation from the Commission, so that everyone knows where they stand."
"I regret that the Commissioner - the Commissioner who is standing in for Commissioner de Palacio that is - is of the opinion that it is very difficult to institute a night ban."
"I think that, with a little good will, this should be feasible."
"I am looking forward to her reply."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Lannoye stated a moment ago that noise is a problem with all forms of transport, but the problem with aircraft is very specific because it is so concentrated."
"In its communication on airports and the environment, the Commission mentioned a few things about noise, one being - and you also echoed this yourself - that the principle of subsidiarity applies to noise. In other words, it must be possible to implement at local level without the European Union having to regulate everything."
"I would, however, like the Commission' s guarantee that distortion of competition is ruled out. An interesting concept in the communication is the drafting of classification lists, not only for aircraft, but also for airports."
"This would mean that noise-sensitive airports would be distinguished from others and that certain activities could not take place at such airports but could possibly take place at less noise-sensitive airports."
"Mrs Van Brempt already pointed this out: we are faced with a dilemma."
"It is clear that certain businesses and a certain economic sector totally rely on night flights. If we asked them what would happen if there were no night flights, they are bound to say that they would have to close down their businesses, their activities would become pointless and they would no longer be able to offer their services."
"Our question is, therefore: how can we marry the two together?"
"The Commission should then legislate against distortion of competition between different airports in different Member States."
"Mrs Van Brempt clearly stated what the dilemma was for the Belgian Government."
"It is caught between the devil and the deep blue sea."
"As it happens, the Belgian Government has taken a number of measures, but would it not be useful, for example, if the Commission were to compile some sort of list of good and bad airline companies in terms of noise, if it were to draw a distinction between those who do invest in combating noise, those who can present a good record in combating noise and those who cannot, those who do not try their best, and then combine this with measures."
"Because one thing is clear: noise must be penalised."
"Accordingly, it should be more expensive to fly certain aircraft and it should be impossible to fly certain aircraft at night for example."
"A total ban would be ideal, of course, but can we afford this and where could this be done?"
"We would like to have these questions answered by the Commission."
"A European framework is lacking at the moment - and you say yourself that a framework should be in place, but when?"
"When will this happen?"
"We have a communication at the moment and shortly we will have the report by Mrs Lucas on aviation and the environment, but when are we getting legislation, when can we expect a framework which is sufficiently clear for each Member State, so that distortion of competition is ruled out?"
"Would it not be useful, for example, to look at 'best practices' at this stage - to use a buzz word - so that we know what certain airports get up to? This would be some achievement."
"For example, at Schiphol, there is a kind of complaints desk for noise."
"Other airports do not have this but could possibly do with one."
"So why not exchange ideas between the different EU airports, where all of us are faced with the same problem?"
"I would ask the Commission to speed up its process and not to wait for the legislative measure alone, but to set up other initiatives in order to bring people closer together."
"Mr President, Commissioner, yesterday the inhabitants of Strasbourg forced decision makers to reject the well-known air courier firm, DHL' s, plans to set up a base at the Strasbourg-Entzheim airport."
"Now the company is trying to worm its way into the Nancy-Metz regional airport, which it has targeted because of its rural location where, due to the lower population density, there might appear to be less public opposition."
"But this is not the case at all."
"When it comes to noise pollution from aircraft and public health in general, it makes no difference whether an airport is situated in the town or the country: all citizens have the right to a peaceful night' s sleep."
"I could also mention the inhabitants of the areas surrounding Roissy, Satolas and Milan who are protesting. Milan has fallen into the clutches of Trans-European Networks which have failed to take into account the detrimental effect of their activities on local inhabitants' standard of living."
"With air traffic booming and the new economy expanding rapidly, I can foresee a fresh increase in freight in the future."
"The Union must react and the Commission must propose tangible measures in response to the legitimate concerns of our fellow citizens."
"The entire transport policy needs to be revised in order to curb, or even reduce, air transport and related noise pollution."
"No research has been carried out into noise pollution from airports."
"It is essential to transfer short-haul air freight transport to the railways."
"And personally, I am in favour of banning night flights in order to respect the local inhabitants' need for a peaceful night' s sleep, for they already have to put up with excessive noise all day long."
"These three matters genuinely require urgent consideration."
"Mr President, Commissioner, for some time the populations living close to Barajas Airport in Madrid have protested every time there has been an extension of the airport, for various reasons, but mainly because of noise pollution."
"I imagine that other populations living near any airport in any large city will have the same problem."
"I know that in the last two months the Government of Madrid has proposed a reduction in night flights, after 11.00 p.m., but I also know that the measures that have been taken have not had any significant effect on the quality of life of the population."
"Let us hope that it will improve."
"Hence the opportunity for this debate, which we should thank Mr Lannoye for."
"From the joint motion for a resolution, I would like to highlight some of the proposals - please excuse any repetition - which I believe the European Commission should take note of if it wants to reduce noise pollution: a global and integrated framework for reducing noise pollution which should lead to a framework directive with concrete and binding measures; the uniform application of those measures in all Member States so that there are no distortions; a Community framework for the classification of noise which will allow measures to be taken with the rigorous allocation of slots and a reduction in flights; and progress towards the establishment of a common air space, which is not in conflict with local and regional measures."
"In the fifth framework programme for research it would be necessary to carry out an investigation into the design of aircraft, with a view to reducing its influence on noise pollution."
"We should also work towards the reduction and disappearance of night flights and the promotion of the railway."
"In truth, Mr President, if everybody disliked aircraft as much as I do and travelled by rail as much as I do, perhaps we would have fewer problems."
"All of this work should be done in conjunction with the populations and residents' associations which are already pushing, throughout the whole of Europe, as in Spain, for a reduction in noise pollution, other types of pollution and a reduction in the enormous demand for air traffic."
"We should also cooperate in the creation of a noise map in local areas which would lead finally to a serious piece of work on the part of the European Community in favour of a reduction in noise pollution which is increasing as a result of demand."
"Mr President, I live 10 kilometres from Malpensa airport as the crow flies and I spent all my working life as part of an aircraft control team, and I therefore feel very strongly about this issue."
"First of all, I must say that many of the problems are the result of bad planning or no planning at all."
"The airports were built haphazardly and no practical assessment of the environmental impact was made as the towns, or certain parts of them, grew up around the airport structures."
"Regional planning is only a recent introduction, whereas airports have existed for a long time."
"The first flights to operate from Malpensa, for example, began as early as 1910."
"Of course, there are other structures which are public nuisances - landfill waste sites, for example, which are created from old quarries with no planning - but, in the case of airports, we see the consequences every day, or rather we hear them, for they fill our ears rather than offending our eyes."
"In addition, provision of information is poor."
"For example, many fingers are being pointed at cargo flights."
"Cargo flights generate neither more nor less noise than passenger flights."
"The amount of noise depends exclusively on the type of aircraft, not on what is being transported: a cargo Boeing 747 produces much less noise than a passenger Boeing 727."
"Consequently, a thorough knowledge of the facts is necessary even for debating purposes."
"Then the legislative framework is also fairly complicated."
"Here, we have an example of the application of the principle of subsidiarity in its entirety, even extending beyond the European Union, for the standards are established by the International Civil Aviation Organisation, which is a supranational body."
"I welcomed the Commission' s remarks regarding a European legislative framework."
"For example, as has already been said, we need to establish what is intended by the word ""night"" ."
"Does night start at 10 p.m. or at midnight?"
"Does it end at 5 a.m. or at 7 a.m.?"
"This is something to be taken into consideration."
"Another factor is the involvement of the local authorities, for every airport is different."
"The noise impact differs even within the same airport according to the runway used."
"For example, runway 25 of Fiumicino airport is next to the sea and hardly disturbs anybody at all, whereas if an aircraft were to take off from the right-hand section of runway 16 it would disturb half a million people or so from the Ostia and Fiumicino communities."
"Local authority involvement is therefore important, although, I must stress, it needs to be within a general European legislative framework."
"In my opinion, it would, on the whole, be feasible to eliminate night flights and ban them, although, I must stress, this must be done by taking specific local factors and also the type of aircraft used into consideration."
"It should not make much difference whether an aircraft has a built-in silencer or whether its silencer is fitted subsequently: the engine noise can be measured and an assessment made of whether the aeroplane is excessively noisy or not, irrespective of the date of manufacture or the type of silencer used."
"In any case, I would stress that we must not just concentrate on the individual factors in isolation but view the issue as a whole."
"Mr President, noise pollution caused by aircraft is mainly a problem to those living near airports."
"This is, in principle, a localised problem which should, as such, be solved by the competent authority of the relevant airport."
"Different airports are already working on this by issuing flight bans to the noisiest aircraft or by banning certain night flights."
"This solution, however, is not sufficient, since aircraft are produced on a global market."
"Competition hinders such solutions, and creates the side-effect that more noise will be produced at other airports."
"In short, we are simply shifting the problem."
"Technically speaking, the problem is not that enormous."
"By using state-of-the-art technology, it is possible to produce aircraft which generate six times less noise than aircraft thirty years ago."
"Since the life-span of aircraft is about thirty years, the effect of these technical improvements are not felt for a long while."
"The question is whether this long wait is desirable. I do not think so."
"If we actually want to do something about aircraft noise, technical improvements will need to be implemented more quickly."
"The extra cost involved will obviously be passed on to the user, who will pay more for their airline tickets."
"The user should be fully aware of the actual costs of flying, including all environmental costs."
"For the sake of fair competition, this should be done on a global scale."
"The proposal from the resolution, which, among other things, presses for making information on the level of noise pollution around different airports available in a readily understood format, is a step in the right direction."
"I also back the other proposals to reduce noise pollution."
"It should be clear that, ideally, the actual environmental costs should be brought into the equation."
"Mr President, Commissioner, your comments this morning on both subjects showed that we need not only rapid data highways, but also efficient air transport in Europe to remain competitive."
"It is obvious that this will lead, in our densely populated States, to increasing noise pollution for citizens."
"I support all those who have stated here that solutions can only be found jointly."
"I come from the region around the Cologne-Bonn airport, an extremely densely populated region."
"We have tried to restrict the noise pollution for citizens."
"Every major attempt was simply answered by the companies with the announcement that they would switch to another airport."
"The airports of Liège and Maastricht are within a radius of almost 200 km."
"The companies are really not bothered about where they start and land their cargo planes, in particular."
"For this reason, I would like to urgently request that we find joint solutions which achieve both objectives: a competitive airline industry in Europe and adequate noise protection for our citizens in the vicinity of airports."
"However, I have surmised, Commissioner, from the Commission' s report that some basic conditions for this have still not been met."
"Firstly, it is obvious from the report that there is still no common method for calculating aircraft noise and, secondly, there is still no common method for monitoring basic data."
"I therefore come to my request: you have proposed specific measures to the Commission in your report."
"You have also set deadlines: the year 2001 for expiry of the old specification on noise emissions for old aircraft equipment."
"You have announced a strategy, which I welcome, for how the burden on particularly busy airports can be eased on the basis of objective data."
"However, you have not set any deadline for this."
"My request to the Commission is that, together with the regions, you set deadlines, in the interests of both the companies and the citizens affected, which we can all work towards in a team effort."
"Commissioner, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this matter of night flights and, more generally, noise pollution from aircraft taking off and landing at airport complexes is an extremely sensitive issue and embraces several areas of concern which require attention."
"This sensitive issue takes us back to a recurring problem faced by all decision makers and politicians, whether they are local, national or, nowadays, European, and that is the problem of how to reconcile economic development with the need to safeguard the health and the standard of living of our fellow citizens."
"In effect, this embraces the three fields of technological, economic and regulatory considerations."
"Although progress has unquestionably been made on the technological side, further progress is still essential in order to renew fleets of aircraft, particularly freight aircraft."
"The European Union must continue with its endeavours in the areas of research and technological development, equip itself with the means it needs to produce the standards envisaged, and give financial and technological support to all studies and programmes which make shared information available and which facilitate the modernisation of equipment with a view to limiting environmental disamenities."
"However, at the same time, we have to take into account the economic aspect of the issue."
"Airport complexes are hives of intense economic activity and appeal; our intention to preserve jobs, reasserted in Lisbon, means that we do not have the right to avoid this issue."
"Any use of existing structures and the establishment of new infrastructures must conform to the legal instruments - the area-specific land use plans and national and regional development rules."
"Finally, in terms of regulation, in the absence of standardised European rules, strict harmonisation of air traffic control and restrictions must be achieved in order to prevent dumping within the Union, a phenomenon familiar to us, which is governed by decisions taken simply at local level."
"We cannot allow this to continue. The citizens are waiting for decisions to be implemented within the relatively near future."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to make a few brief comments with regard to our joint resolution."
"We are discussing night flights, noise pollution and especially sleeping disorders."
"As a researcher who has examined the social effects of industrial labour, especially shift work, for years, I appreciate - and this has also been adequately proven scientifically - the seriousness of sleeping disorders and lack of sleep."
"Against this background, the entire discussion is relatively serious, bearing in mind Mrs Oomen-Ruijten' s comments on ""the brink of the night"" and the way we are discussing noise pollution, and the lack of harmonisation."
"In the foreseeable future, we will discuss at great length the more general aspects of aviation and the environment within the committee, including the common noise classification schedules, how to provide economic incentives in connection with noise and how to achieve aircraft noise standards."
"However, one thing is still lacking from the discussion, namely that we will need the political courage to talk about restrictions, bans if necessary, for night flights during a certain period and reach common agreements on this."
"Mr President, it is certainly not a coincidence that so many Belgian Members have taken the floor during this debate today."
"The problem of night flights in a densely populated country such as Belgium is a very topical and extremely sensitive issue, especially since the Belgian Transport Minister issued a ban on night flights in Zaventem which, following a hefty row within the government, was withdrawn soon after."
"I believe that Mrs Van Brempt has outlined the dilemma very expertly."
"Tens of thousands of people live and sleep a stone' s throw away from the runway."
"15% of the population are suffering as a result of the noise pollution generated by aircraft."
"Medical reports have shown that people living near airports are having to deal with health problems of an unacceptably serious nature, such as insomnia, high blood pressure, stress and depression."
"Needless to say, it makes no sense to ban night flights in one Member State alone."
"Businesses, such as DHL, will then simply move to airports in other Member States."
"As a result, we are at risk of finding ourselves in a downward spiral, where the citizens' quality of life is pulled down with it."
"Mr Sterckx has already pointed out, with good reason, that measures to reduce the effects for those living near airports should not promote distortion of competition."
"The increase in the number of noisy, obsolete and unlisted Russian aircraft, in particular, is the cause of unacceptable noise pollution, not to mention the risks for the environment and safety which such aircraft pose."
"In my town, Ostend, where the airport is situated in the centre of town, there have already been over 50 incidents, so far only leading to material damage."
"I therefore concur with Mrs Oomen, who advocates uniform framework legislation, which will reconcile the economic and employment interests with the care for public health, the environment and safety and which will apply to all airports within Europe."
"The much publicised and promised common framework for noise classification of aircraft could not be here soon enough, Commissioner, especially given the Russian situation."
"I also hope that the European Commission will not budge one inch from the position it has adopted with regard to hushkits and will not succumb to American pressure."
"Finally, I would like to ask that special attention be paid to the specific problems which smaller, regional airports have to contend with."
"They are fighting to remain profitable and are even unable to make the necessary investments to reduce noise pollution."
"This is why I would ask Europe, where possible, to help out in order to guarantee the viability of airports, but especially the quality of life of those living near them."
"Mr President, I have taken careful note of all the comments made by the Members and I will pass them on to the Commissioner responsible for transport."
"Parliament' s message was very clear, as might have been expected, for most of the Members who spoke represent the interests of citizens who live very close to airports."
"On the other hand, it was pointed out, and very rightly so, that airports represent major economic factors and that, if we start to impose bans, there is a serious danger that this will have adverse implications for employment."
"Of course, the question which arises is how to reconcile economics with preserving the standard of living."
"Clearly, the level of noise pollution from night flights varies from one airport to another, according to the topography of the areas and population density."
"This is why, for the time being, the Commission is not going to place a blanket ban on these flights."
"Moreover, very few airports in the Community impose a full curfew: Paris-Orly is the only one to impose a total ban on night flights."
"Munich and Berlin-Tegel limit night operations to mail freight."
"A general ban on night flights would therefore seriously disrupt air transport activities."
"Most large airports place restrictions on the use of the noisiest types of aircraft or employ economic instruments in order to limit their use."
"There are, effectively, a number of alternatives to banning night flights used by various airports, all compatible with Community legislation on market access."
"A notable example is the use of a noise quota system such as that employed by the London airports, or a ban on using the noisiest runways during the night, which one very well-informed Member referred to."
"In addition, the use of flight paths which generate less noise pollution, avoiding sensitive districts during take-off and landing, and the application of differentiated airport tax, calculated according to the environmental characteristics of the aircraft, are some of the solutions currently employed."
"The question now arises of how to proceed in the future, and, most importantly, when to act."
"Pages 34 and 35 of the communication on air transport and the environment contain an action plan setting forth a precise schedule."
"I will not bore you with the details."
"You have the documents in your possession."
"The Commission has absolutely no intention of postponing decisions on this matter indefinitely."
"It has committed itself to precise deadlines."
"With regard to the regulatory framework, we aim to present it at the end of this year, or early next year at the very latest."
"This harmonised framework could include common reference points for measuring the operational noise levels to be limited or prohibited, a provision allowing operators sufficient time to come into line with the new operational restrictions and the establishment of a right for people living near airports to request consultation and negotiations on noise reduction objectives."
"The economic measures proposed also provide for differentiated treatment of airlines according to the characteristics of their aircraft."
"In addition, the Commission envisages the development of a code of conduct based on current best practice."
"I would also like to reply to the question on the drafting of a new noise standard."
"The ICAO is currently working on drafting a new standard, and this is long overdue, for the present standards date from 1977 - ages ago."
"Given the long life of an aircraft - thirty years - clearly, the effects of a new standard will only be seen in the long term."
"This is why we are insisting on the fact that these new standards should be sufficiently ambitious to counteract the environmental effect of the fast-growing air industry."
"In the short term, the Commission considers that rules stipulating the progressive, but rapid withdrawal of the oldest and noisiest aircraft are the best solution, especially for airports whose capacity is restricted by environmental constraints."
"And the best way to ensure the environmental efficiency of these rules is to act at a worldwide level within the framework of the International Civil Aviation Organisation, as the Commission is doing, in tandem with decision making at a purely European level."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"Mr President, in principle, we should proceed to the vote."
"It appears that the joint motion for a resolution is approved by all the political Groups."
"There are therefore no complications and there are no amendments."
"I would, however, like to request that the vote be deferred, if only out of a desire for consistency with this morning' s events, and also because it would be fitting for a resolution as important as this to be voted in by more than 40 or 50 Members."
"Mr Lannoye, I understand that you are moving that the vote be adjourned."
"You know very well that this motion is to be made either by 32 Members or by a group."
"Are you moving this on behalf of your Group?"
"Mr President, I am, of course, making this request on behalf of my Group."
"In this case, Rule 146 of the Rules of Procedure applies."
"This means that one speaker in favour and one speaker against may take the floor in respect of Mr Lannoye' s motion to adjourn the vote, and the majority here in the Chamber will then decide."
"- (PT) Mr President, I would like to support this suggestion. I do not wish to be associated with the sabotage that was perpetrated today."
"I think that the person who decided on this course of action should have said whatever he wanted to, but he ought to have allowed the sitting to continue normally. He ought to show respect to his fellow Members such as myself, a Portuguese person, who will put up with a lot, but I am here to work."
"I do not understand at all how, after what happened, this House can have chosen not to vote on the resolutions on Ethiopia, which are urgent, and have allowed itself to proceed to other votes."
"I find this quite incomprehensible and I think that it makes this Parliament and us look ridiculous."
"This is a matter which has extremely serious political repercussions!"
"This was the speaker against."
"Is there anyone who would like to speak in favour of the motion?"
"I am giving the floor to Mr Blokland."
"Mr President, I would like to back Mr Lannoye' s motion."
"I think that if there are fewer than fifty Members in the Chamber, it is unfair to vote on such a significant issue."
"This is why it is important that this Parliament make a clear statement, and a clear statement is only possible if a large majority of this Parliament is present, and not just fifty Members."
"We have now had a speaker in favour and a speaker against."
"We will now proceed to vote on Mr Lannoye' s request to adjourn the vote on this item on the agenda."
"(The request was rejected) We shall now proceed to the vote."
"Joint motion for a resolution on night flights and noise pollution in the vicinity of airports."
"Mr President, various Members, such as Mr Beysen, who has disappeared and reappeared in the meantime, and Mrs Gebhardt, have already remarked that there are fewer Members in the Chamber than earlier this morning."
"It is clear to us too that there are now even less than half of the Members here than there were earlier on."
"The Members who have left are a mixture of Members who supported me in my request for a quorum and those who heavily protested against it."
"It seems to me to be a good thing that this debate has got under way and I would like to extend warm thanks to the Members who supported me in this."
"I also welcome the fact that, clearly, the choice is not about retaining or abolishing Fridays, but very much about improving the present situation."
"Mrs Buitenweg, we are voting at the moment."
"We will not enter into a debate on Friday sittings."
"If you have a request on a point of order, I would ask you to submit it now, if not, I will now proceed to the vote."
"Mr President, I accept the vote which has just been held and that a decision has been taken to vote now."
"I would like to point out, however, that the voting will be by roll-call."
"This is very important because it will then become clear how many Members were present and, more importantly, how many have left."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we will now attempt to hold an orderly vote."
"This seems to me to be in the interest of the good Rules of this House."
"We are going by the Rules."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Mr President, I would like to say something about the Rules of Procedure which I think is very important given that the MEP, when she asked for a quorum, cited that it is her right under the Rules of Procedure."
"That is correct, even though I do not approve of her behaviour politically."
"But she has now said something which must be objected to in respect of the Rules of Procedure, namely that we will now see from the numbers how the importance of this vote is to be assessed."
"I do not consider this acceptable."
"Under our Rules of Procedure a vote is fully valid if it has materialised in a proper fashion, even if those who requested that the quorum be determined were no longer able to do this because there were no longer enough of them."
"Even then a vote is fully valid."
"Mr Posselt, you are absolutely right."
"It is a fact that all votes are valid, irrespective of the number of those participating."
"The legality of this vote is thus beyond dispute."
"Mr President, we all have experience of trade union movements, national parliaments and so forth."
"The reason for rules of procedure is that they guarantee democratic principles and obviously if, at some time, someone wishes to highlight a particular political problem, then they are perfectly within their rights to do so."
"If, however, a right is somehow abused, I am not sure if that abuse has anything to do with democratic ethics."
"I am speaking on a more general note here."
"In other words I am not sure if, in the final analysis, it has more to do with being obstructive than with proving that there is indeed a genuine problem."
"What causes me particular regret is that we all have experience of national parliaments and so on and this sort of abuse rarely takes place."
"Mr President, I have already asked for the floor four times this morning in order to point out to those Members who expressed irritation at this morning' s events that, ever since the first day of the new parliamentary term, we have requested more clarity regarding Fridays, i.e. to have either a proper meeting or no meeting at all."
"I think that the problem could be solved very quickly if we could schedule the votes for the end of the session, like all the other days, and ask for everyone to sign the attendance register at the end of the day."
"It would then become clear if we would be prepared to consider this a proper meeting or not."
"I therefore recommend that this problem be raised in later proceedings so as solve this Friday problem once and for all."
"Mr Meijer, I would thank you and other Members for their creativity in coming up with solutions to this problem."
"This will not help us any further this morning."
"All that remains for us to do this morning is to apply the Rules of Procedure in an honest and transparent way and, as such, I am at your service and at the service of the Rules of Procedure."
"Needless to say, I will refer this morning' s course of events to the President and the Bureau, upon which the competent parliamentary committee will deal with this matter further."
"This is clear enough, I think."
"I would now like to proceed with the discussion of the next item on the agenda, so that we can debate its content."
"Let us move on to the next item."
"The forestry sector after the December 1999 storms"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following oral questions to the Commission:"
"(B5-0217/2000) by Mr Savary and Mrs Gebhardt, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the problems in the forestry sector following the storms in December 1999;"
"(B5-0219/2000) by Mr Daul, Mr Martin and Mr Redondo Jiménez, on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"Mr President, I welcome this point of order, for foresters and the forestry sector cannot wait for the outcome of these rather irregular debates which can only have one effect today, and that is to send out a message proclaiming that the European Parliament is made up of absentee Members, whereas most of our fellow Members, including those here today, are certainly not relaxing in front of their televisions but are working in the field."
"The issue is wider than that."
"In reality, this is nothing more than a feature of the anti-Strasbourg sniping which has developed."
"Let us be completely clear about this and not try to pretend it is otherwise or to evade the issue."
"Thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak on the forestry sector."
"As it happens, we already expressed our sympathy, as we are wont to do, in a resolution of 20 January 2000, and requested that the Commission supply us with certain information and undertake to help those of our citizens - and they were numerous - who were in difficulties, for this disaster affected the whole of Europe."
"Now, four months later, we are sufficiently removed from events to be able to learn both from what has been done and what has not, and we are expecting a tangible response from the Commission to this question."
"Did we actually intervene?"
"Did we employ the means available to us?"
"This time, we are not claiming appropriations for exceptional circumstances under the ""natural disasters"" heading."
"The sector is simply assessing the extent of its difficulties and the resulting risks - economic risks, security risks, that is to say fire risks, and also risks of non-reforestation, for if it is not possible to remove the wood in the coming weeks, many foresters would prefer to leave them where they are, and then the forestry sector will be in permanent difficulties, and with it the primary processing industry."
"Four months on, the purpose of this oral question is therefore, Commissioners, to inform you, first and foremost, that the condition of the forestry sector is critical."
"In the space of two days, 193 million cubic metres of timber have flooded the market."
"The first question is that of price control and regulation of the market, since the cost of removing some low-quality species is now more than the market is willing to pay."
"We are familiar with the regulation of the market in the context of the common agricultural policy."
"We are not asking you to include timber in that policy, but it appears that Europe could have employed equivalent measures to assist the timber market during this exceptional crisis. It could have temporarily regulated the timber market for a period of several months."
"The question has been put to you."
"What action are you going to take?"
"Secondly, what have you done and what have you achieved with the means available?"
"I refer to the means which allow us to grant exemptions from the competition laws to help exporters, for the cost of transportation of timber which has been exposed to fungal or parasite risk is totally unacceptable, provided that there is a buyer."
"If we want to support the market, we must support the transportation necessary for export to places further afield."
"Is the Commission prepared to take steps to do this?"
"To what extent has it implemented Article 87(2) of the Treaty, which allows it to grant exemptions?"
"To what extent, if at all, has it approached the WTO to request it to grant derogations?"
"What has it done to set up means of remedying the natural disasters affecting the forestry sector?"
"These are not virtual instruments."
"We have rules, such as Article 30 of Regulation 1257/1999."
"If it has not done so, what action does it intend to take in the forthcoming weeks?"
"The matter is urgent."
"Finally, I call for the DOCUP development plans to give unequivocal consideration to the forestry sector and the timber industry."
"Mr President, I would like to inform the honourable Member that the Commission is quite aware of the extensive problems caused by the hurricanes at the beginning of December 1999 in Denmark and Sweden and at the end of December 1999 in France and Germany, the devastating effect on the entire forestry industries of these countries and the implications for those employed in the industry."
"May I refer you to Mr Barnier' s speeches at the plenary sitting of 18 January 2000, when he stressed that the Commission would willingly employ every available means to assist the Member States."
"Nevertheless, with regard to forest damage, I must also remind you that the European Parliament, notably in its resolution of 31 January 1997 on the forestry strategy of the European Union, and also the Council of the European Union, have repeatedly stressed that the Treaty does not lay down any specific competence for a Union forestry policy."
"Thus, the European Union does not have the necessary means to intervene in the way stipulated by the two resolutions."
"In effect, timber is not among the products listed in Annex I of the Treaty. There is no legal framework and timber cannot therefore be governed by a specific market policy, even temporarily."
"Although such actions are theoretically possible under WTO regulations, well-defined, solid legal, economic and commercial grounds would be necessary to persuade our trading partners to accept them."
"To date, the Commission has not received a detailed analysis justifying its taking such a step."
"I will come back to this point in a moment."
"It is therefore, first and foremost, national aid to the timber industry which is the most appropriate means, at national, regional or local level, of supporting the worst affected forestry sites in the industry, and the Member States have to decide on the procedures for providing this aid."
"The Commission is therefore currently assessing the national aid systems notified to it by the national governments for alleviating the effects of hurricanes on the forestry sector according to the effects on competition at European level."
"The departments of the Commission are assessing these aid systems, particularly in the light of Article 87(2b) of the Treaty, which governs the compatibility of the aid envisaged by the Member States in the event of natural disasters."
"The aid programmes notified by the French Government do, in fact, contain a general measure supporting the windfall transportation which may result in some of the timber being transported to countries outside the Union."
"The Commission stresses that Article 87, paragraph 2b of the Treaty does not constitute an exemption from GATT regulations as such, and we and our legal departments are assessing the compatibility of this measure with the Treaty on the basis of recent information."
"The French authorities may be requested to provide further information."
"With regard to the joint financing of aid programmes proposed by Member States under Article 30 of Regulation EC/1257/99 on support for rural development from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF), I would further stress that the Commission is prepared to be extremely flexible."
"However, it is first of all up to the Member States to amend their initial programmes."
"In the meantime, two Member States, including France, have presented their adapted programmes, which now include a substantial section on bolstering the forestry industry following the storms at the end of 1999."
"In this context, actions are proposed for the removal, storage, transportation, protection and replenishment of the devastated forests in order to support the sector."
"These dossiers are currently under negotiation between the Commission and the Member States, but I can state here and now that the Commission' s attitude is favourable."
"I have received five motions for resolutions in accordance with Rule 42(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The vote will take place after the debate."
"Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate you on the way you handled the debate this morning."
"You encountered a storm and weathered it without the help of the Commission."
"But Commissioner, I would also like, and I feel that this is essential, the institutions of the European Union to bear witness to the solidarity which unites the Member States, in particular in the event of exceptional disasters such as the storms of 26 December last which caused such unprecedented damage to a number of forest regions in France, Germany and Austria."
"There is an urgent need for us to begin using the instruments available to the Union to assist the affected regions and support the individuals and companies concerned. The need for our support is all the more pressing given that transportation, storage and forest exploitation cannot be delayed without serious consequences in terms of both the quality of the products and the restoration and protection of forest ecosystems."
"Thus, in the Alsace region alone, more than 6.5 million cubic metres of woodland has been devastated, which is essentially equivalent to one to three years' harvests."
"Clearly, the influx of timber onto the market will send prices plummeting and so further damage the industry' s economic operators."
"Once again, the way that the sector is structured may facilitate the search for joint solutions between the upstream operators which manage forestry resources and the downstream operators which exploit them."
"The inter-trade system introduced in France can certainly play a major part in the search for, and development of, these joint solutions."
"Indeed, since they are designed not to protect the interests of any one section of the industry, they facilitate the protection of the industry as a whole, promote the timber sector and ensure respect for the great internal balances which make it possible to consolidate the whole."
"Although regional in scale, inter-trade bodies also have a local impact and are immediately efficacious in critical situations such as that of our forestry companies and the timber industry."
"We should therefore favour direct contacts with potential partners, even more so given that inter-trade bodies are also the consultative partners of local governments and national authorities with regard to defining forestry policies and hence with regard to the search for immediate solutions to crises."
"They are also able to identify bottlenecks in the implementation of safeguard programmes."
"This is why I ask you not to disregard direct consultation with the industry' s operators in your consultation mechanism."
"Moreover, regulations can be a constraint which varies according to the State in question, as is, notably, the case with regard to grain storage, in respect of the impermeability of the ground, the water sampling limits, which are set at 5% of the low water discharge in France and 30% in Germany and waste disposal monitoring."
"I therefore feel that exceptional measures should also be implemented."
"The scale of the disaster shows that the aid pledged by the State or confirmed at local level will not be sufficient to cover the damage reported."
"It is therefore essential to be able to draw on the Structural Funds to finance special measures for forests and the timber industry in the case of disasters in objective 2 or former objective 5b areas."
"The same applies to rural development measures and other, more specific, economic or environmental programmes, in parallel with actions for using up workable timber, which represents about 50% of the windfall."
"It would also be desirable to promote incentive measures for using the poorer quality wood for energy production."
"However, the urgency of the situation calls for flexible, simplified procedures to financially supplement the provisions already introduced by the Member States"
"I therefore call upon the Commission to seek consensus with the industry as a whole and the Member States concerned in order to find effective, immediate solutions, for the greater the consensus, the more effective the solutions will be."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I experienced the storms of Christmas day 1999 in my home city of Paris and only managed with extreme difficulty to return on the same day to Germany, where the forests were unrecognisable."
"Further south-west, in France, my parents spent many days in the dim light of the petroleum lamp which I had given to them once as a present."
"We do not know when and in what form the next disaster will strike."
"Permit me, therefore, to say something about the current problems and to expand on one aspect of the comments of my fellow MEP and friend, Gilles Savary."
"It concerns point 8 of the joint motion for a resolution in which we ask the Commission to create instruments which make it possible to take rapid and effective action within the European Union if we are faced with a crisis situation as a result of accidents or natural disasters."
"We presently have neither the money nor the infrastructure for this."
"We should not in future rely on cross-border neighbourly aid as in the case of the storms at the end of the year."
"It was offered on a voluntary basis in an exemplary manner."
"It is also a healthy and important expression of solidarity."
"However, in itself it does not constitute a European solution."
"The European Union must take full responsibility for its citizens."
"The Commission must, therefore, quickly rack its brains to find instruments for rapid and effective emergency aid."
"We will expect proposals for solutions soon."
"We need have no qualms about making these proposals unconventional and bold."
"There will certainly be no lack of support from the European Parliament."
"The time has come to move on."
"But first we must sort out the current consequences of the Christmas storms."
"This involves three things in particular."
"Firstly: we must not let the timber market collapse and must, therefore, directly intervene on behalf of the many small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Secondly: we must, as an exception, also support necessary transportation and exports of valuable timber to third countries."
"The Commission must urgently discuss the approval of export subsidies with the WTO."
"Thirdly: we must do everything we can to counter the risks of fungus, pest and fire so that the damage does not become even worse."
"Commissioner, when you say that national aid is the important thing now, then I would say to you that this also means that, in this instance, you do not want to organise the common European market."
"Commissioner, Mr President, it is true that your news and your message are extremely disappointing when we think of the emotional concern shown at the damage caused by the storms last December."
"Mr Barnier was very emphatic in his speech, assuring us that the European Union was, in effect, going to do something to help the victims."
"By victims I mean the small-scale foresters who have been ruined, but I am also referring to the small seaside businesses who now have to face the influx of tourists."
"Well, now we know that forests do not fall within the remit of the European Union."
"So we are going to use part of the Structural Funds to finance emergency aid in the event of natural disasters."
"Yet we are well aware that this will take time."
"And, in this regard, may I say that the European Union' s policy consists of robbing Peter to pay Paul."
"We cannot support this policy, for it amounts to depriving some to provide for others, to the detriment of future projects."
"In my opinion, this is really not good enough, and we expect tangible measures from the Commission."
"The citizens are calling for immediate action."
"Mr President, the document on the difficulties faced by the forestry sector following the storms in December 1999 only refers to the damage caused to the wooded areas in order to better illustrate the price drops in the timber sector and the implications for foresters and timber exporters."
"The resolutions deal mainly with the regulation of the timber market and export subsidies."
"For my part, I would like to speak up on behalf of forestry workers, who receive no mention at all, even though it is their efforts which are keeping the timber sector going."
"The storms were more than just an environmental disaster for all of us and an economic problem for the profiteers of the timber sector."
"They have resulted in a sharp deterioration in the working conditions of foresters and lumberjacks, whose jobs are extremely dangerous at the best of times with the very highest accident rate which will continue to rise."
"The discomfort and danger involved in their profession is illustrated by the fact that there were over 100 casualties in the 1990 storms in Germany."
"The forestry workers' salary is shamefully low - a mere 6900 francs."
"They are calling for a decent salary which offsets the risks involved in their job."
"They are demanding to be able to retire at 55 and calling for an improvement in their working conditions, which are still antiquated and result in the physical deterioration and sometimes death of a number of workers each year."
"We support these legitimate claims."
"Mr President, in relation to the storms which occurred last December, the Community did not match up to our expectations during the initial emergency period and now it is late in fulfilling its promises of aid."
"The Commission has a duty to learn the lessons of the storm disaster, and strengthen the effectiveness of Community texts."
"Between the initial emergency period and the current challenges, with problems in the transportation, storage and sale of wood, there is a chronological gap corresponding to a gap in institutional support."
"This must be remedied and the States concerned must be awarded logistical support in the follow-up to the initial emergency period."
"In its resolution last January, Parliament asked the Commission to submit practical proposals if it were found that the funds available for aid were insufficient."
"So what has become of these famous practical proposals?"
"The Commission should use these proposals to prioritise its reaction to the slump in wood sales, for what we had feared is actually taking place, and it is becoming impossible to sell wood."
"And what measures has the Commission taken or planned to promote the immediate cultivation of damaged plots of land, without which the effective reconstruction of our forests cannot begin."
"Sadly, one merit of this ordeal is that it will have reminded us that wood is an industrial raw material, one that is, furthermore, essentially renewable."
"The sustainable and efficient management of our forests requires an economically viable forest."
"Similarly, only sustainable forestry can provide a proper foundation for a competitive wood industry, while making a crucial contribution to the development of rural areas."
"The Member States are, and must continue to be, the main operators in forestry policy in Europe."
"This must not, however, stop Europe pursuing the coordinated management of forestry issues."
"The sometimes extremely binding regulations governing the single market apply to forestry products."
"In return the Community must provide support for these products, especially at times of crisis."
"Community action in favour of the forestry sector is appropriate inasmuch as it creates added value for the national action which has been undertaken."
"This is an ideal justification for the principle of subsidiarity, for instance in matters of protection against atmospheric pollution and forest fires, or forestry certification, and also in matters of support for the implementation of a world convention on forests."
"I support the Community initiatives in favour of the tropical forests, but I am astounded that there is not the same enthusiasm to come to the aid of our own devastated forests."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is now some three months since Hurricane Lothar caused devastating damage to forests in Europe, and in particular France and Baden-Württemberg."
"In Baden-Württemberg alone the accumulation of storm wood runs to about 25 million solid cubic metres."
"This equates to three times the average annual felling and this has already led to 30% lower timber prices."
"Just the cost of remedying the damage in Baden-Württemberg, the area for which I can speak as the delegate, runs to about DM 1.5 billion, of which DM 300 million are needed simply for reforestation."
"However, Hurricane Lothar is not a problem specific to Baden-Württemberg."
"France and other EU States have also been greatly affected."
"Nevertheless, the Commission has so far refused to make additional budgetary allocations available and prefers to cite, in this instance represented by Mrs Schreyer, the fact that final agreement has already been reached in the European Parliament on Budget 2000 and that the requirement for additional funds should be covered by the Member State in question from the funds already allocated."
"However, the redistribution of funds was made subject to approval and this approval has not yet been given."
"I consider the argumentation of Mrs Schreyer to be somewhat cynical when you consider that, only a few days later, she announced that the additional financial requirement of EUR 300 million for the EU Balkan commitment, which is undoubtedly important, would be covered by EUR 300 million from the agriculture budget without the farmers noticing it, and this includes forest owners."
"I would like to stress once again that we are dealing here with extremely long-term damage which may also have ecological implications."
"Tidying up, storage and reforestation all involve intense physical work."
"Commissioner, I know what I am talking about."
"I am a farmer."
"I have seen how the hurricane took the roof off our stable and I have seen the state our private woods are in."
"We were able to put things right ourselves but, by and large, this is not the case for all areas, all persons, all communities."
"You can see that."
"But that this is done quickly and efficiently and, above all, is sustained long term is an ecological necessity."
"During his visit to the Black Forest on 16 February, the Commissioner for Agriculture, Rural Development and Fisheries, Dr Fischler, indicated broad flexibility within the existing financial framework for measures for rural development."
"He indicated, as you have today, Commissioner, that you are willing to give consideration to, to help ..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, the natural disaster which overtook European countries was tragic."
"I am in complete agreement with the Members who have spoken on the matter and, believe me, the Commission would love to be able to do something about it. Yet neither the Treaties nor the budgetary regulations provide for this possibility."
"As I said before, no Community framework exists which would allow the Commission to adopt initiatives to provide direct aid to the forestry sector."
"Moreover, the same applies within the framework of Regulation 1257/99."
"It is the Member State itself which has to adopt the necessary initiatives and provide for appropriate aid."
"According to the principle of subsidiarity, the Commission cannot direct resources from the rural development programme towards channels supporting the timber industry following storm damage."
"The Commission cannot apply competition regulations to authorise national aid or joint financing initiatives under the provisions of Regulation 1257/99."
"Moreover, negotiations are in progress with the Member States and I have made it quite clear that, within its institutional and legal capabilities, the Commission is doing everything in its power and more, and is being as flexible as it possibly can."
"It is unfortunate that the institutional authorities have decided that forestry policy is to be governed by subsidiarity, and that it does not fall within the competences of the Commission but is wholly the responsibility of the Member States."
"This is something which the Commission cannot change for the moment for that would mean amending the Treaty, although reform of the Treaties is currently being discussed."
"I therefore call upon all Members who are convinced that subsidiarity should not apply to forestry issues but should be the remit of the Community to make representations to their national governments to this effect."
"Commissioner, you have been extremely active this morning."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"Joint motion for a resolution replacing the resolutions on the economic effects of the recent storms on the forestry sector in Europe"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Declarations of vote and other declarations"
"Mr President, I voted in favour of this resolution and I am glad that those behind the sabotage which, from 9 o' clock this morning, prevented us from carrying out our work properly and voting are no longer present to turn this Parliament into an undignified circus."
"Imagine if other citizens were to go about their work in the same way as those delegates who think that they have a four-day week here, even though the five-day week for the plenary meeting was agreed in Strasbourg."
"This Parliament has actually agreed, and I also say this to the delegates over there who want a democratic vote, that Friday will be a session day in Strasbourg."
"It is indeed a strange concept of democracy, and this also applies to the others who instigated this circus, if the opponents of Strasbourg are now using genuinely dirty tricks to sabotage Fridays."
"I was a Member of this Parliament 35 years ago and in all my time I have never seen such abuse of the Rules."
"One really should expect delegates to respect a democratic decision reached by majority, such as that concerning our session calendar, even if it does not suit them."
"But they are bad losers and they really do not care that they have prevented important resolutions being taken for the citizens of the EU and, in particular, those who are starving in Ethiopia."
"This latter point is especially grave and reprehensible."
"I hope that those who instigated this procedural circus will be punished by the voters."
"In the interest of forest owners, including in my own State where, to be fair, the last storm disaster was not as devastating as here, for example, in Alsace, I hope that measures will be taken by the EU, as proposed here, in order, above all, to prevent small and medium-sized enterprises going under ...."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, I would very quickly like to go back to the events which took place during the explanation of votes or during the point of order this morning."
"I am very new to this Parliament and I would just like to express my deep disappointment at the incident."
"Of course, I respect the Rules of Procedure and democracy, but the strategic, political action of a mere forty or so Members has prevented us from voting on Ethiopia."
"On behalf of this Parliament, I would like to apologise to the people of Ethiopia, to the men, women and children who are suffering in a tragic situation and in relation to whom Parliament was prevented from adopting a position this morning."
"I am extremely concerned."
"We were able to vote on the last two items, which were also urgent, but, in all honesty, I would have preferred to have voted for the people of Ethiopia and to have lent them the support of this Parliament."
"Once again, I apologise to the people of Ethiopia."
"Mr President, I would like to support what Mr Daul has just said."
"For me also the timber trade is something of great importance, but then our aid to Ethiopia is equally important."
"For this reason I would like, and I attach great importance to this since you did not previously allow me to speak again when Mrs Buitenweg falsely quoted me, once more to clearly ask: where are those who this morning arranged this whole theatre?"
"Why are they not here now at the end of the session, proving that the work of Parliament is genuinely important to them?"
"That is the real question."
"Mr President, like everyone else, I am deeply concerned about the situation we have landed up in."
"I find it disagreeable to have taken part in the votes we have had when there are so few of us."
"In actual fact, I abstained from voting in all our votes this afternoon because I did not think that I wanted to be involved and participate in making decisions which are as illegitimate as I believe they must be when there are so few of us."
"I support the protest action which has been taken here today."
"I am a new Member and therefore a little shocked when I hear that the unsatisfactory state of affairs which prevails on Fridays has been going on for years, unchanged."
"If that is the case, vigorous protests are certainly needed so that we can bring about a change, for matters cannot continue like this."
"We shall be a laughing stock throughout Europe."
"I notice that, today, we are concluding this sitting with approximately fewer than 40 Members here to make decisions."
"It is disgraceful."
"Mr President, firstly, I voted in favour of the last motion and the amendments thereto."
"That was the formal declaration of vote."
"I would like to rid certain people here of the misconception that those who took the initiative for quorum counts are no longer present."
"It is true that some have left."
"But I am one of the people who took the initiative and I am still here, just as I am here every Friday."
"I have noticed that some people say that there are people who are after a four-day week, but I am certainly not one of them."
"I am, however, of the opinion, that we need to work a proper five-day week, which is not happening at the moment, if the number of MEPs in attendance today is anything to go by."
"And this is why the problem has arisen."
"If Fridays were like Tuesdays or Wednesdays, then it would not have been necessary to have this debate and the counts here today."
"This will now have to be carried through to the moment at which Fridays either run in the normal way or, due to a lack of interest, they are abolished, which is once again a likely scenario."
"- (PT) Mr President, I would firstly like to explain why I voted the way I did: I voted in favour of the joint motion for a resolution because I agree with the serious concerns and actions it puts forward, although this does not represent a change in my Group' s position."
"Our position is that we have concerns about the Union' s courts having responsibility for forestry policy."
"Nor can I fail to mention the fact, which has already been referred to here, that the saboteurs of this morning' s sitting did not take part in the vote, and I am delighted that the PPE has suggested a nominal vote, which will clarify the matter."
"There is a French saying about the arroseur arrosé - the biter being bit. Here we have the saboteur saboté - the saboteur hoist with his own petard."
"It is deplorable that we have been involved in this circus."
"Those concerned could have made a point of order, since it is an important issue that the Bureau and the Conference of Presidents have to address."
"But they went too far. They showed no consideration for Ethiopia and sabotaged the votes."
"They then suggested a nominal vote so a count could be taken."
"As we can see, however, when we take a decision here on an issue related to storms, disasters or Europe' s interests, that is, serious matters, they are no longer present."
"Almost none of the 32 gladiators were present for the final vote, which is utterly deplorable and which clearly reveals the true intentions of those who destabilised this morning' s sitting."
"Mr President, I would like to say to Mr Daul and Mrs Lulling that, in debates on the Rules of Procedure, you must always bear in mind that there are also tactical and strategic aims coming into play."
"It is no different for you than for those colleagues who tried what they did."
"For the first time this morning I joined in the request for the quorum to be established."
"I am a supporter of Strasbourg and a supporter of Fridays."
"However, I am of the opinion that those who wish to ensure that the work of Parliament continues to be carried out should also be present."
"I therefore thought to myself that a warning shot was in order; what then happened I thought went too far and I did not want to fall into line because I thought that it was about Strasbourg and Fridays."
"For that reason, I did not go along with it any further."
"But the fact that those delegates did what they did you have to grant them."
"You then have to respond accordingly."
"The Rules of Procedure, and I would like to pay my respect to the President here, were sensibly interpreted this morning with great composure and great calm."
"Matters proceeded as was established."
"The votes which were carried out are proper votes."
"They are no less valid because only a few delegates participated."
"I consider that, by exhorting our colleagues, and also the Groups, to be present, we should try to rescue these Friday debates and these Friday votes and to bring about a positive outcome."
"Mr President, I would first of all like to thank the President of this eventful sitting, the Members present and Mrs Reding."
"Commissioner, with regard to the forestry issue, I would like to say that, although your openness has sometimes made your words difficult to accept, you have, at least, been frank, in contrast with those declarations made at the time of the incidents, which may have been rather rash."
"I sincerely feel that your approach is far more beneficial to the credibility of the European Union than the tone of the declarations made when the issue first arose, which led us to believe that Europe was much more involved than it actually intended to be."
"The subject of the forestry sector is now open to debate, and we must take up the issue of natural disasters as well, for we cannot endeavour to draw closer to our citizens and then explain to them that we are unable to help them when they are in trouble, while, at the same time, we are sending task forces abroad."
"This is a matter of genuine symbolic and political significance."
"So thank you."
"I would like to express my support for the comments of Mr Daul, who worked together with Evelyne Gebhardt to draft this resolution on the timber industry, and to express my regret and shock at the fact that we have exploited the plight of the people of Ethiopia to further our petty games."
"Petty games which are not acknowledged, moreover, for although, effectively, the right does exist to request that the quorum be tested and also to bring up the issue of Friday working, it is blatantly obvious that this morning' s events were an attack by the anti-Strasbourg faction."
"And, even more seriously, it appears that this incident may well be repeated every Friday."
"We do, however, have one small consolation in that it will not be long before their refusal to participate affects those who were conspicuous by their absence today and who managed to derail this morning' s sitting."
"We simply need to return to the issue of the agenda again as soon as possible."
"It is a well-known fact, and I am publicly admitting it before all those here today, that the Chamber is never full because Parliament' s work is specialised."
"Nevertheless, we must stop trying to hide..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, I would like to remind the House that, several months ago, Parliament rejected an amendment calling for Friday sittings during plenary sessions in Strasbourg to be abolished. At the very least, one would expect Members to abide by their vote."
"This amendment was rejected by a large majority."
"Therefore, we cannot now make any changes to our practices for the year 2000."
"Finally, I would like to join the Members who have spoken in expressing my profound shame at the incident."
"Parliament was prevented from voting to send aid to Ethiopia by petty political issues."
"I feel truly ashamed."
"Mr President, I, too, regret the actions which prevented this House from working this morning."
"However, I welcome the fact that all those who have spoken before me also condemn the manoeuvres and they are the hardest-working Members of this Parliament."
"I feel that we must be constructive in learning from this morning' s events."
"In the first place, we have a Treaty and positions of the European Parliament in favour of Friday morning sittings. We must enforce the Treaty and the European Parliament decisions."
"I call upon Parliament' s Bureau to charge the relevant Committee to examine the Rules of Procedure and any practices of the European Parliament which might penalise Friday morning meetings in Strasbourg, for we should, on the contrary, be making every endeavour to enhance their status."
"Mr President, I too would like to congratulate you on the way in which you have conducted this difficult session and I would just like to say something factual to my colleague, Mr Meijer. I have been in this House for 21 years in all, although only 6 of those as a parliamentarian."
"I have taken part in every Friday session for 21 years, even when I had another job and was not a delegate."
"In this regard, I would also like to thank the staff who work so exceptionally on Fridays."
"However, irrespective of that, I would like to say that I have repeatedly seen such attempts over these 21 years."
"For this reason we introduced a quorum for determining the quorum because we wanted to rescue Fridays."
"That is how all this came about."
"However, I would like to say to Mr Meijer that at some point it was also decided that we would pass legislative resolutions from Tuesday to Thursday and not on Fridays, for which the quorum is not prescribed as compulsory, when we would deal with issues which are not controversial so that resolutions which are not controversial, but important nevertheless, can be passed."
"That was the consensus, and this consensus was reached here."
"Perhaps it is a healthy shock and Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf is perhaps right."
"But I would ask you to clearly understand that Friday was never intended for legislative resolutions. These resolutions are not legislative."
"They are, however, important and they are consensual."
"We should therefore be able to pass them peacefully and in a dignified manner, and that is why, at the end of the day, we have passed them peacefully and in a dignified manner."
"Thank you, Mr Posselt."
"Adjournment of the session"
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"(The sitting was closed at 12.25 p.m.)"
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 14 April 2000."
"Madam President, I would like to make a statement on this International Press Freedom Day on the situation in Tunisia and request that you intervene."
"I will do so when you consider it to be appropriate."
"Thank you, Mr Barón Crespo."
"I have taken note of your proposal."
"Madam President, I rise to speak on the same matter."
"We have just learnt that the brother of Taoufik Ben Brik has been sentenced to three months in prison."
"Everyone here realises that this decision makes the situation critical as the Tunisian journalist had announced his intention to continue his hunger strike until he died if his brother were imprisoned."
"I have just read the piteous appeal that Taoufik' s young brother has made to the Tunisian journalist to urge him nevertheless to end his hunger strike."
"I therefore feel that the immediate future could be decisive in terms of reminding the Tunisian authorities of their responsibilities."
"That is why I join my friend, Mr Barón Crespo, in urging you, as I did in a letter yesterday - and the situation has become even more urgent given recent events - to use your influence and your authority to obtain a fair and speedy solution to this tragic case of the violation of human rights and freedom of the press."
"Madam President, I am going to raise a point of order in the literal and true sense of the word."
"I am referring to the disarray in Parliament' s calendars and agendas, at least for this current year."
"For example, on 19 April, I received an e-mail from the Quaestor, Mr Richard Balfe, which stated that that day was a restricted day and that the meetings planned for that day were cancelled."
"On 13 April, we had received a departmental note stipulating which days were holidays and which were not."
"I would ask Parliament' s competent bodies to plan and draw up timetables a year in advance, although I understand that unforeseen circumstances may require subsequent changes."
"However, to change dates, as this departmental note indicates, to introduce holidays which did not exist before, is a serious lapse in planning in an institution with 600 MEPs and thousands of employees."
"I would kindly request a little attention and organisation in relation to annual planning."
"Mr Valdivielso de Cué, I promise you that I shall look into these matters very closely, but Mrs Banotti would like to take the floor to answer you in her capacity as quaestor."
"Madame President, many colleagues have approached me about misunderstandings relating to signing-in yesterday."
"I would just like to say that I propose to raise this matter with the Bureau this evening."
"There was definitely a misunderstanding and many colleagues, in order to be here for the plenary today, had to leave home yesterday and incur the usual expenses."
"So I hope we can raise this at the meeting of the Bureau later today."
"Thank you, Mrs Banotti."
"We will have the same situation on Whit Monday."
"We will certainly have to keep a close eye on that."
"Madam President, I wanted to take the opportunity to inform you and the other delegates of the fact that Mr Paul van Buitenen, the Commission official who, as you know, has played a not insignificant role in the uncovering of the previous Commission' s failure, received a royal honour in the Netherlands last week."
"I would like to add in all modesty that at least in the Netherlands, his work has always been - and still is - greatly appreciated."
"Madam President, I want to mention the publication of a very important report a fortnight ago from the European Committee for the prevention of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment."
"The report is to the Spanish Government on the visit to Spain by the European Committee at the end of 1998."
"The report is accessible via the Internet, as is the Spanish Government' s response."
"A week ago, a Spanish Court sentenced five former government officials, including a Civil Guard general, to up to 71 years in prison."
"The sentences ended the second so-called ""dirty war"" trial and added weight to allegations that a dirty war, sponsored by the former Socialist government of Filipe González, was waged in the early 1980s."
"According to the international agencies, Associated Press and Reuters, two youngsters of 20 and 21 years of age were driven across the border into the Spanish Basque area where they were tortured for several days."
"They were both killed by a gunshot to the head."
"All seven defendants were absolved of charges of torture and belonging to an armed group."
"The sister of one of the victims told reporters that it was shameful that they were not convicted of torture."
"It is important to know about this matter."
"Madam President, coming back to a point that was raised earlier on: 9 May is, as you know, Europe Day and Parliament will be closed."
"There is, however, a meeting of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market being held on that day."
"Will members of the public be allowed to attend that meeting as observers or will they be barred from entering the Parliament?"
"Thank you, Mr Miller."
"The answer is yes: the public will be allowed to attend the meeting."
"Madam President, when, on the last day of the last part-session in Strasbourg, it appeared on several occasions that we did not have the quorum required for voting, I suggested to the President of that sitting, Mr Wiebenga, that, from now on, we ought to carry out all the Friday votes at twelve noon or at the end of the sitting on Fridays, just like on the other days, and not get the attendance registers signed until the Members leave, with a note of the time of their departure."
"Mr Wiebenga has announced that this matter will be referred to the President and the Bureau."
"My question to you is: has the Bureau looked into this matter yet?"
"I can tell you that I have indeed received Mr Wiebenga' s letter and that this matter is on the agenda for tonight' s meeting of the Bureau."
"As you can see, we have not let the grass grow under our feet."
"Mr Barón Crespo, I can tell you that following the letter written to me by Mr Wurtz, I have already drafted a letter to the Tunisian authorities, stating what you and Mr Wurtz wanted."
"I think that this is the right time to make your statement, if you want, which we can then append to the letter to the Tunisian authorities."
"Madam President, Tunisia is a country which has an association agreement and a very close relationship with the European Union."
"Article 2 of that agreement establishes, by common agreement, the importance of respect for human rights and democratic principles."
"However, since the beginning of April, we have witnessed a situation involving a hunger strike begun by a journalist, Mr Ben Brik, which is causing a serious crisis of conscience and a violation of the association agreement by the Tunisian Government. It has not only forbidden Ben Brik from writing as correspondent for the French newspaper La Croix, but it has also taken away his passport and prevented him from using the telephone."
"I should also add that the Tunisian Government has hindered the work of those journalists trying to cover this situation and has treated them intolerably."
"Therefore, Madam President, I believe that we should clearly point out to the Tunisian Government, which is a friendly government and is associated to us, that this behaviour is not only incompatible with our association agreement, but that also, as Mr Wurtz has rightly pointed out, that this situation should not be allowed to continue and is leading Ben Brik' s relatives to endanger their own lives in defence of these rights."
"Therefore, Madam President, I believe, given that there is no possibility of making sufficiently quick progress with parliamentary procedures, that this House should trust you to intervene on our behalf in order to put an end to this situation and to make the Tunisian Government see sense."
"Thank you, Mr Barón Crespo."
"It goes without saying that before this letter is sent to the Tunisian authorities, I shall discuss the matter with the Chairman of the Delegation for relations with the Maghreb."
"I did not indicate my request to speak earlier because one of the administrators of our Group had, before the sitting, already indicated to the President and Bureau that I wanted to table a point of order."
"I do not know whether we will be able to include an item in the agenda for this part-session to the effect that we should be provided with information on the state of the euro, which is a cause for concern, or whether we should endeavour here and now to ensure that the issue is included in the agenda for the next Strasbourg part-session."
"It was reported in the news this morning that the euro has already fallen below the psychological limit of 90 cents, which augurs even more worrying and serious falls in value."
"We cannot continue to put up with a lame currency."
"Somebody has to give an explanation and announce measures that can restore minimum levels of psychological confidence in what has now become the common currency of many of the Union' s Member States."
"I would like to draw the attention of the President and the Bureau to this point, so that our Group can, in good time, and if it should prove necessary, take steps aimed at altering the agenda for the next Strasbourg part-session."
"I have also heard that, this morning, a Commissioner attended the meeting of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"Is the chairman of this committee in a position to provide information to the House on the Commission' s views on such a critical situation?"
"Thank you, Mr Ribeiro."
"As you will be aware, we have tabled a debate on Mr Duisenberg' s report for the next part-session in Strasbourg."
"I think that this major debate will entirely meet your expectations."
"Madam President, my Group intends to request that, in the debate on monetary policy, a Commission statement on the information policy that it is planning on the euro be added."
"I would like to point out that we must not be influenced by information which is not only alarmist, but sometimes hasty, with regard to the euro, and that we must not focus solely on the progress of the euro' s parity with other currencies, such as the dollar."
"We must take account of the state of the European economy and also the possibilities created by the euro."
"It seems to me that in this respect we should be as aggressive in our defence of the euro as our counterparts in the United States Congress are in defence of the dollar."
"Madam President, I agree wholeheartedly with Mr Barón Crespo' s last-but-one speech on Tunisia."
"Furthermore, I am delighted to see that the Socialist Group has finally decided to adopt a rather more forthright position on Tunisia, a position that, moreover, goes far beyond the complex situation of Mr Ben Brik. Nevertheless, Madam President, I did not understand your speech."
"As you are proposing to write to the Tunisian authorities, an action I fully support, I feel that you should do so in order to state Parliament' s position on the matter."
"I therefore fail to see why you should append the position of one particular group to the letter."
"You are quite right, Mr Dupuis, and that is why I said that I would immediately be discussing the matter with the Chairman of the Delegation for relations with the Maghreb so that we can plan an approach which will be both forceful and well coordinated."
"Withdrawal of Mr Le Pen' s parliamentary mandate"
"Madam President, in these circumstances Parliament has powers which are fully regulated, in the absence of a uniform electoral system, by means of Article 12 of the 1976 Act concerning the election of representatives of the European Parliament by Direct Universal Suffrage, of which paragraph 2, which I will read in French, since that is the text I possess, says:"
"""Lorsque la vacance résulte de l'application des dispositions nationales en vigueur dans un État membre, celui-ci en informe le Parlement européen qui en prend acte"" . [ ""Where a seat falls vacant pursuant to national provisions in force in a Member State, the latter shall inform the European Parliament, which shall take note of the fact"" .]"
"We are therefore talking about a formal and fully regulated competence."
"In fact, Madam President, in accordance with our Rules of Procedure, it falls to the Legal Affairs Committee to examine these issues, but those Rules also stipulate that, on the basis of a report by the Legal Affairs Committee, Parliament shall proceed without delay."
"We are clearly dealing with an issue which cannot be delayed, since the presence and the right to vote in this Parliament of an MEP who is no longer an MEP would be a completely irregular state of affairs."
"For that reason, Madam President, as soon as I received a note from the competent departments, I called a meeting of the Legal Affairs Committee, which will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m."
"Thank you, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, and thank you for having made yourself and your committee available to us."
"Mr Gollnisch, pursuant to which rule do you wish to make a point of order?"
"Madam President, I would like to speak pursuant to Rule 6, in the first instance, and then, if you permit me, to Rule 7(4)(2), but I shall be brief and to the point."
"I think that this does, nevertheless, merit one and a half minute' s explanation."
"I think that you could allow me that much time."
"In what will, I stress, be purely a point of order on the provisions of our Rules of Procedure, I should like to mention certain matters, which are not related to the crux of the issue, but which are related to the procedure to be followed in this case, which, I am sure you will all agree, is extremely serious."
"First of all, I would like to refer to Rule 6. Rule 6 incorporates the provisions covering the waiver of parliamentary immunity into our Rules of Procedure."
"I would simply point out to the House that, in the criminal proceedings that led the French government - wrongly, in my opinion, but that is not the issue here - to withdraw Mr Le Pen' s mandate, in contravention of the French Penal Code, the courts made no request for Mr Le Pen' s immunity to be withdrawn."
"In my opinion, through its abusive interpretation of the idea of what constitutes a crime, this action is in violation of the protocol on the immunities granted to Parliament and of Rule 6 of our Rules of Procedure, which I invite you to read and note well, ladies and gentlemen."
"You will see that it is a serious matter."
"Secondly, Madam President, I would like to remind Mrs Palacio, in particular, although I am sure that she is familiar with them, of the provisions of Rule 7(4)(2)."
"This provision has recently been incorporated into our Rules of Procedure to cover precisely this type of case, following the precedent set by our colleague, Mr Tapie."
"This is what Rule 7 states:"
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr Gollnisch, You have exceeded your allocated speaking time."
"You yourself said that you were asking for a minute and a half in which to make your point of order."
"Mr Le Pen, who will be heard tomorrow in the Committee on Legal Affairs, will explain the whole case and we will do things in complete accordance with the regulations."
"I really cannot let you speak any longer."
"It is quite out of the question."
"This is not the time to debate this matter, Mr Gollnisch."
"Madam President, you have given the floor three times to Mr Barón Crespo, although these interventions were not tabled on the agenda."
"I ask you to give me a few seconds in which to finish what I have to say."
"(Mixed reactions)"
"If you have any respect for your position and for the rights of Members..."
"I have the greatest respect for my position."
"You yourself said that you were requesting a minute and a half in order to make your point of order."
"That time is up."
"Mr Le Pen will explain the entire matter to the Committee on Legal Affairs tomorrow."
"Review of the financial perspective"
"The next item is the statement by the Commission on the review of the financial perspective."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for giving me the floor to tell you about the Commission' s decision concerning the review of the financial perspective."
"Let me begin by taking this opportunity to inform you of another decision which the Commission took today."
"The Commission today decided to appoint Mr Carlo Trojan Head of Delegation in Geneva as of 1 September this year and Mr O' Sullivan Secretary-General as of 1 June this year."
"Mr Levi, formerly Spokesman for the Commission, has been appointed Director of the Forward Studies Unit."
"Mr Jonathan Faull, formerly Head of the Press and Communications Service, will henceforth - and for a transitional period - act as the Commission Spokesman."
"All these staffing decisions were taken as part of the reform of the Commission and I think they were the right decisions in the context of the further reform measures that are needed."
"The Commission thanked Mr Carlo Trojan sincerely for his activities."
"May I add, speaking also as a former Berlin politician, that I too want to thank Mr Carlo Trojan most sincerely for the great commitment he demonstrated during the process of German unification."
"Let me make it quite clear here that it was partly thanks to this commitment that the European Parliament and the Commission immediately rendered so much assistance to East Germany."
"Madam President, I will now turn to the Commission' s decision concerning the revision of the financial perspective."
"That decision was necessary to secure financing for the new political priority, the new highly political task of providing assistance to the Western Balkans region."
"Many of this Parliament' s resolutions have emphasised how important the European Union' s commitment to the Western Balkans is to the future success of the EU' s foreign policy, and the Council has also constantly stressed its importance at various summits."
"That is why now is the time to safeguard this task from the financial viewpoint."
"In the financial perspective, the financial plan for the European Union, which the Council decided on in Berlin in March 1999, the effects on the Balkans were not anticipated."
"Let me remind you that the Berlin decision on Agenda 2000 was taken on exactly the same day as the outbreak of war in Kosovo."
"When Parliament, jointly with the Council and the Commission, adopted the interinstitutional agreement on Agenda 2000, the following statement was annexed to it at Parliament' s instigation: ""In view of the development in the Balkan situation, particularly in Kosovo, the two arms of the budgetary authority request that the Commission, when needs have been ascertained and estimated, submit the necessary budget proposals, including, if appropriate, a proposal for a revision of the financial perspective"" ."
"On 16 December last year, at the time of the decision on the 2000 budget, the budgetary authority once again called upon the Commission to submit a multiannual financial plan for a programme of assistance for the Western Balkans and, if necessary, depending on the amount required, to submit concurrently a proposal on the review of the financial perspective."
"The decisions the Commission has taken today are a response to the requests made by Parliament and the Council."
"The starting point for the Commission' s proposal is the following question: what resources will be required for the programme period - i.e. up to 2006 - to meet the substantial financial assistance needs of the Western Balkans?"
"By the Western Balkans I mean Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Serbia and Montenegro, Kosovo, and also the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia."
"We need to submit an integrated aid programme, while each country' s participation in that programme will be conditional upon compliance with certain criteria concerning the development of democracy in the region, the rule of law and the will to cooperate."
"The programme the Commission is proposing forms part of the stabilisation and association process and is designed to make financing available for the reconstruction and stabilisation of the region, for the promotion of democracy and the rule of law, the development of a market economy and the development of cooperation between the recipient countries themselves and also between them and the European Union."
"Let me now give you a few figures, for whenever we discuss the budget we must, of course, quote actual figures."
"According to the Commission' s estimates, the financial requirement for Albania, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia and also Montenegro up to the year 2006 will be EUR 1.5 billion, i.e. around EUR 200-230 million per year."
"Late last year, we received a very precise study from the World Bank and the Commission regarding the financial requirements for reconstruction in Kosovo, a study which showed that, over the next three to four years, the financial assistance required will total USD 2.3 billion, and the Commission, i.e. the European Union, agreed to fund half that requirement from the EU budget, in other words approximately EUR 1.1 billion."
"As I pointed out, the Commission proposal focuses particularly on the need for the regions to cooperate with one other, which is why special funding is to be provided to that end."
"The Commission proposal also makes provision for including financial aid for Serbia to the tune of EUR 2.3 billion in the financial plan."
"In this regard it is clear, of course, that these EU budget resources can, and must, only be allocated if there are signs of progress towards democracy in Serbia."
"The Commission is convinced, however, that if we decide the financial framework at this stage, that will send an important political message to Serbia. It will make it clear that it is not just a question of making promises to the Serbian forces of opposition, but that preparations are also being made to provide immediate assistance on the ground once the necessary changes are in place."
"With regard to the amounts involved, let me tell you the following: the Commission estimates the total requirement for the region at EUR 5.5 billion from the EU budget."
"The financial plan in Agenda 2000, which was adopted in Berlin, already includes some EUR 1.8 billion; these resources were earmarked for Bosnia-Herzegovina."
"Today, the Commission decided to propose reallocating a further EUR 1.4 billion of aid from other foreign policy budget lines to the Balkans."
"It therefore proposed and decided to reprogramme the budget for external actions, as I will describe in more detail in a moment."
"The view of the Commission is that we will have to raise the external action ceiling here for the next few years by EUR 300 billion a year."
"In this connection, the Commission made the following proposal on financing this additional requirement: in the years 2001 and 2002, these resources should be taken from resources previously earmarked for agricultural policy and reallocated to the external action heading."
"I have already had an opportunity to discuss this proposal here in Parliament."
"At this point let me repeat that this measure does not mean undoing the agricultural policy package decided in Berlin."
"And it certainly does not mean curtailing the direct income subsidies for farmers."
"Let me point out that, overall, the agriculture budget totals EUR 44 billion, which makes it clear that reallocating EUR 300 million has no impact on the overall agricultural package."
"This amount will have to be financed in the year 2001, among others, from the savings resulting from the euro-dollar exchange rate."
"After all, the current exchange rate value of the euro means very substantial savings for the European budget with regard to export financing."
"For 2003 onwards, the Commission proposes that the decision on financing the necessary resources should be taken in conjunction with the already scheduled mid-term review of agricultural policy."
"Let me point out that the Commission is also proposing to the budgetary authority that the external action appropriations should only be increased once resources for Serbia can indeed be allocated."
"This is therefore a decision that establishes a framework for the years to come."
"In relation to the re-programming of external action appropriations to which I referred, let me summarise the situation as follows: the Commission proposals always took account of the geopolitical importance of each region."
"We did not propose any cuts in programmes aimed specifically at combating poverty in the world and the proposals also took into account whether some programmes were not fully taken up in the past, i.e. the administrative activities and the relevant administration' s implementation of these programmes in the areas concerned were examined."
"The necessary redeployment is the result mainly of comparable cuts in the TACIS programme for the countries of the former Soviet Union."
"But let me point out that, in relation to the Mediterranean region, the Commission proposal provides that in this coming period - i.e. up to 2006 - the resources available for the MEDA programme will be increased overall by 13% compared with the previous period."
"Let me conclude by pointing out the following: there is another point where the decision on the revision of the financial perspective also responds to a request by Parliament."
"In connection with the 2000 Budget, you proposed that, in future, the appropriations allocated for Cyprus and Malta should no longer appear under the external action heading but be reclassified under the pre-accession aid budget, so as to make it clear that we have a coherent plan here; that these are appropriations that will be spent with a view to the desired accession of Cyprus and Malta to the European Union."
"I think that will make the financial planning even more transparent."
"In many regards, today' s Commission decisions satisfy some of Parliament' s key requests; we have complied with these requests."
"That is why I ask you to support the Commission proposal on the review of the financial perspective and hope you will do precisely that!"
"Madam President, I thank the Commissioner for that report."
"There were not a great many surprises in it and, to some extent, I welcome that."
"A question remains, however, in relation to redeployment in Category 4."
"I heard you say there would not be cuts against the poverty lines."
"You mentioned lines where there was not complete take-up and that there would be cuts in TACIS."
"Can you give us some idea whether there will be any across-the-board reductions?"
"Last year, the Council proposed a 10% across-the-board cut in Category 4."
"Is the Commission making selective reductions as you suggested or will they be making any across-the-board cuts in Category 4?"
"I am still unclear as to what happens from the year 2003."
"If you are taking money from Category 1 for the next two years, where do you expect that money to come from in 2003?"
"Mr Wynn, I can give you a definite answer to your first question as to whether the Commission is proposing across-the-board cuts in the external action heading: no, it does not propose to do so."
"I would regard that as the wrong approach."
"We have enough criteria according to which we can carefully assess to what extent we need to shift appropriations compared with Agenda 2000."
"So these proposals are entirely justified and no across-the-board cuts are being proposed."
"On your second question: the Commission is proposing to shift appropriations from agricultural policy to foreign policy for the years 2001 and 2002."
"The Commission' s proposal for the years from 2003 is as follows: we are looking to increase the amount for foreign policy, which, in arithmetical terms, would, of course, mean raising the overall ceiling."
"But the Commission is proposing that both arms of the budgetary authority should try to make savings in particular areas during the annual budgetary procedure in order to find these 300 million."
"It could also be that in connection with the mid-term review of Category 1, scheduled for the year 2003, it will be proposed that these additional appropriations be financed over the entire period."
"Let me stress once again that, in my view, we can finance this increase in foreign policy resources within the overall ceiling decided in Berlin and that the appropriations for Serbia should only be disbursed once we see real democratic developments there."
"Madam President, I was extremely interested and curious to hear what Commissioner Schreyer has just said."
"I must say that we would have preferred to be presented with a written text, but it appears that these ideas have been the subject of internal debates within the Commission and that we will therefore be given a more specific text to study at our leisure."
"Having said that, I fail to see your grounds for considering that agricultural expenditure is not going to be used in its entirety, as it should, nor how you could release sums, that you describe as minimal, for the heading covering international actions and foreign policy."
"During the last financial year, we instead felt palpable tension regarding market expenditure and I do not understand what intellectual grounds you have for considering that too much money is being allocated to agriculture, apart from the fact that you need money for the foreign policy heading."
"Secondly, the same applies to the cuts under heading 4."
"You tell us that there is such a thing as interregional solidarity."
"Fine, I can accept that, but what gives you the right - you spoke of very specific criteria, so tell us what they are - what gives you the right to think that too much money has been earmarked for other parts of the world, apart from the fact that you need that money for Kosovo."
"I think that this is a genuine problem."
"I will conclude with my third question."
"I should like to know whether, in the undertakings concerning aid that we gave at the donor conference, we made commitments in US dollars or in euros?"
"Given the state of the euro, I should like to know, if it was in US dollars, how you are dealing with the resulting situation and how you plan to guarantee that there will be strict parallelism between the donations made by the European Union and those made by other donors within the international community?"
"Mr Bourlanges, to answer your last question, the World Bank' s estimate of the requirements in Kosovo was indeed expressed in dollars."
"We had an opportunity to go into this in depth during the 2000 budget discussions."
"In its proposal the Commission has now allocated EUR 1.1 billion for the period 2000-2006."
"It is not therefore charging appropriations already disbursed for Kosovo in 1999."
"As for your comment that you need a written document in order to analyse the proposal: you will find the proposal on the financial perspective and re-programming on the Internet tomorrow."
"The Commission will decide on the CARDS programme next week, because here there were still some questions that required clarification from the legal service. The key figures will therefore be available to you as from tomorrow."
"In reply to what you said about agricultural expenditure, let me point out the following: this year, given the fluctuations in the exchange rates, we will be spending about EUR 500 million less on agriculture and the estimates for next year are that we will need about 650 million less, assuming a parity euro-dollar rate."
"You are also aware that the Commission will have to make proposals again next year on various organisations of the market, especially the sugar market, and my colleague, Mr Fischler, has stated that he will make a proposal in this regard, which will lead to savings of EUR 300 million a year."
"Of course, I am not saying that there is too much money floating around; as Commissioner for the budget I am aware that money is always scarce, but money is also scarce for those who have to finance the European budget."
"That is why, in my opinion, the Commission had to propose financing a new priority, without asking for new money, but rather by examining the possibilities of redeployment within the budget and making the appropriate proposal. And that is what it has done."
"Madam President, you came, Mrs Schreyer, to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, you presented your arguments there, and you were met with respect."
"However, I would like to make one comment and then put a question to you."
"You say there was an increase in the agricultural sector and that this increase would be curtailed."
"The fact that the percentage rise is so high is a result of the cuts in appropriations that were decided earlier in Berlin."
"In fact, these appropriations are urgently needed!"
"I think we must not give the impression that we can keep using the agriculture budget as a kind of bottomless pit whenever we are short of money in other areas."
"That is why I now ask you: do we not need to shift appropriations that might not be needed in export policy to the line for the integrated development of rural areas?"
"We need substantial funds there, because enlargement, with the accession of the Central and Eastern European countries, will generate enormous problems in these rural areas."
"Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, I fully and wholeheartedly support your commitment to the development of rural areas."
"And that will also be very, very clearly reflected in the proposal I will be submitting to the Commission next week for Budget 2001."
"It proposes that next year we increase the appropriations to assist rural areas by 10% compared with this year, and that will quite clearly constitute the largest increase in the draft budget."
"I can assure you that the Commission did not approach the question of how to finance this new priority, this new task, by looking for some kind of bottomless pit; it simply took a very practical decision for the years 2001 and 2002."
"Madam President, first I would like to express my deepest regret that we are debating a review of the financial perspective, and we have not even been presented with an initial written document."
"If an issue like this is presented to Parliament, I would have thought that we might have had something in black and white, so we would know what we were talking about."
"First of all, I would like to say that, not only are we faced with this bad example of administration, but that the Commission seems to take the view that wars can be waged and expenses incurred, yet the financial perspective cannot be reviewed."
"The only way we can bear the costs of war and its consequences would seem to be at the expense of agriculture."
"I would ask the Commissioner how this Commission proposal fits in with the decision of Parliament on next year' s guidelines that agriculture could not be the primary source of financing, as it appears that more would be taken out of agriculture than found, for example, by means of reallocation."
"On the other hand, I would ask whether the Commission believes it would again be possible to use the flexibility instrument for this financing measure, since the rules forbid the use of the flexibility instrument more than once?"
"Mr Virrankoski, on your question whether the Commission is taking account in its proposal of Parliament' s decision that the resources needed for assistance to the Western Balkans should not come primarily from the agriculture budget, we have indeed taken that decision into account."
"Let me perhaps give you a few very rough figures once again: we estimate the need at EUR 5.5 billion and, overall, 3.3 billion of that will come from the external action heading."
"So it is quite clear that the redeployment here is concentrated on foreign policy."
"In practice, the Commission proposal means redeploying EUR 600 million from agriculture policy for the years 2001 and 2002."
"The second point is the use of the flexibility reserve."
"The interinstitutional agreement provides that the flexibility reserve can only ever be used for a given purpose for one year, i.e. cannot be used on a continuous basis for a long-term measure."
"The Commission proposes that, for the time being, only the EUR 40 million that are also available in the budget this year should be allocated to Serbia for the year 2001, for example, to finance the Energy for Democracy programme."
"In the event of a political change in Serbia during 2001, we could also resort to the flexibility reserve."
"Regarding your question of when the documents will be available, you will find them on the Internet tomorrow morning."
"Madam President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for her report, although a number of points seemed very unclear and could even be described as highly ambiguous."
"If I am not mistaken, the total appropriations for Serbia are EUR 2.3 billion."
"These appropriations are not purely nominal; it is simply that they will remain on paper for as long as the Milosevic Government is in power."
"This is neither the time nor the place for me to criticise this government, but I would like to ask the Commissioner whether the Commission took into account the fact that neighbouring countries, as well as the Serbian civilian population, were being penalised when it decided to defer appropriations on purely political grounds."
"Without direct appropriations and aid, how does it intend to resolve the issues of industrial pollution, the navigability of the Danube and the Danube' s bridges destroyed by American bombing, which drastically reduced the river traffic of as many as five neighbouring countries?"
"What contribution is the Commission going to make - not in three years' time but in the next few months - to resolving the issue of the vast amount of pollution caused by the bombing of the Pancevo petrochemical plant, which contaminated huge areas, seeds and harvests with poisonous gases and which, according to the latest United Nations report, even polluted the water tables with dioxins, mercury and other toxic substances?"
"I would therefore like to ask the Commissioner whether there is any chance, any prospect of taking direct, immediate action on Serbian territory as well, in the interests, and I stress this point, of the neighbouring countries and regions."
"Mr Manisco, the Commission regards it as most important to promote cooperation between the states and the regions with funds from the European budget, with your help."
"That is why the proposal on the review of the financial perspective specifically earmarks approximately EUR 80-90 million for cooperation projects."
"Secondly, as I pointed out, we have allocated EUR 40 million for aid to Serbia in this year' s budget as well, but these funds will only be used in a targeted manner in areas where the democratic opposition forces are currently endeavouring to establish a democratic system and the rule of law."
"This year' s budget includes EUR 540 million for the region as a whole."
"At the donor conference on the Stability Pact, Mr Patten approved certain projects and made it clear that the Commission can provide practical measures of assistance on the ground."
"These EUR 540 million are available in the budget, thanks largely to the very strong support of the European Parliament and its endeavour to genuinely allocate adequate resources to this task."
"In this connection, let me once again thank the European Parliament for making such an effort to ensure that the necessary funds are available in the 2000 Budget."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I can be brief because, in the end, all the questions have been along the same lines."
"We have heard that the figure of EUR 1.8 billion was decided on in Berlin. Today, as you said, EUR 1.4 billion has been decided on, and we keep hearing about the EUR 300 million reallocated from the agriculture budget, i.e. the 2001-2002 agricultural sector."
"Commissioner, you had the opportunity to tell us about this in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, but my question is quite simply this: how do I then explain why the farming community is so agitated?"
"When you state here today that we are saving a great deal of money thanks to the exchange rate mechanisms, when you and Commissioner Fischler say at the same time that we can save money in the organisation of the sugar market, then surely the reason the farming community is agitated must be that this information has not been properly conveyed to them, that the agricultural associations did not understand it properly!"
"Or must we always and, on principle, begin with an exchange of blows when it comes to politics?"
"I would therefore be very happy if we really could allay the concerns of farmers; at the moment, however, that does not seem to be the case!"
"Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert, let me assure you that I have worked very hard with agricultural associations and lobbies over the course of the last few weeks to discuss and explain the Commission' s proposal."
"As I have announced, I will be submitting the budget 2001 proposal to the Commission next week. This will clarify the fact that there will be a sharp increase in agricultural appropriations, in line with the decisions taken in Berlin."
"I therefore believe that, based on the actual figures, we can make it clear that the farming community need have no fears and that the important decisions taken in Berlin, particularly in relation to direct income subsidies for farmers, are not affected by the Commission' s decision."
"This item is closed."
"Vote"
"- (NL) Mr President, I can advise you how to vote on each of the four amendments."
"As rapporteur, I have no choice but to oppose these amendments because each of them has also been discussed and subsequently rejected within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"As such, I would suggest voting against the amendments."
"Thank you for that clarification."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE"
"Pesälä report (A5-0081/2000)"
"Mr President, your suggestion of pausing to listen to the interesting explanations of votes is not being heeded, but I am, nevertheless, pleased."
"I voted for the report on the proposal for a Council regulation amending the regulation on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products because I am convinced that it represents a positive technical step."
"We cannot deny the Commission the chance to intervene in such highly technical matters."
"I would nevertheless like to take the opportunity afforded by the explanation of vote to remind the House that there is a need for Parliament and the Council to make radical changes to the legislation on milk quotas as well as to the legislation governing the distribution of agricultural produce, regulated within the European Community, in terms of the quantity produced and how it is marketed."
"The milk quota system was full of holes and we need a new one!"
"Maat report (A5-0074/2000)"
"Mr President, I am sorry that I am only giving two explanations of vote on this occasion, but I do so with great pleasure, for Mr Maat' s report is of great significance: as we are all aware, it has ensured that the practice of giving free milk and milk products to school children will be continued."
"I remember the time when an elderly person came into my father' s bar, where I worked when I was a child, and asked for a glass of milk, saying, 'I drank milk when I was born and I want to die drinking milk!' ."
"I therefore put it to you - and I voted for the motion - that the European Union should give a glass of milk to pensioners, as well as to students, on a daily basis."
". (FR) I do not need to remind you how hard we had to fight to maintain the necessary funds for supplying milk to schools."
"In April 1999, the draft budget submitted by the European Commission provided for a 50% reduction in that budget line!"
"That reduction made it clear that this financial assistance would eventually disappear, which provoked intense reactions within the European Parliament and elsewhere."
"According to experts and specialists in child nutrition, milk is indeed essential to the proper intellectual and physical development of children, of all children."
"Therefore, children of poorer families, who do not have access to certain milk products having essential nutritional benefits, can make up the shortfall thanks to the meals offered in their school canteens."
"A proposal such as this represented a threat to the health of our children."
"This was unacceptable, given that public health had been enshrined in the new Title XIII of the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"Furthermore, it totally contradicted the conclusions of the Agriculture Council of 14 and 15 June 1999."
"Our Ministers had stressed the importance of encouraging milk consumption because of its high nutritional value, especially for children and young people."
"It was only after long, intense discussions that the Commission proposed to increase the budget line by EUR 31 million, with the total amount committed to aid for providing schools with milk then rising to EUR 84 million. This is the situation in 2000."
"For the future, the European Commission has proposed to implement a cofinancing system."
"A maximum of 50% of subsidies for the provision of milk to schools would be financed by the European Union, with the Member States remaining responsible for the other half."
"This is an unacceptable proposal!"
"It was obvious that the Commission' s long-term intention was to dismantle the system of aid for supplying milk to schools."
"The European Parliament' s proposal, which I wholeheartedly support, is to make the Community pay 95% of the cost of European subsidies for milk supplied to schools."
"This is the only way to ensure that this system survives."
"I also welcome the decision to also include drinking yoghurt and milk-based beverages in the regulation."
"This must be done to take account of changes in habits and food preferences and to make this programme more attractive to consumers."
"I can, today, express my satisfaction at having committed myself to this fight and at seeing that the countless letters to the relevant ministers, the countless questions to the European Commission and the countless press releases have paid off!"
". (FR) This issue of Community subsidies for supplying milk to schools goes back to 1997 and is generating an increasing amount of interest in each of our Member States, all the more so because it involves issues of public health and economics, issues which are of concern to the European public."
"If you need proof of this, you only have to read the countless letters which were sent to us when it became known that the European Commission wanted to end this programme!"
"That is why I can only urge you to follow the recommendation of our rapporteur, who is seeking not only to maintain this type of programme, but who is also taking a stand against the proposal of 50-50 cofinancing that the European Commission is putting forward."
"Such a harsh cofinancing programme could lead to certain Member States refusing to pay their national contribution, thereby leading to discrimination within the Union."
"Without denying the need to improve the management of this budget line, I nevertheless feel that improvements to the system can, and must, be made gradually, and I therefore urge you to support the European Parliament' s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and its rapporteur by adopting this report."
". (PT) We are in favour of this report because we think it is important that millions of children attending schools in the European Union continue to be given milk subsidised at a rate of 95% by the European Union."
"As you will be aware, EC subsidies for supplying milk to schools were introduced as early as 1977. In 1999, however, the Commission felt that it should put a stop to this programme."
"But following considerable opposition, particularly in the European Parliament, the Commission submitted a new proposal, which, whilst maintaining the programme, would reduce Community cofinancing to 50%, with the intention that Member States would finance, wholly or partially, the remaining 50%."
"To date, this system has provided for Community financing equal to 95% of the target price of milk, and in the report by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, the rapporteur proposes that this level of financing should be maintained, rejecting the proposal of 50%. We consider this to be very important, as we reject the idea of transferring the costs of the CAP back to national governments."
"- (SV) We have voted against the Maat report which concerns subsidies for the EU' s school milk programme."
"In many schools around Europe, milk is provided free of charge to the pupils in order to meet their need for different forms of nutrition."
"We are wholeheartedly in favour of children and young people being offered milk, and even food, in school, as they are in Sweden."
"However, we do not think that it should be the job of the European Union to subsidise school milk."
"In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, school milk subsidies should be reduced to zero."
"We therefore view the Commission' s proposal concerning cofinancing as a step in the right direction."
"Since the 1950s, Swedish schools have provided pupils with milk and school dinners."
"They have been able to do this without subsidies from the EU."
"Sweden' s membership of the EU means that Sweden, too, was informed about the common school milk programme and, today, Sweden consumes approximately one tenth of the common budget for school milk."
"For some years now, Sweden has been providing full cream milk instead of semi-skimmed milk, simply in order to meet the requirements for milk subsidies."
"This clearly highlights the drawback of the system, as well as the fact that many countries which presently make use of the subsidies really have no requirement for additional resources."
"We believe that export and production subsidies under the common agricultural policy must be abolished."
"Agriculture ought to be placed on an equal footing with other branches of the food industry and compete in a free market."
"Europe is now facing a series of challenges requiring more money to be invested."
"The money which is, at present, being spent on agricultural policy, ought instead to be invested in the reconstruction of Kosovo, the enlargement of the Union to include Central and Eastern Europe and aid to the Third World."
". The reason for this intervention is to clarify why this House should oppose the Commission' s proposals to cut subsidies for school milk by half."
"I am glad that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development of this House rejected these proposals by bringing forward these amendments not to cut the subsidies at all and I urge everyone to support these amendments."
"There are several arguments for doing so."
"By nourishing our schoolchildren we also support our dairy farmers who need our support."
"But also we are preventing surpluses like those seen in the past."
"Trans-European networks (1998 Annual Report)"
"The next item is the report (A5-0076/2000) by Mr Hatzidakis, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the report from the Commission to the Council [COM(1999) 410 - C5-0010/2000 - 2000/2004 (COS)], the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions: Trans-European Networks 1998 Annual Report pursuant to Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 2236/95 laying down general rules for the granting of Community financial assistance in the field of Trans-European Networks."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the ELDR Group supports the Hatzidakis report."
"Community policy in the field of trans-European networks is of major importance because it is not possible to have a common transport policy without a convergent infrastructures policy, as is stressed in the Maastricht Treaty."
"Efficient transport infrastructures are essential for economic growth and employment, as they are for the competitiveness of companies which depend on the movement of persons, goods and resources."
"According to this debate, Europe, first and foremost, is that political Europe towards which we are striving, but it is also the result of economic and social cohesion."
"It is true that the European Union' s budgetary resources are insufficient and need to be increased, and it is also true that we need to increase the contributions of public bodies as well as public/private partnerships."
"In this regard, my Group has drawn the Commission' s attention to the fact that the report does not contain information on sources of funding other than the Community budget and the European Investment Bank, and it has also stressed its concern that as many as seven Essen projects have not been given a guarantee that they will be completed within the timeframes envisaged."
"We, too, say 'Yes' to the Brenner Pass and we, too, say 'Yes' to the use of new technologies."
"However, the Member States must respect the pledges made, and the Commission must also take into account the guidelines established for the B5-700 budget line - a major budget line established in 1998 - promoting more environmentally friendly models and, above all, taking the different factors into consideration where a trans-European link passes through densely populated areas or highly industrialised regions."
"For this reason, we also consider that appropriations set aside for these projects must not exceed 50% and that, after due analysis, the amounts still available for projects on which little progress has been made could be recouped and used for other projects with the same priorities, including environmental priorities."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as the two rapporteurs, Mr Hatzidakis and Mrs Sbarbati, have already explained, both the competent committee and the Committee on Budgets wholeheartedly endorsed the Brenner project, a project that came at the top of the Essen list of priorities."
"However, the original project did not set out a list of priorities, a major shortcoming."
"I therefore consider it essential for the Commission to accept the points laid down in this report, and which have been explained by the rapporteur, as they stand."
"The Brenner Pass covers a region that includes three countries and, as such, it is a very environmentally sensitive area to which we need to devote particular attention."
"At present, 1.2 million lorries cross the Brenner Pass every year."
"The growth in the transport of goods far exceeds earlier rates of increase."
"The free movement of persons, one of the freedoms in the European Union, cannot be achieved properly either."
"Good Friday saw extremely lengthy tailbacks on the Brenner Pass."
"We, Mr Jarzembowski, Mr Swoboda and I - as pointed out in the explanatory statement of this motion in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism - tabled a motion in which we justified this initiative as being a means of achieving an innovative model and approach to project development."
"It breaks new ground and can set an example to the European Union."
"Under the Prodi government, the Italian legislature had already considered the possibility of cross-financing road - i.e. road tolls - and rail transport and indeed approved it."
"I believe that can act as a further model and pave the way to an innovative approach."
"That is an absolute must, especially in an environmentally sensitive area, and I hope the Commission will exhibit the necessary sensitivity."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first let me congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Hatzidakis, on his very sound report."
"The report is as good and judicious as Mr Hatzidakis is in his chairmanship of the committee, for which he certainly deserves recognition and thanks."
"Let me also take this opportunity to support him when he says that the financial resources for developing the trans-European networks are no longer adequate."
"He proposes increasing the budget funding."
"According to Commissioner Schreyer today, that will not be very easy to achieve."
"That is why Mr Hatzidakis quite rightly proposed in committee that funding should also be procured from private or other semi-public institutions."
"The previous Commissioner, Mr Kinnock, put forward several ideas on the subject on the basis of the activities of a working party and I hope Mrs Schreyer will be able to develop and take up some of these ideas, for without an incentive system of extra funding from the private sector too, we will not succeed in achieving what Mr Hatzidakis, the committee and, I hope, Parliament too, will propose tomorrow."
"It is quite clear that in view of the additional tasks that we are also confronted with in transport, when we think of Eastern Europe and the candidate countries, it will not be possible to achieve what Mr Ebner has just called for, namely redeployment from road to rail, especially in bottleneck areas."
"That is not an anti-roads policy, because it will, of course, free up the roads for the kind of transport best suited to them."
"That is why we need this redeployment."
"Some successes have been achieved, especially in relation to the agreement with Switzerland; in other areas, however, we have been less successful."
"Let me also say a few words on the Brenner base-level tunnel."
"The European Commission has already financed the feasibility study, in fact financed it more heavily than other projects."
"Studies alone, however, are not enough."
"That is why we do not yet have any additional mode of transport, why no fewer cars are being driven and why we are not seeing a switch to rail transport."
"That is why we must tackle the projects and why we need investment."
"We also tabled a motion to this effect on account of our common concern in committee."
"The three governments concerned and the Commission really must act now, begin with the spadework and start building, while, of course, at the same time guaranteeing the necessary funding."
"I believe the Brenner base-level project is one of the most important European projects that need tackling, with a view to making north-south traffic environment-friendly and efficient."
"If we combine that with the additional measures concerning the candidate countries, then, in five to ten years' time, we could see an efficient transport system in Europe, and that is something we urgently need!"
"Mr President, firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Hatzidakis, for his excellent report."
"The rapporteur has gone into the matter with great care and raised some very important issues."
"Our Group supports him, for example, on the issue of coordinating regional and private funding in the Member States of the Union."
"However, I would like to underline a few issues."
"The annual report shows that shortcomings exist in the way money spent on the development of trans-European networks is monitored, and insufficient details are available as to the results achieved through the use of funds."
"We need more precise accounts of inter alia how the European Regional Development Fund, the Cohesion Fund, funds from financial sources not included in the Union budget and funds from the Member States are spent to improve trans-European transport networks."
"We also need a report on the effects of functional transport networks on a sustainable economy and employment."
"The rapporteur has quite rightly pointed out that, of the fourteen Essen specific projects, seven still require confirmation of their funding and timetables."
"In addition, the Essen projects have devoured a larger proportion of the Union' s funding for transport than was agreed."
"In the future, greater care should be taken in selecting such specific projects."
"At the same time, it must be ensured that the Member States will commit themselves to them, set aside a sufficiently large share of funding for them, and give them priority in their own plans."
"The Annual Report shows that more money is also needed for the development of transport and traffic safety through the Union budget, since transport communications are so vital for the economy, employment and, furthermore, for social cohesion."
"In the future we shall have to pay more attention to the coordination of various forms of transport."
"At the same time, we shall also have to give consideration to the link between regional policy and transport."
"Balanced regional development can help to slow down the trend towards centralisation and reduce traffic congestion."
"In addition to addressing the problems of traffic in congested areas, we will also have to ensure that the trans-European networks are extended and that they are also developed in areas where the volume of traffic is lighter - areas where there is less traffic, remote areas, and areas where the physical environment presents greater problems."
"Good communications are a vital necessity in these areas."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are agreed on one thing: policy on trans-European networks is in urgent need of reform!"
"The trans-European transport networks, and the 14 specific projects in particular, have not succeeded in any of the aims they were in fact intended to achieve, even though a great deal of money has already been invested."
"But two of these aims really are vital to the European Union."
"One is the key aim of economic and social cohesion, which holds the European Union together."
"These TENs were designed to prevent the drifting apart, or the risk of a drift apart, between poor and affluent regions."
"They have not done so."
"On the contrary, the 14 selected projects have, in fact, driven the regions further apart, and have encouraged a trend towards increased economic activity in the prosperous economic regions, because transport links have been constructed between them, while the poorer regions have become increasingly isolated."
"Secondly, it is still a mistake to think that the trans-European networks help reduce mass unemployment."
"On the contrary, unemployment has risen: even in 1995, in the ten poorest regions, unemployment was seven times higher than in the richest regions, while today it is eight times higher, and rising."
"So I really wonder whether we can afford to continue putting European taxpayers' money in concrete without this having a significant impact on employment."
"Is there really any point in investing more money and calling for more money in this case?"
"Is that not an incorrect response in structural terms, because we could do far more sensible things with the money in order to regenerate employment."
"I also wonder whether the value of these projects has not been offset by the environmental destruction they cause."
"In fact, they have achieved nothing."
"They have destroyed much of the living space of the people of Europe and we should take the mass protest movements against motorways seriously, for they often point the way to more sensible and less destructive options."
"Perhaps the people who are protesting are actually right."
"Europe needs a considerably more intelligent and sustained transport policy, based on a modern approach that thinks ahead to the next generation, realising that resources are finite."
"As regards the 14 projects, the European Parliament' s call for a cost-benefit analysis was not heeded, whilst its call for environmental compatibility checks for all the projects was also ignored; only partial checks were carried out, which conflicts with the relevant directive."
"I think we really need to improve goods transport, which must be facilitated by rail in order to be sustainable."
"We must revise the TENs policy with a view to combining mobility with sustainability."
"Mr President, the trans-European networks are often hailed as one of the key successes of European integration."
"This is true to some extent but they also make our society more vulnerable."
"They help to strengthen the cohesion between the economies of the EU Member States."
"Each country is becoming increasingly reliant on imported energy and a great deal of effort also goes into consultation and legal rulings."
"What effect does this have on the people in Europe?"
"Perhaps an increase in the number of jobs in the short term. In the longer term, it could be that, quite unintentionally, businesses become more vulnerable owing to technical defects in a costly transport system and that jobs could, at short notice, be moved to areas with lower wages, poorer working conditions and fewer environmental requirements."
"Nothing therefore to get too excited about for the time being."
"Similarly, the major transport projects are not as promising as the annual report would like to suggest."
"For the north-south high-speed link from Berlin to Verona, only a few minor components have been constructed."
"In England, the connection of the high-speed link which runs through the Channel Tunnel has been in the doldrums for many years as a result of the privatisation and the splitting up of the railway companies in that country."
"Spain has decided not to go ahead with a European standard gauge for the high-speed link between Madrid and Barcelona, which was used for the line from Madrid to Seville."
"The construction of the Betuwe line through the Netherlands is becoming increasingly controversial."
"Economic experts have calculated that this expensive line would never be a success."
"The costs seem to increase daily, the inland shipping industry considers this line to be distorting competition, freight transport by road does not seem to have gone down as a result and environmental activists are thwarting activities on a daily basis."
"All in all, a good enough reason to abandon the Betuwe line project."
"There is still far too little broad-based, social debate on the priorities set and choices made."
"The people of Europe are entitled to more information on the impact of the TENs, i.e. the impact on their livelihoods, the costs involved, environmental considerations and the rate of implementation."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by expressing my sincere thanks and appreciation to colleague Hatzidakis for a very fine report to Parliament here this afternoon."
"The Commission' s 1998 annual report on trans-European transport networks gives a clear overall picture of the progress that has been made in certain specific projects as well as containing valuable information on the contributions made to these infrastructural projects by the various sources of Community funding."
"Clearly, it is absolutely necessary to increase the resources available for developing these TENs."
"At present, the funding is decidedly inadequate if we are to attempt seriously to meet the commitments entered into at the Essen European Summit in 1994."
"I share the concern of the rapporteur over the fact that seven of the fourteen Essen projects are still facing difficulties because their funding is not totally guaranteed and no timetables have been drawn up for their implementation."
"It would be useful if the Commission, in its future annual reports, specified what funding has been provided by national, regional and local public bodies and by the private sector, in addition to European funding, with a view to setting up the trans-European transport networks."
"The Commission will shortly undertake a revision of the TEN guidelines."
"I hope that in these new guidelines they will accord greater importance to improving access to trans-European network funding for Europe' s island and remote regions."
"It is important to place particular emphasis on the promotion of sustainable transport links with these disadvantaged regions if they are to share equally in the benefits of a unified single market."
"If the revision of the TEN guidelines were to concentrate just on existing bottlenecks as announced by the Commission in its work programme for the year 2000, this would focus the funding on the more economically developed central regions of the Union, perhaps to the detriment of the outermost regions."
"A package of integrated financial measures needs to be deployed in order to press ahead with implementation of the network."
"The Commission and EIB therefore should act together with national governments in implementing the TENs packages through the use of loan guarantees and other financial investments."
"Mr President, I too would like to congratulate Mr Hatzidakis warmly, in particular because he has produced a genuinely realistic report, but some of his observations, which are rather disturbing, should be of particular concern to us."
"It is worth remembering that the decisions that led to the choice of these 14 major projects date back to the Essen Summit, which took place in 1994, that is, already six years ago now."
"Six years on from that decision, only half of these projects have made any real progress, and those projects are, by and large, concentrated in the northern half of the continent."
"A positive start has been made, but the situation looks pretty grim as regards the other projects and, in particular, for the remote regions, as Mr Collins has already pointed out."
"I am particularly thinking of the Southern link, which is supposed to link France, in particular Lyon, together with Turin and Trieste, to the rest of the Balkans that we would like to see firmly annexed to Europe. I am also thinking of the other part of Europe, comprising of Austria, with its specific problems mentioned by other speakers, Hungary, and the other countries of central Europe."
"In this context, I would remind you that it is not only about opening up a Piedmont which is hidden away, a Piedmont stuck in the Alps. This is about connecting a whole region of the continent, the Balkans and central Europe, to the southern part of Europe, to France, Italy, Spain and Portugal, and no real progress has been made as regards this project."
"So, in response to what Mrs Schroedter said, I feel that we must not lose sight of the fact that what these major projects are mainly concerned with is the development of railway infrastructures."
"This particularly applies to this southern axis, which would make Paris only three and a half hours distant from Milan."
"There are, however, difficult choices to be made in order to avoid the huge pollution-related problems currently in the news in Austria, as well as in Italy and Germany."
"Choices have to be made; there must be investment and this decision, this choice that was made in Essen, is still no closer to being taken, six years down the line."
"This concerns Member States, of course, and certainly Italy in particular, which has not supported this project with sufficient vigour, but it also concerns the Commission, as the rapporteur made very clear."
"It is the Commission' s duty to come up with measures which encourage both public authorities and private companies to invest in these huge trans-European networks."
"I therefore consider it to be crucial that the Commission submits new proposals so that these dossiers, which are still deadlocked, can proceed as quickly as possible."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are serious problems with seven of the transport projects decided upon by the Essen Council."
"Like the rapporteur, I am disturbed about this."
"One of these projects is the extension of the north-south link, and in particular the Brenner base-level tunnel."
"Through this project the European Union could demonstrate that it is not just paying lip service to the idea of shifting transit transport from road to rail."
"This is an opportunity to reduce the environmental burden on the region concerned and its population."
"Moreover, this project will have a positive impact on the competitiveness of the Union as a whole."
"Unfortunately, however, there is still a very long way to go as regards its implementation."
"The subsidiary of the Austrian Brenner Railway Company and the Italian Railways, which is supposed to complete the project planning within a period of eighteen months, was only set up at the end of last year."
"This means that, more than five years after Essen, there are still no concrete plans on the table."
"The people of the region cannot understand that."
"For it is they who have to live with the ever-growing avalanche of traffic."
"The existing rules, under which a maximum of 10% of the total investment can be funded by the Union, are quite simply inadequate and unfair for projects that have enormous implications for the future of the European economy as a whole."
"Member States that will benefit from the completion of the Brenner base-level tunnel cannot shrug off their responsibility and leave it entirely to the countries directly concerned, like Germany, Austria and Italy, to shoulder the financial burden."
"In the end, that kind of attitude has nothing to do with solidarity."
"Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, first let me very firmly reject Mrs Schroedter' s across-the-board criticism of the TENs."
"In fact she has insulted us as well, for Parliament and the Council adopted the 1996 guideline by codecision on a proposal from the Council."
"If that was such a terrible thing, the Greens should have opposed it at the time."
"They did not do so."
"Let me just mention two projects that have been successful."
"I think that, from the environmental standpoint, the rail link across the Øresund was precisely the right thing to do."
"We want railways and we want links with remote regions."
"The new Anglo-Irish rail links are of great benefit to the environment and the region."
"The Greens are quite simply wrong to criticise the TENs as benefiting only the central and most densely populated states."
"Secondly, I agree with Mr Ebner and others that, as far as the Brenner base-level tunnel is concerned, we have to think up some new ideas."
"Our committee proposes a four-sided agreement between the three states concerned and the Union."
"The Brenner base-level tunnel is an unusually large-scale project, and also a project with an unusually significant impact on the environment, for the Alps cannot be compared with the lowlands of the Netherlands or Friesland in Germany."
"The environmental situation in the Alps is particularly problematic."
"Quite simply, the way the noise and the stench of cars remains trapped in the valleys is quite different from conditions on flat ground."
"Something therefore needs to be done in this regard."
"Above all, we must persuade governments not to shift the blame onto each other."
"The Italians say they will start building when the Austrians build."
"The Germans say they will begin building once the Austrians are building."
"The Austrians say they will start to build once the Germans and the Italians begin."
"So we need clear yardsticks and data on who pays what and when, and the Community must make a serious effort to get this whole project going."
"Let me make two final comments."
"Madam Vice-President of the Commission. Take your time with the revision of the trans-European networks!"
"First, you should take another look at all the projects in the light of today' s debate."
"We do not want more show projects, 14 or 15 show projects, with no guaranteed financing."
"In this revision, we should identify measures as priorities only if we are certain they can be financed over a period of 10-15 years."
"For the citizens will lose confidence in us if we declare certain projects to be priorities and then do not execute them."
"We must remind the Member States that they have committed themselves to guaranteeing the financing, committed themselves to executing the plan."
"Then we really must take them at their word and say: we will only list specific projects if they really are ready to be executed and financed."
"Take your time and reopen these difficult discussions with the Member States so that you, as the Commission, do not propose projects in which we make fools of ourselves in front of the citizens, but projects that are feasible!"
"Mr President, I shall try to speak more slowly this time because last time I gave the interpreters a hard time by speaking at a Mediterranean tempo."
"I come from a country which, because of its geographical location, has major transport problems when it comes to sending goods or persons to and from European cities and markets and when it comes to giving and taking."
"One can therefore quite easily understand the great interest this country and its representatives have in trans-European networks, which I wish to talk about today."
"However, not only as Greeks, but primarily as Europeans, we cannot but treat these networks as an important tool in our endeavour to strengthen social and economic cohesion, employment and sustainable development in our struggle to achieve European integration. And, of course, I disagree with what Mrs Schroedter has just said."
"We should indeed accord trans-European networks the real importance which they deserve."
"We should ensure that the financial resources spent on TENs are increased."
"What is more, allow me to say that we owe this increase since, in the last decade, the need to cut spending in view of the obligation to meet the criteria and objectives of Economic and Monetary Union also badly affected TEN funding."
"We should speed up the implementation of these projects by improving procedures and facilitating their funding through flexible public and private sector partnerships."
"We should see to it that we overcome any hurdles that are holding up 7 of the 14 Essen projects and leaving us exposed."
"And, of course, we should attach importance during the revision of the TEN guidelines to access to island regions and to regions which have difficulty obtaining access to the sea."
"The Commission has presented us in its 1998 annual report with a rough picture of the state of progress in the construction of these networks, a picture which the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism - which, in the report under discussion, is asking for greater efficiency in the whole network construction operation - would like to be more detailed and informative."
"The main role in the whole of this extremely important operation for the future of Europe belongs to the Commission and we call on it, in collaboration with the Member States, to give absolute priority, in the full meaning and with all the implications of the word, to developing these main arteries in the body of Europe so that it can function in the way we all want it to and meet the expectations of European citizens."
"In closing, I would like to thank and congratulate the chairman of the committee and rapporteur, my fellow countryman Konstantinos Hatzidakis, for the work which he has put into his report which, of course, should be adopted."
"Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, it is common knowledge that, at regional level in the European Union, there is a close connection between low per capita income, high unemployment and distance from mainland Europe or geographical remoteness, which is currently a serious problem, but which has existed since the industrial revolution of the 19th century, due to underdeveloped communications."
"This is a vicious circle, which can only be broken by a political and economic joint action which addresses all the issues that are causing this underdevelopment."
"The trans-European networks policy is not, however, being implemented in such a way as to resolve this crucial issue, despite the fact that it was introduced with the specific aim of establishing direct links between remote countries and the Union' s central regions."
"The basic aim of the specific projects and budgets of the trans-European networks, as well as those financed by the Structural and Cohesion Funds, which resulted from a policy that was greatly desired by the Member States, yet poorly accepted and supported by the Commission, was to establish direct links between those regions that have a higher per capita income. In doing so, they rode roughshod over the regulations currently in force, with the damaging consequences with which we are all familiar."
"The debate on the report by Mr Hatzidakis, whom I congratulate, provides us with a good opportunity to get to grips with the political dimension of the current situation and to try to find a solution to it, in line with the decisive reform of the trans-European networks policy which is due to be implemented in the 2000-2006 period."
"It is therefore the intention of our political group, as the amendments that have been presented have highlighted, to ensure that the networks are compatible with sustainable development and that the reform corresponds to the objective of uniting the whole Community by prioritising the remote regions, which have hitherto been neglected. Finally, it is our intention to upgrade the railways and to bring about the decentralisation of the networks, particularly with regard to airports and ports."
"The concentration of road, airport and port networks is causing serious congestion and environmental problems which we must prevent."
"I hope that we will be able to bring about the changes that the European Union needs in order to achieve the regional balance and social cohesion that we are advocating."
"We must be aware that, at this precise moment, Regional Development Plans are being approved for the period 2000-2006 which will contribute to isolating even further the Objective 1 regions, which desperately need a modern connection to the whole of Europe, including high speed rail links."
"Amongst these regions are my own country, Galicia, and the entire north-western Iberian Peninsula, covering both Spain and Portugal, an Atlantic region which is crucial to the whole of Europe."
"Mr President, this annual report clearly shows that Europe is not providing itself with the means to implement its trans-European transport networks policy."
"But apart from the simple budgetary and financial considerations, in more general terms, it is the Commission' s general guidelines in this area that are worthy of criticism."
"We do agree, of course, with the principle that it is necessary to create trans-European networks for the people of Europe, for the movement of people and goods, for economic and social cohesion and for rail alternatives to the all-powerful motorway."
"We cannot, however, accept the method that has been imposed or the solutions that have been proposed."
"Are all the fourteen projects that have been accepted relevant or essential to the needs of local populations?"
"Have they been devised in association or in consultation, or is the rationale of the trans-European networks, as the report implies, only based on the free market?"
"It is, moreover, not by chance that out of the fourteen projects, the seven whose timetable and financing are still in doubt are precisely those which do not only answer to the demands of profit."
"The most negative aspect, however, seems to be the financing."
"It is based on the principle that public funds cannot be increased, which is a moot point."
"It therefore proposes to have recourse to private funds, in the form of partnerships, and this, moreover, is an essential element of the project."
"This approach to rail transport raises the issue of public service."
"Clearly, if private operators are involved in the financing, they will aim for maximum profit."
"We must make use of private companies because they profit from the infrastructures, but in the form of tax deductions and not by them having an interest in the capital of railway companies."
"The idea of a European public rail service must be developed and we reject privatisation and access to the capital of rail companies, including for new projects."
"Once again, Europe is responding to a genuine need on the part of the people, the need for a high-quality European rail transport network, which is outstanding for both passengers and staff, with a race for profit."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first let me thank our rapporteur very warmly for his report."
"The European Commission' s annual report on trans-European networks once again sets out the progress made with many transport projects and emphasises the important part the TENs play in protecting the environment."
"I take the view that the 14 projects decided at Essen play a very significant role in the extension of the European transport networks and, like many speakers before me, I want to stress the enormous importance of the Brenner base-level tunnel."
"Alpine transit must be looked at and understood as an overall problem."
"Certainly Austria, France and the neighbouring states are affected most."
"To show you or make you more aware of the seriousness of the situation, let me tell you that about 30% of transit traffic round Switzerland goes via the Brenner, which means that Austria bears the main burden."
"It should also be noted that in Austria, 80% of goods are carried by road and only 20% by rail, while in Switzerland the proportion is exactly the reverse."
"When some people ask why Austria is getting so agitated, since surely there is a similar volume of traffic elsewhere too, for instance in the Ruhr region, I have to reply yes, that is true, but the topographical features of Tyrol, of the Inntal, simply differ from those in other areas, such as the plains."
"Moreover, the Inntal in Austria is one of the most densely populated regions."
"Alpine transit is an integral problem which needs to be addressed in integral terms."
"We cannot look separately at Brenner, toll roads and Alpine transit."
"As for carrying out the construction timetables, I can say that we already have definite construction schedules in the Lower Inntal."
"Now we also need a clear political resolve, and not just on the part of the Member States."
"What we need is cross-financing."
"I would consider the transport costs directive an appropriate legal basis."
"I think that would give us sound financing."
"I call for public-private partnerships, for I think working together is the best way to succeed."
"We have a massive problem with north-south transit."
"I am against further studies of the Brenner Pass, for we already have enough of them as it is."
"What we need is to complete the Brenner base-level tunnel rapidly, for the sake of the population concerned, the environment and a sustainable, forward-looking transport policy."
"Mr President, Commissioner, let me add a few comments to what has been said today about the Brenner base-level tunnel, most of which I more or less support."
"The Brenner is a particularly good example of the problems besetting trans-European transport today."
"Transport by rail, at least to the south of the Brenner, is not operating and the international link is not operating either."
"That is why we have such major problems today and if we also need a base-level tunnel because of these mistakes and problems I would suggest that we approach the matter with great sensitivity, and that we proceed with care, for this is a project for centuries to come."
"If we do decide to undertake it, we need to choose the environmentally cleanest, economically soundest option, as well as the most functional option."
"That is why I have tabled a minor amendment to paragraph 7."
"Perhaps we do not need another study, but we should weigh things up properly and select the best project."
"I have put one of these projects before the Transport Committee."
"There are few better or equally good ones."
"We must choose the best because our transport policy, and therefore the EU, will also be measured by this small project."
"Mr President, we support the development of a trans-European transport network which will favour rail transport over road transport, on the condition, however, that the development of the great trans-European lines does not prejudice suburban transport or so-called district lines."
"Rail transport, the main lines as well as the district ones, should be a public service, which aims to meet the needs of the population, not to generate private profit."
"The participation of private capital will necessarily result in a quest for profit, to the detriment both of users and of those who work in the sector."
"Far too many recent disasters, particularly the one at Paddington station in Great Britain, illustrate the incompatibility between the quest for profit and safety."
"As stipulated in the explanatory statement of the report, public investment is continually decreasing and in less than twenty years, has fallen from 1.5% of the European Union' s GNP to 0.9%."
"This has resulted in falling standards in rail transport as a whole as well as staff reductions, which has contributed to keeping unemployment levels high."
"If the Member States of the European Union do not adopt a new policy, or, in other words, if they do not prioritise investment in public services rather than endless subsidies to the bosses, any decision on a genuine public transport service operating on a European scale under the best safety conditions will remain nothing but empty rhetoric."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission' s report states that 1998 saw the consolidation of the trans-European networks and outlines the progress made with various projects in the area of transport, energy and tele- and data communications."
"It must, however, be pointed out that the European Union' s budgetary resources fall considerably short of the requirements and the challenge generated by the establishment of a trans-European transport network."
"Unless there is an increase in the financial contribution made by national, regional and local public bodies and by the private sector, we will not see any significant progress in this area in the foreseeable future."
"I should nevertheless like to stress the fact that recourse to private finance should never be an obstacle to the development of communications in regions which currently have a per capita income well below the Community average."
"With regard to the future review of the guidelines for trans-European transport networks, I feel I must once again draw the Commission' s attention to the need to attach greater importance to improving access to Europe' s remote and isolated regions, and to focus particularly on establishing sustainable transport networks."
"The impact of such investments on the economy of these regions and on employment is a crucial factor in the socio-economic development of these regions."
"The Commission' s work programme for the year 2000 lays down that the review of the guidelines for trans-European transport networks must concentrate on reducing bottlenecks in order to rationalise traffic in Europe and to make it flow more freely."
"As I understand it, this amounts to saying that the review currently being prepared will mainly concern the central regions of the European Union, which are the main victims of these congestion problems."
"I can only hope that this hypothesis does not mean that the remote and, to an even greater extent, the extremely remote regions might only be incidentally affected by this review."
"This fear, which has been mentioned several times by many of my colleagues, led me to table an amendment to this effect, which was adopted by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and which features in Mr Hatzidakis' s excellent report."
"I would be most grateful to you, Commissioner, if, today, you could allay my concerns."
"Mr President, growth and employment in Europe depend to a large degree upon exploiting European infrastructure effectively."
"We should therefore have already set in motion the TEN projects that have still to get off the ground."
"It is no secret that I am very much in favour of a permanent link between Denmark and Germany, and I am glad that the new Danish Minister for Transport is also a supporter of the project."
"However, I am a little put out that German politicians are rather less enthusiastic."
"There has previously been some doubt as to whether a permanent link across the Fehmarn Belt is the way forward, but any such doubt has now been shown to be groundless."
"All the inquiry reports from the Danish and German Ministries of Transport show that there are neither environmental nor financial problems with building a bridge."
"With a faster and easier link between Denmark and Germany, we can build bridges to the new democracies in the East."
"We are not only building a bridge in physical terms, for practical purposes."
"We are building a bridge between countries to help industry and for human, political, social and cultural reasons."
"Building a permanent link between Germany and Denmark will create many new and much-needed jobs in the area."
"There are almost always people who automatically say 'no' to anything new."
"Anything which brings about change is a little frightening, whether it be EMU, the euro, environmentalism or a bridge."
"One should not, however, be afraid of something good."
"A link across the Fehmarn Belt is an exciting, rather than a frightening project."
"Finally, I should like to add my voice to the call to increase the budget appropriations for the trans-European transport networks, as they are quite inadequate."
"Improved growth and employment require sums of a quite different order."
"Mr President, when, at the Essen Summit, the necessary extensive investments in infrastructure were decided upon, it was mainly a question of motorways and high-speed trains crossing national frontiers in a Europe where investments have traditionally been made principally in the individual countries."
"That is precisely why this decision was so extraordinarily important."
"A properly functioning internal market will never, of course, be possible without extensive investment in this area."
"Today' s report nonetheless raises a number of questions about how we are actually to follow up our various decisions."
"A few of these TEN projects have been carried out within a reasonable timeframe."
"Personally, I am very glad that one of these projects in particular has been carried out, namely the permanent link across the Sound between Sweden and Denmark which is to be opened on time in just a few months."
"I am more doubtful, however, where a number of the other projects are concerned."
"As quite a number of people here have said, many of these projects are being developed awfully slowly."
"The rapporteur who, by the way, has done a quite excellent job, has expressed his concern about this."
"It is, indeed, very worrying when these ventures are not taken seriously."
"Let me give an example of this. It concerns the Nordic triangle, designed to link the Scandinavian capitals by high-speed train and motorway."
"This is something which the countries concerned have undertaken to carry out, but it is a terribly slow process."
"Money is forever being transferred to other projects which are obviously considered more important than this major European project."
"This happens because there is every opportunity to transfer money in this way, there being no proper deadlines for when the projects concerned are to be carried out."
"Neither the road nor the railway ventures are, therefore, going to be finished within a reasonable period of time."
"I should therefore like, here today, to ask the Commission' s representative a number of questions. When does the Commission think that the Nordic triangle and the other TEN projects will be complete?"
"What is the Commission actually doing to make sure that they are in fact completed?"
"Is the Commission prepared to commit itself to establishing specific deadlines for completing the outstanding projects and, subsequently, also to ensure that these deadlines are met?"
"Mr President, I would firstly like to express my sincere gratitude for the work accomplished by Mr Hatzidakis, chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the review of the trans-European networks which, in the coming months, I will have to present to this House."
"I believe that his work will contribute decisively to the documents which the Commission will produce. I would also like to express my thanks for the contribution made by Mrs Sbarbati, draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets, as well as for the interventions of the other speakers who have participated in this debate."
"I believe that, as well as analysing the situation, the most important thing is to look to the future."
"Accordingly, I will take this opportunity to make some observations on behalf of the Commission."
"Firstly, I fully agree with Mr Hatzidakis on the importance given to Community policy on trans-European networks and I also share Parliament' s concern, expressed not only by Mr Hatzidakis, but also by the draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets and by other MEPs, on the need for this policy to be provided with adequate financial resources."
"In this respect, I would like to thank Parliament for its support for the provision of a total of EUR 4.6 billion for the period 2000-2006 for this chapter."
"Nevertheless, I should remind Members that, every year, the Commission gives consideration to projects which amount to three times the amount allocated annually in this budget."
"At the same time, there is an agreement by all parties not to increase the overall budgets and, in this respect, you have also heard my colleague, Mrs Schreyer, talk of our current budgetary difficulties resulting from new needs and matters of urgency, such as meeting the Union' s main political commitments following the war in Kosovo."
"In this respect, I share the European Parliament' s concern with regard to the adequate funding of transport networks, but I believe that we can jointly assume some of these responsibilities."
"I would like to remind you that we know that Community support for projects carried out during 1996, 1997 and 1998 has accounted for 30% of the total, which is a very significant figure."
"It is true that these include projects in Objective 1 areas and cohesion countries, which has allowed the percentage of cofinancing to be greater."
"However, I must tell you that we cannot provide you with overall information, because we are not only talking about Community finance but also about finance provided by individual countries and private sectors in some cases, as well as regions and local authorities."
"Therefore, we can only provide the information which is available to us and make analyses based on that data."
"We therefore reiterate something that Mr Jarzembowski said, which is that some of those responsible are from outside the Commission and, of course, the will of the different Member States of the Union to promote and implement these projects is of crucial importance."
"You say that some projects are being delayed."
"In this regard, I would like to say that the target date is 2010."
"There is therefore still time to implement them within the time limit."
"Furthermore, some of the projects present great technical difficulties."
"I will concentrate for a moment on one of the most talked-about projects: the Brenner base-level tunnel."
"That tunnel is a symbolic project as far as the European Union' s technological capacities and its ability to act are concerned."
"We are talking about 54 kilometres of tunnel in one of our most mountainous areas, with a series of unknown factors and uncertainties which require that the project be guaranteed as far as possible before we make such a huge investment as the one required for the Brenner tunnel."
"In order to carry out the Channel Tunnel project, it was necessary to carry out major studies before establishing the routes and detailing and beginning the project."
"This is also true in the case of the Brenner."
"It is perhaps better to begin something late, but to begin with all the guarantees in place, than to find half way through that the studies have not warned us of some difficulty or other, meaning that we have to go into reverse, which would cause even greater delays."
"In fact, new studies are under way, through an agreement between a group of interested parties, to determine the definitive route of the Brenner tunnel."
"It has not been abandoned, it is just that it is an enormously complex project, ladies and gentlemen, and we must understand that these studies will probably take a further five years to complete."
"I want to make this very clear."
"We are talking about very far-off dates, but this does not mean that there is no will."
"On the contrary, there is an absolute will."
"This must, however, be based on the certainty that the project can be carried out in a way which will not damage our credibility."
"Furthermore, I would like to point out that the level of funding in terms of the total appropriations for the 14 principal TEN projects has been 60%."
"That was the percentage which you, the Parliament, considered appropriate in your most recent resolutions."
"It is midway between your initial proposal and the Council' s proposal."
"These partnerships will be promoted in various ways. Firstly, thanks to the introduction of a multiannual indicative programme which will allow for private sector support with greater security and where the developers will enjoy guaranteed Community funding for several years."
"That programme will cover the period 2001-2006. Secondly, the budget line for trans-European networks will contribute risk capital financing, which could promote - and I hope this is the case - the creation of investment funds geared to the TENs and, to this end, we have already asked for expressions of interest."
"We are about to review the guidelines on the trans-European transport networks."
"I will be presenting this review report and an initial proposal shortly."
"However, it must be said that the objectives of the trans-European networks are the development of the single market and social and economic cohesion. I would like to make this very clear."
"Therefore, the remote regions, the extremely remote regions and the least developed regions must be at the heart of Community action."
"However, resolving bottlenecks does not harm the remote regions. I would like to give one very clear example: the bottleneck on the railway in Bordeaux."
"Does this affect France? Yes, of course it affects south-west France, but only to a degree."
"Its real impact is on the whole of the centre and west of the Iberian Peninsula, that is, most of Spain and Portugal."
"So when we clear a bottleneck in Bordeaux, we are in fact benefiting the development of an area of the Iberian Peninsula."
"What I mean to say is that acting in a central area does not always harm the interests of the remote areas, but, on the contrary, in many cases it is perfectly interrelated."
"Mr President, lastly, I would like to refer to the question of the intelligent management of traffic."
"This aspect will also be included as a key element in the review of the trans-European networks."
"I would like to congratulate Mr Hatzidakis once again and express my gratitude for his work as well as that of the other speakers."
"Thank you, Commissioner de Palacio."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"European airline industry"
"The next item is the report (A5-0075/2000) by Mr Sterckx, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions: The European Airline Industry: from Single Market to Worldwide Challenges [COM(1999) 182 - C5-0110/1999 - 1999/2113(COS)]."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the question you are really asking in your communication is: what does the future hold for the European aviation industry?"
"That is the key question approximately ten years on from the start of liberalisation within that sector."
"Liberalisation, as you point out in your communication, set a growth process in motion; new companies have sprung up, new routes have opened, new air fares have in fact been put in place, and so this has attracted a new kind of public to the aviation industry."
"The existing large and small national airline companies have become more profitable and have started to operate more efficiently without government funding."
"All these aspects demonstrate that liberalisation has stirred the market."
"We could say that passengers have generally benefited from liberalisation, but not all of them."
"For example, it is evident that the benefits in business class are only minor compared to those in other passenger categories."
"We now wonder how solid the basis for the European aviation industry is."
"In your communication, you stated that fragmentation is still far more pronounced here than it is in the United States."
"We have more or less the same number of airline companies, but their share of the global market is 38%, whereas ours is 27%, which is a huge difference."
"You also stated in your communication that the profitability of our companies is considerably less than that of our American counterparts."
"We also question the viability of the new companies which are appearing on the market, because how long will they last and how solid are they?"
"One cannot help but wonder how many of these will still be operating within the European market in ten years' time."
"Also, how tenable and sustainable is the growth we have witnessed within this sector over the past decade?"
"We are faced with an overcrowded airspace, or should I say a badly managed airspace?"
"We have congested airports to contend with and this is why, Commissioner, it is of great importance that you at long last make a proposal on the management of slot allocations for airports."
"I think this is a matter of life and death, especially for small companies starting out in the aviation industry."
"We have also asked ourselves about social development and the rights of passengers."
"This is why I wanted to ask you what the outcome was of the agreement recently reached on Gibraltar on this matter."
"Is that in any way related to aviation?"
"These are questions which we are still left with."
"Important steps still need to be taken after liberalisation."
"Firstly, air traffic control should, of course, be Europeanised."
"This topic is also covered in Mr Atkins' report and I will be tabling an oral amendment on this matter tomorrow, to replace 'privatisation' by 'liberalisation' ."
"This was agreed upon in conjunction with the large political groups."
"It is clear that another aspect, namely safety, should also be Europeanised."
"A European Aviation Safety Authority should therefore be set up as a matter of urgency."
"It is obvious that the Member States need to take a step back as far as these two aspects are concerned."
"I will now move on to the key point in your communication, namely the fact that there is no external policy for European aviation, in other words that the rights with regard to third countries have been negotiated bilaterally."
"This, of course, determines the entire structure of the aviation industry in Europe."
"Normally speaking, after a liberalisation process, companies tend to operate in tune with the market which has been liberalised."
"This is actually quite rare in the world of aviation."
"No mergers have taken place."
"An attempt to that effect was made by KLM and Alitalia, but this has now been abandoned, due in actual fact to a number of problems related to nationality, if I can put it that way."
"A merger between Swissair and SABENA is still on the cards, but we rely there on an agreement with Switzerland which we will be discussing this week and on a forthcoming referendum in Switzerland."
"What is happening is that, although European companies join forces with their American counterparts, they play second fiddle to the Americans."
"This is why I, as rapporteur, have a few questions with regard to your proposal to establish this common transatlantic air space."
"I am in favour of this in principle, but I do wonder whether we are not rushing into things or whether this is not too big a step, considering there is no solid base in place for the European aviation industry."
"A number of very complex problems need to be solved first before we can take the second step."
"As rapporteur, I am personally quite suspicious of America' s nationalism when it comes to transport, including aviation."
"Negotiations must clearly be held with a great deal of openness and reciprocity, as it is put, and the European companies must have exactly the same rights as the Americans, otherwise negotiations are bound to break down."
"Only then, as things currently stand in European aviation, will we be capable of competing with the Americans within an open market."
"An important question is: what do we do if we cannot pull it off with the Americans?"
"What do we do then on our own?"
"How viable is the European industry if it is confined to the European boundaries and to those bilateral agreements?"
"What is more - and I have skated over this aspect in my report, but Mrs Lucas has drafted a report on the environment which deals with this at length - we need to acknowledge that there are limits."
"The environment too has its limits and this is an important, in fact, vital question which we may need to ask ourselves, not so much following on from my report but following on from Mrs Lucas' report."
"Secondly, intermodality is highlighted in my report too."
"I think that the Commission too should be clear about this and should issue proposals to promote intermodality."
"Trains and planes could work together very well in a number of areas."
"At all events, Mr President, I would like to conclude by saying that liberalisation has been hugely important."
"I am well aware of this, although we are not even halfway there."
"In order to improve the current situation, we need to receive from the Commission proposals, concrete action plans and legal texts which we can debate within the very short term."
"It is also clear that the Member States have a very important responsibility and that a great deal depends on them and on how much they are prepared to put into creating real European aviation and a real European aviation industry."
"I think, therefore, that Parliament too, in tandem with the Commission and the Council, cannot work fast enough on this score because the world will not wait for us."
"As such, we need to get a move on, otherwise we will be buried under an avalanche."
"Mr President, as draftsman for the Industry Committee I just want to pick up on a couple of areas which I think need to be mentioned today."
"Aviation is without doubt one of the most exciting and stimulating industries."
"The opportunities for business and job creation during the last decade have played a major part in the economies of countries in Europe and worldwide."
"For example, aviation in the UK contributes GBP 10.2 billion a year to the UK GDP and generates and supports 380 000 indirect and induced UK jobs."
"It transports GBP 35 billion' s worth of UK exports, maintaining unrivalled access to the global market, and this is multiplied ten-fold across the European Community."
"When I began my career in the aviation industry 30 years ago, very few people could afford to fly."
"But today, with the liberalisation of the market, flying for most people has become a way of life."
"The report covers a number of areas and outlines fairly accurately the way the aviation industry has developed over the last ten years."
"But in a number of areas there is little recognition by the Commission of the benefits the aviation industry, including aerospace, have brought and I am disappointed by the negative attitude towards the industry in this paper."
"One of the key factors in the success of the last 20 years has been the privatisation of the national state-owned industries which began in the 1980s."
"I also welcome the Commission statement that subsidies have now ceased."
"When we look at the choice of routings and so on for the consumer, air fares have come down considerably over the last few years."
"Fares from the UK are amongst some of the lowest, showing what effect having three major carriers operating out of one country can have on competition and pricing."
"This has produced the real benefits and other countries need to take a look at this."
"The report outlines at some length the expansion in capacity which has taken place in the European aviation industry, particularly across the north Atlantic, but that is obviously quite a complicated issue."
"I fully accept that there are challenges which need to be addressed such as problems with congestion, in particular air traffic control."
"However, I believe that the Commission has a responsibility to put forward more balanced views which do not undermine the value and success of an industry which has made an enormous contribution, not only to the countries of the European Union but worldwide."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats supported Mr Sterckx' s report in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism as it will support it in plenary."
"The key message, as Mr Sterckx has reiterated, is that basically liberalisation has succeeded in principle."
"As a result we now have substantially more competition."
"This stronger competition has also created some movement in price levels, not in all market areas, certainly, but in many of them."
"Furthermore, what many people feared has not come to pass, namely job losses and deteriorating working conditions, and instead we continue to see rising employment."
"In the space of about eight years, employment figures have risen by nearly 50 000 and there really has been no evidence of a lasting decline in working conditions unless we look at this in the context of what has happened nationally, which is that national airlines are in a sense being transformed into modern service industries, which is, of course, accompanied by changes in working conditions and their modernisation."
"Nonetheless I am glad that the report does address the fact that we, of course, expect common rules - even if for a different reason, namely because of safety aspects -with regard, for instance, to working hours and flight times, because, at the end of the day, it is training and actual working conditions that will partly determine how safe we can make European aviation over the long term."
"Mr Sterckx also made it clear, however, that liberalisation concerns only a very small area of European air transport, which can largely be regarded as successful, but there are many other areas that currently continue to give us problems, whether these are old, unresolved problems or new ones."
"We are a long way from having a uniform, common European air transport market, in principle."
"I think in future we will have to deal with four important points."
"Mr Sterckx has already addressed some of them, and I would like to raise them again."
"In my view, the Member States' airlines must, of course, be in a position to have equal access to the international market, like other airlines in the world."
"At the same time, we must ensure that the airline companies really do achieve economic stability, which means we have to try to ensure, through appropriate competition on the ground, that the immense costs of, for instance, landing and ground handling charges are reduced to the kind of level that is usual in other countries of the world."
"Secondly, let me emphasise that we do want to see more air transport."
"It enhances individual mobility."
"But, on the other hand, we must not disregard environmental conditions."
"My position is fairly clear on this point."
"Bans are not the right method; instead we need incentives, we need to give support for the airlines to move towards reducing emissions by using modern fleets that use less kerosene and also produce less pollution."
"Thirdly, in my view we need to improve consumer protection because obviously the growing number of passengers brings increasing problems with it and, in this regard, the passenger deserves more protection than the airline."
"My fourth and final point, and the one I consider most important, is that we must ensure that we also have a single European airspace and we must establish a uniform system of air traffic control in order to reduce delays and congestion."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Sterckx on his report."
"It is the first in a series of reports on aviation which we will be dealing with in the course of this year."
"We support the development of a European aviation space encompassing all aspects of aviation, ranging from delays to environmental harm."
"In addition, we think that, at world level, the Union must be able to show a united front on this matter."
"We also have our doubts regarding the restrictions and automatic responses generated by national sentiment which, to this day, play such a significant role in European aviation."
"I would like to illustrate this with air traffic control, for example."
"These national responses and preferences also hamper cooperation, as we recently witnessed in the unfortunate breakdown in cooperation between KLM and Alitalia."
"We will not protest in cases where liberalisation can help achieve a more effective policy, but it is a pragmatic approach and not a dogmatic one."
"Indeed, where the interests of public services or the environment so require, we will not hesitate to advocate an active stance on the part of the authorities."
"We would also draw attention to the human side of developments within aviation."
"This is dominated by three issues: firstly safety."
"We back the setting up of a European Aviation Safety Authority which unites as many countries as possible."
"Our amendment on widening the scope in this way has been adopted by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism."
"Common standards and inspection agreements boost safety levels."
"This should not be restricted to the EU."
"We can and must help improve safety agreements throughout Europe."
"One is led to believe that lower costs as a result of liberalisation only have benefits."
"This may be the case for some passengers, but upon examination of recent annual reports of major aviation companies, this conclusion does not immediately follow."
"Personnel too experience the adverse, social effects of cost reductions."
"We do not want to let this situation get out of hand, especially when safety issues can be in the balance if, for example, pilots have to fly long hours."
"Finally, air fares may seem low, but often the overall interests of the passengers are hardly taken into consideration."
"It is no fun having to wait for hours because of a delay, on top of which you are likely to miss your connecting flight."
"It is even less fun if you become the victim of overbooking."
"Mr Sterckx rather feebly states in his present report that information on these situations must be made available to passengers."
"A fat lot of good that will do them."
"Passengers have rights and, more than anything, they have the right to be informed at the time when a problem arises."
"As I understand it, airports will be installing notice boards this summer on which they will display passenger rights in the event of delays, for example. This is a step in the right direction."
"It would be better still if the amendment on passengers' right to information tabled by the Group of the Party of European Socialists were to be adopted in addition."
"We are always harping on about consumer interests, well, here is one."
"Mr President, I only have a few minutes so I want to focus on just one particular point in the Commission communication."
"Let us recall that the title of this communication is 'From single market to worldwide challenges' ."
"Yet one of the remarkable things about this communication is that it does not appear to recognise that one of those worldwide challenges must be how the airline industry will respond to increasing environmental concerns and likely environmental legislation."
"Of all the many words in this communication, just one short paragraph is devoted to this issue."
"As rapporteur for a very good Commission communication on aviation and environment I know that the issue of environment and competitiveness is a very live one with strong feelings on both sides of the debate."
"For example, that communication starts by saying that the growth of the air transport industry is, and I quote, ""unsustainable and must be reversed because of its impact on climate and on the quality of life and health of European citizens"" and it goes on to say very clearly that 'business as usual' is not an option."
"It is quite obvious that aviation' s response to environmental concerns will have effects on competitiveness, some positive and some negative."
"Let us not underestimate either the impact of aviation on the environment."
"A report launched in the UK just yesterday by a number of environmental NGOs including Friends of the Earth forcefully made the case that one flight to and from the US could cause more pollution than the average UK motorist causes in a year."
"It makes the case that the world' s 16 000 commercial jet aircraft produce more than 600 million tonnes of CO2 every year - nearly as much as all the countries of Africa put together."
"It makes the case that the number of people flying will almost double in the next fifteen years."
"I would ask therefore that we see a bit more environmental mainstreaming."
"Rather than confining the environmental aspects of aviation to a report solely devoted to that subject, we should be seeing environment threaded through all approaches to this policy area, particularly one which purports to be addressing issues of competitiveness."
"Mr Sterckx has included environment in this own report."
"I very much welcome that but I would also like to see environment automatically mainstreamed through all Commission reports and communications."
"Mr President, in the first half of the previous century, many opinion formers claimed that the air offered enough space for unlimited growth in international transport."
"There was ground congestion and new infrastructure was very expensive, but anything was still possible in the air."
"Meanwhile, the countries at the heart of the European Union have been faced with unexpected problems."
"Thanks to free competition, record low prices and cheap, tax-free fuel, the airspace has become overcrowded there."
"Gigantic airports emerged near Paris, London, Frankfurt and Amsterdam with a great deal of transit movement for travellers from outside Europe."
"These airports continue to grow and they place a huge burden on their surroundings."
"Not only do those living near the airports complain, passengers too are dissatisfied."
"They are increasingly faced with delays."
"The air has more or less reached capacity levels in that respect."
"Thanks to new navigation techniques and low-noise aircraft, it may be possible to increase the number of flights for a little while longer, but this will inevitably have an adverse effect on the environment, safety and the reliability of the service."
"We have reached the limits of growth."
"Further growth of freight and passenger transport will need to be accommodated by alternative means: by rail or on water."
"Meanwhile, however, competition between air traffic - which is favoured by government policy - and trains and ships has become fierce."
"This is why the proportion of international train traffic and freight transport by river and canal has dropped so dramatically."
"There are considerably fewer international through train connections within the European Union compared to 20 years ago."
"In the remote areas of the European Union, however, it seems as if time has stood still there."
"People still complain there that remote regions and islands are not sufficiently serviced."
"New, small airports are expected to perform miracles as they could attract rich business people and masses of tourists."
"What is more, the areas surrounding the Mediterranean tourist beaches are also increasingly afflicted by accidents, noise and air pollution, and nature reserves are being sacrificed."
"During the discussion on Mr Sterckx' s report, it has already transpired in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, as well as from amendments tabled on this topic, that opinion is strongly divided on this matter within Parliament."
"Certain Members favour an increase in the number of aircraft, the lifting of all legal restrictions in this connection and continued reductions in air fares."
"I hear this opinion mainly from those Members who endlessly complain within the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism that their flight was once again delayed and who are very much guided by these personal experiences in their vision of transport policy."
"According to other Members, air traffic has grown far too much over the past decades."
"In their view, the conservation and protection of the natural environment are far more important than fast or cheap transport, and air traffic has already supplanted far too much rail traffic."
"It is high time that the safety and health of passengers, personnel and population on the ground were made the top priority."
"My Group is very much in favour of the second opinion, relating to the environment, safety and the interests of personnel."
"Air traffic cannot continue to grow endlessly and we cannot afford to subordinate all kinds of other matters to this."
"We consider that Mr Sterckx' s report falls short of being able to solve the actual problems but it is a first step in the right direction."
"I am pleased that the rapporteur seemed prepared to adopt a number of amendments concerning safety and the environment at an early stage."
"Mr President, the Sterckx report is excellent and develops a point of great relevance in great depth."
"It may not be obvious, but air transport is not an end in itself: air transport moves capital, it moves industries - be it the tourist industry or some other industry - and it brings people into contact, not merely in the pursuit of leisure, but in order to clinch business deals."
"The contribution made by air transport to the European and global economies is truly great, and it should therefore be both promoted and regulated."
"Regulated in that, all too often, there is insufficient planning, airports are located in inconvenient places and airlines are prevented from expanding by the presence of military corridors or restrictions."
"Clearly, we must not forget that the air industry is among the most global industries, for, nowadays, an aircraft can easily fly all over the world, especially if it is a high endurance aircraft."
"Therefore, while nowadays, it is an easy matter to relocate an industrial plant, it is even easier to relocate an airline, in that the means of production itself is, by definition, mobile."
"Then there is a problem of competition, particularly competition from the United States in the form of those huge carriers which are governed by standardised legislation which, I regret, is lacking in the European Union, both in the sphere of air traffic control - with the result that operational standardisation is lacking as well as legislative standardisation - and as regards the recognition of professional qualifications."
"For example, even today, an Italian pilot with professional qualifications obtained in Italy cannot do the same job in Belgium."
"Another issue to be resolved is the age limit."
"Some countries of the European Union allow pilots to continue flying up until the age of 65, but in other countries they have to stop working at 60."
"I therefore call upon the Commission to adopt common legislation governing the whole of the Union as soon as possible."
"Mr President, aviation is undergoing turbulent times."
"The report drafted by Mr Sterckx elaborates on the effects of strong growth within the sector."
"The enormous competition within the industry has led to a price war in certain sectors."
"The number of passengers and, alongside this, the number of flights, is growing at an alarming rate."
"The rapporteur is looking for the solution to congestion in a common airspace and European air traffic control."
"I support him in this."
"Competition also leads to lower costs."
"The pressure on personnel in the sector is increasing both socially and financially."
"It is vital to guarantee their rights."
"I endorse the rapporteur' s observations that proposals are required which deal with the social dimension."
"Passengers also suffer as a result of the commercial war."
"Although air fares have come down in certain areas, there are situations in which their rights - including those in the event of overbooking - are under real threat."
"This too needs to be regulated."
"The impact of all these developments on the environment is of vital importance."
"Achievements as regards innovations in terms of emission values, noise and harmful substances cannot offset the environmental damage caused by the dramatic growth in aviation."
"And this is not likely to change in the foreseeable future"
"It is therefore necessary to consider the position which we want to, and must, accord aviation."
"In some cases, only air transport is possible but in the case of holidays, for example, the increasing demand for transport can only be met through other means."
"This report should also accommodate the downside of a worldwide aviation market."
"Solutions which spring to mind in this respect include a common traffic control system, stimulation of technological innovation for engines and promotion of alternative methods of transport for passengers and goods, i.e. trains for passengers and coastal navigation for goods."
"In my opinion, imposing VAT on flight services and excise on kerosene, which are, in fact, levied on other means of transportation - at intra-European level if necessary - will contribute to a more balanced view of the costs generated by the different means of transportation."
"In short, the aviation industry is heading for stormy weather."
"It is up to us to guide it through this in the interests of society."
"In our opinion, the rapporteur is steering things in the right direction."
"Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, I just want to shed more light on one aspect of the Sterckx report, the question of airspace control, air traffic control."
"I believe that paragraph 8 of the Sterckx report adopts the right approach, for we must look to the medium and short term."
"I shall begin with the medium term."
"In the medium term we must transfer regulative competencies for air traffic control to the European Union, something that is entirely feasible."
"There is no point in people coming along and saying, well, Eurocontrol has far more members and is far better."
"Eurocontrol does not work and that has been proven."
"One reason is that it operates according to the unanimity principle and the principle of the lowest common denominator."
"I think the European Economic Area sets a good example."
"If the Community of 15 has the authority to set regulations, and if 12 countries want to join the EU in the next few years, then we will have reached the figure of 27."
"If we follow the example of the European Economic Area with Norway and Iceland, then there will no problem with including Switzerland in the same system."
"We therefore need EU competencies in this area, so that we can decide by a majority on the basis of Community law, rather than having to abide by unanimity and international treaties."
"We also need private service companies to carry out the actual operations."
"I admit that Mr Sterckx would like to see the term ""privatisation"" replaced with ""liberalisation"" ."
"I think we will be happy to endorse that."
"But we need competition, and, of course, he agrees with us on that."
"We must move away from a situation of monopolies and here I would like you to consider - although this is by no means a revolutionary idea - that if we have a single market on the ground, we could also have a single market in the skies, and that we should certainly allow different cooperating or competing service companies to control certain European aviation routes beyond the national borders, that we should move beyond the small-state mentality and offer services to airlines."
"We must go further in this regard."
"In any case, we will be discussing this again in connection with the Atkins report."
"I now turn to the short-term aspects."
"We are all grateful to the Vice-President for setting up a high-level working party with a view to achieving results in the short term too."
"I can only call on the 15 governments to instruct their civilian and military advisers to actually deliver solutions to the Vice-President by the end of the month, so that we will have something concrete to consider in June, and so that the Vice-President can respond to practical requests and take practical action, such as occasionally using military areas for civil aviation."
"We must therefore proceed with practical solutions, for we cannot have the same situation this summer as last summer: congested airspace, stacked aircraft, the pointless, constant combustion of kerosene in the air, i.e. environmental pollution of the first order!"
"Let us hope that if the Member States really provide the Vice-President with what she wants, she can then present us with a good proposal that also includes short-term measures which can enter into force this summer."
"Mr President, first of all I would like to thank Mr Sterckx for his report which addresses an important aspect of the civil aviation industry."
"There is no doubt that civil aviation has grown considerably over the last ten years and it is predicted to continue growing in the foreseeable future."
"There are those who would argue that this is due solely to the liberalisation process within that sector."
"Whilst I and my Group recognise that this has had a considerable effect on aviation' s growth, other factors have also contributed."
"In the initial stages of liberalisation, a lot of people lost their jobs, those who remained had to work longer hours and others suffered a deterioration in their working conditions."
"Also, on some routes, fares increased while others were so cheap that airlines went bust or built up huge losses."
"Another result of liberalisation has been the practice of co-sharing, of airline alliances, and in some instances even takeovers."
"We are beginning to see now an increase in aircraft registered outside the EU similar to the maritime sector' s flag of convenience."
"At my own airport in Manchester there are Icelandic-registered aircraft and I have been to Iceland more times than they have."
"The reason why I mention these points is just to lend some balance to the argument."
"It is very easy to say that liberalisation in aviation has been a glowing success, without ever recognising that there is also a negative side."
"My Group accepts that gradual liberalisation is a way forward but only if safety, working conditions and passenger rights are safe-guarded and strengthened."
"We accept that an increasing number of EU citizens are demanding better services."
"My Group welcomes the latest decision by the Commission to launch a campaign to inform passengers of their rights - something which the airlines in particular have failed to do over many years."
"We believe we need something more to ensure that passengers are better protected from delays and cancellations."
"We have all heard the excuses offered by the airlines, ranging from ""aircraft going technical"" , which is aviation-speak for 'I' m afraid there are not enough people booked on so we are going to consolidate' ."
"""Air traffic delays"" is the next one, but of course that is an easy excuse because there is never anyone from air traffic control there to say that is not the issue."
"Then of course there is the 'get them on board' scenario, irrespective of whether the plane is going to leave or not."
"Without doubt aviation has made considerable progress, but I also believe that aviation has a responsibility to its passengers, to its workforce, and also to the environment."
"Finally, my Group looks forward to receiving from the Commission its new proposals regarding slot-allocation, even though they have been a long time in coming."
"I hope this document will embody the view of the fair market access for all, in particular in clarifying the present legislative position regarding the trading of slots."
"Mr President, the report we are discussing today deals with the results of the liberalisation of the air transport sector in the European Union, which was concluded in 1993."
"We have supported this liberalisation process so that bilateral barriers may be lifted, ownership restrictions changed, technical standards harmonised, and suitable safety standards established and so that the conditions of liberalisation may promote greater transparency with regard to how air transport development policy is framed and allow, above all, the inclusion of environmental considerations in production within the aeronautical industry, in tariff policy and in the management of air traffic."
"A key point raised by the rapporteur is the current situation in which, while the aviation industry is liberalised and operates in an open European market, the authorities which control the air space, the airports and the regulating bodies, as well as the companies providing services to the air transport sector, still operate from an excessively local point of view."
"The rapporteur also mentions, as an unresolved issue, the continued state presence, in certain cases, in the ownership of national airlines."
"Turning in particular to air traffic control, the development of a common system of air safety is a fine challenge for the future."
"We must not forget that European airspace is a mosaic made up of 15 sovereign Member States, which, for a variety of reasons, mainly military, find it difficult to relinquish part of their sovereignty in this area."
"To this end, we must concern ourselves with resolving the issue of the policy of privatising the operational bodies responsible for air traffic control."
"With regard to charges, we share the Commission' s opinion that the costs over which the airlines have no control - ground assistance charges, airport taxes and atmospheric costs - must be transparent and non-discriminatory."
"Turning to the Sterckx report, our contribution has concentrated on the environmental aspects related to it."
"Our main criticism centres on the fact that the Commission, in its overall analysis, is trying to treat environmental, safety and health aspects in the aeronautical sector as a separate debate, by means of a separate communication, when, in reality, the impact of these factors on the future of the industry is crucial."
"I would finally like to mention some basic points."
"Airlines' pricing policy must include the external environmental costs of air transport. The regulation of slot allocation must be reviewed according to specific environmental criteria, taking account of noise and emissions into the atmosphere, and specific actions should be taken in order to strengthen intermodality with other trans-European networks, especially with railways, in light of the conclusions of the report on aviation and the global environment, which considers that more than 10% of European short-haul air traffic could change from air to rail."
"Mr President, according to the Commission proposal adopted by our rapporteur, Mr Sterckx, the main stated aim is to liberalise air transport further and make it subject to the rules of the free market."
"In this way, or so the Commission and our rapporteur tell us, we will see reduced expenditure on the part of airlines, better passengers services and more innovation."
"It is therefore proposed that airports, with all the strategic importance which they have for a country' s safety, should be surrendered to the multinationals, despite the negative implications this would have, and that the aspirations of private-sector airport owners to reap maximum profits should be promoted."
"It is also proposed that the sovereign right of each country to control air traffic in its air space should be surrendered to the European Union, on the pretext of establishing a uniform system of air safety. At the same time, the proposal calls for the privatisation of the operational bodies responsible for air traffic control which, it says, will be responsible for all the EU' s air space and will compete with each other."
"This proposal, aside from abrogating the sovereign right of each country over its own air space, will give rise to confusion and will have particularly negative and dangerous repercussions on air safety as, objectively speaking, the competition which is being vaunted here as the trump card will be competition for maximum profit and not for maximum air safety."
"The proposal argues that all this will reduce flight delays and hence the expenditure of the airlines."
"And maybe it will."
"Nonetheless, as experience with similar cases shows, it is doubtful whether a rise in profits will mean cheaper tickets or improved services."
"On the contrary, the situation will deteriorate."
"It is also proposed to end state aid to airlines. This, however, will prove disastrous for air connections to and from disadvantaged areas."
"Greece is a typical example."
"This ignores the indisputable fact, as the experience of official organisations and trade unions for workers in the civil aviation industry around the world has shown, that constant reductions in the running costs of aircraft and ground services, together with wall-to-wall privatisation and the private sector' s goal of maximum profit, are the reason for the continuous rise in the number of air accidents."
"These are the reasons why we shall be voting against the report."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have seen that the aim of Mr Sterckx' s report was to guarantee security, safety, consumer protection, fair competition and environmental protection."
"We agree with these objectives, but we cannot support the project to create a regulatory authority for air transport safety."
"We would like to have further information, particularly regarding the formation of this authority and we would like to know who would be responsible for monitoring it and by what means they would do so."
"Furthermore, paragraph 8 calls for, and I quote, ""the operational bodies responsible for ATC to be privatised"" ."
"We do not think that this is a wise suggestion."
"We are totally opposed to any kind of further privatisation, which could exacerbate the already deteriorating working conditions, in this area which is so closely linked to passenger safety."
"This privatisation will result in major job losses and will certainly have a damaging impact on safety."
"European skies are comparatively safe, and we want to see that safety preserved."
"To conclude, in order to guarantee the primacy of safety regulations over all other considerations, air traffic control must remain a public and national service."
"Mr President, I would first of all like to extend my sincere congratulations to Mr Sterckx on his excellent report."
"It has come, I believe, at a time when the aviation industry is very much in the limelight, what with the takeover agreement between Swiss Air and Sabena, the breakdown of the marriage between KLM and Alitalia, as well as the vicissitudes surrounding Malpensa."
"One could therefore say that there is a lot of commotion in the industry and this makes the report all the more topical."
"Despite the many advantages described by Mr Sterckx, the liberalisation of aviation has not given us heaven on earth - or not yet anyway."
"Just as Europe and EMU will need to be restored ecologically and socially, we will have to assimilate liberalisation with measures designed to better organise the airspace, increase safety and improve consumer and environmental protection."
"It became apparent during the Strasbourg debate on night flights only two weeks ago that European legislation on aviation leaves a great deal to be desired."
"Liberalisation without a common aviation policy and without a unified airspace will inevitably lead to problems."
"It is estimated that air traffic will double in the next fifteen years."
"At present, one in three flights is delayed and 450 000 flight hours are lost annually, and unless far-reaching measures are taken, the situation will only get worse."
"What is actually preventing us from taking a number of additional measures, except for a powerful lobby of airline companies and a misconceived concept of sovereignty in some countries which refuse to let go of the management of their own national airspace?"
"We have a unified market, free movement of people and a single currency."
"Why can we not move towards a single European airspace more rapidly?"
"Moreover, I fully endorse the idea of a common transatlantic air space, provided that this is not subject to unilateral European concessions."
"This is most certainly a lesson we need to learn from the vicissitudes of the hushkits affair."
"As far as the allocation of slots is concerned, I believe that more consideration should be given to environmental criteria, such as noise and exhaust fumes."
"In addition, the government should invest more in measures which improve the quality of life of those living near airports."
"This is often the case and is most needed at smaller, regional airports."
"In summary, and by way of conclusion, I would like to advocate a pax avianautica."
"The ingredients of the pax avianautica which we need to pursue are a unified airspace, a common aviation policy, viable airports in a comfortable environment, increased safety and strong, European airline companies."
"My home town of Ostend, with its noisy and unsafe, regional airport, will not fully understand the meaning of the European Union until we have achieved this."
"Mr President, first of all I would like to thank our colleague, Dirk Sterckx, who has put an enormous amount of work into a report which is extremely important as it is a policy document that will lead to a great deal of further discussion."
"Personally, I fully agree with the committee' s report, in that there is a need to open up the European skies, and with the need to unify them, since, although roads have been unified, the railways, the sea and the skies are not yet in that position."
"It is extremely important that we move in this direction, but this should not be limited to the creation of a new market."
"Personally, for several reasons, I feel that the tone of the report is excessively smug with regard to the liberalisation that has already taken place."
"Firstly, the competition with which we are familiar has created two air spaces: that of the major routes on which we see congestion, delays, queues and broadly inadequate consumer protection laws, although prices have, of course, fallen."
"I live in Bordeaux, but it is more expensive for me to fly from there to Lisbon than to fly to New York via Paris, and if I wish to fly to any other French city, I have to change aeroplanes at an airport in Paris."
"I feel that these effects of liberalisation should not be ignored."
"Secondly, I think that it is important to point out, as certain honourable Members have during this debate, that safety is not something that should be haggled over, and that European harmonisation of air traffic control must include this aspect of safety and it must not be handed over wholesale to businessmen."
"This is extremely important."
"I am one of those people who think that a European system of specifications should be introduced, some kind of agency, of course, but which would not necessarily involve privatisation and competition between the various air traffic control centres that exist at the moment."
"Lastly, my third reason is that the Union' s regional policy, which accounts for the Union' s second largest budget, is meaningless without an effective planning policy."
"Airports are highly decisive factors in influencing the location of businesses, senior officials, management, and therefore jobs to an area."
"I fail to see why subsidies should be banned both for routes and for infrastructures, when certain remote regions do not have access to airports."
"I feel that this aspect of regional planning should be taken into account."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Sterckx, as well as all the honourable Members who have spoken, for their active cooperation in the debate which has resulted in the report that we are discussing today."
"To a large extent, the report confirms the analysis which was expressed in the Commission' s communication on the European air transport sector in the light of the global challenges, since, thanks to the liberalisation of this sector, we have been able to establish a much more competitive market than the one that existed previously. The importance of this is clearly illustrated by the increase in the number of airlines or the increase, much less spectacular perhaps, but significant nevertheless, in the number of routes where there are more than two competitors."
"This gives an idea of how competition has increased over these years."
"The opening up of the markets means that the sector has evolved in very diverse ways."
"Airlines have developed innovative strategies in order to adapt to the growth of the market and the challenges of competition, but despite their restructuring efforts they still suffer a large degree of fragmentation and financial fragility in comparison with their principal international competitors, and I am referring specifically to the US airlines."
"Ladies and gentlemen, some of you have spoken of a common transatlantic air space, and I would like to tell you that this is a very important issue."
"The current situation is the result of the bilateral signing by various Member States of the European Union and the USA of the so-called ""open skies agreements"" which, in fact, are resulting in an internal fragmentation of the European market and making it impossible for European companies to restructure in such a way as to give them sufficient capacity to compete at an international level."
"As you know, the Commission is totally against these bilateral open skies agreements."
"It has appealed against them at the Court of Justice and I hope that the judgement of the Court will allow us to put an end to this situation and do what we have to do: enter into a bilateral agreement with the United States as the European Union as a whole, as a single internal market, and not divided up into different countries."
"The opposite situation may undoubtedly suit the United States, but in no way does it suit European airlines and European interests."
"One of the objectives of the negotiation of a common transatlantic air space is precisely to resolve, by common agreement with the United States, the current situation caused by the unilateral actions of the different countries which have signed up to these agreements."
"I must point out, ladies and gentlemen, that the reality of the internal civil aviation market in Europe has been affected in a very negative way by this."
"Just now some of you were talking about the KLM-Alitalia affair, which obviously involves other issues, but where, if the two companies had already merged, we would not have the problems that we are facing at present."
"It is true that one trait of European liberalisation, when compared to US liberalisation, is that the granting of state aid has been authorised to support the restructuring of certain airlines."
"It is true that the Commission authorised the injection of public capital - only once, as a one-off and subject to strict conditions - with the aim of helping companies to effectively carry out the transition from a regulated market to an open market."
"We can now congratulate ourselves on the fact that the majority of European companies have completed the transition process and that transition can be considered to have been finalised."
"I must say to those people who said that employment in the sector would be reduced, that this has not been the case and that neither has the quality of work deteriorated in any way whatsoever. On the contrary, more jobs and wealth are being created."
"Companies have been able to confront the situation and liberalisation has significantly benefited consumers, although it is true that it has not benefited all consumers in the same way; for example, it has provided less benefit in relation to short-haul business trips where undoubtedly the lowest fares are not usually adequate and cannot be used."
"I would like to end by referring to some of the questions that have been raised."
"The issue of Gibraltar and the agreements reached recently by the two countries involved do not affect transport."
"In this regard, therefore, the situation remains as it was before that bilateral agreement between these two countries of the Union."
"I would also like to say that intermodality, which is already being considered, is a key element in the balanced development of mobility and air transport."
"On the other hand, the question of slot allocation must be the subject of a Commission proposal since we cannot accept the current situation, in which many slots are lost, not all of them are properly used and, furthermore, let us be honest, there is a black market in them."
"We will make a proposal to the effect that slot allocation should be an administrative right granted under licence."
"We will try to ensure that there is greater flexibility in this allocation without causing any companies to go bankrupt."
"With regard to Iceland, I would like to point out that it is an integral part of the European Economic Area and is therefore fully affected by the legislation."
"I have left two issues until the end, not because they are less important, but because I wanted to focus on them for a moment."
"The environment is a key issue in the development of aviation and, of course, efficiency in the consumption of fuel per passenger is improving every day, although it is true that the growth in air transport is exceeding the improvements achieved in efficiency."
"We must therefore try to ensure that aircraft are modernised."
"The question of noise is also a serious problem."
"Lastly, I would like to make it clear that our primary concern, despite the fact that I have left it to the end, is safety."
"That is the main and primary objective and all initiatives relating to air transport, the single airspace, the management of air traffic, the regulation of air transport, must take it fully into account. All our actions must take account, first and foremost, of the basic objective of safety."
"The Commission does not hold any position in principle with regard to whether or not operational air traffic services should be privatised."
"We believe that, before we reach that point, some associated services could be privatised, such as, for example, meteorological areas, which would allow for greater flexibility."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Appointment of senior Commission officials"
"The next item is the oral question (B5-0218/2000) by Mr Pomés Ruiz, on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats (PPE-DE), on the appointment of senior Commission officials."
"I would remind you that the vote on this matter will take place on 17 May 2000."
"Mr President, could I begin by thanking the honourable Member for his question."
"I substantially agree with the points that he very effectively made."
"In fact I would only diverge on one point."
"He may be right that behind every great woman is a great man - there is a debate about that."
"What I am certain is true is that behind every great man is a very, very surprised mother-in-law."
"The honourable Member is, I know, very clear about the fact that responsibility for employment policies and patterns in the Commission, as a separate institution, lies with the Commission itself."
"However, in order to provide useful information to this House and to the wider public, I am glad to respond to the two questions which the honourable Member has put down."
"In order to give full and detailed answers to his first question, whilst saving some of the time of the House, I have sent a paper to the honourable Member listing the number of appointments of senior officials made in the Commission since taking office and also giving the names, nationalities and previous functions of all concerned."
"To provide comprehensive detail, that paper also sets out the total number of senior officials from each nationality in the Commission and of the total numbers of all A grade staff of each nationality in the Commission."
"A copy of that paper has also been provided to the secretariat-general of this Parliament for information and, naturally, it will be generally available to honourable Members."
"In this oral answer, therefore, I will summarise the situation relating to senior appointments as at last Thursday, 27 April."
"Since the present Commission took office, six appointments have been made involving promotions to grade A1."
"They related to three officials of German nationality, two of Italian nationality and one of Irish nationality."
"There have been fourteen other transfers at Director-General or Deputy Director-General level, which did not involve promotion in grade, although in four cases relating to Spanish, French, German and British officials, the changes meant advances in responsibility to full Director-General posts."
"In the same period 19 appointments involving promotion to grade A2 have been made."
"These related to officials of the following nationalities: 5 British, 4 Italian, 3 Belgian, 2 German, 1 Dutch, 1 French, 1 Spanish, 1 Irish and 1 Austrian."
"Eleven transfers at Director level which did not involve promotion in grade have also been made."
"In addition, two external appointments have been made in this period, one of a German national at Director-General level, and one of an Austrian national at Director level."
"In summary therefore, a total of 25 promotions to senior appointments have been made since this Commission took office."
"Six of the officials are Italian nationals, five are German, five are British, three Belgian, two Irish, one Dutch, one French, one Austrian and one Spanish."
"These figures are accurate as of 27 April 2000."
"As the House will know, in an international and multinational institution like the Commission, it is essential, as the honourable Member said, that the allocation of jobs broadly reflects the diversity of the Union that we serve and uses abilities effectively."
"Those principles of balance and quality are clearly set down in the Staff Regulations and the Commission is committed to applying them fully at all levels."
"As in any large organisation there is continual change amongst the staff of the Commission as people move, retire, become recruited, or promoted."
"As a result, a still-photograph of the staff profile at any fixed time does not, and cannot, give a complete picture."
"To be properly judged, balance must consequently be assessed and be maintained over the medium term and the Commission is also actively committed to ensuring that."
"In response to the honourable Member' s second question relating to the rules and criteria applied to senior appointments, I draw the attention of the House to the decisions on the subject which the Commission adopted and published last September and last December."
"Those decisions constitute specific legal rules for the institution rather than a generalised code of conduct."
"Copies of those rules have been sent to the honourable Member and they are available on the Internet."
"Against this background the following information may be useful to the House: the guiding principle of the system which the Commission uses is that appointments to all senior posts will be determined on evidence of the merit of candidates, including managerial capacity and other relevant abilities."
"In order to take necessary account of the geographical balance to which I referred earlier and to do so in compliance with the essential principle of meritocratic appointment, specific provision is being made."
"The Commission has rejected the concept of quotas because of its counter-productive rigidity, and also because it would breach Staff Regulations."
"It has, however, adopted a decision to ensure that all Member State nationalities should be represented by at least 1 qualified person in the most senior post, Director-General or equivalent, and consistent with that, the Commission has given fresh emphasis to assess effectively proven merit as a prerequisite of highest positions."
"The effects will be to maintain high standards of quality amongst the officials who lead the staff in the Commission in its vital policy, treaty application and management tasks and to do so whilst ensuring the broad geographical balance which is central to the character of an institution serving the whole of the Union."
"The system for making promotion to the highest posts facilitates these purposes of sustaining merit and balance and I will summarise its operation for the information of the House."
"Candidates for A1 and A2 jobs are interviewed by a panel of senior officials which has been assisted in the lifetime of this Commission by an advisory external expert with relevant experience in executive selection."
"That panel makes an objective assessment of the professional and managerial qualities and capabilities that are relevant to the post and recommends a shortlist."
"The shortlisted candidates are then interviewed by the portfolio Commissioner who is most directly concerned with the post and, in the case of A1 officials, by the Commissioner for personnel, who at the moment is myself."
"The Commissioner responsible for personnel then formally proposes to the College the candidate who has been agreed upon with the portfolio Commissioner and with the President of the Commission."
"In the case of appointments of Directors, the agreement of the relevant Director-General must also be obtained."
"At all times the panel, the Commissioners and the College are conscious of the commitment to quality and balance and therefore apply that commitment consistently in the interests of the Commission and of the Union."
"I can confirm that all appointments made by this Commission have been in accordance with these rules which are themselves based on Article 29 of the Staff Regulations and that will continue to be the course followed."
"I apologise for the length of time I have taken up but, naturally, I wanted to give the House the most comprehensive information."
"Mr President. I very much welcome the opportunity presented by the question tabled by my colleague, Mr Pomés Ruiz, to be able to start the debate on what will be many issues in connection with Commissioner Kinnock' s reforms."
"I would like to thank him very much for the very comprehensive and open response that he has given to that question."
"Today we have rightly focussed on what are the absolutely key appointments at the top of any organisation."
"After all, your reform, Commissioner Kinnock, is going to have to be led from the top and we very much welcome the confirmation you have given about the way in which the top appointments have been handled."
"What I would like to do in developing on Mr Pomés Ruiz' question is to table one or two other points to you in connection with some of the more detailed aspects of the White Paper and the change in organisation that you have proposed."
"Clearly the very ambitious reform contained in your paper is going to be a formidable task for the managers you appoint."
"To achieve your objectives of moving the Commission towards a world-leading international public service, it is clear that the appointments and capabilities of your team are going to be critical."
"You say in your White Paper that there is a real need to raise management skills and create a common management culture across the Commission."
"I would like to know first of all how far you feel that management culture is now being developed by your new top team and how far that is starting to be communicated through the Commission' s organisation."
"The important and welcome news that we have had today about the appointment of a new Secretary-General, Mr David O' Sullivan, raises the question whether he has been involved already and will that have an impact on the development that you have already set in train."
"The second point I wanted to raise has to do with what you identify in your White Paper - and I agree with this entirely - about the real challenges for any service organisation which is decentralising and delegating responsibilities to reporting managers, empowering them to take decisions and to have that all-important control of budget."
"I would like your assurance that the new team that comes in has those skills and also, and this is particularly important, that it also has a commitment to developing team-work in the Commission."
"This is going to become more and more important as we get more information-technology driven solutions, more horizontal team-working of the type that I know is moving into areas like the information society."
"Can we have your assurance that your senior team is going to be open-minded and looking at these new solutions?"
"Finally, your White Paper quite rightly notes that action is going to have to be taken when managers are not performing to the expected standard."
"It would not be surprising, given the changes, that there are some people who feel uncomfortable with this."
"Can you confirm that probationary periods, as set out in your White Paper, have been included in the contracts for the new appointments, how long those periods are and that systematic assessments of performance are included in those appointments?"
"Mr President, I too would like to thank the Commissioner for his reply."
"It is clear from the current debate that the European Parliament has asked the Commission to rotate senior posts and has already lent its support to this idea."
"We have also asked to ""de-flag"" senior posts."
"We want to see people appointed on merit and quality, and we as the Group of the Party of European Socialists very much welcome the action taken by the Commission so far, in response to Parliament' s requests."
"We have also ascertained - and I must say that a number of the questions raised a moment ago are really starting to confuse the issue again - that the Commission is responsible for its appointments and that we as Parliament do not want to take the Commission' s place, especially not as far as appointments are concerned, because we would then be throwing everything back into disarray, and I felt that some of the questions were already heading in that direction again."
"I would actually like to return to the very root cause of this discussion."
"If it were to obtain these statistics, I believe that we already had them at our disposal."
"If something else were going on, then we must have heard about it through the grapevine because over the past few weeks, rumour had it that some aspects were useless, that certain appointments or certain people had not been transferred and that some of them did not come up to scratch. It has all gone quiet now."
"All we have now is a number of very innocent, factual issues."
"If this is about the internal reforms as a whole, then we could say: OK, here is a White Paper and here we have procedures we agreed on."
"This very exciting and very extensive change is something both the Commission and Parliament want, but the ball is now back in the Commission' s court."
"We have precise data."
"The Commission has to come up with proposals on these points."
"Are we not up to speed, or is there something up with the Commission?"
"As recently as, let me think, seven months ago, we supported and appointed the Commission with an overwhelming majority, and now all of a sudden these questions are being asked."
"Should this be seen as an attack on the Commission?"
"Is the Commission all of a sudden incapable or is this a sudden, inverse kind of declaration of support on the part of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and that is why this Group is asking the Commission these questions? Those seemed to be the undertones for a fleeting moment."
"Our friends from the European People' s Party have thrown us into a bit of confusion because we are fully agreed on the key points."
"The rotation system is clear."
"The statistical data we received in this respect does not lead us to believe that anything should be amiss."
"Neither have I heard that anything is wrong with the performance, quite the opposite, in fact."
"That does not, of course, detract from the fact that, if you say you want to abandon national quotas, each one of us as we are here today would like to see some geographical balance in it all."
"In fact, the Commission too has admitted to this, without rushing to attach national identity to the individual figures, individual posts, because we would then be back to square one, as we would be pushing aside the merits of the case and forcing the national flags back into use, which would take each one of us some time to digest."
"I am speaking up today as a Dutch national."
"Despite this, I do not think we should operate at national level but should cover a wider level."
"Surely this position could not be any clearer?"
"I would like to add one more point which has not been discussed here but which I would like to bring up."
"The question came up: should someone who has held a senior post be transferred to a job in the public sector elsewhere without any further ado?"
"What should we make of it?"
"In our opinion, we really need new standards."
"This is what we asked the Commission for."
"The Commission was willing to produce these new standards."
"What you cannot do is judge the individuals who are not yet bound by these standards."
"If you ask me, you would be shooting the Commission in the foot and, in my opinion, you would be shooting yourself in the foot more so than the Commission and this is not helpful."
"In short, we are giving our wholehearted support to reform and we hope from the bottom of our hearts that the deadline is met."
"Since Commissioner Kinnock is present today, I would appreciate it if he could confirm whether he is on target with his staff and people."
"That is a mammoth task."
"It is our task to give each other very critical guidance, and to ensure that reform is brought about."
"We cannot see how these factual questions, which do not show up any defects, could contribute to this debate, unless there were ulterior motives towards the Commission from the start."
"As I understand it, the salto mortale of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats could be interpreted as a declaration of support."
"Mr President, Commissioner, it would naturally be rather difficult if Parliament were to take over the European Commission' s personnel policy."
"In my opinion, we would then be far removed from the efficiency required by the Commission."
"Because when you made your proposals back in January, and we studied them carefully, it was clear that the Commission' s appointment policy - and that is how we put it then - is a matter for the Commission and we should not interfere with it, unless there is obvious cause for this."
"We continue to endorse the guidelines you gave at the time for this personnel and appointment policy."
"First and foremost, appointments must be based on the candidate' s merits."
"This is how it was described in your document and I think that this clause should be retained."
"It is clear that we continue to support this."
"A candidate' s aptitude for managing an office is one of the key aspects, and I heard you emphasise this in your reply a moment ago. You made it clear once again what procedures are followed when appointing top officials."
"You have also already stated in your action plan that a geographical balance should be kept, which was, in fact, what the question was about."
"This too seems logical to me, yet it would not be beneficial if we were to rely on this provision too much and be too strict about it. After all, if you were to do this, in other words, if you were to weigh it up extremely carefully, then I think personnel policy would become impossible in the long-run and you would be very far-removed from the efficiency required in this type of matter."
"On behalf of my Group, I would say that this question was somewhat superfluous."
"One can enter into a large-scale discussion on the decisions taken today with regard to the nationalities of the people who have been moved, appointed or who have left."
"This discussion would be meaningless."
"The question which should be raised is whether or not this benefits the functioning of the Commission and have the procedures laid down by the Commission been followed?"
"This is the question we need to ask ourselves."
"Whether the person involved is Dutch or of any other nationality is of little relevance in the great scheme of things."
"What I do like, Commissioner, is that you, in your information, provide evidence of a transparent policy."
"I also welcome the fact that, based on your information, it appears that there are no major imbalances. I feel this should be acknowledged."
"We have been given important information, in my opinion, and I would therefore like to say by way of conclusion: let us not stand in the way of the Commission' s reform process but support it instead."
"We should not complicate matters - especially with regard to personnel policy, which is one of the most difficult topics - by asking questions which are not really relevant."
"Mr President, in September the Commission adopted some excellent principles which were to be applied with regard to its staffing policy, and particularly in the appointment of senior officials, but let us now examine today' s appointments in the light of those fine principles."
"I must enquire as to whether the panel actually interviewed the applicants, from whom the leader of the Institute for Future Studies was selected."
"I somewhat doubt whether any lengthy interview process was involved in filling the post in which Mr Levi did so very well."
"I would also like to mention that all the institutions should in fact adopt these rules concerning the appointment of senior officials, and we are finally able to say that the European Parliament has also adopted good principles regarding the appointment of senior officials, which must therefore take place very openly."
"Let me make an observation regarding representation on a geographical basis. It is quite right that we should aim to move away from national quotas, but that should not mean we should have a hidden criterion that actually favours the notion of representatives of large Member States and major language groups in senior positions."
"We must realise this."
"Finally, let me say a word about equality. Commissioner Kinnock faithfully made a list of the Commission' s senior appointments and promotions, but, Commissioner, you did not say how many women were nominated for, or promoted to, these posts."
"I would ask you to take a look at your list with your ""gender policy spectacles"" on and tell us the answer, because the Commission really has to set equality targets a lot higher than it has ever done before."
"Vice-President Kinnock, there is a strange atmosphere in this Chamber."
"The PPE Group' s question for an oral answer was to be one of the major debates of a part-session - and a passionate plea was made for the debate to be held in April - but, today, the PPE Group is I know not where, for it is certainly conspicuous by its absence from this Chamber."
"It may be that the decisions you adopted this morning have in some way assuaged the Group' s thirst for knowledge, but this Chamber appears to be unusually empty for a debate on such a major issue."
"I supported the submission of the question."
"I have been wondering since September, Vice-President, how it could be that such objective, such perfect, such universally acceptable criteria of competence, merit and so forth were met solely, surprise surprise, by officials living in or originally from certain island countries, while these same qualities did not appear to be present in officials from other, more misshapen countries - boot-shaped countries, for example."
"Let us forget the figures for a moment and focus on the functions."
"The A1 grade covers a wide range of concepts: an official could hold an A1 post and have important duties, such as Director-General for Development, for the Press and the Media or other Directorate-Generals, or he could be an aide."
"How can it be - and this is a question which I continue to ask - that these criteria of merit, surprise surprise, have only worked in favour of certain nationalities?"
"This is what is to be inferred from a careful examination which is not merely concerned with numbers."
"I continue to ponder this question, Vice-President, as I ponder the question of the appointment of senior Commission officials - officials or chefs de cabinet - who then unexpectedly book a flight and, via some European airport, London rather than Malpensa, desert the Commission for the private sector."
"I feel that this is also a question which, although it does not form part of our question for an oral answer, would merit a debate at another time in its own right."
"Personally, I feel very strongly that there is a need for this."
"Lastly, I feel that the Commission is making the mistake of giving Commission staff themselves too much say in the selection of new staff."
"It should retain its right to make such decisions and not delegate this task to its administrative staff."
"Mr President, first of all Mr Dell' Alba is certainly right with the first part of his question."
"The tone of the question when it was put seems very different from the tone that we are hearing now in the Chamber."
"First of all, we have to say that the White Paper reforms are progressing."
"They are progressing slowly but Rome was not built in a day and we must remember that."
"We all know that there is a timetable - one that we have all agreed to and must be kept."
"What I would like to address, before I look at the substance, is the question behind this question, - that is what we really have to look at here."
"It strikes me - and I will not be quite as subtle as Mr van den Berg - that the tone of this question seems to be the same tone as the Stauner report, the original Stauner report that was comprehensively rejected within the Budget Control Committee - the same tone that was set in the explanatory statement which was rejected by Parliament as a whole."
"We are all desperate to see reform but it will take time."
"The new Commission has been in office for only seven months."
"It was approved by the European Parliament by a huge majority."
"The question we really have to ask here is not to the Commission but to the PPE Group as to the motivation behind the question."
"It strikes me as being clearly politically motivated, trying to undermine the work done on reform, trying to shoot this new bird down before it has taken flight."
"This is because there is an element within the PPE Group, and I do not include Mr Pomés Ruiz in this, interested in wrecking the tactics of the Commission, wrecking Commission reform and wrecking the EU."
"And the PPE Group is being hijacked by that element within the group."
"I believe that this Commission is very open to taking on board some - I hope all - of Parliament' s concerns and criticisms, because we have criticisms too."
"But there is a time and place for that and this will be when we look at Mr Pomés Ruiz' response to the White Paper."
"The PSE Group want to engage in a constructive debate because we are interested in the outcome of reform, not in scoring short-term political points that do nothing but damage the European Union."
"Turning very quickly to the substance of the questions: in the Commission hearings the European Parliament asked for rotation of A1 and A2 posts and to end national flags on senior jobs."
"The Commission has taken positive steps since they came into power, ensuring that appointments are made on the basis of merit."
"Of course, in a multinational institution, we must be sensitive to national considerations but these must be seen within the medium and long term."
"As the Commissioner said, you cannot take a snapshot halfway through."
"We should be interested in checking systems and not checking individuals."
"The role of the European Parliament is to keep the Commission on its toes."
"We want to see appointments on merit but that does not mean interfering and questioning every single senior appointment."
"I would like to make a quick point on improving the equal opportunities aspect of the Commission' s reform proposals."
"Mrs Hautala' s question was very well put and we also would like an answer to that."
"We do not currently think that the proposals go far enough in terms of gender mainstreaming and equal opportunities."
"On parts 3 and 4 of this oral question I understand that the Conference of Presidents agreed on April 6 that these two questions should be removed."
"That being the case, I would like to ask you, Mr President, to look into why the services had still not removed those parts today."
"That is a serious problem."
"The fact is that Commission reform is going ahead."
"Mr Prodi has made some announcements today as the head of the organisation."
"Again, most of it looks at mobility but I would like to ask the Commissioner why the role of the new post, Director of the Economic and Political Council, was not advertised."
"That is a post that we would like to have seen advertised."
"Finally, I would like to ask the PPE Group to refrain from such politically motivated and unconstructive questions as we have here."
"I am confident that Mr Pomés Ruiz will not take that attitude when he responds to the White Paper, but please do not let your group be hijacked by a minority."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Morgan."
"I regret that I do not have any information on the question which you have addressed to the Presidency but, in any event, I will submit it so that you receive an adequate response."
"Mr President, I also want to thank the Commissioner for his answer and, in common with other women, request the figures showing how posts are distributed between men and women."
"Since the Commission delved into the details on 27 April, perhaps we can be told how many men and women there are in category A posts, not in category A posts generally, but broken down by grade, i.e. A1, A2, A3 and so on, for what is interesting is to see the figures broken down in that way."
"More often than not, it turns out that there are no women at all in top posts."
"And, in this connection, we could perhaps be informed about the composition of the panel - which should be an objective panel - in terms of gender."
"Perhaps in terms of country of origin, too, but in any case in terms of gender."
"Who, in the end, is to evaluate the shortlist that has been mentioned?"
"More often than not, it is exclusively men who carry out the final evaluation."
"Mr President, could I thank the honourable Members in all parts of the House for the constructive contributions they have made in the course of this debate."
"Perhaps I could risk some superficiality, because of the time, by trying to answer the specific questions raised."
"First of all Mr Harbour' s questions, which typically were perceptive and constructive, related to how far we thought that the commitment to the development of managerial skills and culture was being achieved."
"I will just stipulate one or two points that are evidence of progress."
"I would not claim they were perfect and this list is not exhaustive."
"So far as training is concerned, which, as Mr Harbour knows, is fundamental to the kind of changes that we want to achieve, the comprehensive programme of training for all managers in the Commission which should continue over two years commences this month."
"Secondly we are already embarked on the process of collecting mission statements from every Directorate-General."
"Most have submitted theirs."
"There is also the establishment of task assessments which we will do through a series of pilot schemes that will affect around one quarter of the Directorate-Generals in the first instance and then the compilation of job descriptions which will be undertaken over the period up to the end of July this year."
"The process of evaluation of staff, and that of course includes managers at all levels, is being refined and will be introduced."
"As Mr Harbour says, the role and activity of the Secretary-General in all of these activities and indeed in many others is crucial."
"I believe that Mr O' Sullivan has a very strong commitment to the direction set out by the White Paper and will be a notable successor to his extremely talented and committed predecessor, Mr Trojan, who will take up a new post from the end of this month."
"So far as empowering managers is concerned, the best instance we can give is that from May 1 we inaugurated the new internal audit service, the central financial service and we will shortly be having the first meeting of the Audit Progress Committee."
"These are the first crucial steps in the decentralisation of financial control, which is of course critical to the empowerment of management at all levels in a money-handling institution."
"Mr Harbour will be familiar with my view that as a consequence of making that central and measurable change, subject continually to examination, we will get a reverberating change of culture in the wider managerial style and operation of the House."
"Finally, he is right to stipulate that team leadership, team working and team building are all critical to the effective operation of modern managerial skills."
"We are nurturing that by the combination of structural change and supplementary training, evaluation and the appointment system."
"Obviously too, the consideration of probationary periods in contracts of appointment for managers will be a strong supplement to the direction which we want to take."
"But to do that comprehensively will require amendments to the Staff Regulations and I am looking forward to the cooperation of Parliament and the Council in gaining the changes in Community legislation which are necessary to facilitate that further development."
"Mr van den Berg was correct, and indeed kind and generous, in re-asserting the fact that the Commission must be responsible for its appointments and its personnel policies."
"I presume that he will follow through his enquiry as to why this question was asked."
"I can only say that I welcome the opportunity to provide comprehensive information."
"I am reminded that, in the hearings, correctly and forcefully, several Members of this House raised the question and indeed made assertive demands for de-flagging of senior posts, for the complete abandonment of formal or informal quotas and for the rotation of officials holding A1 and A2 posts."
"Those are principles that I not only agreed with at the time, together with my colleagues in the Commission, but have actively been seeking to put into effect ever since."
"If I can come to the point relating to new standards and outside posts, a point also raised absolutely correctly by Mr Dell' Alba, who has a question down on these matters and I am looking forward to answering it, I should draw the attention of the House to the fact that in the course of giving my attention to a specific case, which related to the departure of my own Chef de Cabinet, Mr Andrew Cahn, it became very obvious to me that the current arrangements relating to authorising the movement of permanent and temporary officials to outside employment do not have adequate clarity or consistency."
"In practice, the course of action and rigorous scrutiny which I requested to be applied in the case of Mr Cahn meant that his case was dealt with very thoroughly and entirely properly."
"I do not believe, however, that the Commission, or indeed other institutions, should have to rely on individual motivation by officials or by Commissioners and on rather ad hoc means of applying principles, which are, to say the least, rather generalised."
"I therefore asked the Director-General of Administration and Personnel to produce a draft for rules that would take into account best practice in the administrations of Member States and of other international public bodies and to give precision to procedures."
"Having such rules would obviously be the best means of ensuring transparency, consistency and practical guidance which would be in the interests of all parties, especially when, as Members have reminded us in the course of the debate, Member States and institutions are increasingly keen to encourage more exchange between national and EU administrations and between the public and private sectors."
"Naturally, when I have a proposal to make for new and improved arrangements, I will put them to my colleagues in the Commission and subsequently report them to this House and the other institutions for consideration."
"Can I take the opportunity of Mr Sterckx' s contribution to underline the point that I made earlier, a point which he wisely acknowledges, that no one, in consideration of the broad geographical balance to which the Commission is committed, should try to take a still-photograph of the profile of the staff at the Commission and represent that as in any way a permanent state of affairs."
"A moving picture is the only one that tells the full story and the Commission is totally committed to ensuring that priority is given to merit and full and proper account is taken of geographical balance, which is essential in a multinational serving institution like the Commission."
"On Mrs Hautala' s point, I would simply say that none of the appointments that have been announced today was the subject of a panel and there is a very straightforward legal reason for that."
"Mr David O' Sullivan, for instance, will take up his post by rotation as provided for under the Staff Regulations and equally as provided for under the Staff Regulations, Mr Ricardo Levi is a temporary official and moves with his post to his new position."
"So in legal, procedural and employment policy terms, the use of the panel system for promotion and appointment purposes was not required by the existing law in the case of appointments of that kind. I think that also responds to the point raised by Mrs Morgan on that subject."
"The question was also raised of women' s appointments."
"Of the 25 very senior appointments that have been made by this Commission since last September, 4 have been of women officials."
"That to me is modest."
"Mrs Hautala and others will know of my ambitions in this respect."
"I would only say that since that is nearly 20% of the total number of appointments, we are on target for this year' s commitment to ensure that we achieve at least a 20% advance in the number of women who are appointed."
"In the course of the rest of the year I can say with certainty that velocity will at least be maintained."
"Obviously, I would like to see it exceeded because there are a large number of highly capable women, as Mrs Dybkjær pointed out to us, in the Commission, and we want to see that quality properly recognised."
"So far as Mr Dell' Alba' s geographical excursion into islands and boot-shaped countries is concerned, as I say I am looking forward to answering his further question and doing so in great detail."
"It is significant that the island country, the larger island country, secured in the course of these months under this Commission no additional appointments at A1 level by promotion."
"The boot-shaped country obtained two such appointments - the boot-shaped country obtained 4 A2 promotions in this period and the big island obtained 5, of which, to the best of my knowledge, none came from Wales."
"I hope that is of some reassurance to Mr Dell' Alba."
"Mrs Morgan, inevitably asks from the wilds of Wales 'Why were there not any Welsh people?'"
"It is because, Mrs Morgan, whilst I am totally committed to geographical balance, this would mean in Wales having one North Walian and one South Walian or I would generate even more dissatisfaction in the country I love most."
"But Mrs Morgan did raise intriguing questions about the questions which have been put down; doubtlessly they will be pursued."
"I would like to say to Mrs Dybkjær that in the comprehensive pursuit of our policy for equal opportunities, there will be evidence as the coming months and years pass, of us giving attention from the point of the invitation to applications, right through to initial appointment and promotions, to show that we are making serious efforts to secure substantial advances in the number of women of all ages and all grades who are employed in the Commission."
"I can only ask honourable Members to wait until the physical evidence is available."
"But if commitment and the strong and active dedication of members of the current College is anything to go by we will achieve success in all respects."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday 17 May 2000."
"Legal aspects of electronic commerce"
"The next item is the debate on the recommendation for second reading (A5-0106/2000) by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council Directive on certain legal aspects of Information Society services, in particular electronic commerce in the internal market (""Directive on electronic commerce"") [14263/1/1999 - C5-0099/2000 - 1998/0325(COD)] (Rapporteur: Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi)"
"Mr President, the recommendation which it is my honour to present, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, proposes that the plenary adopts the common position without amendments."
"I have to say that this attitude has also been adopted by the various political groups."
"Mr President, I would like to stress that, by approving the Council' s common position on electronic commerce tomorrow, this House will be showing a very great degree of political responsibility of great institutional significance."
"Furthermore, by approving this directive, Parliament will be taking a decisive step in favour of the competitiveness of European businesses in the 'on line' economy and will be setting a milestone so that both consumers and companies will be able to operate in the internal market with the same guarantees and the same ease with which they operate in their domestic markets."
"The directive ensures that companies and citizens are able to provide and receive information society services throughout the European Union, which will thereby become a genuinely border-free area."
"European companies will be able to offer goods, services and information within the Union in accordance with the regulations of the Member State in which they are established and, therefore, in normalised circumstances, without being bound by 14 different sets of legislation."
"In order to arrive at these results, the directive harmonises certain areas, in particular - to name the main ones - the place where the operators are established, their obligations in terms of transparency, the requirements for transparency in commercial communications, the conditions required for the conclusion and validity of electronic contracts, the responsibility of Internet intermediaries, the settlement of disputes, as well as the competences of national authorities."
"In other areas, the directive is supported by the existing instruments intended to facilitate harmonisation and the mutual recognition of national legislations."
"Mr President, the directive includes - and this is important - all information society services, both business to business and business to user services, such as those which allow electronic operations to take place - interactive telesales of goods and services, on-line 'shops' , for example; services which are offered free, such as those financed through advertising or sponsorship, the on-line press, on-line databases, on-line financial services, on-line professional services - lawyers, doctors or other professionals - leisure services such as video on demand, direct marketing and all services accessed via the Internet."
"The directive is also - as I have already said - a great example of interinstitutional cooperation."
"This directive is a magnificent example of teamwork by Parliament, the Commission and the Council."
"Therefore, Parliament' s position on first reading, in particular its decisive support for the principle of the country of origin, was crucial to the Council in order to avoid the balance of the text being jeopardised."
"In general, the common position follows the guidelines set by Parliament and, apart from some marginal cases, no significant amendments are added to the annex which provides for the exceptions relating to the principle I have mentioned. Balance is also maintained with regard to the provisions concerning consumer protection and the responsibility of intermediaries."
"I would like to express my thanks, as rapporteur, for the cooperation of all my colleagues in the Committee on Legal Affairs, and in particular the leaders of the various political groups - especially the support of Mrs Berger and Mr Harbour from my Group - and the other institutions."
"The common position, therefore, maintains the balance between the various general objectives and the various interests, and we have not therefore tabled any amendments."
"It is clearly not a perfect text, but we consider it to be a reasonable and acceptable one, and it is crucial that it is adopted as soon as possible."
"I will not repeat - although it is true - that Internet time is much shorter than time as we have known it up to now."
"We must also understand that this directive is a priority in terms of guaranteeing the development of electronic commerce."
"We must take account of the globalisation of the economy and competition from US companies and the legal framework of the internal market which strives, as on the Internet, for a space with no internal boundaries."
"All of these elements are Community assets as far as the competitiveness of European companies is concerned."
"Lastly, the development of new technologies and market-related innovations make it essential that we establish a legal framework for the development of commerce, while, as this directive ensures, areas are set aside which are suitable for self-regulation and for the development of specific codes of conduct."
"This directive, furthermore, will provide a significant stimulus to small- and medium-sized businesses so that they will embrace, without delay, this commerce without frontiers. They are currently not doing so because of the legal uncertainty involved in dealing with many different sets of legislation within Europe."
"Lastly, several Member States are already legislating in this area and, without this directive, we could see a genuine fragmentation of the internal market."
"This directive, furthermore, Mr President, is a milestone which will affect all Community initiatives which have an impact on electronic commerce."
"The legal framework established by this directive will facilitate the adoption of other Community directives, such as the one on copyright, the distance marketing of financial services or the controversial Brussels Convention on jurisdiction, and will clearly help to remove the risk of incompatibility between these initiatives and the principles of the internal market."
"Parliament intends to monitor closely the transposition and application of the directive in national legislations, and I have therefore included two recommendations, two reminders to the Commission, which I hope will be approved tomorrow, not within the framework of the directive, but within the framework of the legislative resolution; one on the procedures for the detection and withdrawal of illicit material, and another on the drafting of codes of conduct."
"Lastly, Mr President - and with this I will end - it is symbolic that Parliament is approving this directive on the eve of the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the declaration by Robert Schuman, in which he stated that Europe would not be created in an instant but through achieving specific objectives which would create genuine solidarity between citizens and businesses."
"Fifty years ago, 'specific objectives' referred to the European Coal and Steel Community; today, as this directive points out, they refer to the information society."
"For this reason, Mr President, I believe that tomorrow this Parliament will be worthy of congratulation, and this congratulation can also be extended to the other Community institutions."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first I want to thank the rapporteur who, in my view, has done a quite excellent job on a very difficult subject."
"The e-commerce directive is such a very difficult subject because it is a typical example of how runaway technological advances and market growth can outstrip legislation."
"European legislative procedures happen to be particularly complex and the market is simply developing at a faster pace."
"Another problem facing us when we had to consider this directive at both first and second reading was that we realised that in many areas EU harmonisation has not made enough progress yet, for much of what was said in the discussion of this draft directive in fact showed up serious weaknesses and major problems here."
"By way of example let me just take the debate on the country of origin principle or, alternatively, the country of destination principle."
"In both cases, both alternatives, we as the legislator looked rather like the Odysseus of ancient times negotiating his way between Scylla and Charybdis, quite simply because we will create injustices in either case, whether for the producer or for the recipient of the product or service."
"We might also create other problems, which would later prove difficult to resolve in legal practice, for instance if a Portuguese judge suddenly has to apply German law, or indeed if a Spanish judge suddenly has to apply Italian law, in relation to a fairly simple case of secondary importance, simply because such combinations of circumstances could arise."
"So I must admit that I am not entirely satisfied with all the points of the common position before us."
"I still have criticisms about many of them."
"On the other hand, at the moment we do not need a second reading consultation, and certainly not a conciliation procedure."
"We must come to a rapid decision so that we can finally offer the users on this market a legal framework, even if, as the rapporteur rightly pointed out, it may not be perfect in every way and may still have a number of weaknesses."
"But that is why I also expect the European Commission to monitor the implementation of this directive carefully and, if this should prove necessary, to submit practical proposals for amending it during the current legislative term."
"I also believe that we may then have made further progress towards harmonising many areas of the law."
"Let me just give you as an instance the forthcoming harmonisation of civil law."
"Here the Commission has already given the appropriate instructions."
"The Tampere Council called for reports and voted on them. The European Parliament will also be considering this matter again in the near future and I think the decisions that emerge from this process could also serve as the basis for the further development of this e-commerce directive."
"Mr President, Commissioner, first let me thank the rapporteur, on behalf also of my political group, for this report and for the strategy she proposes, namely to accept this common position as it stands."
"We found this strategy convincing and we too can recommend that the plenary of the House adopt the Council' s common position on the e-commerce directive unamended."
"We do so primarily because we believe that this key component of the European legal framework for the information society needs to be implemented swiftly."
"Let me emphasise that another reason why we are able to adopt it unamended is because the Council - exceptionally, I am tempted to say - has incorporated many of the European Parliament' s amendments at first reading."
"That does not mean, however, that we do not still see much room for improvement, as other speakers have pointed out as well, and some of our wishes have not been fulfilled."
"But if we are prepared to set these wishes aside for now, for the sake of the speedy adoption and implementation of this directive, we also expect the Member States, when they implement it, with appropriate monitoring by the Commission, to resolve all the questions that are still not one hundred percent settled without this being at the expense of aspects that are important to us, in particular consumer protection."
"Here I am thinking above all of the interpretation of Article 1(3), which is still worded in a very ambivalent way."
"I hope that article will not be used to undermine national provisions on health protection, such as the ban on the mail order sales of certain medicines."
"I think we are also entitled to expect that the proposed codes of conduct, which will give those involved in e-commerce a very wide margin for self-regulation, will be drawn up as soon as possible and that they will be very comprehensive, with the participation of consumer protection organisations, in such a manner as to be really binding and easy to implement."
"I think we can also describe the rules that we adopted on provider liability as generous."
"I can only hope that they stand the test of time and that we will not have to revise them again in three years' time in light of practical experience."
"The adoption of the e-commerce directive does represent a very, very important step, yet a few other key building blocks for the e-Europe are still missing. As the rapporteur pointed out, the Council is dragging its feet on the common position on the distance marketing of financial services, on copyright in the information society."
"We also need to make more rapid progress in setting up out-of-court settlement procedures and the small claims procedure."
"Finally, I hope that the directive we are to adopt will also serve as a good stepping-stone towards finding equally good global solutions."
"Mr President, the passage of this directive at second reading has perhaps been historic."
"No amendments!"
"I congratulate heartily our rapporteur on her original strategy and I hope what will be her achievement of obtaining continuing consensus."
"I do not believe it has been easy for any of us as politicians to curb our natural instinct either to improve on or alter someone else' s text."
"Yet it was a carefully considered decision."
"We know the proposal is not absolutely perfect but the general feedback, both at a recent hearing in committee and from those who have lobbied Members has been: 'let' s have what might be an imperfect directive with a review rather than none at all' ."
"Speed with certainty in this fast-moving new world is essential."
"Now we have an initial road-map; a reference point for European businesses trading on the Web; a road-map that has clearly established the country of origin principle while still protecting consumer interest."
"That is a good balance."
"This should really open up the internal market to the many and increasing opportunities which e-commerce promises to businesses of all sizes, but particularly SMEs."
"We must continually be aware that the Web is not limited to Europe."
"It is, of course, global."
"A large part of consumer transactions from Europe on the Web is directed at American sites and in future may well be directed at Asian sites."
"European business has to keep up and the key to this will be confidence."
"We have to aspire to the establishment of the highest quality of e-businesses in Europe."
"Companies setting up or changing to this way of doing business have to look carefully at the way they operate, at the information and the service they provide to customers if they are to survive."
"We should also take care to provide coherent legislation."
"Confidence is essential."
"There are many opportunities but what of the threats?"
"Only this weekend we have seen in London the down-side of the communications and information revolution that the Web has created by putting elements in society in touch with one another, who have then wrought violence on the streets of London."
"This may be extreme but there will be unscrupulous people who will set up scams on the Web."
"One bad news story may blow confidence in e-trade for years."
"E-commerce is in its early stages."
"We need, as legislators, to be watchful, not necessarily interventionist, but wary of implications as the medium grows."
"Our rapporteur has given us an extremely good basis."
"The ELDR Group will stick to her original 'no-amendment' line."
"Mr President, there is a practice in this House of thanking and complimenting rapporteurs and sometimes I have to confess that I feel it can be overdone."
"But on this occasion I wish to say that it would not be overdone if I, on behalf of myself and my Group, particularly thank and congratulate the rapporteur on her work."
"Perhaps I might also, as a new Member of the House, and therefore of the committee, thank her for the marvellous job she does as the chairman of our committee - for the courtesy and kindness, but firmness with which she carries out its business."
"I have some sympathy with Commissioner Bolkestein here today."
"Parliamentary debates are not always marked by tremendous cut-and-thrust but today I fear it is a procession because we are all standing up and saying that we agree with each other."
"Is this, we ask ourselves, the death of ideology?"
"I suppose we could excuse ourselves with the thought that we are debating more with the medium here than the message."
"We are dealing with the creation of a new medium and therefore one which creates an urgent and acute need for regulation and for common regulation on a grand scale."
"It is therefore, and I think we are all correct about this, vital that we get on with it and that we do not risk unnecessary delay in bringing this into effect."
"Nevertheless, I was very grateful to my colleague, Mrs Ahern, also from the committee, for raising some points of continuing concern tonight and I would like to thank again the rapporteur for the device whereby she has introduced in an addendum to the resolution the points about the intermediate service providers and codes of conduct."
"That is important and I hope that the Commission will be taking that on board."
"Coming as I do from one of the very remote parts of Europe, it is exciting to speculate on the possibility that these new media will help to correct the apparently unstoppable drift to the centre and the decay of the outlying parts of all our countries and societies."
"In these circumstances we should welcome the chance to bring in an effective regulation on e-commerce."
"We must also remember that there is another kind of exclusion other than geographical."
"There is the lack of skill in these technologies."
"We are also challenged - albeit outside the scope of this directive - to make sure that we do not have an exclusion of people by ignorance or the lack of access to the instruments of this medium of communication."
"So let us be sure that we carry the directive but do not forget the other problems."
"Mr President, can I join in the very warm welcome to my colleague, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi' s approach, and commend her on the drive and persistence with which she has advocated this directive and the approach that we have taken."
"It is an indication also of the approach this committee will take on all the subsequent legislation."
"I would like to perhaps put a distinctive slant on this legislation."
"I am one of the few engineers in Parliament, certainly in the Legal Affairs Committee which is dominated by lawyers, and can put a rather different point of view sometimes."
"It seems to me that this piece of legislation can be likened in the technological world to the operating system of the whole legal framework that we are putting in place in the European Union for electronic commerce."
"It is this operating system within which a lot of other key legislation will be fitted, such as the copyright and information society and distance selling of financial services."
"All of those things were fitted into the overall framework of this directive."
"So essentially this is the core principle."
"I hesitate to call it the Windows because that produces rather unfortunate competitive issues these days but those of you who are software experts will know what I mean when I use the word ""Linux"" ."
"For those of you that are not so technologically enabled, Linux is a competitor to Windows that is owned and updated by the users."
"That essentially is what we have here."
"We have a system that is going to be operated by the users and the point I want to make this evening in now thinking ahead, because we are confident we are going to get this directive through, is to say to the Commission that we need to have a very comprehensive and a very fast feedback from the users about the problems and issues that they are encountering in using this directive."
"Clearly the Internet world is going to be highly suitable for the Commission to set that up."
"We want to know about issues where Member Governments have blocked transactions."
"We want to know where the directive is being tested in the courts."
"We want to know where consumers have had problems and feel that their rights are not protected."
"We want to know for some of the special cases which we have not been able to cover this time, like gambling - the effect on national lotteries - pharmaceuticals and books, the real problems that they are having. All of those I suggest need to be covered by the feedback."
"The final point I want to make is about speed."
"Mrs Palacio referred in her introduction to Internet years and the speed of approach."
"We were challenged by the Commission and by the Council to get this directive through as quickly as possible."
"I say to both of them, and in particular to representatives of the Council here, we have risen to that challenge and we now expect Member Governments to behave with the same speed to get this legislation transposed."
"We encourage the Commission and the Council to get the remaining bits of that legislation to us as quickly as possible because that is what Europe needs."
"Mr President, can I too add my congratulations to the rapporteur."
"There can be no doubt that the job of the Parliament tomorrow is without further ado to vote through the report unanimously."
"Commission, Parliament and Council have had ample time to discuss and debate at both first and second reading and, as the rapporteur said, most of Parliament' s views now feature in the Council common position."
"It is therefore a balanced proposal."
"Let us remind ourselves that the Lisbon special EU Summit in March set us new targets and deadlines to make better use of the Internet, strengthening Europe' s competitiveness in the knowledge economy."
"This therefore means we need to create a clear and simple, predictable and consistent legal framework for electronic commerce."
"It is now an economic and political imperative."
"The directive will go a significant way towards creating the framework which is necessary to provide the confidence that both business and consumers desire to maximise the potential of e-business."
"From the wealth of letters and comments that I have received as a member of the Legal Affairs Committee, I know it is not possible to please all interested parties."
"Concerns still exist but I believe that Council, Commission and Parliament have struck the right balance between the need to protect public policy and consumers and at the same time promote and support the growth of e-business."
"I therefore strongly recommend that Parliament endorses and adopts Mrs Palacio' s report, which represents a common position."
"We do this in the full knowledge that the e-economy is evolving at a rapid pace."
"We are witnessing in the 21st century the equivalent of the Industrial Revolution."
"That means, as policymakers and institutions, we are still navigating our way through uncharted terrain."
"We need therefore to continue, as Mr Harbour said, to have a full consultation and debate on both the outstanding and arising issues for business and consumers."
"In particular, this is the case given the global nature of e-commerce."
"We have in this directive an article which allows us to do that."
"Article 21 of the common position provides for a review and we should use the time until then to deepen and further our knowledge on this critical sector of the European economy."
"I would warn against complacency."
"We need to continue to consult with interested parties in this debate and we need to ensure that the result is a national legislation and that we produce clear, appropriate and speedy legislation."
"Mr President, Commissioner, e-commerce offers the European Union a unique chance to stimulate economic growth, strengthen the industry' s competitiveness and create new jobs."
"The legal framework of the internal market plays a crucial role in this."
"The present proposal removes a whole raft of obstacles and uncertainties which businesses are still having to negotiate in the field of e-commerce."
"These uncertainties have been there for far too long because the Council needed nearly a year to determine its positions."
"Similarly, the copyright directive has been with the Council since February 1999, i.e. for over a year now."
"In the light of the speed of developments, neither industry nor consumers benefit from such delays."
"Parliament works significantly faster."
"The country of origin principle is one of the internal market' s cornerstones."
"It is therefore obvious that this should be extended to cross-border e-commerce."
"One cause for concern in this respect, however, is that this principle will only apply to trade between businesses for the time being."
"Revisions of private international law for the benefit of on-line trade with consumers are in the pipeline."
"It is crucial in this respect that disputes are settled out of court as much as possible."
"After all, court proceedings are drawn-out and costly."
"I would therefore call on the Commission to support initiatives to this effect."
"It is unfortunate that the present directive is not being dealt with in conjunction with, and at the same time as, the copyright directive, because there are inconsistencies in terms of liability of service providers."
"How does the Commissioner intend to create unambiguous and legally secure positions for service providers?"
"I would like a reply to this question."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her work."
"I was not one of those who agreed with the consensus in committee about the tabling of no amendments."
"That does not mean I did not appreciate her very solid work and I would also like to thank her very warmly for taking to heart the concerns that I expressed in committee, particularly on the liability of intermediary service providers, codes of conduct and the participation of consumers."
"Without consumer confidence, e-commerce is going nowhere."
"This is fundamental, horizontal legislation that is going to be dealing with the whole Internet and its commercial viability."
"Unless we have consumer confidence and can deal with illegal content speedily without resorting to lengthy court cases, we will not have the kind of ground rules which citizens and consumers need and require."
"There has already been reference here tonight to the need for revision."
"Even before we adopt the directive we are talking about revision and I think that is very wise."
"Some of the concerns that have been expressed here tonight, particularly about dealing with illegal content and consumer acceptance, need to be being already pursued by the Commission before we adopt this fully as a European directive."
"I would like finally to thank again the rapporteur for taking on board the serious concerns that we expressed in committee."
"Mr President, with the adoption, without amendments, of the common position of the Council, the European Parliament is rising to the challenges of the current changes, to the demands of the new economy, at last setting rules in place governing the use of the Internet for trade and the provision of services."
"I will not go into the technical and legal details, which were covered by the rapporteur, Mrs Palacio with her usual competence, and I would like to thank her for the extremely skilful way in which she handled the legislative procedure for this directive."
"A further point: the new economy is something which the European economic and social model will have to address, and it must exploit all the opportunities for development and new jobs it provides."
"We are witnessing a new industrial revolution. Consequently, the structure of the European economy is in need of legal infrastructures and, tomorrow, we are going to meet that need."
"The absence of legal infrastructures is holding back development."
"The internal market has become a reality and the fundamental freedoms enshrined by the Treaty of Rome as objectives have indeed been achieved, but whilst in the past the creation of the internal market was an end in itself leading to economic development, now new challenges have arisen for a market which is being forced to compete with the rest of the world by the globalisation of the economy."
"The European economic and social model, which is based on the social market economy, is quite capable of dealing with world-wide competition, provided that it succeeds in evolving, eliminating all the unnecessary rigid constraints which are responsible for its continuing weakness in some areas."
"It is no longer good enough just to create any old market: the internal market must be competitive, regulated in such a way as to allow firms to produce and trade quality goods and services at costs which are compatible with those of competitors."
"This constituted the historic change brought about by electronic commerce - a revolution whose scope and implications are still not fully understood."
"We only need to think back to the issues we have worked on in the past: risk capital, highly skilled services, innovation tools and the protection of intellectual and industrial property."
"All these areas will have to evolve, and, in many cases, change completely."
"A malicious thought has come to me: what will become of the petty national protectionist behaviour which we have witnessed in recent years?"
"Now, at this time of revolution, a large number of issues dear to the European People' s Party must be reassessed."
"The social market economy also means solidarity and paying due attention to the more vulnerable strata of society which, in the industrial revolution sparked off by the Internet, also now include those who do not know how to use a computer."
"This potential for growth is our challenge for the future!"
"Mr President, I want to begin by cordially thanking the rapporteur and the Commission for the superb way in which they have handled this difficult but extremely important issue."
"The new technology is in the process of transforming our lives and, together with the new currency, can create a completely new Europe."
"However, we are not alone in the world; e-commerce means competition, not only for companies but also for politicians."
"Faulty regulations and obstacles both old and new can mean our failing to make the most of our historic opportunity for new freedom and success."
"The development of information technology provides new opportunities to communicate and to disseminate information simply and cheaply."
"The increased flow of information through Bulletin Board Systems, electronic mail and the Internet ought not to be subject to greater restrictions than traditional information channels and communication facilities."
"A guiding principle for the new technology ought to be that everyone should have considerable freedom to make use of it and exploit the advantages it has to offer and that everyone should also be responsible for what they do."
"The basis of a democracy must be that freedom of expression should be protected, not restricted."
"Communication using computers should be viewed in the same way as any medium of communication."
"It is stated in one of the items, item 48, that the directive does not affect Member States' ability to prevent a certain amount of illegal activity by imposing demands upon service providers who store information from their clients."
"I proposed that that sentence should be removed because it does not have anything to do with the criteria for being able to impose the restrictions concerned."
"It is not appropriate for the Member States to decide this issue or to demand that service providers be held liable for the actual details of the information provided."
"That would be as absurd as making a café owner liable for monitoring what is said across the café tables."
"Is there anyone who wants to see a utilitarian nanny State?"
"I do not think so."
"I therefore also support Amendment No 1, which I think is extremely important and deals precisely with this issue."
"E-commerce crime, or cyber crime as it is called, should, in my view, be combated by means of better working methods on the part of the police and not by means of legislation which is in danger of compromising basic democratic values."
"It is time to implement the decisions about quality labelling and, in cooperation with the service providers, to devise practical codes of conduct without thereby raising the cost levels for consumers or introducing costly bureaucracy."
"Freedom with responsibility ought to be the motto for continued work on developing this area."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too want to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on her report and her strategy."
"I welcome her recommendation that we should not suggest any amendments to the common position."
"All current surveys show the great economic potential of electronic business."
"The previous speakers have already described that in graphic terms, so I need not go into the subject or this aspect of it again."
"Europe continues to trail behind the USA in e-business."
"Yet we have a real chance to catch up."
"Europe is presently seeing a wave of Internet companies being set up."
"We must give political support to this trend."
"We must also encourage stronger competition on the local telephone markets to make Internet connection cheaper."
"In this context, let me also give special thanks to the Commission, to Mr Bolkestein and his colleague, Mr Liikanen, who has also done an excellent job here with the TC package he forwarded to us in Parliament a few months ago."
"Many thanks!"
"I think that means we have a very good policy in that area as well."
"At European level, the creation of the European single market and the introduction of the euro are certainly decisive factors in the promotion of electronic business."
"Furthermore, e-business will be encouraged tomorrow when we adopt a legal framework for electronic commerce in the European Union."
"That will send out a clear signal."
"It will show that Europe is open and is able to promote the Internet as a new form of communication and commerce."
"I believe it is also a good signal in terms of attracting foreign investment."
"On the content of the directive, I just want to emphasise one key point which some of the previous speakers have also addressed."
"It is the question of the regulations that a web trader has to comply with for cross-border transactions."
"Here the regulation provides that what is known as the principle of the country of origin should apply."
"That means that a service provider is subject only to the control and the legal system of the Member State in which he is established."
"The aim is to prevent him from having to comply with the different legal provisions of all the countries in which his clients may reside."
"That saves him a considerable financial outlay in these transactions."
"However, it also creates a new situation, to which industry and national legislators will have to adjust."
"Divergent rules in the Member States, on advertising, for instance, will mean that Internet providers in the European Union are treated differently."
"That is why we need changes to the law and more far-reaching harmonisation in some respects."
"In Germany, for example, we may well have to abolish the law on discounts and the regulations on free gifts."
"I am glad the directive also contains a review clause."
"I would ask the Commission to take that very seriously."
"We in Parliament will, of course, follow developments in e-business closely and give appropriate support to any Commission proposals for a revision of the directive in a few years' time."
"Mr President, I would like to preface my few remarks by echoing comments made by other speakers in thanking Mrs Palacio for the work that she has done on this report."
"It is not merely that she is not proposing any amendments - although that is an example that some rapporteurs might follow with advantage, rather it is because she has recognised the overriding importance of taking this legislation forward and putting it on the statute book."
"As has been mentioned this evening, e-commerce and online business are developing very rapidly and it is very important that we put in place a legislative framework in Europe within which it can develop and flourish."
"Indeed, as Mrs Wallis said, you must remember it is not only within Europe."
"It is actually a global industry and it is around the world that we want to see a proper framework established."
"It is always easy to be wise after the event and no doubt if we do proceed apace we may not achieve a 100% satisfactory outcome."
"It is one of the interesting characteristics of the Community system of legislation that it is relatively easy to bring forward amending legislation."
"This can be done quickly if necessary, as Mr Lehne pointed out."
"So there is no reason to delay."
"Speed on this occasion is of the essence."
"It is important that we are not distracted from setting a framework within which e-commerce can develop for the benefit of both business and the consumer."
"Professor MacCormick said that there seems to be a very great deal of agreement about the need to go forward without amending this proposal."
"One of my colleagues in another parliament, of which I have the privilege to be a Member, always says 'the one way of identifying things when you are wrong is when everybody is in agreement about it' ."
"On this occasion I do not believe we are wrong to approach this matter in that way and I hope this Parliament will agree with me with a big majority."
"Mr President, I would also like to express my gratitude and congratulations for the work carried out both by the rapporteur, Mrs Palacio, and by those who have worked on it in the Council and the Commission."
"Of course, it is essential that we have a legal framework in place as soon as possible."
"However, I would like to make certain observations which may be useful in this second phase which is so necessary."
"We should not forget that the Internet is international."
"We are talking about a directive for the internal market, but, as its original name, the 'World Wide Web' , suggests, it is international and we should bear this in mind as a fundamental reference, above all because the Internet is going to determine Europe' s economic position in the future, as well as its political position and its ability to influence the global, social and cultural environment."
"I therefore believe it is fundamental that we bear in mind that the bulk of this success stems from the creation of new companies, the creation of small- and medium-sized enterprises."
"Therefore, in the review which is carried out, it is essential that we remember not only the consumers - who in any event must make their own decisions and must use mechanisms for encrypting and protecting their data in accordance with laws and with technology - but also the SMEs, because otherwise there will soon be little electronic commerce in Europe."
"It therefore seems essential to make a genuine effort to homogenise the rules of the internal market and, at the same time, work energetically to unify the principles applied on a global level with regard to electronic commerce."
"There is no point in having sound regulations for our internal market if we lose sight of the bigger picture."
"In order to achieve this, it is also important to bear in mind that the regulations of the country of origin are fundamental, since, without them, small- and medium-sized businesses would find it difficult to operate and would encounter obstacles to achieving their objectives, because they do not have access to the same resources as large companies."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, ladies and gentlemen, I say 'yes' to the directive and 'yes' to the rapporteur' s strategy, for it is thanks to that consistent approach that I too have withdrawn my amendment."
"The electronic market is a prime market in terms of growth, employment and future prospects, and not just in Europe."
"We must therefore exploit all its opportunities and it is important that this regulation on electronic commerce has removed the barriers created by divergent legislative provisions and the ensuing legal uncertainty."
"The rapporteur analyses the common position in the spirit of constructive criticism."
"Let me pick up on two points of detail that are very close to my heart and where I would have liked to see the common position worded more clearly."
"First, there is the question of the sale of medicines and, secondly, the protection of books as a cultural asset in connection with the existing fixed book price agreements."
"On the first point, let me say briefly that in my country, Austria, we have banned the sale of medicines by mail order."
"So there is some concern that firms established in Member States where this is allowed could encourage Austrian patients to order and buy medicines through the Internet."
"In view of the health risks alone, I once again ask for extra clarification in the common position, so as to ensure that advertising activities and agreements with a view to the mail order of medicines are excluded from the area coordinated by the directive."
"My second point concerns cultural assets."
"Article 1(6) is the only article in the directive that refers, and then only in very general terms, to the cultural area, to the protection and promotion of cultural diversity."
"I think that is not good enough."
"So I would ask for it to be made clear that the directive does not apply to the fixed book price schemes introduced via legislation or arrangement in some Member States."
"Furthermore, operators established in Member States other than the countries concerned should not be allowed to undermine these schemes when selling to an end consumer."
"As far as I am concerned, the question of e-commerce in medicines and the protection of cultural diversity will be an important issue in the review scheduled in three years' time, which I welcome."
"I ask the Commission to devote special attention to these two points."
"Mr President, Commissioner, representatives of the Council, I had to hurry when I noticed my electronic gadgetry up there in my office on the twelfth floor was telling me the list of speakers was being worked through at a rate of knots."
"It seemed it was the representatives of our political group that were going at such a rate, and I did not notice."
"I am a little out of breath."
"Hopefully, however, it will not have an effect on the matter in hand."
"It was easy to agree with the explanations given in section 6 by the rapporteur, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, as to why Parliament wishes to adopt the Directive under discussion in accordance with the common position."
"As so many have already said, the matter is urgent, and I agree."
"Stressing the importance of the review clause is only prudent in such urgent legislative plans as these."
"I am satisfied that, as in the directive on electronic money for which I was rapporteur, a review clause is to be included."
"The directive in hand is immensely important as regards the competitiveness of the EU."
"It is pointless to deny that a veritable race is going on between the various continents in the area of electronic commerce."
"There is competition with regard to speed and innovation."
"From the point of view of unemployment within Europe, which remains high, we should remember that it is the early bird that catches the worm."
"New jobs will be created where the new technology is first introduced."
"We cannot watch from the wings while Europe consistently lags behind the United States and other global challengers."
"On the other hand, Parliament will not solve the challenges of e-commerce by intervening itself in a big way or through regulation."
"Wisdom is not always a characteristic of politicians, be they in the Commission, the Council, or in this Chamber."
"Too much regulation will freeze commerce over the Internet and prevent it from adapting to new circumstances and technical developments."
"This must also be borne in mind, especially in relation to the second reading of the copyright directive soon to take place here."
"To derive maximum benefit from e-commerce we have to ensure there is real competition in the telecommunications networks."
"Like Mrs Niebler, I would also like to thank Mr Liikanen, and express my gratitude for the work the Commission has done with such determination in this area."
"Only through competition will we be able to reduce costs, and thus increase the length of time people use the Internet, as well as increase the volume of electronic commerce."
"If we just sit here talking about details, we will not manage to lay down even elementary up-to-date standards for electronic commerce."
"How do we imagine we will be prepared for the next stage, m-commerce, or wireless commerce, if we cannot meet the demands of e-commerce?"
"That is why I support the previous speakers regarding the adoption of the common position with no amendments."
"Mr President, could I first of all convey my thanks and compliments to the rapporteur, Mrs Palacio, for the way in which she has handled this matter."
"She has taken into account the importance of, and urgent need for, this directive, and she has cleared the way for the prompt and final approval thereof."
"On behalf of the Commission, I would like to express my great appreciation for the crucial role which Parliament, and the rapporteur in particular, have played in the negotiations on this directive."
"Mrs Palacio has spoken about a milestone in the development of the European Union."
"I think that she is right and it is indeed a lucky coincidence that this milestone should be reached a few days short of the fiftieth anniversary of Europe Day which will take place next Tuesday."
"Parliament' s approach to this directive and the effect Parliament has had on bringing about the common position could well serve as a model for future cooperation between the institutions."
"I will return to this in a moment, but on behalf of my staff, I would very quickly like to thank those Members of this House who have carried out the Commission' s work."
"I would like to thank those Members of this House who, in turn, have thanked the Commission for the work it has done."
"Once again, this is something which my staff will greatly appreciate and I am grateful to the Members for their comments."
"I probably do not need to stress the urgency with which clear and flexible legislation is needed for e-commerce within the European Union."
"This is legislation which will offer legal certainty to industry and the consumer."
"Rapid approval of this directive is vital in order to attain this goal."
"In fact, heads of government stressed this recently at the Lisbon Summit, as was pointed out by Mrs McCarthy, among others."
"The directive must ensure that the principles of the internal market also apply to the information society services and that small- and medium-sized businesses, in particular, can consider the entire European market as their home market."
"Many in this House, especially the rapporteur, Mrs Palacio, have emphasised this aspect for the benefit of small- and medium-sized businesses."
"The Commission is therefore of the opinion that the directive will stimulate European integration and will, consequently, lead to greater economic growth, more investments in innovation and more jobs in Europe."
"It will also have a favourable effect on the European industry' s competitive position within the global market and this aspect too has been stressed by a number of Members in this House."
"Furthermore, the directive strikes a very precise balance between all private and public interests involved."
"This has also been acknowledged by various MEPs."
"Mrs Wallis spoke of the right balance that has been struck and this was echoed by Mrs McCarthy."
"Some Members are left feeling not completely satisfied."
"This is understandable."
"When the right balance is struck, this invariably means that one or other party cannot achieve its ambitions."
"Mr Lehne mentioned that he was not 100% satisfied and Mrs Wallis too has said that it is better to have what might be an imperfect directive with a review rather than none at all."
"This is, of course, true."
"As I said, I understand that not everybody can be happy when the right balance is struck."
"The French language captures this sentiment rather beautifully with the expression: on ne peut pas contenter tout le monde et sa belle-mère [You can' t please all of the people all of the time]."
"Parliament has not tabled any amendments and has thus paved the way for a swift approval."
"This is a wise and much appreciated decision taken by all major political groups."
"I too would like to express my appreciation for this."
"Parliament has been extremely sensible, if I may say so."
"The decision is justified, not only on account of the pressing nature of the directive, but also because the common position offers a sound and - I repeat - well-balanced compromise."
"This compromise is in line with the internal market' s direct approach, which received huge support at first reading and which was supplemented by Parliament."
"Parliament tabled a number of amendments at first reading which proved to make a positive contribution to the common position and which elucidated and reinforced the Commission' s original proposal."
"Those amendments have been incorporated in the Commission' s amended proposal and subsequently in the common position."
"It should also be stressed that Parliament' s rapid approval of this directive without any further amendments was made possible thanks to the excellent cooperation between the rapporteur, the Finnish Presidency and the European Commission."
"This has also been highlighted by the rapporteur and the Commission is grateful for this."
"In other words, the common position fully reflects the support which Parliament has given to the internal market approach at first reading."
"I think that we should, and can, learn from this close cooperation between Parliament, the Presidency and the Commission in order to accelerate the decision-making process in policy areas which fall under the codecision procedure."
"In my opinion, further consultation is necessary in order to find out how we can improve this approach in future."
"As a necessary step following on from all these efforts, the Commission will now commit itself, at Parliament' s request, to a swift and accurate transposition of the directive, taking into consideration the balance which has been struck between all the different interests and which undertakes to ensure that the directive is implemented correctly."
"This mainly applies to the country of origin principle which has been mentioned many times this evening, as well as the liability of intermediaries, which is also a very important aspect of this directive."
"In this connection, the Commission will be happy to meet Parliament' s request to issue guidelines for codes of conduct and to stimulate the establishment of effective procedures for notification and removal."
"I would like to say a few words regarding the specific questions which have been raised by Members of your House."
"First of all, I would like to address a comment made by Mr Harbour regarding feedback."
"In answer to Mr Harbour' s remarks, I would like to say that the Commission plans to monitor the implementation of a feedback structure by the various Member States very closely."
"The Commission most definitely intends to encourage all interested parties to keep the Commission abreast of all the possible problems which could crop up."
"The Commission will be setting up a website with this goal in mind, thus enabling interactive exchange with all parties, with the intention of taking these remarks on board when this directive is up for review in three years' time."
"With regard to this review, Mr Lehne expressed the hope that it will take place under the mandate of this Commission."
"This Commission will still be within its mandate, at least if Parliament so wishes, because, as you are aware, the Commission as a whole is, of course, reliant on assent from this Parliament."
"I will now move on to a question raised by Mrs Plooij who spoke about the way in which the different directives have to be aligned with each other."
"I would like to inform Mrs Plooij that the directive on copyright in the information society will be discussed during the forthcoming Internal Market Council, which will take place on 25 May."
"The Portuguese Presidency will make every effort to reach a common position during that Internal Market Council."
"One of the key topics which is still being discussed concerns the exemptions which can be made on copyright and, more specifically, exemptions for the benefit of technical copies, which are necessary to ensure that a free flow of data remains possible on the web."
"Needless to say, this point is very closely linked to the provisions of the e-commerce directive which we are debating this evening, provisions which concern the liability of service providers."
"I would like to assure Mrs Plooij that the Commission is absolutely determined to ensure that both directives are brought into line with each other with regard to this important matter, in order to create legal certainty, which is needed both by parties entitled and service providers in the information society."
"Finally, I would like to address a comment from Mr Karas."
"He has spoken about the trade in pharmaceutics."
"I would like to point out that the introduction onto the market of pharmaceutics by means of advertising and sale, etc. is bound by strict national and Community rules."
"Distance selling, particularly of pharmaceutics, is greatly restricted or even banned in certain Member States."
"Those restrictions also apply to selling via the Internet."
"Given the Internet' s global dimension, there is indeed a risk that Community legislation on advertising and sales of pharmaceutics via the Internet could be by-passed by companies based outside the European Union."
"The risk is there."
"This is why the Commission is now working together with the Member States to find solutions to this problem and to examine whether and on which points Community legislation is necessary in this field."
"This concludes the remarks which I would like to make on behalf of the Commission at the end of this debate."
"I would once again like to convey my heartfelt thanks, first of all to the rapporteur, Mrs Palacio, and also to all the others who have taken part in this debate for their constructive attitude, as a result of which no further amendments were tabled at second reading. It has also facilitated the swift adoption of this directive, at least I assume so, because the vote is tomorrow, so that we can swiftly move on to the next stage and implement e-commerce for the benefit of all EU economies."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"I feel I must thank you, on behalf of the House, for your exhaustive response to the debate."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m."
"Food Aid 1999"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0105/2000) by Mrs Schierhuber, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion on behalf of the European Community on the Food Aid Convention 1999 [COM(1999) 308 - C5-0148/1999 - 1999/0131(CNS)]"
". (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I want to sincerely thank all those who helped me draft this report, and especially the committee members for adopting it unanimously."
"Day after day, over the last few weeks, we have seen pictures of the dreadful famine in Ethiopia all over the media."
"While we all sit at home, replete after a good supper, our TV screens show us depressing new evidence of the sufferings of a people plagued by drought and hunger."
"This afternoon, in response to precisely that situation, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on the famine in Ethiopia."
"The European Parliament, one of the most important political institutions in the European Union, has a duty to take a stance on the matter and it is important that we do not remain silent in the face of such disasters but offer political, moral and financial support, given also that the EU is one of the biggest donor countries."
"The international Food Aid Convention we are discussing in plenary today could not take place against a more topical background, and its importance and necessity could not be demonstrated more clearly."
"The objective of this international convention is to contribute towards world food security, but also to make it possible to respond to acute food crises with different food requirements."
"By and large, I welcome the new convention for I believe it incorporates some very good ideas and covers a wider range of products."
"But let me add a few general comments."
"Firstly, we must at all events continue to provide food for emergencies such as drought and other climatic disasters."
"Here we need to ensure it is delivered rapidly and minus the bureaucracy, because aid can only save lives if it reaches the suffering people rapidly and in time."
"A binding strategy for closer coordination between the donor countries will help ensure that the aid really is effective."
"Secondly, we should set a long-term objective in our food policy, which is to create food security in every part of the world, so that the supply of food aid can be confined to emergencies."
"Food aid consignments should gradually be replaced by measures to improve food security in these countries."
"Thirdly, it is extremely important in food policy to take account of the repercussions on local food production and markets."
"These repercussions must be monitored and, as I said, local production must not be jeopardised, for I believe that would be counterproductive."
"Fourthly, the Commission has been asked to evaluate food aid to ensure that it is fully consistent with other development cooperation sectors and their principles."
"Naturally, the findings will have to be incorporated in our future activities, otherwise the evaluation would presumably be pointless."
"My fifth point is that we must be extremely careful to ensure that the aid actually reaches the target groups who are genuinely in need."
"In this connection, I am particularly keen to see women involved in the planning and execution of the programmes, for I think that would be a good step in the right direction."
"Allow me to mention another point, namely the problem of food aid on the basis of credit."
"I welcome the restrictions in the new convention, for our long-term aim must be to abolish the credit system completely."
"Instead, we should increase still further the share of food aid in the form of grants."
"In that context, let me also say that I fully and wholeheartedly support the amendment Mr Fiori tabled for the plenary."
"To finish, a word about the forthcoming WTO talks."
"Let me express my very serious reservations about linking the liberalisation of world trade to food aid provision, for that would be at the cost of the starving people, which can be in nobody' s interest."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Schierhuber, you have already mentioned the resolution on Ethiopia."
"Well, it is an outstanding example of how topical and necessary food aid is, even today."
"As such, we can hardly deny this Food Aid Convention review our approval."
"But we will not only lend our approval for the sake of international solidarity to relieve famine, but because this review encompasses a number of improvements compared to previous versions."
"After all, the nature and way in which food aid is being granted within the framework of this Convention to this day, has been, and is being, heavily criticised, and rightly so."
"Under the terms of the Convention, cereal surpluses from Europe and the United States can be converted into cash and removed from our market."
"In this way, local food production is often thrown off balance and deeply discouraged."
"The Convention is used as a lubricant for commercial transactions and often clashes with social and cultural traditions. For example, our rapporteur already mentioned the important role of women in the supply of food."
"Big bucks are often made on the back of the poor by making huge charges for transport and operational services."
"The European Union has codes of conduct which deviate from this and which it tries to apply to its own aid."
"These rules are now also incorporated in this international food aid agreement."
"The Convention has changed significantly for the better, in our view, due to the fact that not only cereals, but also other products, including local products, fish and vegetables, can qualify, transport and operational costs must be proportionate to the value and the least developed countries, in particular, will be able to apply for this aid."
"In my view, the intention to promote local agricultural development is vital."
"Despite this, there is still a blemish on the new Convention."
"The European negotiators have succeeded in cutting mixed aid in the form of loans down to 20%."
"But the United States remain determined to use this type of aid, which permanently saddles the most needy countries with a debt burden, even if this is at a reduced interest rate and if it does not have to be paid off for another 30 years."
"But what is 30 years in the life of a nation?"
"We fully endorse the agreements which should prevent a great deal of malpractice, by detaching aid from commercial transactions, for example, and by warning against disrupting the local markets."
"This can happen very easily, both in buying products and selling food aid within the local market, because speculations and price rises are just round the corner."
"The example of Ethiopia illustrates that not only the purchase but also that the transport, distribution and preservation must be monitored very carefully and, Mr President, given that we were in Ethiopia, the orders had been placed, there were plenty of foodstocks, yet none of it was there at the right place or time of the famine, I do wonder whether we should not fine-tune our instruments."
"Mr President, I warmly welcome the extension and modification of the Food Aid Convention and thank the rapporteur for her work on this report."
"The Commission proposal comes in for some criticism from the Budgets Committee in that there is no complete financial statement."
"I have to say, with the fluid nature of food aid it must be extremely difficult to project accurate financial figures."
"Now that the scope of aid has been widened, quite rightly in my opinion, from just cereals, this would be even more difficult."
"I am particularly pleased to read in the new Convention that least-developed countries and low-income countries will be given priority when food aid is being allocated."
"I am also pleased to see stronger provisions for promoting local agricultural development and local purchases as this also assists local economies and encourages local agriculture."
"There are now many areas of sub-Saharan Africa where, unless there is a dramatic climate change for the better, it is unlikely that food will ever grow again."
"I am thinking particularly of areas where the desert is literally burying the productive land."
"We are now seeing in Ethiopia an even more desperate situation, where food aid is being provided but there is no water to cook with. This is an issue that will have to be addressed in the future."
"Water will become more valuable than oil in future in developing countries."
"It is also good news that the new Convention covers transport costs and associated operational costs."
"Even if again this comes in for criticism from the Budgets Committee, it is not much good delivering food aid to a country' s ports if you cannot then distribute it to the remote areas by truck or by air to the people starving and in need."
"There is no doubt that past programmes have had a beneficial effect where they can be carried out and the fact that sub-Saharan Africa has a steady and worryingly increasing problem probably reflects the instability in many of these countries caused by war."
"This has increased the number of refugees dramatically and worsened the problem of providing food aid."
"The continuous need for an international, legally binding framework which defines and provides the commitments and instruments for the delivery of food aid to the developing countries is obvious."
"The extension of the Convention and the new rules that have been introduced must therefore be warmly welcomed."
"Mr President, I also wish to congratulate the rapporteur."
"Clearly from the comments that we have heard already, the global institutional arrangements intended to underpin food security, as recent experiences testify very clearly, need serious attention."
"There is actually a loss of confidence in all forms of food aid except for emergency food aid."
"Internationally negotiated commitments to tackle issues of food security problems are not, in my view, properly understood."
"There is still an institutional resistance to radical reform of food aid policies."
"This is summed up by the kind of tinkering on the edges which characterises the re-negotiated Convention."
"The institutional Treaty-based arrangements for food aid are, in my view, still somewhat outdated and created with a world in mind where food aid was assumed to be a major feature of development and of humanitarian assistance and relief."
"The arguments have already been made here this evening for compensatory financing, for aid to agricultural development, for export credits and for local sourcing; all of these criteria, all of these priorities are very well understood."
"Something people have not mentioned is that the European Union has actually gone further towards translating the understanding of these issues into action than any of the other donors, particularly for instance the United States."
"We welcome the fact that in our food aid budget line we target food security issues and that budget provides financial assistance for food security."
"That is very important indeed."
"Clearly the challenge is to meet the needs of the hungry in the most locally sensitive way."
"We need to see foodstock plans based on knowledge and transparency."
"We need to have the knowledge of where the foodstocks are, we need to assess where they are and we need to access those foodstuffs when we have identified them."
"We also need to monitor all foodstocks that are held in the world, both public foodstocks and private foodstocks."
"Finally, in the context of the WTO debates, we also need to see a guarantee of the legal right of all human beings to access to food."
"This will mean, and many of us said this in Seattle in the debates, that we would require inter alia a food security clause in any future WTO agreements on agriculture."
"This would represent very real progress in the attempts that we make to tackle food security."
"Mr President, this Convention will only be successful if, in time, it becomes redundant."
"Needless to say, structural food aid will continue to be necessary as long as we have so many seriously undernourished people."
"The aim of this prevention exercise is to secure the developing countries' own foodstocks and to phase out dependence on donor aid."
"In other words, the intention is not to help Europe get rid of its agricultural surpluses or to promote rich countries' exports by means of soft loans."
"Excess production within European agriculture must be drastically reformed in order to re-adjust the market, the world' s poorest regions should not be used as a dumping ground for products of stubborn European mismanagement, and our efforts to stimulate exports should not be aimed at the poorest and most vulnerable countries in the world."
"The Fiori amendment is preoccupied with Europe' s own interests and is therefore wide of the mark."
"In fact, it promotes exactly the opposite of what is really needed, namely a strategy which leads to self-sufficiency."
"This means that the focus should be on stimulating local production."
"If this does not happen, our aid will have the opposite effect."
"The local producers will then be pushed out of the way from the outset by free or cheap products and the affected countries will remain dependent on the 'oh so generous' donors."
"Another implication of a correct strategy is that soft loans would not be linked to compulsory purchases in the donor country."
"Moreover, the permitted 20% credit is not really of any benefit because it can lead to unfair competition."
"Despite what has been agreed, food aid must remain restricted to financial aid and a range of real food."
"As such, vitamin tablets from Canada do not form part of this."
"Mr President, does the Commission share my view that European food aid itself should be streamlined and should be stripped of time-consuming red tape?"
"Does the Commission think that this is feasible and could aid not be allocated via one development budget line?"
"Mr President, the food problem can, in principle, be solved, even in Africa, provided we have a cohesive development policy intended to reduce poverty there instead of increasing wealth over here."
"Our aim should not be to fill the purses of a few but to fill the mouths of many."
"Only when we manage to achieve this will aid no longer be necessary."
"Mr President, I strongly support Mrs Schierhuber' s report on food aid."
"Being myself a producer of food under the provisions of the Berlin decisions, which have already been widely discussed in public, I am aware how insane and inconsistent it is to use various methods to cut production in the EU while there is hunger in the world."
"Nowhere is it written that sections of the world population that live in an environment that has been destroyed by natural disasters or wars must not be allowed to eat."
"One euro a day is enough for survival and offers a chance for the future."
"That is feasible, in any case."
"In this regard, the European Union, the Member States, politicians, industry and science must take responsibility and break down the wall between prosperity and hunger once and for all."
"How will future generations judge us, I ask myself?"
"By the flood of megamergers that lead to ever larger and more uncontrollable giant undertakings, or by whether we manage to adopt targeted measures in the next ten years to combat poverty by cancelling the debts of developing countries, as an initial but necessary step?"
"The report rightly refers to a whole range of guidelines on fighting poverty."
"For reasons of time I cannot go into them in detail."
"But the careful observer will notice that there are different weightings at work here."
"They are reflected in phrases such as ""priority to the least developed countries"" when allocating food aid, or ""alleviation of poverty and hunger of the most vulnerable groups"" ."
"I am glad I am not one of those who have to distinguish on a daily basis between ""a bit hungry"" or ""starving"" , as it is currently presented in the media, while regrettably little is being done."
"The main part of the report correctly makes reference to the fact that its aim, ultimately, should be to make food aid unnecessary."
"But we cannot do that unless the politicians agree that hunger is not a political weapon and unless the responsible leaders in every area of society all realise that we only have the world on lease from our children."
"We hold the goods of this earth on trust for our descendants."
"If we take that approach, then I am convinced we really can combat poverty."
"Mr President, I am, of course, in favour of food aid for starving people, despite the commercial operations that are hidden behind this aid and despite the conflicts of interest which divide rich countries on this issue."
"First of all, I wish to condemn the derisory extent of this aid compared to what is actually needed."
"The European Union prides itself on having given a commitment to supply 1.322 million tonnes of wheat equivalent, but, at the same time, the report states that there are 791 million people suffering from malnutrition in poor countries, 124 million of whom live in sub-Saharan Africa alone, where Europe is supposed to be particularly closely involved."
"Work it out for yourself: European aid comes to around 7 kilos of wheat equivalent per person per year, which is less than twenty grammes per day, and the report is cynical enough to stress the fact that food aid must not discourage local production."
"It is not food aid that has ruined agricultural production in many African countries, however. It is the iron grip of huge European and American industrial or agricultural concerns, which have imposed the cultivation of hevea, coffee, groundnut, cotton and even out-of-season fruit and vegetables for the European market, at the expense of their own food crops."
"Even in terms of food production, habits have been foisted on the populations of these countries by forcing them to consume rice or wheat-based products, which they can only obtain on the world market, generating profit along the way for a handful of huge Western companies."
"In places, the report smacks of ""Lady Bountiful"" and presents this aid as an act of charity on the part of Europe, but Europe, or rather its privileged class, is responsible for the ruin of Africa, and that includes the ruin of its self-sufficiency in food."
"It is not charity, then, that Africa needs."
"What it needs is the European and American multinationals to stop bleeding it dry. It needs Europe to provide the African people with simple machinery, such as water pumps and industrial products to compensate for what it plundered throughout colonial times and afterwards."
"Africa will then be in a position to develop its agriculture to a level where it can produce the food to feed its people properly."
"Of course, I am not naïve enough to think that one decent resolution passed in the European Parliament will be enough to guarantee this."
"It would require an end to capital' s dictatorship of Europe as well as of Africa, and the only reason why I have voted in favour of this report is in order not to stand in the way of this aid."
"Mr President, in our work on food aid we must not forget that, even today, there are hundreds of millions of undernourished people in the world."
"The endeavours of our predecessors in the Community institutions succeeded in reducing the total number of undernourished people by over 20% in the space of 30 years."
"In recent years, the trend has been reversed, which is extremely odd considering the efforts made by the Western world: in certain areas of our planet, the number of undernourished people is constantly on the up and the problem is heightened by natural disasters or, even worse, wars, which have continued to hit the headlines recently."
"We must therefore congratulate ourselves on the fact that this issue is still on the agenda of the European Parliament and the countries of the European Union."
"I was very pleased to note that, as is the case in the Convention we are discussing now, the Community legislator has consistently striven to guarantee food security and not subsistence."
"The ultimate purpose behind our aid is to bring about food security: with the passage of time, the aid must be gradually replaced by tangible measures and sustainable instruments for consolidating that security, eliminating, at last, the need for any form of aid or intervention."
"I am sure that our fellow citizens fully approve and support any initiative undertaken by the Community institutions on the matter of aid, or, even better, support for those communities which are less fortunate than we are."
"However, I cannot miss this opportunity to touch on an aspect, a principle which, I feel, is of paramount importance, precisely to our fellow citizens."
"In my opinion, the correct weighting should be given to European production."
"The Convention does not give any form of priority to European products, not even agricultural produce, which are intended for humanitarian aid."
"Europe has always been one of the highest-producing continents in the agricultural sector."
"For example, the European Union is one of the world's largest producers of starchy products, which are essential for nutrition."
"This productivity must not be undervalued or underestimated in respect of the produce available on world markets, even in the provision of aid to the most disadvantaged communities."
"For this reason, I have tabled an amendment, not to the draft Convention, which, I am aware, cannot be amended, but to Mrs Schierhuber' s resolution."
"This amendment has been judged inadmissible, but my aim in tabling it was to provoke a debate of substance in this Chamber on a topic which, I feel, is of vital concern to our farmers, particularly at this difficult time for them in the aftermath of the reform of the common agricultural policy."
"In conclusion, I would stress that the purpose of my amendment, and the purpose, now, of this speech, is to promote the cause of Community products, in particular, agricultural produce, at the time of the conclusion of international agreements, and to urge the European executive bodies not to disregard the millions of people whose livelihood depends on European produce, and I refer not to consumers but to producers."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, allow me to offer my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Schierhuber, for her report and her proposal to adopt the Council decision on the Food Aid Convention."
"As you know, the International Wheat Agreement comprises two separate legislative texts, the Grains Trade Convention and the Food Aid Convention."
"The Grains Trade Convention was fundamentally amended as early as 1995, which meant there was no need to envisage amendments to the new convention."
"And that is why the Commission requested extending the period of validity of that convention until 30 June 2001."
"In the case of the Food Aid Convention, however, the Committee on Food Aid decided to renegotiate the agreement and in particular to take on board the recommendations of the Singapore Conference."
"The purpose of the new 1999 Food Aid Convention is to contribute to creating food security in the world and to enhance the international community' s ability to respond more effectively to acute food crises and the food requirements of the developing countries."
"The new convention attaches special importance to the following points."
"Firstly, more consideration is to be given to local nutritional customs."
"Secondly, the donor countries can now express their commitments in tonnage, value or a combination of tonnage and value."
"Thirdly, the members of the convention must give priority to the least developed countries and the lowest income countries when allocating their food aid."
"Fourthly, stronger provisions are introduced for promoting local agricultural development, including possible triangular transactions and local purchases."
"More than half the relevant Commission resources will go to such transactions."
"My fifth point is that food aid to the least developed countries will be given purely in the form of grants."
"Overall, food aid provided in the form of grants will represent not less than 80% of a member' s contributions and members will strive to raise this percentage even higher."
"Next, in determining whether, and to what extent, the food aid provision on long-term concessional credit terms should continue to be covered under the Food Aid Convention, FAC members will take account of the results of the relevant multilateral negotiations."
"In this connection, the European Union and some other members reaffirmed their opinion that food aid provided under credit terms should no longer be included in the list of food aid operations."
"Our position is as follows: food aid must be clearly separated from commercial transactions."
"My seventh point is that the new Food Aid Convention is intended to improve the monitoring of the effectiveness and impact of food aid transactions and cooperation between food aid donors, recipients and others concerned."
"Eight, the provision of food aid under this convention will not be tied in any way to commercial exports of goods or services."
"In conclusion, since several speakers raised this question during the debate, let me tell you how much aid we are currently providing for Ethiopia."
"The Commission and the Community are in a position to mobilise 542 526 tonnes of cereals between April 2000 and March 2001, i.e. immediately, this year."
"Let me also point out that during the negotiations we kept in constant contact with the food aid recipient countries so that we were always aware of their position."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Aid to uprooted people in Asia and Latin America"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0065/2000) by Mr Deva, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation (EC) extending Regulation (EC) No 443/97 on operations to aid uprooted people in Asian and Latin American developing countries [COM(1999) 443 - C5-0146/1999 - 1999/0194 (COD)]"
"Mr President, I am indeed privileged today to present this report to Parliament."
"It is one of the first reports from the Development Committee under the codecision procedure."
"I am particularly grateful to all my colleagues who have turned up in force to hear me speak and present my first report to Parliament and the heaving public galleries."
"All are waiting with bated breadth to hear my speech."
"This is a very urgent matter."
"It is my hope that we can pass this report without any substantial amendment other than procedural ones because the report is an extension for one year of an existing regulation which supports four million refugees in the most war-torn and ravaged part of the world."
"If we delay or fail to pass this report in plenary as soon as possible, all further assistance, food supply, housing, shelter, water, sanitation and education, to the most vulnerable people in the world, will be severely affected as there will be no legal base in the European Union to support them and to fund them."
"What we are doing today is to consider a Commission proposal to extend the regulation on aid to uprooted people in Asia and Latin America, which expired on 31 December 1999."
"The extension we propose is for one year until 31 December 2000."
"The extension of the regulation will enable a further EUR 40 million to be spent until the end of this year."
"Between 1997 and 1999, Parliament sanctioned EUR 240 million."
"This regulation came to an end on 31 December 1999."
"By extending this regulation today for a further period of one year, we are also giving the Commission time to prepare a new regulation which I hope will be a multiannual one to replace the existing regulation."
"This new regulation, to be brought in at a later date, should build on, and take into account, the existing regulation as well the annual report and the evaluation which the Commission has undertaken to present to Parliament and Council in the very near future, and no later than September."
"The European Parliament' s original report on the current regulation, the Howitt report, was exemplary in how it was constructed by Parliament."
"It had considerable success in improving the existing draft and thus played an important part in supporting and improving the text which was finally adopted."
"Notably, the Parliament contributed to a strengthening of the regulation in its reference to environmental concerns, complementary support and cooperation and assisting local host populations, a strong approach for targeting support programmes towards women refugees, particularly those who have been the victims of rape, and a clear provision for the upholding of the ""non-refoulement"" principle, i.e. protection against forced return."
"Mr Howitt engaged then in a very positive dialogue with the Irish presidency as well as with the Commission in order to improve on the existing draft."
"In addition, and more importantly, more than fifty NGOs were consulted."
"Therefore the Parliament played a major role in producing this regulation with its report."
"Support to uprooted people, refugees, returnees and internally displaced people in Latin America and Asian developing countries has been a feature of the Community budget since 1984."
"The UNHCR estimates that there are 4.8 million in Asia and some 88 000 in Latin America."
"Of these, the current regulation and the one year extension that our report today is calling for, will continue to help 2.9 million Afghani refugees of whom about 40% are in Pakistan and Iran and the 60% balance in Afghanistan itself."
"A total of EUR 24.3 million was given to Afghani refugees with a further EUR 960 000 to Thailand, EUR 6 million to Sri Lanka, EUR 11.8 million to Burma and EUR 1.8 million to Nepal."
"In Afghanistan, about 2 million people were assisted by the mine-clearance programme which is crucial in returning that country back to normality."
"Therefore, in a sense, an immediate approval of the proposal would postpone the need for a long-term solution."
"In doing so it would nevertheless allow the institutions to engage in a more thorough dialogue in this area and hopefully allow us to find a more permanent solution by 2001."
"This is also a very timely report in the context of asylum-seekers."
"We are now presented with a solution by this Parliament, by our institutions in Europe, where we want to and can help people where the problem is."
"We can stop people needing or wanting to come across if we can help them at the place where the problem has arisen."
"The central thrust of my report is to help the people in war-torn areas, in ravaged parts of the world, to settle back to normality, to have proper foundations and sanitation, proper infrastructure, and to stop them needing to travel as asylum seekers and refugees."
"Mr President, may I begin by stating how bizarre it is that we are debating the extension of a regulation tonight in May 2000 that already expired last December and which, under the Commission' s proposal, would again expire in seven months' time."
"As the rapporteur for this Parliament on the original resolution four years ago, I cannot but comment that this represents a failure of political commitment in Europe to aiding five million refugees, some of the poorest of the poor, in Asia and in Latin America."
"Nevertheless we are here now, and the Socialist Group supports the rapporteur' s recommendation for adoption of this regulation with the minimum of amendments, already agreed in principle with the Council, in order to allow a fast-track, one-reading approval of the extension, and in reality to allow refugee support projects this year to go ahead rather than be cancelled."
"The need for this work remains as strong as it did four years ago."
"It is no good us debating conflict resolution in the Parliament and then finding that the sole support to assist people when the guns are put down or when the period of immediate humanitarian assistance is at an end is then forgotten altogether."
"This regulation has enabled us to intervene in countries where there is deep conflict with serious abuses of human rights."
"For example in Afghanistan, which has today broken all world records for refugees with six million people having left the country since 1992, leaving the single largest and longest staying refugee population in the world."
"Or like the protection of the terrorised indigenous peoples fleeing from Burma."
"As one conflict ends another begins, as the half a million returnees expected in Timor by December this year go to demonstrate."
"On this regulation, we know that the Council has some divided thinking."
"I have to say, Mr Patten, I regret that the Commission does too."
"Whilst it has supported projects in Asia to a great degree it has failed to address properly and with sufficient vigour the problems of refugees and internally displaced people in Latin America."
"You know that I have spent much time visiting and studying the problems of violent, armed conflict in Colombia."
"In that country alone there have been 800 000 internally displaced people since 1996; 123 000 new internally displaced people between January and June last year."
"It is a disgrace that with this regulation the European Commission in the past has failed to address this problem."
"The sort of forced displacement that we have seen in Colombia I have seen too in Chiapas in southern Mexico where the presence of international aid workers is essential for the protection of human rights."
"Finally, I would like to congratulate Mr Deva on his report, thank him for his kind words in his speech and endorse what he says."
"I know he will be listening carefully to the Commissioner when he sums up to see if he will put on record that promise to ensure that a future proposal for a multiannual regulation comes forward and that the annual reports will be provided."
"With Mr Deva we ask those questions of you, Mr Patten, and if we do not get satisfactory answers the Socialists on this side of the House will be supporting Mr Deva in taking a very different stance on this report altogether."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Deva for a very good report, of which it might be said that it is as long as the Commission' s text is short."
"It no doubt says something about the relationship between Parliament and the Commission at the moment that the text presented to us has been produced very urgently and is therefore very brief and very simple.And, as Mr Howitt also mentioned, is it, of course, not particularly satisfactory to receive it four or five months after the regulation has in fact expired, but this is actually the usual way, although I do not suspect Mr Patten of being up to no good."
"It is the usual way things are debated in parliaments."
"A report is submitted which says that we must now extend the regulation."
"It is four months since it expired."
"Parliament is thus, in actual fact, compelled to say: all right, then, we really have to accept the extension for, otherwise, there will be even more people dying of hunger and destitution."
"It is not a fair way of doing things, and I shall therefore, like Mr Deva and others, also listen to what Mr Patten has to say."
"That said, however, I would also say that we need to implement this proposal as quickly as possible, for we must try to help as best we can and just hope that we can find a more satisfactory way of doing things in future."
"One simple little matter, which Mr Deva also emphasises, and which I too think we ought to discuss in the future, is the situation of women and children, which is, of course, extremely difficult and always will be in these situations."
"We therefore need to concentrate very heavily on this area and find some methodical ways of doing so, partly by involving NGOs and others who can make a contribution."
"Mr President, I would like to join in the heavy criticism which has been levelled by the parliamentary Committee on Budgetary Control and the Committee on Development and Cooperation and which has been outlined in the otherwise very constructive report of Mr Deva."
"These committees complained about the fact that the annual reports have not been issued by the Commission, and what is worse, the independent evaluations have failed to materialise, although these are, of course, vital in order to establish that the validity period of the regulations definitely needs to be extended."
"But how can we do this without the necessary reports at our disposal?"
"As has already been expressed in other criticism, this is probably once again a case of outstanding payments, unnecessarily complicated procedures for financial control and a fragmentation of efforts."
"Also the fact that the amounts spent are disproportionate to the number of displaced persons raises questions."
"Commissioner, of the EUR 240 million, 40% has been allocated to Latin America which has less than 1% of refugees in the world, while 60% has been granted to Asia which has 40% of the displaced persons."
"Were it not for the fact that a sudden discontinuation of the programmes would cause undesired effects and result in innocent victims, we would follow the advice of the Committee on Budgetary Control, but instead we will now follow Mr Deva' s recommendation."
"He has called for an extension of that programme by one year, although Mr Howitt has already pointed out that, in actual fact, we are already halfway through that year."
"We hope that the report and in-depth evaluation will as yet be forthcoming."
"Mr President, we are not talking about humanitarian aid but about viable projects aimed at self-sufficiency and the reintegration of refugees and displaced persons, ex-soldiers, etc. Surely we should be able to come up with the goods and establish that there is indeed reduced dependency on aid."
"Mr President, we are prepared to give the Commission some respite because we know that so many people are making huge efforts and because Parliament too is not exactly whiter than white as far as the Council is concerned, which you are under-staffing, but I think that, in any case, we will need to get the Commission to keep its promise to us, because otherwise this cooperation will be futile."
"Mr President, it seems simple. All we need to do is to change the year 1999 to 2000 and the European Union can support campaigns for another year for the benefit of uprooted people in Latin America and Asia."
"There is, however, more to it than that, as evidenced by the opinions of the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"With regard to the implementation and evaluation of this programme, the Commission has not exactly come up smelling of roses."
"Little consideration has so far been given to the operation of this programme."
"Sound annual evaluation reports are lacking."
"Moreover, we are still waiting for a long-term vision for this programme."
"I would, therefore, make the approval of the extension of this programme dependent on the availability of reports."
"Parliament must use this as a way of forcing the Commission to account for the spending of the development funds."
"None of this detracts from the fact that the recipient countries sometimes have dire situations to contend with."
"The European Union must help where it can."
"The role of the national Member States, however, is at least as important."
"Indeed, at European level, we are always running the risk of making pledges that we cannot keep due to budgetary restraints."
"The most important prerequisite to a long-term solution for the problems outlined is sound coordination of Member State efforts."
"Nothing more, nothing less."
"Mr President, it is not only a political responsibility but a moral responsibility that the European Union has to help those in straits outside its boundaries as equally as they can."
"This being the purpose of this report, I congratulate its rapporteur, Mr Deva."
"To help those in need when it is in our hands to do so, at the end of the day, results in our really helping ourselves."
"The Bible as always is right when it states that there is a giving which does not impoverish."
"The other side of the coin is also true."
"Hoarding does impoverish."
"Countries that have serious internal hostilities and all the terrible reaping of that where the innocent go to the wall and countries encouraging displaced persons to return home ought to be helped."
"The fact of the matter is that those displaced are mostly women and children."
"This makes it even more imperative that action should be taken."
"Food supplies, water and sanitation, housing and shelter, education are, of course, the top priorities."
"I welcome the recognition of this."
"I believe that the four amendments submitted by the Committee on Development and Cooperation must be accepted by the Commission and I hope that the Commissioner, Mr Patten, who did not very often give me happy replies on other things when he was in another office, perhaps today will give me some little encouragement that Christmas is really coming."
"It is essential that annual reports are submitted by the Commission to this Parliament and to the Council, as is specified."
"If such reports are not forthcoming then I could not find my vote to go with this renewal."
"I believe that the Commission must answer to this and tell us what they are going to do."
"The financial framework needs to be introduced in keeping with provisions already agreed to."
"These provisions must be strictly adhered to and this change is absolutely necessary."
"The new text on comitology is necessary and when the long-term future of this regulation is assessed, this Parliament must have before it independent valuation reports, so where improvements can be made they can press upon the Commission to make those improvements."
"Where they think this expenditure of finance can be maximised to a better reaching of the objective and target of these regulations, then we should have the information before us so as to give us a good, healthy and proper debate."
"Mr President, the Commission proposes that the existing regulation be extended."
"According to the regulation, the Commission is obliged to prepare an annual evaluation for Parliament and the Council, something it has not done. However, the programme must not be halted under any circumstances; that would be quite wrong."
"It is important that the programme should be extended, but not before we have seen the evaluations."
"The Commission promised that we would have the evaluations in March, then in April and then in May."
"So where have they got to? An independent evaluation is needed for otherwise we have no guarantees that the money has been spent properly."
"The purpose of the evaluation is, of course, to improve the future programmes."
"Everything concerning development aid, including the rehabilitation of refugees, ought to fall within the remit of the Directorate-General for Development."
"It is this Directorate-General which has the expertise and it should therefore also have the responsibility."
"The Court of Auditors has also criticised the lack of clarity in the way the different initiatives are related to one other."
"It is indefensible and damaging to the programme that no effort is being made to introduce coherence."
"I am glad that there is support, especially in the Committee on Budgetary Control, for my amendment to the effect that the programme should only be extended once the Commission has fulfilled its part of the agreement and submitted annual reports and evaluations."
"Without this amendment, the Commission could get away with not having submitted a single evaluation report since the regulation came into force in 1997."
"I have also noted that my dear friend, Mr Dell'Alba, has had his grumbles printed as an appendix to my opinion."
"However, he is only speaking for himself."
"At any rate, he had no backing in the Committee, since he was the only one to vote against the conclusions."
"Mr President, let me first of all thank my honourable friend for his extremely thoughtful report and for the care and attention that he has devoted to the issue of uprooted people in Asia and Latin America."
"It is common to all the speakers in the Chamber and to others outside that it is an excellent report but, speaking for myself, I would not have expected any less from my honourable friend."
"Regulation 443/97 on aid to uprooted people is an important instrument clearly, an instrument to deliver aid that is not covered by humanitarian assistance and the honourable Member Ms Maes made this distinction extremely clearly."
"It supports projects implemented by international organisations like the UN and the UNHCR and NGOs and these measures are designed to improve living conditions, not only for returnees but also for the communities into which they will integrate."
"In that context particular importance is attached to clearing the land of mines, a point which my honourable friend referred to, rebuilding farming systems, supporting secure livelihoods and embracing key health and education challenges."
"A number of honourable Members have made clear the good and practical work done as a result of this regulation."
"I noted in particular what the honourable gentleman, Mr Howitt, said about geographical balance and one or two other honourable Members referred to that as well."
"I also noted what the honourable gentleman Dr Paisley said about our moral duties to those who are uprooted."
"Dr Paisley and I have not always seen eye to eye on every subject but I hope that this is a subject on which we can see eye to eye and even share quotations from both the Old and the New Testament."
"The Commission started preparations for the renewal of this regulation in Spring 1999."
"However, these discussions were delayed by the former Commission' s resignation last year."
"It was decided as an interim step to propose an extension of the current regulation up to the end of the year 2000."
"A Commission activity report covering the three years of implementation of the regulation from 1997 to 1999 was presented in its preliminary version to Mr Miranda, the President of the Committee on Development and Cooperation of Parliament, and, of course, to the rapporteur."
"In parallel, preliminary findings of an on-going external evaluation on the implementation of the regulation were also transmitted."
"The final evaluation report will be submitted to the Parliament by September of this year."
"Now to the amendments: the Commission broadly agrees with the four amendments which have been tabled by the Parliament."
"However, concerning the first amendment I would like to stress again that the draft of the activity report has already been made available to the Committee on Development and Cooperation and that official submission will take place next June at the latest."
"The Commission agrees with amendments two and three since they reflect the existing framework of interinstitutional cooperation with regard to budgetary discipline and comitology."
"Now let me come to the fourth amendment."
"I recognise that the Parliament would like to see the independent evaluation report extremely soon."
"A number of honourable Members have argued that you should see that by July."
"We believe however, that given the late contracting of the 1999 programme, which means that some activities are only now getting under way, it would be better to finalise the report, which must be a thorough and comprehensive document, a month or two later, say by September."
"That will give us a reasonable period to evaluate 1999' s activities."
"However, as you know, the evaluation is already under way and I will make any interim reports available as soon as they are produced."
"I want to make that commitment unequivocally."
"I hope that Parliament would be willing to agree this approach."
"There have been references to the new regulation."
"I can confirm that the new regulation is under preparation."
"It will need to take into consideration the findings of the evaluation exercise and, of course, before presenting it to the legislative authority, we in the Commission will have to ensure that we are able to mobilise the necessary human resources for its effective implementation."
"Too often, in my experience of just seven months, we undertake to do things without having first made sure that we have got the resources to carry them through and it is important for us to be honest about what we want to do and how we can achieve it."
"Before closing let me once again thank Parliament for its support in extending the validity of this important instrument."
"I can assure honourable Members that I have taken account of the criticisms and of the aspirations that have been expressed during the course of this debate."
"I am old enough and experienced enough in political life to recognise the difference between a standing ovation and a raspberry, or a bronx cheer as the Americans would call it, and I do not wish to sit through another debate about a subject as important as this and hear it dominated by well-meant criticisms."
"So I hope that we can do better by the time we next discuss this important subject."
"We are dealing with important technical details but, above all, we are dealing, as honourable Members have pointed out, with human tragedies that lie behind the need for all these measures and that is why we have to ensure that our own response is as rapid and as effective as possible."
"That concludes the debate."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11a.m."
"EC-Switzerland agreements"
"The next item is the report (A5-0118/2000) drawn up by Mr Carraro, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of the Agreements between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and the Swiss Confederation, of the other part (7260/2000 - COM(1999) 229 - C5­0204/2000): 1. on the free movement of persons (9748/1999 - C5­0197/2000­1999/0103(AVC)); 2. on air transport (9749/1999 - C5­0198/2000 - 1999/0104(AVC)); 3. on the carriage of goods and passengers by rail and road (9750/1999 - C5­0199/2000 - 1999/0105(AVC)); 4. on scientific and technological cooperation between the European Community and the European Atomic Energy Community, of the one part, and the Swiss Confederation, of the other part (9751/1999 - C5­0200/2000 - 1999/0106(AVC)); 5. on certain aspects relating to public procurement (9752/1999 - C5­0201/2000 - 1999/0107(AVC)); 6. on trade in agricultural products (9753/1999 - C5­0202/2000 - 1999/0108(AVC)); 7. on mutual recognition in relation to conformity assessment between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation (9755/1999 - C5­0203/2000 - 1999/0109(AVC))"
"Mr President, this draft recommendation marks the end of a political and institutional process which began 10 or so years ago under the auspices of the then President of the Commission, Jacques Delors, who, as far back as the early 1990s, predicted the entry of the Swiss Confederation into the then common economic area."
"As you are aware, this project was blocked by the Swiss referendum in December 1992, when, albeit by a very narrow majority, the Swiss citizens decided to block the entry of the Swiss Confederation into the European Community."
"That was the beginning of a period of uncertainty, of widely sectoral agreements, which is being brought to an end by this package of seven agreements, which are closely related to the economy but which are also wide-reaching and of general interest."
"The seven agreements govern the free movement of persons, air transport, the carriage of goods and passengers by rail and road, scientific and technological cooperation, public procurement, agricultural products and, in relation to these, mutual recognition in the area of conformity assessment."
"They are also characterised by a specific simultaneous enforcement clause to the effect that the agreements will enter into force only insofar as they are approved or rejected en masse."
"For this reason, although the draft legislative resolutions are separate documents, they have to be tabled and approved en bloc because, and I stress this, they have to be enforced en bloc."
"The agreements were signed as early as June 1999, ratified by the Swiss Parliament on 8 October 1999, and tomorrow they will have reached the stage of ratification by the European Parliament."
"However, I would also like to point out to the House that the citizens of Switzerland will, once again, be called upon to pronounce judgement on this package of agreements, and, therefore, also on relations with the European Union, in the referendum on 21 May next."
"Nevertheless, it is as well to remember that this declaration will certainly be different from the 1992 decision in form and substance."
"In 1992, the people of Switzerland were called upon to pronounce judgement on Switzerland' s accession, whereas on 21 May they will be asked to approve or reject a package of strictly economic agreements which do not have the political implications of the 1992 agreements."
"However, I feel it is highly significant that Parliament is voting on and approving the texts - if that is the decision of the House, as it was the largely unanimous decision of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and as it is the desire of all the parliamentary committees which have expressed their opinion - and giving its assent before the Swiss referendum on 21 May."
"Not, of course, in order to undermine the sovereignty of the Swiss people' s vote in any way, but, on the contrary, to give a further sign of confidence and conviction that the development of a common European economic area and growing integration of the markets and economies of this Europe - of which Switzerland is, clearly, at the heart owing to its central geographical position - are a concern which we share and which we consider more important than disputes over procedures."
"In my opinion, it is politically significant - and, for this, all thanks go to the Chairman of the Committee on Industry and the staff which have made it possible - that Parliament is going to vote before 21 May, for this will present the Swiss citizens with a sure, well-defined legal framework on which to pronounce judgement."
"The opinion of the Committee on Industry is wholly favourable and I recommend that the House votes unanimously for the motions during tomorrow' s sitting."
"Mr President, I want to begin by thanking the rapporteur for the committee responsible. He has produced a very coherent opinion."
"I also want to thank the Commission for its good work in connection with the negotiations."
"With regard to my committee' s area of responsibility, that of citizens' freedoms and rights, this agreement is welcome."
"I also want to emphasise that it is important to view the agreement in its entirety."
"In the course of my work on the opinion, I in fact became aware of quite a number of problems and difficulties for EU citizens who live and work in Switzerland."
"In certain cases, it has been a matter of discrimination pure and simple."
"There is no doubt that the agreement we now have provides great opportunities to solve those problems which exist and to prevent new problems from arising."
"In this connection, I would just mention, for example, the right of entry, the right of establishment, the opportunity to enter the labour market, the coordination of social security systems, the right of establishment for non-gainfully employed people and students, together with new opportunities for cross-border workers."
"I want to emphasise, as the rapporteur for the committee responsible pointed out, that it is important for our opinion to be made available before the referendum in Switzerland - not because it is for the Swiss to say 'yes' or 'no' to the opinion, but to show our desire for cooperation, that is to say further cooperation, with Switzerland."
"Our committee has pointed out possible future areas of cooperation, for example operations to combat trafficking in women and to combat organised crime and economic crime."
"We view these agreements, especially the agreement concerning the free movement of persons, as being very important in the context of cooperation between the EU and Switzerland."
"Mr President, I too want to thank the rapporteur for his report and congratulate him."
"The Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism as a whole is pleased about this agreement because it was well known how very difficult it was to reach a transport agreement which established a fair balance between competition and the environment and which would also produce a satisfactory solution for both sides."
"The two agreements that directly concerned us, and that we have analysed, concern air transport and road and rail transport."
"Here we must note, with regard to air transport, that Switzerland is, of course, already a member of numerous international conferences and organisations and has therefore incorporated in its legislation quite a few aspects of what we in the EU regard as the acquis communautaire."
"Its adoption of the regulation on the liberalisation packages is the most practically significant measure."
"The Transport Committee regards it as a small weakness that the duty-free agreement is not applicable to Switzerland in this case."
"The road-rail discussion is a more difficult and also a more interesting one. We think the experiment being proposed here is most interesting."
"On the one hand, Switzerland will gradually forego reducing the number of heavy goods vehicles."
"It will allow vehicles of 34 to 40 tonnes up to the year 2004; on the other hand, it will abolish the quotas accordingly."
"Eventually it will replace this system with a road tax, of approximately EUR 200 on average."
"So you can understand why the transport operators are rather critical of that."
"And in my view their criticism is fair because we believe these road taxes do not take sufficient account of the fact that the transport operator may invest in environment-friendly lorries."
"But what the Transport Committee considered even more important was that this agreement points the way to a transport policy entirely in line with that of the EU: reducing the burden on the roads while supporting transport by rail."
"We believe the proposed agreement between the EU and Switzerland is a pilot agreement; the same applies to the analysis of the means by which what we regard as a theoretical transport policy may subsequently be put into practice."
"Mr President, the Social Democrats Group and I myself most emphatically welcome this agreement between the European Community, on the one hand, and the Swiss Confederation, on the other."
"It is a step in the right direction."
"After all, Switzerland is located at the heart of Europe but is not yet a member of the Union."
"The conclusion of the bilateral negotiations with Switzerland will put the Union' s relations with Switzerland on a new footing, and we all hope that, in a few weeks' time, the Swiss people will give their assent to these agreements."
"But there are a few aspects that still need clarification."
"I am not referring to what I usually refer to in this connection, namely closer cooperation to combat tax evasion at the cost of the European taxpayers."
"Tonight I will confine myself solely to the question of freedom of movement and will specifically address the subject of cross-border workers."
"In all, there are 140 000 cross-border workers in Switzerland who come from Germany, France, Italy and Austria."
"These cross-border workers are very seriously affected by the most recent deteriorations in Swiss pension schemes."
"Prior to the tenth review of old-age and surviving dependants' insurance there was a so-called spouse' s pension, which was paid without regard to the place of residence of either spouse."
"Under the tenth review, which recently came into force, this rule was removed."
"It was replaced by educational credits, which were, however, tied to residence in Switzerland."
"As a result, cross-border workers from the European Union had to pay the same contributions as Swiss residents, but received a 30% lower pension."
"The forthcoming eleventh review even provides that only widows resident in Switzerland are entitled to a widow' s pension, which, of course, once again makes the situation worse for cross-border workers from the EU."
"Unfortunately, European Union governments have paid too little attention to this issue until now."
"I hope all this will change in the near future."
"The current rules on old-age and surviving dependants' insurance conflict with the principle of equal treatment and equal status."
"Cross-border workers pay in just as much pension insurance as their Swiss counterparts but receive considerably lower pensions."
"I hope that this unilateral discrimination by the Swiss Government will be remedied in the wake of this bilateral agreement."
"I am extremely grateful to the rapporteur for touching on and bringing up this question in his explanatory statement."
"A glance at the map shows that these are probably not the last negotiations and agreements we will see between the Union and Switzerland."
"That makes it all the more important to abide not just by the letter but also by the spirit of the agreements we are deciding tomorrow."
"For that can only be to the benefit of future negotiations and future agreements which we will be negotiating and deciding bilaterally."
"Mr President, the bilateral agreements between the European Union and Switzerland are analogous to the multilateral agreement arrangements that have come into effect within the framework of the European Economic Area."
"It is the opinion of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party that the European Parliament for its own part should support their adoption."
"Switzerland' s position illustrates the curious nature of Europe' s present arrangements for integration, and the need to aim to change them, especially now that the EU is expanding throughout the whole of Europe."
"The merging Europe has organised itself into a series of concentric rings, at the core of which has been the founder members of the European Union."
"First there was the Council of Europe at Strasbourg, which divided in two when France, Germany, Italy and the Benelux Countries formed the European Coal and Steel Community."
"The attempt to form a political and defence community came to nothing, but the European Community was created."
"The Outer Seven, as opposed to the Six, formed the European Free Trade Association, EFTA."
"The expansion of the Six into a Community of, in the first instance, eight, and then twelve, went relatively smoothly."
"Since these instances of enlargement, a debate has begun on differentiated integration."
"At the end of the 1980s, a plan was drafted in the European Commission whereby the then European Community would consolidate as a federation and the other countries of Europe would join the Single Market via the European Economic Area arrangements."
"The first Agreement on the European Economic Area was offered to the EFTA countries."
"It was then that concentric circles were being spoken of for the first time."
"The EEA Agreement was established, although for Austria, Sweden and Finland it turned out to be a short-lived arrangement."
"EEA membership was rejected in a Swiss referendum."
"So the only countries remaining in the EEA were Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein. Bilateral agreements began to be drawn up for Switzerland."
"Negotiations are now under way regarding the future accession of twelve countries to the European Union."
"It is strange that neither Switzerland nor any of the EEA countries are among them, although they would be the best suited of all to join."
"There is a simple reason for this, however. They do not want to join the present Union, nor that of the foreseeable future."
"Now that the Union is growing fast, it is reasonable that it should be subject to internal differentiation."
"Just as Jacques Delors, Valery Giscard d'Estaing and Helmut Schmidt, among others, recently proposed, the core countries of Europe should go further along the road towards integration than the others, while the rest of the Union could develop as a confederation of independent states and differentiate."
"In this way, we could ease and speed up accession for the countries of Eastern Europe and this would also make membership possible for Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein and even Switzerland."
"Mr President, Mr Väyrynen' s comments just now about concentric circles remind me a little of a hole with circles drawn round it, looking at Switzerland and Europe."
"I hope this hole will be filled sometime in the next few years with the accession of Switzerland to the European Union."
"For then we would not have to negotiate and decide seven different agreements but all this would be a matter of course."
"I very much hope we will make progress in this regard over the next few years."
"But perhaps these seven agreements are a preparation for that debate and I very much hope that just as Parliament will be approving these seven agreements by a large majority tomorrow - or so I assume - the Swiss people will also approve them by a large majority on 21 May in order to make it clear that Switzerland is part of Europe."
"I would like to say a few words about the agreement on scientific and technological cooperation because I myself have been repeatedly involved in that area of cooperation with Switzerland over the past few years."
"I warmly welcome that agreement because basically it means that Switzerland will take part in the European Union' s framework research programme on an equal footing."
"To that end, it will pay a contribution in line with its GDP yet participate fully in the programme."
"That is a major advantage for both sides."
"Yet there is one drawback: it is the European Parliament and the Council that decide the content of this programme, not Switzerland."
"That means that Switzerland, like Israel, Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland, which also take part in this framework research programme, can only participate in something that is decided over their heads."
"They have no say as regards its content."
"So I would propose that we take our time preparing the sixth framework research programme and that we at least hold informal talks with the Swiss parliamentarians - just as we do with Israel, Norway and so on, i.e. states which do not belong to the EU but which do take part in the framework research programme."
"That is something the European Parliament could organise."
"Parliament could take the initiative and invite parliamentarians from these countries, so that we can know in advance what input the Swiss can contribute, what problems they may have, what proposals they may have."
"In fact, this would also be a step towards bringing Switzerland and the European Union closer together."
"I would very much hope we could do that."
"Aside from that, let me thank Mr Carraro again for this excellent report."
"Anyone who wants to learn will find a great deal of information in his report."
"Once again, many thanks and I hope we will adopt it by a large majority tomorrow."
"Mr President, the attendance in this Chamber shows that there is no dispute about this agreement, that Members want it, and I am sure we will vote for Switzerland and for this agreement by a great majority tomorrow."
"We want closer cooperation in Europe."
"We want more dialogue."
"We want to analyse problems pragmatically, find compromises, although on the basis of democracy and the rule of law, and we want, at the end of the day, to vote in the proper manner."
"We often see the Swiss people voting on issues and as a democrat I am constantly delighted by the democratic attitude of Switzerland."
"The peaceful settlement of conflict - i.e. democracy - versus the declaration of war."
"In fact, war never has been a solution for the people of Europe."
"We need ground rules for democracy, and in the end we must also abide by them."
"After over 50 years of a policy of peace, the German Foreign Minister acting as President of the Council has called on the military to take a decision."
"That should set us thinking."
"I believe it is important that we use democratic methods to safeguard peace."
"Now he, as President of the Council, and the 12 prime ministers have taken an arbitrary decision without any legal basis against a Member State. It has no legal basis and in particular it goes against the European institutions."
"The decision with regard to Austria was taken without any de facto participation by the Commission, without the participation of the Council and, of course, without the participation of Parliament."
"In my view, that raises a number of problems, especially for Switzerland. And I regard the signs of weakness the euro is currently showing as a judgement by the international community of this conflict within the European Union."
"The crux of the matter is that this is a conflict between the prime ministers and the European institutions, a conflict that is putting a spanner in the European works and creating insecurity."
"In fact, Austria was always seen as the blue-eyed boy in matters of human rights and democracy."
"I think Austria has fared very well with its neutrality over the past decades, a neutral position between east and west."
"In joining the European Union we clearly committed ourselves to the west, with the aim of preventing any future military conflicts."
"But that means talking to each other, meeting each other, analysing things pragmatically, finding compromises."
"I must say that in Austria, too, it is now time to review the situation for, when it comes to their referendum, the Swiss people will be looking very carefully at how the 14 prime ministers decide."
"In Austria, Mr Haider resigned on 1 May."
"He no longer plays an active role in Austrian politics."
"I think it is high time the sanctions against Austria were lifted and I believe the prime ministers should also apologise to the people of Europe for choosing to go down a road that is unacceptable to Europe."
"I demand the immediate suspension of the sanctions against Austria and I believe this decision with regard to Austria will be of the utmost importance to future plebiscites and referenda in Europe."
"We very much welcome the report by Mr Carraro and his colleagues."
"I totally agree with the remarks of the honourable Member, Mr Linkohr, about the quality of the report."
"I am also grateful for the authoritative comments made by the honourable Member, Mr Carraro, and by representatives of other relevant committees during this debate and the other contributions we have had as well."
"One or two honourable Members have been able to bring in subjects about which they care passionately like the honourable Member, Mr Rübig, and I commend them on their inventiveness."
"But it has been a useful debate which has reflected the importance of the subject."
"We are extremely satisfied that Parliament has given this verbal approval to the seven agreements with Switzerland."
"They are the result of four years of extremely difficult and tough negotiations."
"The outcome of those negotiations has been excellent and I am delighted that Parliament has reacted in the way that it has."
"The agreements are very important."
"They are very important politically and they are very important from a technical point of view as well."
"They unblock the stalemate in the relations with one of our closest neighbours and our second biggest trading partner."
"They open the way to closer relations and, I hope, to further integration."
"Through these agreements the biggest problems in our bilateral relations will be resolved in a number of key sectors: technical barriers to trade, public procurement, research and development about which the honourable Member knows so much, agriculture and air transport."
"Equally important, a viable solution has now been found for alpine transit."
"The European standard of free movement of persons will also be introduced in relations with Switzerland."
"I am glad that Parliament has found the result of the negotiations to be in general so positive but we have also taken note of some more critical remarks, especially regarding cooperation in the fight against transit fraud, cigarette smuggling and other fiscal crimes, where you want to see our Swiss friends doing much more."
"Parliament has repeatedly called for better cooperation and the problem will be further investigated I know by a special delegation of the Budget Control Committee."
"I want to make it absolutely plain that the Commission shares these concerns."
"Losses of several billion euros are caused to the Community budget every year because Switzerland does not apply the relevant Council of Europe protocols on judicial cooperation."
"The Commission has repeatedly stated that we see a rapid solution to this problem as the prerequisite for any further agreements in other areas."
"It is a point that I am looking forward to discussing with the Swiss Foreign Minister when he comes to Brussels a little later in the summer, as well, I hope, as discussing more positive matters with him."
"I want to assure all honourable Members that we have taken account of the detailed concerns that have been expressed in this useful debate and of the other comments that we have received on these negotiations."
"As a number of honourable Members have said, the Swiss Parliament has already approved the seven agreements."
"They did that in October last year."
"We very much hope that the Swiss people themselves will give their blessing in the referendum scheduled for May 21."
"It would be constitutionally indelicate I am sure for me to urge them to vote in one way or the other but I do very much hope that these negotiations which have been conducted in good faith and have led to very satisfactory outcomes will be endorsed by the people of Switzerland."
"I am sure that the assent of the European Parliament will be very helpful in this respect in encouraging people in Switzerland to vote on May 21 in what we all think would be the right way."
"So I very much hope that the vote which the Parliament holds tomorrow does not surprise any of you and does not surprise the Commission either."
"That concludes the debate."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11a.m."
"Financial assistance to Moldova"
"The next item is the report (A5-0082/2000) drawn up by Mrs Matikainen-Kallström on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on the proposal for a Council decision providing supplementary macro-financial assistance to Moldova (COM(1999) 516 - C5-0261/1999 - 1999/0213(CNS))."
"Mr President, Moldova bears the heavy burden of communism as do many other newly independent countries that were formerly part of the Soviet Union."
"Examined in human and economic terms, Moldova is faring very badly."
"The social situation is chaotic and democratic progress painfully slow."
"A civil war and the repercussions of the economic crisis in Russia have been paralysing the country for a long time now."
"Industry is still underdeveloped and unevenly distributed regionally."
"A modest export trade is based on the sale of agricultural produce to neighbouring regions."
"A look at the figures will show the level of desperation that exists."
"Since 1992, the Moldovan economy has shrunk by almost 70%. Life expectancy has fallen dramatically, and, according to a study undertaken last year by the UN, 50% of the people live below the absolute poverty line."
"The Commission deserves praise for having proposed a considerable increase in financial aid to Moldova at the suggestion of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund."
"Bilateral financial aid via the TACIS programme has been reasonably successful."
"A big step forward is particularly visible in the areas of local administrative training, the weeding out of corruption, and the promotion of exports and agriculture."
"This, however, is not enough."
"More financial aid must be made available if we are to solve the problem in macro-financial terms. This involves developing democracy and establishing a proper financial and economic policy."
"Positive action to develop Moldova must be supported with measures that boost the democratic system."
"The Commission must see to it that the additional funding is used properly, flexibly and in a way that strengthens the basic structures of society."
"Since the biggest economic problem in Moldova is its dependence on Russia, the new EU aid action must aim at severing this dependence."
"For example, Moldova relies totally on Russian imports of energy, and is consequently tied by a leash to Russian energy companies."
"The circle can only be broken by establishing Moldova' s own energy sector and the diversification of its export trade."
"The other problem with regard to Russia is connected with the withdrawal of troops from Moldovan territory."
"The EU must do all it can to make it clear to the Duma that withdrawing Russian troops from Moldova would enhance the country' s stability."
"Furthermore, talks on dismantling Russian missiles stockpiled in Moldova must be pushed through immediately."
"My report was unanimously adopted in committee."
"There were good and sensible additions made to it by the Committee on Budgets."
"I hope that this spirit of consensus will be present too in tomorrow' s sitting."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets. (FI) Mr President, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets, I would like to draw attention to the economic effects this legal decision will have."
"The European Union is granting different forms of economic aid to different countries."
"Macro-financial aid is one of the most important, in addition to which equivalent forms of aid can be given in the form of European Investment Bank guarantees and Euratom loans."
"There is, however, a ceiling to this provision of loans, which has been determined in interinstitutional agreements."
"That is a maximum annual figure of EUR 200 million from the Guarantee Fund."
"This causes problems for possible new loans from the European Union, because this ceiling is inflexible."
"The present loan and guarantee decisions might lead to a situation where this ceiling is easily exceeded, if something unexpected happens."
"I would therefore think that, from the point of view of the Committee on Budgets, it is important that the Commission should make a multiannual assessment of likely future fund requirements, which would serve as a general guide."
"The aim should be that Parliament and the Council agree on priorities concerning the use of left-over margins, and that a procedure should be agreed in order to make any changes to these principles."
"In the case of macro-financial aid, the Commission appears to have considerable faith in the ability of the international institutions - the IMF and the World Bank - to evaluate the economic situation in whatever countries are concerned."
"The role of these institutions is perhaps too important, and the Commission often automatically accepts conditions imposed by others on these loans."
"For this reason, I think that Mrs Matikainen-Kallström' s remarks and amendments are very important, as they take account of the fact that such areas as employment and social security should also be examined when determining how the money from loans should be spent."
"Mr President, the excellent report by our colleague, Mrs Matikainen-Kallström, on supplementary assistance for the budget of Moldova gives us a rare opportunity to cast our eyes on this small country on the periphery of the European Union, on its economic development and political orientation."
"The people once again find themselves living in poverty."
"The average monthly per capita income in Moldova is only approximately EUR 30."
"Privatisation is making only slow headway and so far the country has not managed to entirely resolve the problem of integrating its Russian minority groups."
"It has still not achieved monetary or budgetary stability and Russian occupation troops are still stationed in part of the country, in Trans-Dnestr."
"For days now, there has been a very real risk of all the lights going out in Moldova."
"The Russian energy company Gazprom suspended gas supplies because Moldova could not pay its bills in German Marks and US dollars."
"So we are quite literally witnessing this country' s almost desperate fight for economic survival and political existence."
"Geographically, Moldova is a narrow strip of land between Ukraine and Romania."
"Many young Moldovans are looking towards the European Union."
"Some are studying at our universities and technical colleges thanks to funding from the European Union and its Member States."
"At home, most of them want Moldova to become more open to the European Union."
"How can we, the European Parliament, make it easier for Moldova to become more open?"
"The macro-economic financial assistance, which the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats firmly support, is an important step towards building up the necessary confidence in the Moldovan administration system and thereby consolidating its budget."
"Moreover, the aid under the TACIS programmes must concentrate more on vocational training, education and improving the totally outmoded transport, communications and energy infrastructure."
"Small crafts and services businesses can only be started up if there are prospects of improving the framework conditions for competition and investment, which is only feasible in the long term with the help of the European Union."
"But Moldova must also know where it wants to go."
"Does it want to remain in a state of insecurity because it relies so heavily on cheap Russian raw materials, which it cannot even pay for yet, and also remain incapable of reform in many areas, which would mean tying its long-term future to the imponderables of Russian economic and social development?"
"Or does it want to follow the example of Romania and resolutely tread the long and difficult road of economic reforms and closer cooperation with the European Union?"
"In that case, it also deserves stronger support on our part."
"That support must be conditional on a radical modernisation of its economy and administration. We hope Moldova will opt for renewal and for Europe."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Matikainen-Kallström' s report deserves our full support."
"She has guided this 'child' in difficult circumstances, for which I thank her."
"When we talk of transitional economies we might ask where these economies are really going."
"It seems that the direction is not always clear."
"Moldova imports all its raw materials from abroad and is very dependent on energy imports."
"One tenth of its GNP goes on a bill from just one Russian company, Gazprom, which - as the previous speaker said - is switching out the lights in the state of Moldova."
"There is therefore a stranglehold on energy that does not just affect Moldova but also its neighbour, Ukraine; and Belarus, too, for that matter."
"Consequently, this phenomenon has a broader political significance, which may create tension in this region, and which we will then have to attempt to relieve."
"Moldova' s need for finance will be huge in the years to come."
"The Russian crisis on 17 August 1998 had an enormous effect on Moldova."
"It has become a ragamuffin state."
"The basic pension is just one fifth of the heating costs of one small flat."
"No nation can live and function like that."
"The balance of trade surplus is a massive 23 - 25%."
"As has been said, Russian troops are in the region of Trans-Dnestr, Lebed' s famous 14th army, not all of it, but nonetheless it has some influence."
"We obviously support the loan decision and the line the report adopts, the macro-financial assistance, but this will not be enough."
"We are taking stability eastwards, so that we will not have to import instability from there."
"The next zone of enlargement, the following zone of candidate countries, will be the one we shall have to concentrate on."
"We have to create an area of special action, of which Moldova will be a part, and we have to help them."
"We therefore have to create an Eastern programme, to run alongside the current round of enlargement, which will help these countries - Moldova, Ukraine, Belarus and Russia - at a stage when we are receiving new members, so that no new curtain falls between these states."
"Mr President, I would also like to thank the rapporteur, Marjo Matikainen-Kallström, for preparing a sound report."
"She has got to grips with the issue in a comprehensive way and raised some important issues connected with it."
"Our Group supports the rapporteur' s views."
"As has been said here several times, the situation in Moldova is extremely difficult."
"Although a little headway has been made in the areas of administrative development, social pluralism, and human rights, the economic and social situation is still extremely grave."
"The country' s economy has shrunk by around two thirds in the last ten years alone."
"Discrepancies in income have grown wildly and half the population lives below the poverty line."
"Development in Moldova depends essentially on whether the country can achieve political, social and economic stability."
"It will be extremely hard for Moldova to overcome its huge problems without foreign assistance."
"The Union' s support for Moldova is thus in place."
"The EUR 15 million loan now to be made must be coordinated with assistance from the IMF and other international agencies with the aim of boosting Moldova' s social and economic stability."
"It is also important that the Commission guarantees the aid by attaching certain economic conditions to it, so that it is used properly in the right areas, for example, in improving administration, organising basic civil services and increasing economic efficiency."
"Later, we have to ensure that the conditions have been fulfilled properly and that the country is progressing along the path of democracy and that people' s living conditions are improving."
"The report' s proposal for the possibility of revising the financial perspective to increase the amount of funds in the guarantee reserve is also in order."
"Mr President, establishing and consolidating a multi-ethnic state is no picnic in political terms."
"Moldova is still living proof of this."
"Ever since its conception in 1991, it has been faced with intransigent separatism from the Dnestr Republic."
"And we ought to remind ourselves of the Russian military presence in that republic, which is again completely at odds with repeated international withdrawal obligations on the part of Moscow."
"Faced with a double challenge in internal and external politics between being absorbed by Romania or by Russia, the political élite and the electorate of this small former Soviet Republic opted without hesitation in favour of its own independence in 1994."
"It did so precisely because of Moldova' s political unity."
"This commendable strategy of phasing out internal and external hotbeds has made room for, among other things, the autonomous statute of the minority population of the Gagauz and the border treaty with neighbouring Ukraine which is less than one year old."
"These achievements, however, cannot begin to conceal Moldova' s extremely difficult transformation process from ex-Soviet Republic to democratic constitutional state based on a social market economy."
"In terms of energy supply and a market for its goods, Moldova is extremely dependent on the Russian Federation. As such, Chisinau is looking to the West for financial support for modernisation."
"Hence the present, third request for macro-financial support from the European Union."
"Given the level of exchange rate stability and internal currency stability achieved by Moldova, I can go along with this."
"However, I have two questions."
"What has been the effect of the European Union' s two previous capital injections into that country?"
"Could the Commission be specific about this?"
"Also, Amendment No 1 tabled by the competent Committee seems to clash with the objective of this specific long-term loan."
"Needless to say, I too much prefer giving the average Moldovan citizen financial support rather than lining the pockets of the Gazprom bigshots!"
"Mr President, I should like to extend a warm thank you to Mrs Matikainen-Kallström for the effort she has put into this report."
"The European Union is prepared to invest EUR 15 million, equivalent to SEK 120 million, in a long-term loan."
"The desire is for this to be given to Europe' s poorest country, which has a gross national product as low as that of the poorest countries in Africa."
"Moldova is a country where the community, or society, has abdicated responsibility in a number of areas."
"The average wage among State employees is MDL 230, which is to say approximately SEK 150 or about EUR 19."
"The lowest pension is a mere quarter of this, or MDL 64."
"Because the State' s finances have been completely undermined, neither State employees nor pensioners receive their payments on time."
"Many have to wait for over a year for their money, and sometimes even longer."
"Moldova is a deeply tragic example of the devastating consequences of Soviet Communism, an appalling ideology which has destroyed whole societies, countries and peoples spiritually, morally, socially and economically."
"What we see fully revealed here is the harvest of the dragon' s teeth sown by communism."
"According to the Swedish professor, Per Ronnås, Moldova has seen a more devastating peacetime fall in its standard of living than any other country in modern times."
"At the same time, all the intelligence about people' s exposure to extensive torture by the police, involving electric shocks and suffocation with the aid of plastic bags placed over the head, is a very serious source of concern."
"Moldova is today experiencing general migration."
"A quarter of the country' s four million people are estimated to have travelled abroad in search of work."
"Many poor and destitute girls have ended up in the hands of crime syndicates which degrade them and exploit them sexually."
"We can do nothing other than support this country, Europe' s very poorest."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to thank Mrs Matikainen-Kallström for her report and all of you for the sensitivity you have shown with regard to such a serious problem as Moldova."
"I note that the sensitivity of the different political groups is in line with the sensitivity of the Commission when it made the proposal for supplementary macroeconomic assistance for Moldova and, in this respect, we are especially grateful for their support."
"It is true that today, we are talking about macro-financial assistance, therefore, with clearly defined objectives, which will undoubtedly improve the financial room for manoeuvre so that we can tackle the other difficulties such as those which you have raised during tonight' s debate."
"Of the amendments presented in the report, the Commission has no difficulty in accepting Amendments Nos 1 to 4 referring to the final objective of the aid, the need for a coherent approach in our various instruments for Community assistance and the need for social balance in that assistance."
"Therefore, the Commission will support these amendments in the Council and I hope they can be taken forward."
"Nevertheless, I would suggest to the rapporteur and honourable Members that they reflect further on the remaining amendments."
"Amendments Nos 5, 6 and 8 advocate the establishment of a new committee to control this type of aid."
"In our opinion this initiative would be excessively bureaucratic and would not make sense."
"Macro-financial assistance is usually granted for periods of one year, it is not always renewed, it is granted in different areas, different countries, according to the circumstances and we believe, therefore, that the current system of concentrating its control in a particular body, the Economic and Financial Committee, makes sense since this is the group of people with the greatest experience and knowledge of the control and management of this type of aid."
"I would remind you that the Economic and Financial Committee is not a normal committee. It is a committee provided for in the Treaties which, in practice, consists of personal representatives of the Ministers for Economic and Financial Affairs."
"In our view these are the people who really have the ability to carry out this management."
"The creation of specific ad hoc committees would achieve less and would not be as effective as the current model."
"I would also like to make another comment on Amendment No 9, which asks us - and I suspect that it also coincides with Mr Belder' s demand - whether we can provide information on the effectiveness of aid."
"We agree that the Commission should report on what we must do, but what causes us difficulty is the idea that this should be done before 15 September."
"By definition, macro-financial assistance includes a series of general economic indicators, which are not always available at that time."
"In some cases they will be available to us, in other cases they will not."
"We think it is much more reasonable that the Commission' s obligation should refer to the whole year and that we should be allowed greater room for manoeuvre between 15 September and 31 December to present these reports. We believe they will be of better quality if we have additional time available to us."
"The Commission' s concern, as I see it, that it should be provided with figures for the budgetary debate should not cause any difficulty, since every six months, a report is sent to the budgetary authority on the guarantees covered by the general budget along with an annual report on the management of the Guarantee Fund."
"By means of both reports, the Commission will have access to all the necessary budgetary information."
"Nevertheless, in order to assess the aid we should be allowed more time."
"Lastly, I would like to make a comment on Mr Seppänen' s concerns regarding the budgetary availability of resources for this type of aid."
"In our view, there is no difficulty. We believe that this type of aid can be dealt with by means of the current budgetary resources."
"It is true that, in the future, we will possibly have to debate whether the current priorities and our financial room for manoeuvre are coherent or not, but we do not think that this is a debate which can be held in relation to a specific report; rather it will require a much more profound and more general debate, which we will be happy to take part in at this Parliament' s convenience."
"That concludes the debate."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"(The sitting was closed at 10.55 p.m.)"
"Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting"
"The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, I would like to make a correction to my statement on the EC/Switzerland agreement, because since 1 May this year, Mr Jörg Haider has been neither a member of the government nor the leader of Austria' s Freedom Party."
"As such, the grounds for the sanctions imposed by the 14+1 on one Member State should be rescinded immediately."
"Mr President, I would like to make the following comment in connection with the Minutes: reference was made in the Maat report on school milk yesterday to the fact that the Community' s contribution to financing shall be equal to 75% of the target price."
"It says 65% in the German version of the Minutes."
"Would you be so kind as to check again whether the various language versions are all in order?"
"Mr Goepel, the services have already informed me of this error and all the versions will be corrected."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Combating counterfeiting and piracy"
"The next item is the report (A5-0096/2000) by Mrs Fourtou, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the Commission' s Green Paper 'Combating counterfeiting and piracy in the single market' ."
"Mr President, I would like, above all, to thank the Commission for appreciating the risk involved in the phenomenon of counterfeiting and piracy."
"Their Green Paper initiative is a clear demonstration of their determination to tackle the problem, and I should also like to thank my colleagues on the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and on the committees whose opinion was requested, who have made a considerable contribution to the enrichment of my work."
"Piracy and counterfeiting constitute a risk to consumer health and safety."
"Spare parts for cars and aircraft, toys and pharmaceutical products, all of which endanger the lives of consumers, are to be found on the counterfeit market."
"Piracy also jeopardises innovation and the very future of certain firms."
"By way of example, I would cite the hundreds of thousands of jobs lost every year within the European Union due to this."
"Counterfeiters take advantage of the investments made by bona fide industry in new product research and development and in advertising."
"This also undermines the fiscal resources of the state authorities."
"Finally, it has been established that this phenomenon is often closely linked to organised crime."
"My report advocates a coordinated overall approach in order to combat piracy and counterfeiting. This approach has two aspects: prevention and law enforcement."
"If we are to prevent this scourge, we must first familiarise ourselves with it."
"We therefore propose an extensive public awareness campaign, with whatever programmes the Commission can suggest, and increasing awareness among the police, judicial and customs authorities."
"We plan to set up training schemes for these authorities and a cooperation plan involving the exchange of know-how and adoption of best national practice."
"Prevention must also involve strengthened cooperation between the private and public sectors, and the legal protection of technical arrangements, while obviously respecting consumer rights."
"Indeed, making allowances for consumer rights and the legitimate demands of professionals is one of the difficult aspects of this report."
"Of course, each Member State has its own internal regulations for law enforcement."
"In order to make them more effective, we must endeavour to harmonise current legislation and thereby remove the disparities between protection systems."
"Obviously, penal sanctions must be made more stringent and civil measures and procedures must be simplified."
"The approximation of the penal sanctions applied by different nations in the case of customs offences is certainly desirable."
"It will also be appropriate to pay particular attention to matters of international judicial cooperation."
"To conclude this brief overview of my report, I shall say that the effective protection and implementation of intellectual property rights must be an absolute priority in negotiations with countries seeking accession to the European Union and in all relations with third countries."
"I shall add that we should try, in our plenary sitting, to preserve the consensus which emerged in committee when voting on this report, in order to ensure that the European Parliament thereby gives a strong political message as to its commitment in the fight against counterfeiting and piracy."
"And finally, I appeal to the Commission, which I hope will submit its proposed action programme for responding to the urgent nature of this phenomenon in the very near future."
"Since the matter would indeed seem genuinely to be one of absolute urgency, especially as regards piracy in the audiovisual media, the Commission must not fail to respond in a decisive and urgent manner."
"Mr President, I want to congratulate Mrs Fourtou on this important report."
"It is important both in terms of the functioning of the single market and, most importantly, for the protection of consumers."
"It is right that we should focus on the way in which counterfeiting is growing between the Member States, within the single market, as well as beyond the frontiers of the European Union."
"The consumer can be conned by counterfeiting in all circumstances very easily but it is always a menace. It is a menace because the counterfeit product carries none of the necessary guarantees of safety and quality which come from a product which the manufacturer can stand by and endorse."
"It can be dangerous to health."
"It can certainly be dangerous to innovation."
"It can be dangerous for the future of research."
"There is very little to be said for the counterfeiter except that, at best, he or she is a parasite upon productive industry."
"This is not a victimless crime."
"We are talking about things that seriously damage the marketplace."
"For that reason, the Environment and Consumer Policy Committee takes much the same line as the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee in supporting and endorsing this report."
"Naturally the point we would wish to make in conclusion, however, is that in protection of the consumer, the provision of information must involve consumer organisations within the Member States themselves."
"They are best placed to pick up some of the worst scams which now prevail and inform the public that what may, at first sight, appear to be a bargain, is really a snare and delusion."
"My second point has been touched upon by the previous speaker. It is this: there are those who would say that this debate embraces the debate about copyright and trademarks."
"These must be kept separate."
"A number of amendments from the political groups and the committees have tried to make this clear."
"There is a debate going on - and the Commissioner knows perfectly well about this - about parallel imports and whether these are now being used in some cases in a way which is damaging to trade, anti-competitive and against the interests of the consumer."
"We do not want to see these two debates confused."
"What we are attacking here in this proposal, and quite rightly, is those who, by the parasitic practice of counterfeiting, batten upon the public, confuse and deceive it and can sometimes actually damage society in the process."
"Mr President, I am pleased to see Parliament, in the form of Mrs Fourtou' s report, prepared to undertake an extensive campaign against counterfeiting and piracy within the internal market."
"The text gives an accurate outline of the extent of the damage and its catastrophic repercussions on the economies of our countries and also on the health and safety of our fellow citizens, since the phenomenon now involves sectors as potentially dangerous as medicines and car parts."
"We can therefore welcome this appeal for increased awareness and for a uniform mobilisation of resources across the board in order to limit and eventually curb this scourge."
"While the Fourtou report does not appear to play down the significance of the damage, it does, however, appear to disregard the urgency requiring that an appropriate policy is implemented straight away."
"Reading this text gives the impression that Parliament is urging the Commission to consider with the utmost urgency the technical definition of the measures which should be implemented, whilst in this respect the counterfeiters are, as always, one step ahead in terms of technology."
"If it is appropriate to use any more sophisticated technology that might make counterfeiting and piracy more expensive and more difficult to engage in, then the fight we undertake should not neglect to use radical means, applicable immediately."
"Failing to do so would mean that our policies, however well intentioned, will be forever missing the boat."
"The text is still particularly vague as to the measures to actually protect patents and intellectual property rights which it would like to see Member States adopting."
"Without such measures, crafty economic opportunists and seasoned technological plagiarists will continue to pass well-disguised theft off as innovation."
"Similarly, something is amiss when we are striving for a raft of protective measures, which would make it possible to put an immediate stop to the sale of these goods, while there are reasonable grounds for suspicion and when the only thing lacking is the time needed to furnish proof."
"In addition to all the necessary schemes intended to combat the sale of these fraudulent goods, however, it is essential to cut off the supply of these goods pouring into the single market, flouting all the principles which are supposed to regulate its operation."
"And in order to do so, Parliament must agree to remove the veil of doctrine which blurs the vision of the great majority of its Members when it comes to incontrovertible evidence of the need to re-establish internal border controls within the Community."
"It would also have been wise to specify in some form other than the desperately vague paragraphs 31 and 34 exactly what obligations would be required of candidate countries on the subject."
"Finally, and this is certainly the most serious issue, what cooperation policy do Member States intend to implement as of now in order to fight not only against the fly-by-night street trader, but more especially against organised crime, which nowadays apparently is becoming the real beneficiary of this expanding sector of activity?"
"The Union for a Europe of Nations Group will vote in favour of this report, even though it represents only the first minimal step in a Community-wide policy in which each Member State must take hard and fast action, and urges Parliament to vote in favour of its amendments, which would make it possible to give the text much more force than it has at it stands."
"Mr President, this report is extremely late in coming, given that the Commission' s Green Paper was adopted on 15 October 1998."
"It is true that, in the meantime, we have had the elections to the European Parliament, but if consultation with Parliament regarding a Green Paper takes more than a year and a half, something is not working as it should, and Parliament and the Commission should therefore review their methods for cooperation so that this issue can be resolved more speedily."
"The Green Paper is, of course, a good one."
"It was well received by the various parliamentary committees and Mrs Fourtou has produced a good report that was adopted almost unanimously by the Legal Affairs Committee, with 23 votes for and one abstention."
"The opinions of the various committees are also favourable and have been well received; the opinion of Mr Berenguer Fuster, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the opinion of Mr Whitehead, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, and the opinion of Mrs Montfort, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy."
"The Legal Affairs Committee has incorporated most of the proposals made by the various committees asked for an opinion."
"What is important is that we are moderate and restrained when it comes to adopting the report."
"The Union for a Europe of Nations Group, for example, has tabled amendments which may affect the internal market."
"Specifically, I think that Amendment No 6, tabled by Mrs Thomas-Mauro, which requests that border controls be established at internal borders, is extremely dangerous."
"The purpose of this kind of initiative is not to rebuild the borders that we have already removed, and that is one of the reasons why Mr Berenguer Fuster and myself have tabled Amendment No 9, which is designed to prevent internal controls from being re-established by clamping down on piracy."
"We must ensure, for example, that by clamping down on piracy, we do not contravene the agreements on the liberalisation of the internal market in matters of distribution. We must also prevent this provision, as Mr Whitehead said earlier, from leading to the regulation of all intellectual property rights, in the area of patents, for example, which is why we reject some of the amendments."
"To sum up, I think that the report is a good one, but I would draw your attention to one issue: when we discuss the conditions for accession of the candidate countries, we must attach particular importance to the issue of the protection of intellectual property and protection against piracy."
"In the accession negotiations, it must be made clear to candidate countries that the issue is extremely important to us and is, of course, extremely important to relations with third countries, since the development of international trade must be based on the recognition of the protection of intellectual and industrial property."
"Mr President, this is a useful draft legislative provision. We must dress the wounds suffered by European industry, amounting to millions of euros (though the movement of the euro may relativise such a figure)."
"We must consider the implications of these inferior quality products for consumers."
"We must find the means to curb the globalisation of counterfeiting and piracy."
"This text illustrates our inability to regulate the internal market since we eliminated internal border controls within the European Union."
"The fact is, establishing a single market without internal borders, without these safety valves which, in the final analysis, would not disturb the ordinary citizen, offers an area which is a sheer delight, and a profitable one at that, for criminals of every kind."
"Modern-day pirates, come to Europe, the only risk you run is that of a few spot checks being carried out by customs officials looking for the needle in the European haystack!"
"In this respect, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy was indeed well advised and insightful when it adopted the opinion, since it adopted the amendments I tabled."
"Admittedly, candidate countries must undertake not to counterfeit or make pirate copies of our services (only, perhaps, of our values) but we should also consider the countries with whom we sign customs agreements."
"Should the aforesaid undertaking not be a condition sine qua non?"
"Moreover, let us not be naively optimistic. A totally free area cannot be created until the structures to monitor this freedom are ready."
"I wished to point this out in my Amendment No 6, which was adopted within the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"Customs controls at the internal borders of Member States, in this specific context, do not represent a barrier to the single market but, quite the opposite, offer protection as regards the jobs, health and safety of European Union residents."
"In adopting this very important amendment, realistic and constructive Members of Parliament will be cultivating the art of good border management."
"We must ensure that the European Union is not replaced by a poor quality counterfeit which would leave our States vulnerable to cross-border crime and which would be to the detriment of its inhabitants."
"Mr President, I have the impression that, by following the Commission in laying too much emphasis on the internal market, many of my fellow Members have not grasped the real scale of this phenomenon."
"Our markets are adversely affected by counterfeiting and piracy, as are all world markets."
"It would, therefore, be a dangerously narrow approach to confine ourselves too much to the single market, suggesting that the entire solution could be found there."
"I should also like, at this Green Paper stage, to stress the fact that such illegal activities, when they affect pharmaceutical products, spare parts and toys, constitute a very real risk to human health and safety."
"And I appeal to reason to ensure that the attempts to reconcile national approaches do not compromise the arrangements already in place in our national states."
"I foresee the risks of allowing harmonisation to become an end in itself."
"Given the real risk of losing focus, I should like to issue a warning to the Commission."
"Rather than on the counterfeiting of garden gnomes which it mentions, we should be concentrating on protecting patents, trademarks and copyright, which make it possible to guarantee consumer protection as well as ensuring the continued existence of firms that undertake significant investment up front in research and development and in the manufacture of quality products."
"Many jobs in the textile sector, the automobile industry and the sphere of culture also depend on these."
"Let us be serious about this."
"Software protection within European or national administrations requires much more than a code of conduct, but rather the strict observance of regulations, and I hope that the Commission will acknowledge that this is more a matter of determination to adopt sound managerial practices than of the introduction of a harmonised arsenal of legislative and criminal law measures."
"Mrs Fourtou' s report is valuable because it provides an important gloss on the Commission' s green paper 'Combating counterfeiting and piracy in the single market' ."
"This document clearly sets out the importance of intellectual property in the contemporary world and the damage that theft of that property can do."
"While many people quite rightly consider that burglary is wrong, there is not somehow the same feeling about, for example, the illegal taking and using of intellectual property, for example, pirated CDs or using Napster to get other people' s music off the Internet."
"But, of course, there is no fundamental difference between the two."
"In some ways the most interesting challenge posed by these relatively new forms of crime are the means of countering them."
"Clearly, in any pan-national single market, measures cannot be confined to a single Member State' s jurisdiction but it does not automatically follow that the correct answer is European-wide harmonisation of penalties, criminal law and procedures."
"There is undoubtedly an overriding requirement for coordination and a single strategy to deal with the counterfeiters and pirates, but the principles of mutual recognition have not, in my view, been given the prominence I would like to have seen in the conclusions to the report."
"This tends to emphasise the need to harmonise more than is appropriate or necessary in the circumstances."
"However, having said that, it is important for the European Union' s judicial area to have a coherent and comprehensive framework for dealing with the problems of counterfeiting and piracy which is widely carried out both within and without the Union by increasingly determined and technologically sophisticated criminals."
"We are often glibly told, rightly in fact I believe, that we are moving into a knowledge-based society."
"We therefore cannot allow that knowledge to be stolen from those to whom it belongs as doing that will undermine the economic base of the society."
"If that happens, we allow it to happen at our peril."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11 a.m."
"Transitional civil administration/peace accords"
"The next item is the report (A5-0111/2000) by Mr Laschet, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the proposal for a Council Regulation on support to bodies set up by the international community after conflicts, either to take charge of the interim civilian administration of certain regions or to implement peace agreements."
"Mr President, this specific proposal concerns support for those bodies which the international community must unfortunately establish now and again, either to take care of interim civilian administration in regions affected by conflict or to implement peace agreements."
"As a Union, we must, of course, assume long-term responsibility for this type of task in Europe."
"We are already involved in two cases, through the High Representative for Bosnia-Herzegovina and through the EU' s participation in the UN' s transitional administration in Kosovo."
"The major part of the EU' s operations in Kosovo, for example, will, of course, be concerned with actual reconstruction, but the EU must, naturally, also assume responsibility for those bodies which are required if there is to be a return to a society with a functioning civilian administration, able, in the long run, to become a democratic society cooperating closely with both the EU and the other Balkan countries."
"It is equally obvious that responsibility must be shared fairly between different international players and that there must be correct and detailed regulations relating to how this is to take place."
"In this regard, I nonetheless feel a certain unease."
"We are receiving more and more information about an unduly small proportion of the EU' s aid to Kosovo in fact going to practical reconstruction and an extremely large proportion of those resources we have allocated for the year 2000 being spent in other ways."
"Administration of the reconstruction bureau, which is also an important measure, is one such item of expenditure, but here we are also concerned with, for example, budgetary aid and energy imports."
"We are not questioning the significance of these measures, but it is rather alarming if the cost of those operations which constitute the EU' s main task is actually much lower than the 360 million which has been allocated."
"More information is required in this area."
"In order that the work can be executed quickly, and in the absence of a legal basis, the Council has so far chosen to take a decision on the measures within the framework of the common foreign and security policy."
"In accordance with the present proposal, this type of measure is now to be transferred to the first pillar."
"We therefore demand a rethink, firstly of the legal basis for the aid provided by the Union and, secondly, of the way in which we are actually to use those resources which have traditionally been allocated within the sphere of foreign policy but which belong, rather, under the first pillar and Category 4."
"There appear to be a number of gaps in this area."
"If the Commission' s proposal and the Council' s wishes are to be complied with and a new budget item created, and if this is, moreover, to be provided with additional net financing, it will be necessary to consult Parliament and carry out a proper budget procedure."
"I want to be clear on this point: it is not a question of Parliament enjoying the prestige of being able to express its opinion on these questions, but of our now having to realise that these tasks are not of an interim character but are to be more long term in nature."
"Where operations are concerned, we must have a method which is fast and legally correct and which permits transparency, and we must therefore have a more regular budgetary procedure."
"There must be a great readiness to engage in continued operations of this kind."
"We must therefore also clarify the way in which the budget is managed, together with the legal basis for the aid. In this way, disputes about these matters will not become obstacles to constructive operations."
"On the whole, I believe that transparency and public scrutiny are important elements of the measures which need to be taken in future."
"However, these must be combined with speed and efficiency."
"In an area like Kosovo, decisions cannot be made on operations which are to be delayed for a long time, because the situation may already have had time to change."
"We should establish conditions for how the resources concerned are to be used, but we should not have procedures which are so complicated that the EU is accused of inefficiency or that important reconstruction operations are delayed."
"It is therefore important that support for the type of body we are now talking about should be accompanied by special agreements concerning how the money is to be used and that there should be subsequent proficient monitoring of the quality of the operations concerned."
"Moreover, we must subsequently be given detailed reports on how, for example, the transitional administration is working."
"There are positive features to be mentioned."
"Even if the EU sometimes comes in for criticism, it is worth mentioning that the EU' s task force has received a lot of praise for the efficiency it has shown."
"We only hope now that this efficiency really can also be transferred to the more permanent work in the reconstruction bureau and to the EU' s operations within the framework of UNMIK."
"I want to emphasise that considerable freedom of action at local level is required, but we must, of course, be able nevertheless to check that the resources are being used correctly."
"The present proposal also contains a new budget item of EUR 27 million."
"This is to be accommodated within Category 4 which, in turn, of course, also gives practical expression to yesterday' s proposal from the Commission for a review of the budget in order to accommodate the more long-term support for democratisation and reconstruction in the Balkans."
"The Committee on Budgets has a large number of questions regarding these figures."
"There is a definite desire on the part of Parliament to come up with the aid required and we are aware that the needs are very great indeed."
"We must also focus on the needs of the Balkan peoples, but then it is the task of Parliament and of the other branches of the budgetary authority to find the technical solutions to the financing requirements."
"I think that the sum of 27 million we are talking about here emphasises the need to review the budget."
"I believe that most people judging the issue, possibly with the exception of the Council, would consider it impossible to use this aid in its entirety within the framework of the budget' s current Category 4."
"It is unreasonable that support for other poor regions in the world should be affected by the problems in the Balkans."
"To sum up, I think that we must now give more consideration to the quality of the operations."
"Now that the Commission is presenting both the budget for implementation and this new way of dealing with the support for establishing the EU' s part in the civilian administration, it is important that we should not focus solely upon the overall figures or the formal decision-making processes. It is at least as important to evaluate the operations and to make sure that these are implemented swiftly and efficiently."
"In general, it is now being said that the implementation in Kosovo is more effective than in Bosnia, but there are still plenty of new issues which ought to be investigated."
"The whole of this discussion shows how closely foreign and security policy is bound up with Parliament' s role in, for example, the budgetary procedure."
"In this regard, we must develop a model for guaranteeing that aid is put together correctly and transparently in accordance with our regulations and in such a way that it can also be examined and reviewed, as Mr Staes pointed out."
"These considerations must not lead to the aid programme becoming bogged down in vague decision-making processes."
"Against this background, we support the Laschet report."
"Mr President, Mr Laschet has produced an excellent report on a very technical subject, going into great detail and discovering certain features connected with the subject which have been discussed during this debate."
"For this reason, I would like to congratulate him on his splendid work."
"Parliament is considering a proposal for a Council Regulation on a basis for financing the UN operation in Kosovo, UNMIK, and the costs of the High Representative for Bosnia-Herzegovina."
"The intention is to transfer these appropriations from the common foreign and security policy in the second pillar to the first pillar, to be financed from the Commission' s budget."
"Although this would appear to be a purely technical measure, there are certain problems associated with it."
"The first concerns Category 4."
"Category 4 is already overloaded."
"For this reason, the Commission proposed yesterday that the financial perspective be revised and that there should be substantial use of agricultural appropriations for external action."
"This transfer will bring with it a considerable need for additional financing in Category 4."
"Another problem concerns competence."
"If the proposal for a regulation were to be adopted without amendment, it would mean that there would be a syphon for transferring second pillar funds to the first pillar in Category 4, without consulting Parliament."
"For this reason, the regulation must be amended so that Parliament may maintain its power of influence."
"This syphon has to be blocked, so the annex to the proposal should be deleted and the amendments the Committee on Budgets is proposing should be adopted."
"The proposal should therefore be restricted at this stage of the proceedings to just two situations: financing the UN operation in Kosovo and the costs of the High Representative for Bosnia-Herzegovina."
"Thirdly, if the funding of special envoys is transferred in future to the Council' s administration budget, as is supposed, it will mean that the gentlemen' s agreement between the Council and Parliament will have to be reviewed."
"Under this agreement, the Council and Parliament do not interfere with the content of each other' s budget."
"If, however, what are clearly operational appropriations, such as those for financing the work of special envoys, are transferred to the Council' s budget, they will no longer be serving to fund the Council' s administrative expenses, but rather providing common financing of the work of the European Union."
"For this reason, these funds can no longer fall within the scope of the gentlemen' s agreement: the European Parliament must have the right to express its opinion and to influence the use of appropriations for financing the work of special envoys, even though they may have been included in the Council' s administrative budget."
"The proposal for a Regulation may, as far as I can see, be adopted only if the Commission, and the Council too, accept Parliament' s amendments, since, otherwise, the proposal will go against the present interinstitutional agreement."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to express our Group' s support for the rapporteur' s report."
"It is quite clear that we need to strengthen the powers of the Commission and of Parliament in matters relating to aid for Bosnia, because past experience has shown that this is fraught with problems."
"There is the report from the Court of Auditors for a start, but there are also the experiences of the delegates of the last legislature, and particularly Edith Müller, who kept on probing in Bosnia-Herzegovina, because it had become apparent that people' s sense of responsibility was nowhere near what is should have been when it came to the deployment of resources, spending money, investigations and the discharge procedure."
"Transferring actions to the first pillar increases the likelihood of the Commission and Parliament being able to exert a great deal more influence over the allocation of funds, to carry out their responsibilities, and also check up on what becomes of the funds in the discharge procedure."
"Firstly, this means that we will be able to make it clear to the European taxpayer that we are going to heighten the European institutions' sense of responsibility when it comes to spending money."
"However, we will also - and I think this is at least as important - be setting the course for an important development, and I am with Mr Brok every step of the way on this point."
"I believe it is absolutely vital for us to make it clear, in view of the fact that foreign policy is constantly gaining in importance within Europe, that the European institutions must be strengthened and that it is not for the Council alone to bear responsibility; rather it must be made clear, by increasing the level of responsibility of the Commission and Parliament, that we want to assume responsibility for foreign policy and that we also want to be involved in shaping policy in this sphere."
"Mr President, the proposal for a regulation aims to provide a legal basis for transferring the financial contribution from the CFSP to the budget for the first pillar, which we consider a positive move, since Parliament' s lack of monitoring powers over the CFSP itself is a disgrace."
"The draft resolution and the amendments therefore quite rightly stress the need to step up supervision of all operations to fund what are euphemistically called bodies in receipt of aid, in order to avoid any mention of a protectorate."
"This is what is really at issue in Bosnia or in Kosovo."
"The resolution indeed is silent on the key issue, which is the validity of the policy implemented in the former Yugoslavia."
"What is the state of affairs, five years on, in Bosnia-Herzegovina?"
"How is the outcome of the war in Kosovo to be appraised?"
"How much did the military intervention cost?"
"How much did the destruction cost?"
"Through an 80% increase in the 2001 budget, the peoples of Europe are being asked to foot the bill for the parties that caused the destruction and that now want to embark on reconstruction, for the greater profit of a few industrialists."
"But who do they think they are kidding when those self-same Heads of State that conducted the war are now causing living conditions everywhere to deteriorate and making employment less secure?"
"What is more, the planned solutions to assist these protectorates are problematic and harmful."
"For example, the level of the wages handed out to international organisations only serve to undermine these regions further."
"For example, and this is still more tragic, there are still no effective controls on the distribution of aid."
"Even the Committee on Budgetary Control is stressing the serious abuses in the management of European Union aid to Bosnia-Herzegovina."
"The deutschmark is foisted on Kosovo, and the law of the market prevails."
"As far as we are concerned, the outcome of the military intervention speaks for itself."
"Milosevic is still in power."
"Kosovo is a ravaged country."
"The ethnic divide is becoming entrenched, at the same time that an ungovernable protectorate is being set up which is seeking to deny the Kosovars independence without, for all that, being capable of applying the hypocritical framework of UN Resolution 1244."
"For all these reasons, unlike my fellow Members who have spoken so far, we will be unable to vote in favour of a resolution which makes only marginal improvements to a disastrous policy."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 11 a.m."
"(The sitting was suspended from 10.35 a.m. until the vote at 11 a.m.)"
"Welcome"
"Ladies and gentlemen, let me welcome, on your behalf, a delegation from the Maltese Parliament, which is currently visiting our institution."
"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the European Parliament."
"We hope that, despite your very heavy schedule, you will have the opportunity to meet many of the Members of this House, and that your visit will be a productive one, helping relations between your country and the European Union to progress."
"Vote"
"- (FR) Today, Parliament adopted the common position on the legal aspects of electronic commerce as it stands."
"Everyone will acknowledge the value of clear regulations in a continually developing field where the economic and legal stakes are considerable."
"I shall not dwell on aspects which have already been extensively discussed."
"I should like at this point to return to one aspect I consider more fundamental."
"Today we are setting regulations, quite rightly, for the litigation which may arise from impersonal, and therefore risky, electronic commercial transactions."
"It is now imperative that we consider what steps we can take in advance to prevent such problems arising and, in order to achieve this, primarily combat the rationale according to which, in a world which is losing its most sacred ethical standards, e-commerce should be just another phase in the development of an unregulated society and one which therefore, as we can observe, inevitably places the very weakest at a disadvantage."
"There is no question here of banning an extraordinary instrument of culture and openness."
"What we have to do is be as demanding with this as we are, legitimately, with any other form of trade."
"And now we are getting to the heart of the matter: e-commerce and, more generally, the Internet, are the expression of a society without legitimate and, ultimately, human territorial limits."
"This precious asset of freedom is caricatured by those who, deliberately or otherwise, promote the destruction of protective ethical standards."
"Indeed, freedom only really exists, in any society, when each person has the legal capacity to accept or reject, in full knowledge of the facts, what is being offered to him and not just to engage in litigation after the fact, which gives rise to many problems, as we have clearly seen in the course of these debates."
"The law must be the expression of a general political vision, a social project."
"Otherwise, all it can do is follow after developments that it can neither anticipate nor control."
"International or supranational structures never have that extra spark of spirit which engenders motivating ideas and collective commitment."
"The European Union is no exception."
"Carraro recommendation (A5-0118/2000)"
"Madam President, I voted for the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of the EU-Swiss Confederation agreements not only because I feel that it is extremely important for Switzerland, which will undoubtedly become part of the European Union in what we hope will be the near future, to have agreements established with the Member States of the Union, but also because, when I think of Switzerland, I feel a sense of relief."
"Indeed, even today, all the newspapers in the European Union were proclaiming that even the fall of the European single currency, the euro, is the fault of the pensioners. Well!"
"So pensioners are responsible for everything that goes wrong!"
"In Switzerland, on the other hand, where income tax is only 10%, pensions are much higher than in our States."
"Therefore, the Pensioners' Party has a liking for Switzerland."
"- (FR) The report under discussion today concerns relations between Switzerland and the European Union."
"Let us remember that Switzerland participated in the negotiations that led to the signing of the agreement on the European Economic Area."
"In a referendum held in 1992, however, the people of Switzerland voted against this agreement, thus making it impossible for Switzerland to participate in the agreement on the EEA and with the result that Switzerland' s application for European Union membership, submitted in May 1992, was put on hold."
"It was therefore necessary to find some means of maintaining links between Switzerland and the EU."
"This led to the signing of bilateral agreements."
"Since 1993, Switzerland has submitted a series of requests to participate in the internal market in specific sectors."
"Following these requests, negotiations between Switzerland and the European Union resulted in a package of sectoral agreements."
"This 'package' is made up of seven agreements on road and air transport, the free movement of persons, public procurement, research and development, mutual recognition in relation to conformity assessment, and agriculture."
"In order to anticipate a situation in which any one of these agreements could be cancelled by referendum after the conclusion of the negotiations, the European Union decided to link these agreements together by including a standard clause in each of them to the effect that the agreements could only come into effect simultaneously and could only be applied in full."
"This represented a minimum guarantee of coherence."
"The procedure has undergone some delays in the Council due, in particular, to differences of opinion regarding the free movement of persons."
"In April 2000, under pressure from the European Parliament, the Council presented the single, consolidated legislative instrument to approve the seven agreements between the Community and its Member States, on the one hand, and the Swiss Confederation, on the other."
"This proposal for a decision combines the seven proposals, previously submitted by the Commission in a single legal instrument, with some amendments."
"Shortly thereafter, the Council referred the matter to the European Parliament. Only then did we have an opportunity to state our views and to decide whether or not we were going to give our assent to this package of agreements."
"As it happens, our rapporteur is urging us to do so, and I shall follow his lead."
"This is all the more important since a referendum on the agreement on the free movement of persons is due to be held in Switzerland on 21 May."
"We must send out a positive political message by giving our assent."
"I should, however, like to add a few minor points."
"Switzerland must indeed clarify its position in relation to the European Union."
"It must not be allowed to carry on picking and choosing the European policies it wishes to implement."
"Madam President, the Pensioners' Party voted in favour of the Schierhuber report on the Convention on European Community Food Aid to the world."
"We are all in agreement regarding this initiative, myself in particular, but I would like to stress the importance of avoiding the establishment of agricultural produce quotas such as milk, cereal or other food quotas resulting in these products being wasted, squashed by steam rollers in the form of citrus juicers, wine presses and so forth, whereas they could be preserved and delivered, whenever there is a need, and there is always a need, to states throughout the world which require food aid."
"Laschet report (A5-0111/2000)"
"Madam President, this report is chiefly concerned with providing the current situation in Kosovo with the semblance of a legal basis and pseudo-democratic backing."
"Parliament is invited to ratify the de facto situation created by the military attack upon Serbia and Kosovo a year ago."
"After expressing at the time our opposition both to Milosevic' s ethnic cleansing and to the bombing by Western forces, we refuse to sanction in any way whatsoever the situation resulting from this bombing."
"As for the financial aspects, we continue to maintain that it is the powers responsible for the bombing attacks who must fund the repairs to the damage caused by the war and its consequences, in both Kosovo and Serbia, and also in neighbouring countries, deducting the necessary sums from their military budget."
"- (FR) The proposal for a regulation before us today seeks to provide an appropriate legal basis to enable the European Union to fund a number of bodies which have been set up by the international community following conflicts and which are responsible either for implementing certain peace agreements, as is the case in Bosnia-Herzegovina, or for ensuring the interim civilian administration of certain regions, as is the case, at present, in Kosovo."
"The purpose of this text is also apparently to ensure the transparency of the funding, which would take the shape of subsidies, and also to make it possible to extend the type of action concerned to other bodies in future."
"The text would, finally, provide the basis for the European Commission to take decisions on funding and, acting on behalf of the European Union, to then sign financial agreements with these various bodies."
"Behind the sales pitch for this regulation, and as an inevitable progression from political decisions taken long ago, what we have here is no more and no less than a deliberate attempt to step up communitisation."
"Let us make no mistake!"
"The present regulation, in response to a request from the Council, involves transferring the funding of joint actions, decided on within the framework of the CFSP and previously funded from the common foreign and security policy budget, to the first pillar, i.e. the vast range of Community policies managed by the Commission."
"In this seemingly innocuous move we are also witness to a significant strengthening of the powers of the most integrative and most federalist body par excellence, i.e. the European Commission, on the grounds, although this is not admitted by the Council, that some operations should be perpetuated and that funds should be released for other actions."
"Let us remember that if the European Commission decided to support them, any new bodies which might be set up by the international community would be guaranteed funding from the first pillar budget, without any need to even consider consulting the European Parliament."
"Finally, strictly in terms of the actual budget, the proposal for a regulation puts a little more pressure on Category 4 of the financial perspective, for external measures, which is already under great strain on account of funding the reconstruction in the Western Balkans."
"If it were implemented this year, a supplementary and amending budget would be required."
"For all the above reasons, the French Members of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group are unable to support Mr Laschet' s report."
"Hatzidakis report (A5-0076/2000)"
"Madam President, the Pensioners' Party, which is part of the Group of the European People' s Party, and I, myself, as its representative, voted for the Hatzidakis report on the granting of Community financial assistance in the field of Trans-European networks, mainly because communications within our Union are the single most important factor in the creation of Europe and the most important issue where the principle of subsidiarity is applied in practice."
"There is no greater indication that Europe exists as a political, as well as a geographical, entity than the building of a network of links within Europe."
"I hope that we will continue along this path and that national infrastructures will be established which give due consideration to European projects."
"Sterckx report (A5-0075/2000)"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted against Mr Sterckx' s report, which I believe constitutes a serious threat to the future of air transport."
"In the first place, this report gives no precise analysis of the liberalisation of air traffic."
"There is no mention of its huge impact on the environment."
"There is no mention of the major implications for airspace congestion related to the fact that the average number of passengers per flight has been considerably reduced as a result of competition."
"There is no mention, or only very superficial discussion, of the great decline in the social conditions observed in these sectors of activity, nor is there any mention of the adverse effects on town and country planning, to the extent that, at the present time, it costs a lot to travel to a remote area of Europe, whereas costs have fallen for routes which are already well served."
"These are the negative results of liberalisation."
"Worse still, Mr Sterckx' s report proposes a new phase of liberalisation, envisaging not only a single European airspace, a proposal worth considering, but associating this inevitably with the privatisation of air traffic control."
"Even the United States of America has not privatised its air traffic control agency."
"It remains subject to the federal authority of the Federal Republic of the United States of America."
"Even the home of liberalism did not go for this option."
"One would have to be totally unaware of the deterioration in the safety of British transport systems, and the recurrence of accidents related to the privatisation of this means of transport, not to realise that, in terms of safety, there is nothing better than a public service."
"Yet the choice made in this report is quite different, in fact the opposite, the complete antithesis."
"I think that Europe is probably now, more so than before, in need of the confidence of its constituent nations, and that a new phase of liberalisation would run counter to the latter' s expectations."
"They make this quite clear on a regular basis."
"A subsequent return of liberalism will come as no surprise."
"Madam President, on behalf of the Pensioners' Party, which is part of the Group of the European People' s Party, I voted for the Sterckx report on the regulation of the European airline industry."
"I particularly welcome the recommendation in this report that national government delegations should be seconded to the European Union structures which deal with incentives for technical research."
"I would also like to use these few, precious seconds allotted to me to point out that it would have been appropriate for these measures governing transport and, in particular, air transport in Europe, to make provision for young and elderly people who enjoy travelling, and that it would have been appropriate to provide flight discounts for them - but not necessarily during peak hours or on peak days - thereby promoting cultural exchanges among both young and elderly people from different States of the European Union."
". (PT) We are bound to agree with the report under discussion when it states that increasing competition has had harmful repercussions on social conditions and safety and has led to a great expansion in the number of routes, thereby causing congestion of air space."
"We also support the report' s confirmation of the importance attached to passenger air transport as a public service for the remote and island regions and to the requirement that air transport safety be improved."
"We are therefore bound to disagree with the fact that the report continues, despite this analysis and in a completely contradictory way, to seek greater liberalisation of every aspect of this sector, as well as the transfer of the sovereignty of air space."
"These are some of the reasons why we cannot vote in favour of this report."
"Fourtou report (A5-0096/2000)"
"- (FR) I supported Mrs Fourtou' s draft report on the Commission' s Green Paper on combating counterfeiting and piracy because we are at the preparatory stage and I feel that our rapporteur has clearly outlined the serious risks involved in counterfeiting and piracy."
"The fact is that, quite apart from the economic considerations, important enough in themselves, together with the activities of organised crime, consumers are being exposed to serious human health and safety risks."
"I also share the views of the report when it stresses the need for public information and awareness campaigns and calls for a strengthening of the law enforcement aspect in view of the rising tide of counterfeiting and piracy."
"On the other hand, I have rather more reservations as to the degree of harmonisation required, particularly in terms of criminal law."
"In the same spirit, I should not like the involvement of national parliaments to be limited to a warning, inferring that we should be deadlocked if we did not take legislative powers on civil and criminal law away from the national level."
"This way of reasoning, the seeds of which are to be found in the Green Paper, seems rather limited, but I have no doubts that, through cooperation between the competent authorities and the pooling of experience, it will be possible to obtain satisfactory results within optimum time limits without falling into this skewed way of thinking."
"We must face facts. We already have tried and tested practices at national level."
"What we should be doing is coordinating them better rather than ruling them out in the name of a uniformity which would only prove counter-productive."
"Finally, I would like to welcome the invitation issued by our rapporteur to European and national authorities to monitor the internal use made of protected works, such as office software."
"I would go even further and I believe, as my fellow Member, Mr Yves Butel, has said, that, in this area, what we need is not so much a code of conduct as for the regulations to be strictly observed."
"- (FR) Computers, audio and video equipment, toys, fragrances, pharmaceutical products, clocks and watches, cars - absolutely everything is copied."
"The harm suffered by the luxury goods industry is just the visible tip of the iceberg, probably also the least dangerous part."
"Damage to the economy is much more significant."
"A UNESCO Conference organised in Paris in June 1992 estimated the illegal gains due to counterfeiting at some BEF 3 000 billion per year."
"According to the International Chamber of Commerce, the cost of counterfeiting represents between 5 and 7% of world trade."
"Sales of illegal compact discs were reported to have increased by almost 20% in 1996 and comprise 14% of the world market."
"In the software sector, piracy rates are estimated at 46% worldwide."
"The number of jobs lost in the European Union is put at 100 000 over the past ten years."
"These figures are probably still greatly underestimated, and Internet imperialism will make them higher still."
"Current investigations show that piracy and counterfeiting are closely linked to other forms of organised crime, such as trafficking in drugs and armaments and money laundering."
"This gives us an indication of the major stakes involved for the internal security of our Member States."
"As the rapporteur quite rightly mentioned, I think that a balanced policy on the subject must combine prevention and law enforcement."
"Prevention involves increasing public awareness, not just of the damage done to our firms, but also of the risks involved in purchasing poor quality products which may, in some instances, be dangerous to human health and safety."
"I am thinking, for example, of pharmaceutical products and spare parts for cars."
"I do not share the opinion expressed in Amendment No 8, since I think that confiscating illegally copied goods, even if it is only a simple compact disc, may well serve as an example and be of instructional value, particularly with regard to young people, who must learn that copying is damaging to the artist whose works they like."
"As far as the law enforcement aspect is concerned, we must involve our Member States in a more proactive policy of fast and effective legal prosecution of offenders."
"I think it would also be useful if the forces of law and order were to receive suitable training to be able to detect counterfeit goods more easily."
"Increasing penalties might also have a deterrent effect."
"Counterfeiting and piracy constitute a threat to the proper operation of the internal market."
"They jeopardise the viability of some of our businesses, especially small- and medium-sized businesses that undertake research."
"They introduce distortions of competition."
"They undermine the foundations of a sound economy."
"Moreover, and most especially, they mislead the consumer, sometimes at the risk of his or her health or safety."
"This consumer must be protected, so much is clear. It is in this spirit that I support Mrs Fourtou' s report."
"- (FR) Mrs Fourtou' s report has given us the opportunity for a preliminary discussion on the measures to be taken to combat counterfeiting and piracy."
"This report rightly deplores the harmful consequences of these methods for the economies of our countries, as well as the risks they entail for the purchasers of inferior quality products."
"Parliament has therefore adopted some of the conclusions of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, particularly on what is at stake in this fight and on the importance of eliminating some of the disparities between intellectual property protection schemes in order to better address the problem."
"We thought it useful to adopt, in the form of amendments, other conclusions which were not adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, particularly regarding the need for fast, effective civil law protection for intellectual property rights, and the need for realistic, appropriate and effective legislation on patents."
"Regarding the definitions of scope, it would have been better to include not only the deliberate and fraudulent sides of such activities but also the commercial motives behind them."
"Not to refer to the search for easy, illegal profits, which is characteristic of activities of this type, is to omit an essential feature, one which effectively makes them similar to one aspect of organised crime."
"On the other hand, I am pleased to see that the House has adopted our amendment to define innovation and the improvement of innovation in an appropriate manner, since the similarity between these two areas often makes it possible to disguise counterfeits with nothing more than superficial changes and to introduce them as innovations."
"There is a great deal at stake in piracy and counterfeiting, both for the people who are the victims of the illegal copying activities and of the counterfeit products, and also for the people who make money from them."
"The fact that such activities are often associated with organised crime makes it imperative for us to define most precisely the legal instruments we wish to create in order to combat it."
"The effectiveness of the law, especially within the Community area, will lie in this precision and in its capacity to provide a realistic response to practical problems."
"That concludes the voting."
"Adjournment of the session"
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"(The sitting was closed at 11.45 a.m.)"
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 4 May 2000."
"- Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, on Saturday, a horrific accident struck the people of Enschede, in the Netherlands."
"There was an explosion in a fireworks warehouse which has already caused at least sixteen deaths and has injured over six hundred people, six of whom are in a critical condition, with many more people reported missing."
"Around four hundred homes have been destroyed by the explosion, and more than a thousand have suffered damage."
"This is one of the most terrible disasters in the Netherlands since the second world war."
"I have contacted the Dutch authorities to express our deepest sympathy, both in a personal capacity and on behalf of the European Parliament."
"At this sad time, our thoughts go out to the victims, to their families, and also to the emergency rescue teams who are working tirelessly."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I invite you to observe a minute' s silence."
"(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)"
"Madam President, on behalf of the 31 Dutch delegates of this European Parliament, I would like to convey to you my heartfelt thanks for the words you spoke a moment ago and for the respect this Parliament has shown for the victims of this terrible disaster in Enschede and for their relatives."
"Madam President, on behalf of the 31 delegates, there is actually little I could add to your words."
"I would, however, like to underline how we have been moved not only by what you said a moment ago and the silence that was observed, but also by the prompt assistance across the borders to relieve the distress following this disaster."
"At a moment' s notice, German colleagues joined forces with their Dutch friends to carry out the frequently dangerous activities which were necessary to control the disaster."
"German hospitals too have been involved in the care of the wounded, dozens of whom are still in hospital."
"I find this an example of European solidarity which is what we stand for in this Parliament."
"On behalf of the 31 delegates, I would also like to thank the Commission which immediately expressed sympathy in the form of a letter from Mr Prodi to the municipality of Enschede."
"I would like to ask the Commission to consider what kind of a role it sees for itself in relieving distress and in preventing terrible disasters of this kind in which so many citizens are involved."
"I am extremely grateful to you on behalf of the 31 for the sympathy this Parliament has shown, and I can see in our Parliament a true representation of the European solidarity which this continent so desperately needs."
"- Thank you, Mr Oostlander."
"- On 7 May last year, terrorism of the most undiscriminating and brutal kind once again struck in Spain with the murder of José Luis López de Lacalle, a journalist and co-founder of the Forum d' Ermua, a peace movement of Basque intellectuals."
"The terrorists intended to strike a blow at one of the most precious assets of democracy, freedom of expression."
"This forum was founded after Miguel Ángel Blanco Garrido, a municipal councillor in Ermua, was murdered by ETA in July 1997."
"This forum means to affirm that intimidation and blackmail are not enough to silence consciences."
"Throughout his life José Luis López de Lacalle fought to defend freedom and democracy."
"After spending five years in prison under the Franco regime, he fell victim to another dictatorship, that of terrorism."
"That very day, I made a point of staunchly condemning this act of barbarism and of expressing, both in a personal capacity and on behalf of the European Parliament as a whole, our deepest sympathy and condolences to his family and the newspaper he worked for."
"I also notified the Spanish Government of our utmost support in the fight against terrorism."
"Agenda"
"The final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday 11 May 2000 has been distributed."
"Relating to Thursday:"
"We can have five items in the Human Rights section. At the moment, we only have four."
"We therefore have the opportunity to add a further item, and I have received three requests."
"A request from the GUE/NGL, the Greens and the TDI to add a new sub-item entitled ""Tunisia"" ; one from the PPE Group to add an item on ""Spectator safety and the prevention of hooliganism at the forthcoming European football championship"" ; and an item from the Union for a Europe of Nations Group to add a new sub-item entitled the ""Situation of Bhutan refugees in Nepal"" ."
"I shall therefore put these requests to the vote in the order in which I received them. Firstly, though, Mr Cohn-Bendit wishes to speak in support of the request by the GUE, the Greens and the TDI."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the association agreement between the European Union and Tunisia has been in force since 1 March 1998."
"Since then we have not had a single major debate on Tunisia, and there have been no topical and urgent motions."
"Every time one of the groups can be relied upon to say, ""Yes, it is important, but you must see that Mr Ben Ali is still just settling in."""
"We have all read the reports in the papers of the status of human rights and freedom of expression in Tunisia."
"I find it outrageous that every time we attempt to discuss this, we are prevented by Members of Parliament and the Tunisian Government."
"I find it outrageous that one of the two major parties is trying once again to put off any debate or any topical and urgent motion on fundamental freedoms in Tunisia."
"Our Group is therefore asking everyone to stop listening to the leaders of the two main parties, and instead to act like independently-minded adults and resolve at long last to have a debate on the situation in Tunisia."
"Let us have the topical and urgent motion, and we shall see what majority there is for human rights, and what majority uses human rights purely in the interests of its own party and resorts to tactics when the situation is sensitive."
"In opposition to a tactical stance on Tunisia, and in favour of frank and open debate, I urge you to vote in favour of the topical and urgent motion and to table the situation of human rights in Tunisia."
"Madam President, for my part I wish to speak on a constructive rather than on a polemical basis."
"I think this is indeed an opportune moment to have a debate on human rights in Tunisia."
"It must be held this week because today the trial of Taoufik Ben Brik' s brother is taking place in Tunis and tomorrow a delegation of Members of the European Parliament, from my Group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Group of the Party of European Socialists will be returning from Tunis."
"This week we are also due to be visited by the President of the Tunisian League of Human Rights and perhaps by Mr Taoufik Ben Brik himself."
"In view of these circumstances and the importance of the European Parliament decision to take action to encourage the release of Mr Ben Brik, I think it particularly appropriate for us to enter this item on the agenda."
"Madam President, firstly I would like to say that, out of self-respect, we should not create false arguments amongst ourselves."
"Human rights should not only be defended when we come here, but they should be defended constantly. I believe we are all united in this fight."
"There are no substantial differences between us."
"It would have been a good thing if, in the past, when the Socialist Group proposed an urgent debate on the situation in Tunisia, we could have counted on the votes of those people who are protesting today, because we have not managed to have that urgency approved."
"However, I would like to remind you - I was the first speaker at the last Brussels part-session and I asked you, Madam President, on behalf of all of us, to write to President Ben Ali of Tunisia - that what we have to do now is wait for the President of Tunisia to reply to you in your capacity as leader of this Parliament."
"Secondly, I would like to point out that the matter of our relations with Tunisia does not end with an urgent debate."
"It is a much more important and substantial issue and my Group has agreed today to present an oral question to the Commission and the Council in order that we may hold a full debate on this issue."
"I believe that if Mr Cohn-Bendit, for example, wishes for a full debate on this question, he should support our proposal so that we can include it in the next agenda."
"Thank you, Mr Barón Crespo."
"I think the House is now sufficiently well informed to proceed to the vote."
"(Parliament rejected the proposal)"
"And now to the proposal from the Group of the European People' s Party on hooliganism."
"Madam President, I wish to thank my own group for allowing this resolution to come this far."
"It is not often that we discuss urgencies that might be able to change something for the better."
"We are always very reactionary and talk about things that we really cannot affect."
"However, next month, before we sit again in Strasbourg, the European football championship starts."
"A number of problems have already been raised by people such as the Belgian Police Federation, and there have been many documentaries in various countries about various games and the security arrangements for Euro 2000."
"I know this is meant to be a human rights issue, and indeed it is about the rights of ordinary people."
"Every real supporter of football has the right to go to a football game and spectate, and then come away without a threat of violence, without problems on the streets and without being harassed unduly by people we do not particularly like to meet at any time: football hooligans."
"This is what this motion is about and I very much hope Members will support it."
"(Parliament approved the proposal)"
"Madam President, on Friday of last month, the four votes could not be held because of the absence of a quorum which had been requested."
"Now, I do not think that this is the appropriate place to debate this."
"Those who took the initiative have sent a letter to all Members to explain what exactly their intentions were in taking this action."
"We will all have the chance next month, of course, to speak our minds regarding Fridays because we will then be discussing the 2001 Agenda."
"However, that does mean that we have a problem in the short term, namely what we will be doing this coming Friday."
"That problem has been addressed by this Parliament' s Bureau and, if I understand it correctly, the Bureau issued an opinion to the Conference of Presidents with a proposal not to hold any votes this coming Friday."
"As I understand it, this has not been discussed by the Conference of Presidents."
"Since it is, of course, up to this House to draft the agenda, I would like to propose simply moving all votes scheduled for Friday to Thursday because, whatever you may think of what happened last month, I think this would be the best way of avoiding the problem."
"We can then decide next month what we want to do in the long term."
"Thank you, Mrs van der Laan."
"As you can see, this provides some incentive for you to attend in great numbers on Friday in order to vote."
"I would address my very good friend, Mary Banotti, and ask what the situation is regarding Danish TV here in the Parliament building."
"We are, of course, one of the small countries which are always oppressed, but we should like to be able to watch Danish television so that we can keep up with what is happening. We are Europe' s most important country."
"We are simply the best. Just look at who won the Eurovision Song Contest."
"But we cannot keep in touch with what is happening."
"What are you going to do about it, Mary?"
"Thank you, Mr Blak."
"Mrs Banotti will reply immediately."
"Madam President, this is becoming a regular item."
"We were not getting interpretation throughout."
"So, dear Freddy, I did not understand a word you said - but I am sure it was wonderful!"
"Mr Blak will explain it to you."
"Madam President, I should just like to say that last year in this House we democratically rejected a motion to cancel Friday sittings by a large majority."
"We decided in favour of maintaining sittings on a Friday and said that on that day we would put items on the agenda which were uncontroversial, matters which had nonetheless to be dealt with and yet could also be properly settled with a rather smaller number of people."
"Last Friday, a minority of people abused a provision in the Rules of Procedure in order, as it were, to undermine the Friday sitting and to prevent the votes from taking place."
"In my view, this is an abuse of a rule which, in itself, is perfectly reasonable because, after all, a majority of this House made a decision on Friday sittings last year."
"The matters which were not put to the vote that Friday - including the important issue of Ethiopia - were voted on in Brussels and the results were almost unanimous."
"We could have voted on them almost unanimously on the Friday too, and I should like to ask colleagues to stop this sabotage, to let us get on with our work and to discuss the issue of how we organise our work separately and calmly."
"But let those who want to work here on a Friday do so in peace and quiet."
"At the end of the day, the votes had to be repeated because those who had asked for there to be a check on the quorum were themselves no longer present and did not take part in the vote."
"Ladies and gentlemen, as you are well aware, we are not going to start a debate on this sensitive issue."
"I will allow two more speakers and then we shall move on to the order of business."
"Madam President, I think there is a misunderstanding here."
"Mrs Van der Laan spoke about the proposal made by the Bureau to the Conference of Presidents."
"As I understand it, the Conference of Presidents has not discussed this matter any further."
"According to Mrs Van der Laan, it is not the intention that we now pass judgement on an action regarding the use of the Rules of Procedure."
"I would not want to term it misuse because then I would not know what else these Rules could be used for."
"What matters is that we too discuss a proposal from the Bureau here and now."
"Surely a proposal from the Bureau cannot simply be sidelined. All we want is that it should also be discussed and that a vote should be taken on it."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I shall now give the floor to Mr Wiebenga, since he was in the chair for the Friday of the last part-session and he will be able to tell you that we have discussed this within the Bureau."
"Madam President, for those Members who do not know, I would like to make it clear beforehand that I do not belong to the action group which started this Friday action, but that I was the acting President who had to contend with it."
"I would like to remind you - and I am at liberty to say this here because I have also said this outside the Bureau - that I referred this point to the Bureau, to you and colleagues in the Bureau, and have, for the short term, suggested four possibilities for Fridays, before we decide on the agenda for the year 2001, because then we might just as well, of course, vote here in plenary."
"The first possibility is to scrap Friday sittings altogether."
"The second possibility is to have Friday sittings with a full agenda and hold votes at 12.00, at lunch times, or such like."
"The third possibility is to hold debates on Fridays without voting and then delay the votes until Brussels or subsequent sittings."
"The fourth possibility is to carry on as we are, that is to say, to hold minor debates on Fridays and round them off with votes."
"Clearly, this last possibility will lead to situations in which other Members can request that the quorum be checked, meaning that we will once again be unable to hold votes this coming Friday."
"Madam President, the competent body in these matters is not the Bureau but the Conference of Presidents."
"I think that, whatever your opinion may be, whether you are for or against Fridays and whether you are for or against Strasbourg, our Parliament would benefit most if we were not to argue every Friday about the quorum and - I also told the Bureau this - if we were not to hold any votes this coming Friday."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Conference of Presidents which is to meet on Thursday will look into the situation in any case and will see what grounds there are for holding the votes on Friday."
"I must also inform you that Mr Provan is to present a report to the Bureau on the internal reforms to be applied to the operation of Parliament and, of course, the organisation of the Friday sitting, which Mr Wiebenga has just been discussing, will be one of the areas under consideration."
"Having said that, if you wish to continue to discuss the matter, I see no objection to this."
"We shall hear your comments, presented as procedural motions."
"Madam President, on a point of order."
"I was simply making a protest about the electronics here."
"I was unable to receive interpretation, and I am sure that certain other Members were having difficulty with interpretation earlier."
"I think I was getting Swedish at one point and I could not hear Mr Blak at all."
"I just wanted to point that out."
"I think Mrs Banotti referred to it but as I could not hear her, because I was getting Swedish at the time, I do not really know what she said."
"Thank you, Mrs Ahern, we shall take steps to ensure that this does not happen again."
"Madam President, on a point of order."
"It is the same point, and for once I agree with Mrs Ahern."
"This must be a first!"
"Madam President, I should like to start where Mrs van der Laan left off."
"On the Friday of the last part-session, she announced that, from now on - for as long as there is still a sitting on a Friday - there will be a request on each occasion for a check on the quorum. This means that the group which made the request last time has itself made it plain that its only objective is destruction and not proper work."
"The Bureau cannot tolerate this because the plenary has decided - Mr Posselt referred to this - that sittings should be held on a Friday, and not even the Bureau can overrule this."
"We cannot allow a handful of people who, up until now, have seldom been present on a Friday, to make a mockery of us and blacken our public image."
"When a roll-call vote took place at 10 o' clock, hardly any of the 30 proponents were still here."
"We really cannot tolerate behaviour of this kind!"
"Madam President, I should like to respond to what my fellow Member has just said."
"I am among those who are in favour of the Friday sitting and who think it important to keep the sitting on that day, just like on the other days of the week."
"I should like to add that some of us who, quite rightly, requested that that quorum be checked so that the sittings could be conducted in due order, remained in attendance throughout the votes."
"It is inaccurate, therefore, to accuse Members of sabotage."
"There are Members in the Chamber who attend from Monday to Friday, and remain until the end of the sitting on Friday."
"Madam President, I could not agree more with the observations made by Mr Wiebenga."
"The least we can do is to carefully examine once more how we have filled Fridays."
"But I would add - also because a number of misconceptions have made their way into the media - that I am not one of those people who would like to solve the 'Strasbourg' discussion via the back door, but that I do belong to the group of people who want to examine, via a vote, whether we can hold a proper sitting in Strasbourg on a Friday, which also involves our French delegates."
"I wanted to highlight these two aspects."
"But that also means - and I must get this off my chest - that all those Members who criticised me last time because I had levelled criticism at them, must have left the Chamber before 12.00. (The last vote was held after 12.00.)"
"That was very hurtful because, unfortunately, the activists, comprising pro-Europeans from my own country and a large number of anti-Europeans, had left by the time the roll-call vote was held."
"Reference can be made to the last roll-call vote for this."
"Let us examine in a fair manner and through sound discussion how we can fill this part-session."
"Madam President, I have little to add after Mrs Oomen' s intervention."
"I only hope that you will understand this."
"The Dutch group which made Fridays a subject for discussion in this way did not do this because they are against Strasbourg or anything like that."
"They did so because time and again, there is heavy criticism, also in the Netherlands, regarding these Friday sittings and also because most of us prefer to work in our country on Fridays."
"This is because we already spend a great deal of our time in Brussels and Strasbourg as it is, and because we need the time to talk to our electorate."
"I think that a serious discussion about Fridays is urgently needed and this should not be confused with the discussion about Strasbourg."
"It is a discussion on the question of whether we organise our work efficiently and well and whether we have any time left to spend in our own constituencies."
"I support the action in this sense."
"As I said, there is scope for discussing this when we come to examine Mr Provan' s report."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I was among those who were present throughout Friday."
"It is easy to check up on, because electronic voting took place that day."
"In fact, there is no question of sabotage. Rather, it is a question of taking Parliament seriously enough to find it actually embarrassing that there are only 70 Members here when we vote on important matters such as school milk or Ethiopia."
"This has also given rise to quite a major debate in my own country, Sweden."
"We must get a serious discussion under way about these matters."
"Either we make Friday a proper working day or we do away with it."
"I will be very brief, Madam President. Moreover, I feel that this issue should be discussed in more detail, perhaps at a more convenient time."
"I subscribe to the view that Parliament should work on Fridays."
"Solutions can, in all probability, be found by putting debates rather than voting sessions on the agenda, for we are all aware that Fridays are convenient for interaction with the Commission and, therefore, important in terms of our political work in the area of our function as MEPs representing our home territories."
"When we discuss this issue, it would, however, be preferable for Members to refrain, when considering the action to be taken, from laying themselves open to misrepresentative publicity regarding the nature of Parliament' s function."
"There are certain types of action which give our countries and our electorate the impression that, in actual fact, the European Parliament spends its time fooling around and doing no work. The effect of these actions is therefore damaging, whatever the motive behind them."
"I therefore hope that we will be responsible enough to reach a point at which the debate can brought to a definitive conclusion without going down a path which none of us want to take and without laying ourselves open to criticism."
"As Mr Wiebenga said, and as I said myself, we are currently investigating the best solutions."
"Madam President, all I asked for is whether or not it is possible to put the request that we do not vote this coming Friday to the vote. After all, this is now the item on the agenda: determining the agenda for this plenary session."
"No, Mrs van der Laan, you ought to know that according to the Rules of Procedure, this is a request that should have been presented in due form and at the due time, and this was not the case."
"I cannot therefore put this request to the vote."
"It only remains for me to express the hope that there will be a good attendance this Friday, votes or not."
"I am counting on you all, if only for the benefit of the public that attends our debates."
"Agricultural prices"
"The next item is the report (A5-0115/2000) by Mrs Jeggle, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the Commission proposals relating to the prices for agricultural products (COM(2000) 77 - C5-0121/2000 to C5-0126/2000 - 2000/0045(CNS) to 2000/0050 (CNS))."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I hope that you had a wonderful weekend and that you were able to relax somewhere in Europe in our fantastically beautiful - and, above all, undamaged - agricultural landscape, which is responsibly and lovingly tended by our farmers."
"It is in this spirit of optimism that we can begin this debate on our report on the prices for agricultural products in 2000/2001."
"In the past, this report was always the subject of fierce debates on farm incomes."
"The decisions made under Agenda 2000 established many principles, not necessarily always for the best as far as agriculture is concerned."
"This Commission proposal, too, contains a series of points which will again lead to a reduction in farmers' incomes."
"In my report I make my opposition to this absolutely clear."
"The Commission is proposing to further reduce the additional charges on the intervention prices for cereals in two stages and then to fix them."
"The Commission' s proposal to reduce the monthly increments would mean another substantial deterioration in farm incomes."
"In this context, we also reject the Commission' s plan to make the intervention criteria stricter."
"If the minimum moisture content threshold were lowered this would reduce the compass of the intervention safety net and increase the proportion of the cereal crop which is, in principle, excluded from intervention."
"A third point - and here, judging by recent press releases, the Council appears to be coming round to the Agriculture Committee' s point of view - relates to Mrs Schreyer' s proposal to cut the agriculture budget by EUR 300 million per year in favour of the EU's foreign policy, despite the fact that additional money has still not been made available to remedy the extensive forest damage."
"At this stage I should like to state clearly once again that however important the EU's commitment to the Balkans is, the agriculture budget does not constitute an inexhaustible supply of funds which we can use to finance all our other desirable policies."
"The agriculture budget is neither a self-service shop nor a high-yielding dairy cow."
"Mrs Schreyer says that, of course, the EUR 300 million will not come out of direct support, but that is irrelevant because in the second pillar of agricultural policy too - that is, promoting the development of rural areas and stewardship of the countryside - each and every euro is necessary and well-spent."
"Our farmers are already experiencing uncertainty of a kind which ought to make us stop and think."
"Structural change is not, in itself, a bad thing; it is much more the consequence of a huge improvement in training and therefore in knowledge, skills and technology."
"But if an increasing number of farms are going out of business, farms which we have classified as viable from a political point of view, and if farmers are complaining about their workload, which is becoming unbearable, then something is wrong, and perhaps something is also wrong with our policy."
"It is our job to put in place tangible and enduringly reliable or - with your permission I will borrow a word from our definition of modern land management - sustainable framework conditions and not to turn the screws - including the tiny ones - even further."
"After all, we have already tightened the large ones as far as they will go."
"We need to change fundamental aspects of our agriculture policy for the long term!"
"We need a new vision for our farmers which is forward-looking and geared towards future needs."
"At this point I should like to ask the Commission whether, and to what extent, it is prepared to accept the amendments we adopted unanimously in committee."
"I am obviously asking because there is the possibility of referring this back to the committee if the Commission is not prepared to take on board points which are important to Parliament."
"I refer in particular to the moisture content of cereals and the monthly increments."
"On the other hand, I recognise that the budget year begins on 1 July and that a referral back to the committee might mean that the Council would not be able to decide in time, which would again be disadvantageous for agriculture."
"That is what I want to prevent at all costs."
"I started the report by reminding you of the beauty of the European agricultural landscape."
"I should like to finish with the sentence: 'Food and drink hold body and soul together' ."
"Let us not forget this, even in our political considerations and decisions!"
"Madam President, a large contingent within the Committee on Budgets is of the opinion that, as far as next year' s agricultural prices are concerned, we should adhere to what was agreed in Berlin."
"Nothing more, nothing less."
"This is an achievement in itself in certain sectors of agriculture."
"In various European countries, large groups of farmers are in dire straits."
"At present, there is a great deal of suffering in silence."
"So far, it would seem that the agricultural budget was born under a lucky star."
"The euro-dollar rate impacts favourably on the budget, although certain figures are a cause of concern."
"There is nothing to say, however, that things will remain the same forever."
"Despite this, the Commission has made various proposals to benefit from the agricultural budget, if possible."
"Sometimes, these discussions focus on the sugar sector and other times they home in on other sectors of the agricultural budget."
"The Committee on Budgets is of the opinion that we must keep to what was agreed in the plenary a number of months ago, namely a situation in which the agricultural budget serves as a primary source of funding for external EU action should never arise."
"The budget will stick to this principle."
"Secondly, according to the Committee on Budgets, the European Commission should come up with proposals to reform the sugar sector without delay."
"If we start to discuss the budget for 2001 in structural terms in September or October of this year, then it is essential to know what the Commission has in mind for the sugar sector."
"Am I not right in thinking that sugar fell outside the scope of the Berlin agreements?"
"And in order to evaluate the 2001 budget effectively, we need to know this."
"I hope that Commissioner Fischler will be able to tell us this afternoon when he intends to produce reform proposals for sugar."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when our farmers read in the press that we in the European Parliament are debating agricultural prices for the 2000/2001 financial year, many will certainly cherish the hope that we might just be considering a few price increases."
"But that is not the case!"
"In fact, we are discussing the proposals which the Commission has tabled following the Agenda 2000 reforms."
"May I, at this stage, specifically thank the rapporteur, Mrs Jeggle, for her work."
"Hitherto, people have regarded it as a routine annual exercise when we have had to debate prices for agricultural products."
"Year after year, blows were exchanged and, in that respect, I now welcome the fact that the fixed multiannual price proposals really can give farmers a rather more reliable framework in which to plan their production."
"However, I should like to warn you that, with this system, the annual review by the Council, the Commission and Parliament might not perhaps receive the attention which it deserves."
"The market situation, the outlook in the individual sectors and the trends in farm incomes as well as employment should continue to be examined by the European institutions on an annual basis."
"The proposals on setting institutional prices and monthly increments cover the products already mentioned."
"Most prices were fixed under Agenda 2000, but the Commission is proposing to cut the monthly increments for cereals by 7.5%."
"I should like to fully support the rapporteur' s stance in this regard."
"In our group' s view, the reduction in the monthly increments for cereals cannot be supported, not least because the Commission' s proposal undermines the Berlin decisions on Agenda 2000."
"We should not continue to exert pointless pressure on farmers' incomes."
"I now turn to a topical issue, Commissioner Fischler, which is of interest to me. During the last plenary part-session, we once again discussed with Mrs Schreyer whether this EUR 300 million for reconstruction aid in Kosovo for 2001/2002 really could be taken out of the agriculture budget."
"I am familiar with the argument that we would save this amount because of the exchange rate mechanism."
"This was also reiterated when we were discussing the organisation of the market in sugar."
"But have I deduced correctly from the press that, at the beginning of last week, the Council in any case rejected this Commission proposal?"
"I interpreted the press report as meaning that it did not support this, and I would be grateful to have the answer from your point of view, otherwise we will provoke a discussion here and debate the reality afterwards."
"Personally, I was extremely pleased at least by this admission from the Council at this stage."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no longer much point in discussing the package of agricultural prices since the 1992 CAP stipulated the gradual transition from a production price support system to a direct aid system, increasingly required to be dissociated from the production volumes."
"And as Agenda 2000 adopted and extended this approach, the establishment of agricultural prices is henceforth multiannual."
"While, however, it must still be possible to make annual adjustments, they must nonetheless comply, for the most part, with the commitments made in Berlin covering this period."
"This leads me, together with my colleagues on the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, to refuse to endorse the Commission' s proposal to reduce the monthly increments for cereals in two phases, by 7.5% each time."
"The same applies to moisture content in cereals."
"The Berlin agreement must continue to be our benchmark."
"This is the principled position that the European Union adopted in Seattle with regard to its trading partners and competitors within the World Trade Organisation."
"Logically, then, it should also set the standard in our debates on internal CAP matters."
"In particular, the European Union must fulfil its commitments in order to enable European farmers to have a clear idea of the policy as it affects them, in order to be able to manage their farms as wisely as possible."
"I therefore think it imperative to lift the veil from this notion of making the agricultural sector pay for Kosovo."
"In this connection, then, I would urge the Commission to provide us very quickly with its proposed reform of the COM in sugar."
"Mr President, the opinion of the Committee on Budgets and that of the Liberal Group more or less coincide."
"This is purely accidental."
"I will therefore not repeat what I said in the first two minutes."
"All these points which I mentioned are also backed by the Liberal Group."
"I would like to add a few more points, however."
"We are living in an era in which the agricultural budget is extremely tight."
"The slightest movement in the dollar and euro rates would get us into great difficulty."
"This being the case, the Commission will have to make a choice as to what to do with the money that is available."
"Potentially, however, there is another very large gap."
"Over the past few years, we have been faced with outbreaks of epidemics of infectious animal diseases."
"We had the BSE crisis in Europe and several European countries suffered from swine fever outbreaks."
"These combined outbreaks have cost the European budget billions."
"It has so far been possible to finance them from categories other than the agricultural budget."
"It was agreed in Berlin that this can no longer be the case."
"If I am not mistaken, the agricultural budget only comprises one item of approximately EUR 100 million for the control of animal diseases."
"This is peanuts compared to what was needed in the past to control outbreaks of infectious diseases."
"This is why the Liberal Group is expressly asking the Commission to produce proposals as soon as possible for coping with any disasters."
"One of the options is possibly to set up an insurance system throughout Europe, which would also promote fair competition."
"In anticipation of the budgetary discussions in September, we would like the Commission to provide us with the necessary data so that we can take this into consideration in the discussions of the budgets for the year 2001."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, adoption of the 2000/2001 agricultural price package involves a commitment to save EUR 300 million from the agriculture budget and to use the appropriations released for reconstruction work in Kosovo."
"In this context the report rightly points out that the Commission ought to submit a general document on this to Parliament, in the form of a concrete plan, before further austerity proposals can be accepted."
"Without a doubt, the issue of funding the whole reform package plays a decisive role."
"What I do not find satisfactory in this process, however, is the fact that we always speak first of reducing expenditure and revenue while at the same time transferring ever more tasks to the Commission, which, of course, does not reduce costs either."
"Up until 2006 the Commission should work on the basis of the realistic targets set and should deduce its financial needs from them."
"As a result of Agenda 2000, European farmers had to accept a EUR 5 billion reduction in their income."
"This meant that the agriculture budget was fixed at EUR 50.5 billion and it should stay as such."
"To achieve its objectives, the Commission should, in my view, be invited to present a report showing how costs have changed in the agricultural sector."
"Today, more deals are concluded in a second than used to be in an entire day and change is the only constant."
"Agricultural prices change particularly quickly."
"In the EU in 1999, the prices of crop products fell by 4% and livestock products by 6%."
"As a result of excessive over-production, pig prices fell by 9%."
"All the important agricultural products such as milk, beef, cereals and pork are suffering from increased turbulence on the world' s foreign exchanges, reducing farmers' incomes still further."
"That is why we are still far from answering the question of how European Union farmers should make a living in the future."
"In the saturated marketplace, only products produced economically can be sold."
"The price reductions will destroy farmers' livelihoods in Europe and thus temporarily ease the pressure on the market."
"Following this structural change the agricultural holdings which have been able to survive will further increase their output and wield even greater power on the world market."
"Another price war will lead to a new round of market redistribution."
"Further developments will show whether the reform of the EU' s agricultural policy by means of Agenda 2000 is capable of achieving its overall aims or not."
"Mr President, notwithstanding the fact that Agenda 2000 has set the parameters governing agriculture for the period up to 2006, the annual price package is still very important."
"I agree fully with those who expressed their reservations today in relation to the Commission proposals on the cereals sector."
"I am very pleased to see Commissioner Fischler here to listen to this debate."
"To farmers the price received in the marketplace should represent the real value of their professional endeavours, rather than what they often perceive as social support for the products of their labour."
"While not in any way wishing to detract from the overall success of CAP reform, as agreed in Agenda 2000, and acknowledging that without income support farmers would not survive, I must, at the same time, confess to some unease about a situation in which the produce of the land, as produced by our farmers, has to be sold at below production costs."
"This happens in many instances."
"In this context the support for agriculture - it is substantial and I acknowledge that because it represents almost 50% of the entire budget - must be seen also as a subsidy to consumers."
"With the availability of employment outside agriculture and the advances made by the EU and Member States in reducing unemployment, there is now a serious threat to the sustainability of Europe's traditional family farm."
"In recent weeks we have heard much talk about a review of the agricultural budget which was agreed in Berlin only a few months ago."
"I get the feeling that those concerned only with book-keeping have absolutely no understanding of what is happening out there in the real world."
"I warn that unless we become more vigilant and show a greater understanding of the unique and irreplaceable role of farmers in society, future generations and parliamentarians will be forced to react to save agriculture."
"That is what we are now doing in our attempt to rectify the rural-urban imbalance which we have allowed to develop over a period of years."
"Remember: that it was not the people who created this major problem for society; it was a lack of vision on the part of politicians and planners."
"Let us take a fresh look at how better we can plan the long-term survival of agriculture as the profession responsible for food security and safety, taking account of the unique role of farmers as managers of the environment."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to congratulate Mrs Jeggle on the report that she has produced, on the work she has done and on having achieved the practically unanimous support of the Committee on Agriculture for her report."
"I would also like to congratulate the Commission on having included a multiannual element in the proposals."
"Nevertheless, although this is a little repetitive, I would like you to bear in mind and reconsider, with regard to cereals, both moisture content and the monthly price reviews, since they are issues which could cause us considerable harm."
"There is also another question, and I feel that harsh words are required: every time a problem arises in this European Union or in its political positions - positions which I do not question - we consider taking funds away from the agricultural budget."
"This issue is of serious concern to us, since the Commissioner for Budgets has repeated that she intends to take EUR 300 million away from sugar to send to Kosovo."
"There are also other matters which I would like to stress, which do not appear in the proposal on prices, such as my concern for the nut sector, hazelnuts and almonds, which is facing such great problems at the moment, since, in some cases, the improvement plans implemented by the Commission are coming to an end."
"Since its review is not finished, and until the problem of the nut industry is resolved, an extension of these improvement plans should be reconsidered, until its correct place is found, which should be the COM in fruits, where it will be treated in a genuinely differentiated fashion."
"Other issues of concern to me do not appear, such as the case of asparagus intended for processing."
"Article 10(3) of the Regulation on processed fruits and vegetables provides for lump sum aid."
"This aid is going to stop very soon; it comes to an end during this season."
"How does the Commission intend to ensure that, in Europe, this aid is used to promote competitiveness and continues to be given to asparagus producers?"
"With regard to table grapes, on 31 July aid expires for the production of juice, which is included in the COM in wine."
"In my opinion, it should be included in the next amendment of the COM in fruits."
"Once it has expired however, that is, from 31 July, what are we going to do, until the new reforms are approved, about the aid for table grape processing?"
"Will it be extended?"
"What is the intention here?"
"Regulation No 2275 also provides for aid for promotion in the flower and plant sector, and this aid is also coming to an end."
"How can this happen, given that the Council has asked the Commission to carry out a study on the evolution of the aid, in order to justify whether or not it should continue?"
"I believe that, while waiting for this study to be presented - and we still know nothing about it - and then for a reform to be proposed, Regulation No 2275 should perhaps be extended."
"Does this fit in with the Commission' s plans?"
"They are important sectors because they affect very specific areas."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Agenda 2000 has created a certain kind of stability for the European Agricultural Policy."
"I consider it a matter of great importance that we can have a clear and firm view of the future, at least until 2006."
"The departure from the Berlin Agreement - these sums are significant to agriculture, but extremely small on the level of the Community as a whole - the question in principle of departing from what has been agreed, is a very serious matter."
"It is necessary for this Parliament to make decisions on a new and ongoing agricultural policy after 2006."
"This kind of policy, which departs from what has been agreed upon, is not likely to create the stability and spirit that would enable us to share a common view of the future."
"One thing of which we seem oblivious, is the present everyday reality of agriculture."
"There has been a considerable rise in agricultural costs; fuel prices have gone up, and the level of costs in general is showing a constant upward trend."
"In addition to this, farmers as well as the food industry have invested a great deal in quality, in order to rid us of the scandals which have marred the European agricultural model."
"It is the farmers themselves who will ultimately have to pay these costs."
"The farmers for their part have carried out all their duties and obligations."
"We may only hope that the other party will also hold to those mutual agreements that have been made."
"Mr President, in its proposals to the Council of Ministers, the Commission has not set out the prices of products and subsidies, as it falsely claims it has done; in our opinion, it simply wants to remind us of the prices and subsidies which will be in force for the period from 2000-2001 in accordance with existing regulations, and at the very most, to amend some monthly increments to the intervention prices of any products to which this system still applies."
"We should like to take this opportunity, however, to note that first: producer prices and subsidies have been frozen for numerous agricultural products for twelve consecutive years, as is the case with sheepmeat and goatmeat, whereas for other products they have been falling due to the constant increase in production costs, thereby reducing net agricultural incomes, as the Eurostat figures also show."
"The question therefore is: what are the farmers doing about this?"
"Secondly, eroding or even abolishing the intervention system will leave farmers at the mercy of traders, who buy from producers at derisory prices and then often resell at substantially higher prices."
"As a result, while nominal producer prices have fallen, often quite sharply, consumer prices have risen."
"In other words, both producers and consumers are being bled dry in the name of protection, which is what the European Union claims it is doing."
"The question is what will farmers and consumers do about this?"
"Will they step up their fight?"
"Thirdly, low quotas and the resultant extortionate fines are eating up the subsidies for the 1999 harvest."
"Thus the subsidies end up becoming a white elephant."
"A blatant example is that of oil, which also concerns my country, and in particular my native island of Lesbos."
"Despite declarations that the 1998-1999 subsidy would be GRD 460, producers were only paid GRD 330, one year later."
"The same applies to cotton where, although the minimum price is EUR 101 per 100 kilos, Greek producers will be paid less than EUR 65 because of the co-responsibility levy."
"We have the following comments to make on the issues addressed in the report: as regards cereals, we disagree with the reduction in the monthly increments of the intervention price, which should have been increased."
"Also, it must be said that this approach is further eroding the intervention system and, as with other products, it will apparently be abolished altogether for cereals."
"We also disagree with the monthly increment being paid in November, since harvest time in Greece is in June."
"And similarly with rice, we recommend that intervention commence on 1 October or November and not on 1 April because otherwise, our producers are at the mercy of greedy profiteering traders for six months...."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to support Mrs Jeggle' s report and the statements she has made by asking a few very simple questions."
"Commissioner, I think it is in your interest to use the support offered by the Members of the European Parliament in order to attempt to safeguard your budget for agriculture."
"When we see the way in which money is being used and diverted to finance other measures, we have good cause to wonder if we shall still have the resources to implement a European agricultural policy after enlargement, and moreover to ensure rural development."
"When you achieve savings on cereals through moisture rates, how many millions does that amount to throughout Europe?"
"And how are these millions going to be used?"
"Do not forget that it is the intermediate regions that will be the first to suffer the effects, not the good cereal-growing areas, the main cereal-growing areas, but rather the regions where there are average production levels, where many farmers are currently experiencing problems."
"Looking across the board at agricultural regions, I am forced to note that it is these small- and medium-sized farms whose continuity is not assured, where the farmers' children are looking for careers outside agriculture."
"I therefore think that this policy calls for caution, Commissioner."
"And you have our support."
"The agricultural budget must be used to promote rural development and to step up support to the family-type farms that exist at grass-roots level, rather than containing only budget measures whose sole purpose is to make savings."
"Commissioner, we are counting on you a great deal."
"We are speaking from the bottom of our hearts. Within Parliament we are aiming to defend the family farm."
"- (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Jeggle, on her work, and say that, in fact, this price package is no longer as important as it has been in the past, since, fortunately, it has started to turn into the presentation and definition of agricultural policy in the medium term."
"This is why, only recently, we carried out a reform of Agenda 2000: these price packages tend merely to make annual adjustments in response to one-off situations."
"The current price package comes at a time when the Commission has promised to present proposals for reform in various sectors over the current year, specifically the rice, sugar, fruit, vegetable and oil sectors. I hope that these reforms do take place."
"There is one particular situation that I would like to highlight, which concerns the issue of fruit and vegetables and which is of particular importance to my country."
"We are all aware of the iniquity of the present regulations of the policy on processed tomatoes."
"Changes to quotas are made between Member States, and this happens every year within a framework which does not take account of unforeseen changes in the climate or the market, and this creates a permanent state of instability in the sector."
"A short while ago, therefore, following Mrs González' report, the European Parliament approved the urgent establishment of guarantee thresholds at Member State level and the Commission was asked to present these proposals as a matter of urgency."
"However, in the price package, the Commission has not presented anything in this regard to remedy the situation, and the Commission does not appear to be in any hurry to put forward a proposal either."
"My country is likely to lose 10% of its quota if the COM proposal is not adopted quickly, and this, quite frankly, is unacceptable."
"So the question is, why has the Portuguese Presidency not adopted initiatives to ensure that a proposal would be put forward with due haste? And why do they use the argument that ""the tomato industry cannot be reformed because there is no money"" when we spend the money we have on things other than agriculture, such as the financing provided for Kosovo?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to thank you, Mrs Jeggle, very much for your report."
"After all, it is the first which you have tabled in the House."
"I should also like very much to thank the Members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the other committees, which have actively participated in the consultations, for their constructive cooperation."
"I am pleased that Parliament agrees with the main thrust of the Commission's proposals, namely that we need more continuity and that prices therefore need to be fixed on a multiannual basis."
"With your permission, I will first comment on the background to, and the content of, the proposals which we have made."
"It is absolutely right - as has been stated here - that the price package is no longer as significant as it was in the past."
"As a logical consequence of the multiannual approach which we chose for Agenda 2000, the Commission has now also proposed to set the institutional prices and amounts for those sectors for which this is actually still necessary for an unlimited period of time."
"This offers our farmers a considerably more stable framework for their longer-term planning, although we do not, in principle, rule out making any changes which may later prove to be necessary."
"The only exception to this multiannual approach in our proposals concerns the sugar sector, where the production quota regime currently in force - as most of you here probably know - will expire in the 2000/2001 financial year."
"That is why it would not have been appropriate - given that this final year has to be fixed now first - to introduce a change here."
"That is why we are also proposing that the current prices for sugar be kept for this final year of the production quota regime now in force."
"I shall now turn to the individual amendments put forward. Amendment No 4 seeks to leave the monthly increments unchanged."
"I cannot, to be quite frank, agree to this proposal, because you are wrong to claim that the reduction which we have proposed contravenes the decisions made in Berlin."
"On the contrary, this is the logical consequence of the decisions made in Berlin!"
"You see, in Berlin it was decided to maintain the system of monthly increments."
"But that has nothing to do with adjustments to the amounts."
"In the past, too, we made adjustments- more or less - every year."
"On the other hand, I should also like, as it were, to warn you against believing that it would not be sensible to make this adjustment, because you have to bear one thing in mind: if the amounts are not adjusted and this leads to market supply being disrupted and to cereals being held back in the hope of higher carryovers, then farmers will lose more in the spring when they market their products than they would gain through these higher monthly increments."
"That is why I cannot accept this proposal."
"The second issue, which involves updating and tightening up the quality criteria, has, of course, been under discussion for months now."
"In the meantime, since we are, after all, dealing here with an area where the Commission has exclusive competence - I should also like to emphasise this - a vote has been held in the relevant Management Committee."
"That actually puts an end to the debate because, as of 19 April, Commission Regulation (EC) No 824/2000 was enacted."
"I do not think that we should reopen this debate now."
"That is why I cannot agree to Amendments Nos 2 or 5."
"Since the issue of moisture content has been raised here today, I should like to point out that the price of cereals might have been fixed in Berlin, but not the price of water! 14.5% is the maximum moisture content which traders customarily accept nowadays."
"It does not present a particular problem to farmers."
"After all, if a farmer does have bad luck and has rather higher moisture levels in his cereal crop, then all he needs to do is to pay the drying costs and the problem is solved!"
"But we can no longer accept the idea of having grain in intervention storage which does not comply with usual international trade practices."
"Unfortunately, I also have a problem with including mustard seed in the support system, as you propose in Amendments Nos 1 and 3, because that would be contrary to the Marrakech Agreement."
"It would run counter to the peace clause which states that no new products may be incorporated into the support system."
"I now come to Amendments Nos 6 and 7. Some clarification is probably called for here."
"Firstly, the funding of foreign policy measures for the 2000/2001 financial year, which is what we are discussing here, is not in any way linked to the setting of sugar prices."
"Secondly, the proposed reduction in the ceiling under heading 1a for the year 2002 does not prejudice the measures in any particular production sector either."
"Thirdly, Mrs Jeggle also addressed the situation in 2003 and subsequent years. Here, the Commission has decided that appropriations are only to be withdrawn once the political situation in Serbia has changed dramatically."
"If this is the case, the Commission will decide when it reviews the financial perspective in 2002 - as it decided to do in Berlin - how to meet any possible needs."
"At this stage, the Commission has specifically decided not to prejudice anything here either."
"In addition, the Commission has decided that, as a general rule, funds can only be taken from heading 1a if sufficient funds are not available from other sources, and at the moment it is far from certain that this will be the case."
"Mrs Jeggle, you proposed that we should at least utilise the appropriations in 1b - i.e. those for rural development - and you linked this to the disastrous storms in Badem-Württemberg in which many trees were uprooted by the strong winds."
"This is a much more complex problem because here the Commission had originally intended to make it possible precisely to transfer funds between the two sub-headings."
"However, this was rejected by Parliament."
"That is why a transfer of this kind is not possible on the basis of the Financial Regulation currently in force and the Interinstitutional Agreement."
"I now come to the question which Mrs Keppelhoff asked concerning what ECOFIN actually did decide. Well, the proposals which Mrs Schreyer circulated to ECOFIN were rejected for the time being."
"At the moment, however, we are, of course, still in the discussion phase; the actual budget debate on the 2001 budget is yet to take place."
"The rejection does not primarily or exclusively concern this issue of the 300 million; the proposals as a whole were given a negative reception by ECOFIN."
"Amendment No 8, to which Mr Mulder, in particular, referred, concerns a study on alternative ways of covering financial losses arising in the event of outbreaks of animal diseases."
"The study which Mr Mulder mentioned was also intended to examine the possibility of introducing a compulsory insurance scheme."
"We will commission a study of this kind."
"However, I have to tell you that the results will not be available until the end of the year."
"We will not obtain the results from those carrying out the study any earlier than that."
"I also share the view expressed in the amendment that producers ought to take on more of the financial responsibility for eradicating animal diseases."
"However, in principle, it is the Member States who are responsible for this issue."
"That is why initially all we can do here is carry out an evaluation of the possible ways in which we at Community level might support the Member States in setting up schemes of this kind."
"In any case, this issue ought to be dealt with in the context of the review of veterinary legislation which is currently being carried out by the Directorate-General responsible for public and animal health."
"Mrs Redondo asked a number of questions about the organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables, about nuts and about ornamental plants, and Mr Cunha asked about processed tomatoes."
"As planned, the Commission will submit a report on the functioning of the organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables before the end of this year."
"This report will not only cover fresh fruit and vegetables but also processed fruit and vegetables, and therefore processed tomatoes."
"We expect this report to be ready at the beginning of the second half of this year."
"As far as promoting ornamental plants is concerned - or to be more precise, Mrs Redondo, publicity for the ornamental plants sector - it is true that the Commission is carrying out a review here."
"In fact, we made this a requirement when the legal arrangements were introduced and, depending on the outcome of the assessment, we will table a proposal in sufficient time to ensure that there is no interruption in the publicity campaign."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Flax and hemp for fibre"
"The next item is the report (A5-0124/2000) by Mrs Schierhuber, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1251/1999 establishing a support system for producers of certain arable crops to include flax and hemp grown for fibre [COM(1999) 576 - C5-0280/1999 - 1999/0236(CNS)] and on the proposal for a Council regulation on the common organisation of the market in flax and hemp grown for fibre [COM(1999) 576 - C5-0281/1999 - 1999/0237(CNS)]."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at first sight the importance of the flax and hemp sector may perhaps not be obvious, particularly to those colleagues who work less frequently on agricultural matters."
"Flax and hemp are crops with a very rich tradition in Europe, whose popularity has nevertheless declined over the years and whose versatility is only now being rediscovered."
"It is precisely the possibilities which this branch of agriculture offers of developing products with a promising future which we need to support at European level."
"Insulation for houses, filling materials for vehicle bodywork and presses for furniture manufacture are just some of the examples of this modern technology."
"The production of these materials from renewable raw materials should offer a real alternative to synthetically-produced ones and, at the same time, provide a new and attractive source of income for farmers as suppliers of those raw materials."
"The need for reform is justified, above all, by misuses of funds and subsidy fraud in recent years."
"I am firmly opposed to this subsidy hunting and strict controls are necessary to ensure compliance with legal provisions."
"All the same, in my opinion, the Commission proposals overshoot the mark a little."
"Allow me briefly to outline the basic considerations underlying my report. Area payments should be set at EUR 126/t - or EUR 600/ha - and should only be disbursed if proof of delivery to the processor is furnished."
"The area payments are being established under the regulation on the support system for producers of arable crops and, for this reason, this regulation also needs to be adjusted to take account of the specific characteristics of flax and hemp."
"It goes without saying that the regional base areas envisaged in this regulation need to be expanded to incorporate the areas for flax and hemp."
"Since flax and hemp are mainly grown for non-food purposes and no surpluses are produced, there should be no set-aside obligation, because set-aside serves as an instrument to regulate markets where surpluses are possible."
"The processing aid which is to be paid out to the primary processor will only be granted if proof can be provided that processing has taken place within the last 18 months."
"Since this aid is supposed to take account of the economic viability of the sector, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development proposes setting this at EUR 120/t for long flax fibre and EUR 70/t for short flax fibre and hemp."
"Of course, it is not only the premium for long fibres, but also that for short fibres which needs to be secured as a long-term measure because it is precisely short fibres which are of prime importance for innovative projects."
"Commissioner, the national maximum quantities and the maximum quantity for the EU, which the Commission is proposing, need to be reconsidered."
"The maximum quantities for each Member State should be calculated on the basis of existing processing capacities and adjusted to take account of planned processing capacities for which irreversible investments have already been made."
"Allow me to make one further comment on hemp because there is still some misunderstanding here. There is no risk of drugs being cultivated in Europe and the use of hempseed for nutritional purposes is deeply rooted in certain regions."
"The existing control mechanisms and limits are sufficient, in my view, to prevent hemp from being cultivated for the production of psychotropic substances."
"Specialities have developed in the individual regions - such as hempseed oil and hemp beer - which help to enrich regional identity through the food chain."
"Mr President, I should once more like to point out that a reform, which is admittedly necessary, of the flax and hemp sector, which, on account of its multi-functionality, is so important for the future of European agriculture and for the future of farmers as suppliers of raw materials for new spheres, must not be allowed to render the entire sector unprofitable."
"The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development adopted this report by a large majority."
"That is why I should like to extend my warmest thanks to all those who supported me when I was drawing up this report."
"Mr President, according to Mrs Schierhuber' s present report, if something goes wrong with a certain regulation in Europe, in this case flax, it is quite possible to ensure that that regulation can remain intact by means of new proposals."
"Flax, like hemp, is a special product, with a long European tradition."
"The mere fact that both my trousers and jacket are made of linen and flax which is processed in Flanders and partly in Zeeland, and grown in France, bears out this product' s long-standing tradition."
"The reason we are having to hold this debate is to do with the fact that the regulation has gone off the rails."
"We all know what happened to short flax."
"We also know that that derailment occurred in Southern Europe and we need to be prepared to adapt the policy."
"But what is now happening with the Commission' s proposal is tantamount to throwing out the baby with the bathwater."
"People have overstepped the mark."
"At the same time, it is quite possible to tighten the flax and hemp regulations so that we can manage on a normal budget such as the one we have had over the past couple of years and, despite this, continue to grow flax and hemp in Europe at a profit."
"I am saying this because, although the cultivation of flax and hemp is traditional, they are also used in special applications in linen for clothing and in other applications in the non-food sector. I am thinking of dashboards and bumpers for cars."
"At the same time, they form a true complement to agricultural policy. They are special products which offer a great deal of added value and employment."
"It is exactly because of these three facets that we have to be so much more careful about drafting a sound regulation."
"This is why I give my full backing to Mrs Schierhuber' s report."
"The amounts which have been mentioned guarantee that cultivation remains profitable and also ensure sound processing."
"What we need is tighter control on processing to ensure that malpractices are prevented in future."
"I would like to end on a historical note."
"My country suffered an eighty-year war at the hands of Spain, which was eventually settled with the Peace of Münster."
"The people who met round the table came from the southern Netherlands - Belgium as it is known today, - the northern Netherlands - the Netherlands as we know it today - and Spain, and all three wore linen jackets, most probably made in Flanders, the linen being grown in Northern France and Belgium."
"An eighty-year conflict failed to destroy the cultivation of flax along the North Sea coast."
"Surely, we cannot afford to let the current regulation go under on account of a minor derailment in Spain which has meanwhile been rectified and which has led to crops being cultivated there over an area reduced to 50 000 hectares."
"I would like a new flax regulation for Europe to reflect this historical awareness that was achieved with the Peace of Münster."
"Mr President, we agree with the objectives pursued in the Commission' s proposal on the new regulation on flax and hemp: to regulate and balance the markets, simplify the common agricultural policy and prevent fraud."
"However, we do not agree with the chosen method."
"This is because we consider that this proposal, since the amendments improving it, which were presented by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, have not been accepted, may lead to the total disappearance of hemp and flax crops in small- and medium-sized holdings, and as an alternative crop in certain areas of the Union."
"We believe, Commissioner, that it is unacceptable that, in order to put an end to fraud, we should seek to end cultivation within a certain sector."
"This is a good time to point out that the best way to combat fraud is through the total transparency of public aid and of the investigations into fraud that are under way, and publishing the names of fraudsters, as the only way of preventing all farmers and the whole of the sector from having to pay for the consequences of fraud on the part of a few speculators."
"The inclusion of flax and hemp within the general regulations on herbaceous plants requires the establishment of a single yield for all areas of the European Union."
"The existence of different yields in northern and southern areas, in the different regions of the Union, may lead to real discrimination in payments per surface area with regard to this crop."
"Therefore, we request that the inclusion of an average yield be accepted for all regions of the Union, and that this be the average yield for cereals."
"With regard to aid for processing, we feel that it is completely inappropriate that there should be transitional aid for the processing of short-fibre flax, as the Commission proposes, which would end in 2006."
"We believe that it should be long-term aid and that it should be brought into line with the aid for the processing of long-fibre flax, which is the only way of guaranteeing the commercial production of short-fibre flax in an industrial sector which provides a genuine alternative to synthetic products."
"Commissioner, we are in complete agreement on the need for stabilisers with regard to this crop, but we completely disagree with the national guaranteed quantities established in the Commission' s proposal, since we feel that they are absolutely inadequate and represent quite the opposite of the actual situation in each of the countries."
"We therefore also ask you to consider the proposal presented by the Committee on Agriculture."
"Lastly, we absolutely agree with the existence of controls in this sector."
"Therefore, the existence, in every single case, of the sales contract between the farmer and the processor, seems to us to be essential."
"We are therefore voting against the report with regard to the disappearance of these contracts."
"The existence of a contract is the best way of proving that the crop has been sold and processed."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Schierhuber, for this report, not least because it takes into consideration processing in those countries in particular, which, as Members of the EU, have also taken up the cultivation of flax."
"It is quite natural that they have considered the market and consequently also the support for and emphasis on processing to be matters of paramount importance, particularly in the case of short-fibre flax, which can be used for buildings and as insulation."
"I would also like to say I agree with the previous speaker, Mrs Rodríguez Ramos, regarding average yields."
"The average yields of flax and hemp are very similar across Europe, in the North as well as the South."
"There are no great differences between them."
"As far as cereals are concerned, however, the differences are considerable."
"Such being the case, it would be unreasonable if the fringe areas - i.e. the areas around the Mediterranean and the North - were to be placed in an unequal position with regard to aid payable on the basis of area in the case of hemp and flax, which represents such small-scale production in the context of agricultural production as a whole."
"Amendment No 38 is therefore particularly sensible;"
"I endorse it and hope that it will receive wide support, expressly in order to prevent the Mediterranean and Nordic countries from being placed in a position of disadvantage in comparison with the central regions of the European Union, as far as this area of production is concerned."
"Mr President, I am pleased to have this opportunity to address Parliament on this very important issue."
"The main thing to stress is that misuse of funds in one place should not prevent innovation continuing in other areas."
"Excellent schemes are already being developed and should be supported."
"In an unstable agricultural industry, the opportunities offered by flax and hemp in a developing market for natural fibres should not be lost."
"It will provide farmers with the opportunity to diversify - something that they have continually been urged to do by respective Member State governments and by the European Parliament - to produce new employment possibilities."
"In my own nation, Wales, flax processing plants are already being established using European Union aid."
"The report from our Agricultural Committee also includes amendments to extend grant aid for producing flax and hemp to non-arable land, thus providing opportunities to diversify areas of the European Union unable to obtain monetary support under the present regime."
"This is a crucial matter as it affects thousands of hectares of European land with low productive possibilities."
"For example, 80% of the land mass of my nation, Wales, is non-arable."
"The higher than average incidence of rainfall there makes it ideal terrain for growing short-fibre flax and yet it could not apply for European Union support under prior regulations."
"Its peripheral location, something which has already been stressed here from other areas, and its small family farm units having to compete in a wider market, coupled with the high value of sterling, has meant that it has lost 80% of its income in less than three years."
"The importance of flax production being subsidised in such areas of the European Union cannot be overemphasised."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur for accepting our amendments in this regard."
"We also reject quotas and a ceiling for this production, as this would limit the possibilities to develop diversification and employment possibilities in disadvantaged regions."
"We also believe there should be a balance of support between farmers and processors."
"The rapporteur, Mrs Schierhuber, has agreed to put a limit of EUR 600 per hectare to farmers directly, provided that the farmer proves to the competent authorities, within 18 months after having applied for the subsidy, that he has delivered the fibre to a processor."
"We also agreed if this proof could not be provided to the competent authorities within that period, the subsidy should stay at the level of the premia for set-aside land."
"I congratulate the rapporteur and call on the European Parliament to support the Agriculture Committee's report."
"Mr President, first and foremost I would like to thank Mrs Schierhuber for the work she has done, the main merit of which is the fact that it introduces some sensible elements into a proposal which makes no sense whatsoever."
"It is true that the regulation in force is deficient in terms of control, and some people have taken advantage of these deficiencies in order to obtain aid which stretches the bounds of legality."
"These situations obviously required modifications which logically should have concentrated on strengthening controls."
"Nevertheless, we have seen another example of the unique way in which the Commission fulfils its function of producing legislative proposals."
"The Commission' s proposal takes an extraordinary approach: instead of strengthening the control mechanisms, it abolishes aid for short-fibre flax."
"To be honest, the Commission is behaving here like the doctor who proposes decapitation as a cure for a headache."
"Furthermore, the Commission' s proposal, if put into practice, would lead to the disappearance of the crop in some Member States, which would have a negative affect on many farmers who had found an alternative crop which did not produce surpluses and which was destined for non-food use."
"In Spain, for example, practically all flax grown is short-fibre flax, since the heat and the lack of rainfall restrict the growth of the plant."
"Furthermore, the dryness of the ground in summer makes it practically impossible to pull up the plant together with its roots in order to obtain long fibre."
"Furthermore, short-fibre flax is perfectly suited to dry conditions, there is a certain market for it and, at least in theory, it is the type of production which we are intending to promote."
"The elimination of aid for short-fibre flax would hinder the innovative non-food use of agricultural products, fundamentally affecting regions with low rainfall and more difficult conditions."
"The Commission is therefore proposing to concentrate aid in the areas with the best conditions and deny it to the least-favoured ones."
"I would like to remind the Commission of Article 158 (ex Article 130A) of the Treaty, which lays down that social and economic cohesion must be strengthened, and the differences in levels of development between the different regions and the underdevelopment of the least-favoured regions, including the rural areas, should be reduced."
"Lastly, I think it is essential that the Commission' s proposals are not accepted; however, in any event, the inclusion in the regulations on herbaceous crops would lead to unfair situations as a result of the use of yields conditioned by drought."
"Mrs Rodríguez Ramos' amendments therefore seem to me to be a good solution to the problem."
"Mr President, over the past couple of years, we have seen a sharp increase in the acreage of fibre flax and hemp as a result of subsidy-hunting in Member States such as Great Britain and Spain."
"Producers in those countries destroyed their harvest, whilst they pocketed the subsidies for the crops."
"It is only right that the Council clamped down on this type of misuse of Community funding by amending the flax regulation."
"The original objective of production support was to bolster the traditional fibre flax crops which are mainly grown in Belgium, France and the Netherlands."
"It is vital not to lose sight of this objective."
"We therefore reject the proposal that the Committee on Budgets outlined in its opinion, namely to pitch the support granted to short- and long-fibre flax at the same level."
"The production costs for long-fibre flax are higher than those for short-fibre flax and for hemp."
"It is precisely with the short-fibre variant that farmers fiddled the system."
"We can go along with the proposal to bring the cultivation of flax under the general support regulation for arable crops."
"But the cereal support level is too low for long-fibre flax and therefore acts as a disincentive to producers to grow this flax variant."
"This is why we have made our approval of this report dependent upon whether the support level for producers of long-fibre flax will be double that for cereal."
"As long as support for processors continues to be varied according to whether the crop concerned is short- or long-fibre, we can do away with this differentiation in the support for producers."
"Firstly, a compulsory contract with processors who, in turn, must prove that the flax has been processed. Secondly, a certain quota per Member State, shared between long-fibre and short-fibre flax and hemp."
"Finally, I would point out that, as it is late in the season, this regulation will not be able to come into force until the 2000-2001 season."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we are discussing a Commission proposal on the reform of the COM on flax and hemp in two respects."
"Firstly, the Commission is explaining the need for the reform in terms of an increase in budgetary cost."
"I do not believe that that is the best way to try to justify the need for a reform, although I agree that it is needed."
"Amongst the objectives which this reform should have, as well as simplifying and updating the regulations, is also improving control, which is something we always forget about later on."
"The Commission proposal offers a good, coherent and precise analysis of the sector in the European Union."
"It explains the importance of flax and hemp production from both an economic and an ecological point of view."
"However, it seems to me that the Commission' s considerations with regard to hemp fibre and short-fibre flax are not very realistic, either as regards its future viability or its range of uses."
"However, the thing that seems least appropriate to me is the proposal on processing aid."
"In this case I would like to draw your attention to the increasing number of uses for this type of fibre, as several speakers have already pointed out."
"If we were to follow that route, the European Union, which already falls short in terms of using this type of fibre, would cease to use it altogether, at least in some countries."
"Today I read in one of my country' s newspapers that one of the autonomous regions has abandoned more than 95% of its cultivation of short-fibre flax."
"These were the words of the local Minister for Agriculture for that region."
"This type of situation will become inevitable if this amendment is put into practice."
"With regard to payment for processing, I cannot agree with the Commission' s proposal, either in terms of the distinction between short- and long-fibre flax or its proposals for hemp."
"It appears to me that they have not made any precise calculation to justify the different amounts for the premiums."
"Neither does there appear to be any precise calculation to justify the maximum guaranteed quantities, either at European level or on the different national levels."
"Consequently, these quantities are going to hinder development in the European Union with regard to short- and long-fibre flax and hemp."
"In addition, it also seems to me to be problematic to apply these regulations during this, the 2000-2001 season, since we are already at a late stage."
"I believe that Mrs Schierhuber' s proposal is a balanced one."
"It has been approved by a majority in the Committee on Agriculture and we should adopt it as a basic regulation."
"Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteur for her handling of what is a very complex matter where both producing and non-producing Member States have serious reservations regarding the Commission proposals."
"In very broad terms, I welcome the Commission proposal to bring flax and hemp into the arable area payments scheme."
"A single area payment is in line with the view that growers should respond to market demands rather than be driven by CAP subsidies."
"However, I shall not repeat the many reservations about the proposals that colleagues have already mentioned."
"We should note that flax and hemp are environmentally-friendly crops."
"Compared with mainstream crops such as oil seeds and cereals, they require low levels of chemical and fertiliser treatment."
"They also produce renewable raw materials that can displace synthetic fibres derived from petroleum and other mineral resources."
"We should welcome, therefore, the expansion of industrial crop activity and the opportunities provided for diversification."
"However, I wish to raise the question of land eligibility, which appears to be a particular problem in the UK."
"Most of the flax and hemp grown in the UK is on land ineligible for arable area payments."
"The Commission proposals, as I understand them, threaten the UK growers and would leave UK processors with no domestic supply of raw material."
"It has been suggested that the land eligibility rules should be disregarded for flax and hemp so that any land could be used for those crops, but without an increase in the base area."
"This would allow expansion, should market conditions encourage growth, and allow new growers to enter the market."
"It would be helpful if the Commissioner could comment on this matter when he responds to the debate."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Schierhuber."
"I have a feeling that this type of subject matter is right up her street."
"I can only say that I agree with the thrust of her report."
"I think it is indeed time that the Commission intervened in a support regulation for flax and hemp."
"Large-scale fraud, misuse and so forth can only give agricultural policy a bad name, and this must be avoided."
"That is why the Commission was right to intervene."
"At this stage, however, there is another reason why the Commission would do well to devote special attention to this subject matter, as I am still of the opinion that it is necessary to develop agricultural crops other than the traditional crops grown at present."
"Flax and hemp are typical crops which could help us find new markets for new agricultural products."
"'Agrificatie' (agrification) is the correct Dutch term for this and I will have a look in due course to see how this has been translated in the different languages."
"Encouraging initiatives have been taken in this field and large investments have been made in various countries."
"In my opinion, the Commission should, more than anything, ensure that investments already made in factories and processing materials are used to the best effect."
"I am thus not persuaded that it is absolutely vital to tie certain quotas to certain countries."
"Instead, they should be tied to certain user capacities."
"There is one aspect, however, not covered by the regulation, which works out quite well for Commissioner Fischler, namely that it will not cost him a penny."
"Could he not consider making the use of these products made from flax or hemp compulsory?"
"It could be laid down in the law, in the interest of the environment, that dashboards for cars should be made of such and such products."
"Maybe this could culminate in excellent relations with the Environment Commissioner, because I have the impression that she has a habit of hampering agriculture in other areas of the environment."
"Perhaps this initiative could help us to turn the corner."
"Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, the Commission appears to have made a sound proposal, but in actual fact, this is not a sound proposal."
"It may possibly prevent fraud because there is no longer an incentive for farmers to pocket the higher flax premium instead of set-aside or cereals premiums."
"The only problem is that if you cut the flax premium to the level of the cereals premium and the set-aside premium, then no more flax or hemp will be cultivated in the EU and that will be that."
"But if you introduce processing aid, where, in your view, fraud cannot be committed - and incidentally it can actually, but let us assume for now that it cannot - then the result might be that the raw material is grown outside the EU and imported."
"If we want to ensure that flax is cultivated here, then we need to do precisely what we have proposed here, what the rapporteur has proposed, namely to go back to the level of the cereals premium."
"When proof is then furnished that processing has taken place the amount is doubled, and this proof will not require very many checks because it has to be provided by those who wish to have this premium."
"I should like to make the following comment on the maximum quantities: the fact that the budget has expanded because of fraud - and here the Commission has not distinguished itself in terms of controls - is not something of which we can approve."
"Obviously, we have to push back the tide of fraud and the money which has been lost because of fraud needs, of course, to be traced. But the overall budget for this important, environmentally-friendly crop needs to be increased, and that is why the quotas which are now being laid down are inappropriate."
"Mr Fischler, I am curious to hear whether you are going to accept the proposals made by the rapporteur - and I should like to thank her for her report."
"You know what procedure this is."
"If you say that you cannot accept them, we will react tomorrow and then we will have to negotiate this sound proposal from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development at another level."
"Mr President, the aid scheme for flax and hemp has turned into pure subsidy-hunting."
"It is almost criminal how grossly the scheme has been misused, and we must put a stop to this."
"For a number of years, aid for hemp has been much higher than that for other crops."
"Per-hectare aid for hemp is more than twice as high as that for cereals."
"This means that, even though there are almost no legal uses for hemp, the area used for hemp cultivation has quadrupled in the course of the last year."
"The desire to retain the high per-hectare aid for hemp is, in reality, a result of the very odd collaboration between, on the one hand, those who want to see cannabis legalised and, on the other hand, speculators in EU subsidies, for it is, in actual fact, impossible to see any difference between cannabinol-free hemp and the hemp which is used to produce hashish."
"The Commission proposes that aid for hemp should be reduced in three phases to the level of aid that has been set for cereals."
"I should ideally have liked to see aid reduced immediately to the aid level for cereals, but I can happily live with the Commission' s proposal."
"It gives farmers time to adapt."
"I cannot, however, live with the recommendation from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"It cannot be in accordance with modern, forward-looking and enlargement-oriented agricultural policy to propose that the transitional arrangements should be further extended."
"That would be ""far out"" of place! Moreover, it is something I shall be voting against."
"Where flax is concerned, the Commission also proposes to limit the opportunity for subsidy-hunting and, here too, the Committee is in favour of improving the scheme."
"I take the opposite view, namely that the aid should be limited."
"It should be the market and consumers who decide what should be produced, not sky-high EU subsidies."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my particular thanks go firstly to the rapporteur, Mrs Schierhuber, for her comprehensive survey of the situation and her excellent report."
"The debate on reforms in the sphere of flax and hemp grown for fibre has been going on now for almost five years, if you take 1996 and the proposals which the Commission made then as the starting point."
"In place of the reform proposed by the Commission at that time, however, the Council simply stepped up controls."
"This certainly increased administrative expenditure considerably, but largely failed to achieve the desired, and necessary, effect: subsidy-hunting continued and the area under cultivation increased from around 100 000 hectares to 240 000 hectares, with the result that budgetary expenditure on this sector was, virtually, more than doubled."
"The proposal before you today has three main objectives. It is intended to put a stop to subsidy-hunting once and for all."
"The Commission wishes to foster rural development by supporting traditional cultivation and production methods, and it wants to help farmers over a limited period of time to find profitable new sales outlets and to increase their sales potential."
"You see we are not under any illusions!"
"In the light of budgetary constraints - with which everyone is familiar - the sector has to be more market-oriented."
"An even more important point is that, following the Berlin decisions, no new money is envisaged for the promotion of new products."
"Such new products may be perfectly interesting for agriculture, but our message must be honest here: the overriding objective with innovations of this kind has to be profitability."
"The Commission has carefully examined Parliament' s amendments."
"Many of them are acceptable to us, at least in essence; others are not acceptable in their current form but prompt further reflection."
"Then there are others which, I am afraid, we cannot accept."
"I now turn to the first proposal on including flax and hemp grown for fibre in the arable crops regulation. I am prepared to accept Amendment No 2, which concerns the formulation of the objectives, and Amendment No 1, at least in spirit."
"The idea of doubling aid per hectare when proof is provided that the straw has been processed into fibres seems, at first sight, to be very tempting, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf."
"However, in my opinion, it is doomed to failure."
"This is because, by introducing it, we would de facto be creating first and foremost fresh incentives for renewed subsidy-hunting, and ultimately we would again have to rely on controls which have hitherto already proved to be insufficiently effective."
"Consequently, I do not agree with Amendments Nos 3, 9, 10 and 12 nor, for similar reasons, with Amendment No 38."
"In Amendment No 4, however, fears about the rules on land eligibility are expressed which were addressed in particular by Messrs Adam and Wyn."
"I agree with them that we need a sensible solution here, and that is why I can agree in principle to Amendment No 4."
"The same goes for Amendment No 37 which is along the same lines."
"Amendments Nos 7, 8 and 15, regarding derogations from the provisions for arable crops in respect of surface area and set-aside, are acceptable to the extent that they are in line with the agreement on Agenda 2000, but only within this framework."
"In my opinion, they are actually no longer necessary because there is land all over the place within the surface area on which flax and hemp can be grown without limiting the amount of other crops that are cultivated."
"Nevertheless, problems could arise in some areas."
"We will try to find a solution here, so as to reduce the possible constraints which might arise."
"I can accept Amendment No 6 on hemp."
"However, irregular plots cannot simply stop being subject to checks altogether, as is recommended, at least implicitly, in Amendments Nos 5 and 16 and I cannot therefore agree to these amendments."
"There could be room for a certain amount of flexibility, however, where it is a question of achieving high control levels."
"That is why I can state my agreement with these amendments and with Amendment No 14 at least in this respect."
"It is because of the risks for the image of hemp that the Commission is proposing a ban on hemp and hempseed being used in food, despite the fact that the varieties which have to be used in Europe do not contain any psychotropic substances."
"This is a highly political issue which we can certainly discuss further."
"However, at the present time, I do not wish to agree to Amendments Nos 11, 13 and 32."
"But the actual objective is clear."
"I now come to the second proposal, on the regulation on the common organisation of the market in flax and hemp grown for fibre."
"Processing aid has to be in reasonable proportion to production costs and take account of the market value of the products."
"It is a fact that processing long-flax fibres entails higher costs."
"A distinction must therefore be drawn between processing aid for long-flax fibres and aid for short-flax fibres and hemp fibre."
"Maximum permitted impurity levels also need to be fixed because the aid is intended to promote the production of high-quality fibre and not of the waste entailed in fibre production."
"Our policy for the sector has to be unambiguous."
"We can only accept investment in products which are profitable under market conditions."
"This principle also applies here."
"That is why I cannot agree to Amendments Nos 18 and 34, even though they definitely contain further food for thought."
"I do agree, however, with the ideas underlying Amendments Nos 23, 25 and 26, that is to bring the aid payable for long and short fibres more closely into line and to make the granting of aid dependent on the result of checks."
"Nevertheless, the limits given in the budget cannot be exceeded."
"The second important subject is the national guaranteed quantities."
"In view of the well-known difficulties with checking harvest results, these are absolutely indispensable."
"The Commission proposal mitigates the risk of abuse at the processing stage without quotas having to be set for the individual processing plants, and thus without the disadvantages which quotas of this kind would have on an expanding market."
"A maximum guaranteed quantity for the whole Community would not be a solution."
"Experience shows that this only leads to disputes between Member States and makes it more difficult to find a real solution."
"Dividing the maximum guaranteed quantity between the Member States annually, on the basis of processing capacity - which cannot be verified - is not really a practicable alternative."
"That is why I cannot accept Amendments Nos 20, 21, 27 to 30 and 35."
"But the idea of introducing a kind of newcomer quota and dividing this each year between those Member States where there is only very little flax and hemp production at the present time, or none at all, is, I believe, definitely worth exploring."
"I can accept Amendments Nos 24 and 33 for those instances when the farmer and the primary processor are one and the same person."
"As far as the import of hemp and hempseed is concerned, I agree that we need a practicable solution."
"However, I cannot agree to Amendments Nos 22 and 31 in their current form because they implicitly say that no further controls need to be carried out."
"Turning, in conclusion, to the timetable, I am also prepared to accept Amendments Nos 17 and 36, in accordance with which the new rules would only enter into force on 1 July 2001."
"But this would mean that the aid per hectare for the next marketing year would have to be set this year in accordance with the system currently in force."
"In this case, I would be bound by the figures in the 2001 budget."
"A reform of this sector is absolutely essential!"
"I think that you agree with me on this."
"We need to make the fibre flax and hemp sector more market-oriented so that it is able to make an effective, indisputable and useful contribution to the economy and is no longer the target of public criticism."
"Under these circumstances, I would have thought that you would have attached great importance to adopting the resolution this week, so that the Council can also take a decision as soon as possible."
"In this way we can avoid the market disruption which would ensue in the 2000/2001 financial year if the level of the aid was not settled by 1 August."
"For all that - as I have told you - I can accept 13 of the amendments and, as regards many of the others as well, I have specifically emphasised that, although I cannot accept them as they stand at the moment, some of them definitely provide further food for thought and material for debates which I will initiate in the Council."
"However, because the market really will be severely disrupted if we do not have a scheme in place in time, we would either have to adopt temporary preventive measures - which would have to take account of the initial budget estimates for 2001 - or we will have a harvest where the producers will not know what payments they can expect to receive."
"We really should not allow this kind of situation to develop."
"It would be simply unthinkable to have to explain to the producers and also the processors why they should have to suffer because we cannot manage to decide on a proposal which, after all, has already been on the table in this House for eight months."
"Mr President, allow me to ask the Commissioner one more question. Commissioner, you mentioned the controls which will need to be carried out in connection with the processing premium, and these must indeed take place."
"Now if you combine our proposal to double the aid per hectare when proof is furnished with the proof for the processing aid, which also has to be provided, and if you join these two things together - of course this is not elaborated upon in the report - then the controls which need to be carried out for both kinds of premium are guaranteed and farmers do not lose out."
"If you implement your scheme, as proposed, you will be depriving European flax and hemp growers of land and that has nothing to do with controls."
"Mr President, with your permission I should like to ask the Commissioner a supplementary question."
"I fully agree with you that we must not let it reach such a point that the poor farmers and processors do not know what lies in store for them or what their prospects are for the future."
"That is why I should like to ask you this specific question, Commissioner: can you envisage - and I am referring here to Amendments Nos 27 and 28 and to my previous comments - that the Commission might, after all, consider rethinking its proposal on quotas and restructuring it?"
"Perhaps I will begin with the second question, which was asked by the rapporteur."
"If I have correctly understood what this is about, you are referring first and foremost to the so-called newcomer quotas."
"In this regard, I have said that we are prepared to accept a quota of this kind."
"I now turn to the first question, which was asked by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf. I am sorry, but what you are proposing is still based on an assumption, namely that this check is carried out."
"It is simply the case that the current system is not working and that is why I believe we have no choice but to change it."
"And so I do not want us to turn the system completely on its head."
"If we go back partly to the old system again then I do not see how we can make it work and why it should work any better than it has in the past."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday at 12 noon."
"Civil liability and motor vehicles"
"The next item is the report (A5-0130/2000) by Mr Rothley, on behalf of the Parliament Delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text, adopted by the Conciliation Committee, on a European Parliament and Council directive on the approximation of laws of the Member States relating to insurance against civil liability in respect of the use of motor vehicles and amending Directives 73/239/EEC and 88/357/EEC (Fourth Motor Insurance Directive) (C5-0111/2000 - 1997/0264(COD))."
"Mr President, I must, and can, be brief."
"This week we are able, for the first time, to adopt a European Union legislative act which has been drawn up on the initiative of the European Parliament and on which, thank God, the Commission and the Council have cooperated positively."
"It is about improved protection for accident victims in the European Union."
"This directive resolves a large number of the problems which usually arise when people are involved in an accident in another country."
"First of all, however, and before looking back, I wish to take a look into the future."
"Commissioner Bolkestein, a draft fifth directive already exists."
"I have drawn it up and it will soon be put before Parliament."
"I very much hope that we will also be able to cooperate closely on this issue."
"The fifth directive is therefore already in the pipeline."
"At the beginning of June - this is also part of our glance into the future - we will be holding a conference at the Academy of European Law in Trier on another important issue, the reform of personal injury, and this may give rise to a further parliamentary initiative."
"As you can see, we wish this debate on improved protection for accident victims to gain a certain momentum."
"I would be very grateful to you in particular, Commissioner, if we could achieve this together."
"I would be grateful to you because you made an important contribution - and this is where I start to look back - to the debate on the fourth directive."
"You see there was the major problem of deciding whether this directive ought to apply when the accident had taken place in a Member State of the European Union."
"I have never understood why the Commission initially fought against this so stubbornly; its stance could not be justified from a logical, political or legal point of view."
"Then, thankfully, when we discussed this in Parliament at the end of last year, you prepared the ground for us to make this possible."
"This directive will now apply in all countries which are members of the green card system, meaning that approximately 90% of all accidents in which Europeans might be involved will be covered."
"And while I am on the subject of figures, we are talking about approximately 500 000 accidents a year in the European Union alone - not counting third countries - where we will be able to settle claims much more easily in the future."
"In the past there was the problem that people had to cope with a foreign language, foreign laws and so on. Sometimes the process dragged on for ages."
"When I look at the petitions which have been sent to the European Parliament' s Committee on Petitions because claims arising from traffic accidents in another country have taken years and years to settle, I am quite sure that this directive constitutes a very decisive step forward."
"Obviously, we cannot in any way change either the law which has to be applied or the legal jurisdiction, but by now proposing a system whereby each insurer has a claims representative in every other country, we will probably be able, as far as the accident victim is concerned, satisfactorily to settle the claims arising from 90% of all traffic accidents which take place in another country."
"That is a very big step forward."
"When we debated this, some questions were still open."
"I did, and I would just mention this point, rather regret the fact that the compensation bodies - and these were, after all, the Commission' s idea - were gradually watered down during the political consultation process."
"Nevertheless, at the end of the day, we did find a solution which is satisfactory, but in three to four years' time we will review what this directive has achieved and, if necessary, propose improvements."
"In conclusion, I should like to say that thanks to your intervening, Commissioner, important progress has been made on this directive, and I should specifically like to thank you for that."
"You overcame resistance from within your own Commission."
"This was a great achievement and we thank you very much for it."
"I hope that, where the protection of accident victims and its improvement is concerned, we will also enjoy fruitful cooperation in the future."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Rothley for his work, for this measure will put an end to a series of worrying and embarrassing situations which have arisen in our Community."
"The joint draft adopted by the Conciliation Committee certainly represents great progress for our Community."
"Nevertheless, although I will vote for the motion, I have to say that I am very perplexed by the response I have received from the Commission to my question on an issue which is not completely related to the question of accidents which take place abroad but which nevertheless concerns the insurance sector, a sector in which, as far as I am concerned, in Italy, truly unimaginable events occur, which leads me to suspect that Parliament' s inspection system is, indeed, defunct."
"I tabled a question to the Commission, calling upon them to do something about the genuinely appalling issue of those insurance companies which set high premiums and then do not pay citizens from certain parts of the Community what they are entitled to."
"A conference, sponsored by the 'Automobile Club d' Italia', was held in Naples and attended by leading lawyers, because insurance companies, as was also the case in the past, are making Italian citizens pay different premiums according to where they live, claiming that they have to recoup their costs in the areas where there are a greater number of accidents."
"So I wonder, and I put the question to Parliament, whether this could be an example of blatant discrimination among the citizens of a single State and among citizens of the European Community."
"Although it is true that in certain areas a decidedly larger number of accidents is recorded, it is also true that, when people belong to the same state and the same Community, events are shared by citizens who live in the same district, the same area, the same country and the same Community."
"With regard to the payment of premiums, absolutely incredible, unbelievable things happen: in a town such as Alexandria, for example, premiums are less than half the level of those in a town such as Naples or Catania."
"Therefore, I feel that, like Parliament, in addition to developing this type of measure, such as that presented in the Rothley report, we should endeavour to take further steps to avoid blatant discrimination against citizens of the same country, and also extend an invitation to the insurance companies: while it is mandatory to be insured, it is also mandatory for the insurance companies to insure the citizens."
"In certain regions of Italy, the fact is that insurance companies refuse to insure the Italian citizens, which is an extremely serious offence."
"In this regard, I would like to repeat the question I tabled, to which the Commission replied that the European Parliament has no competence in this sector."
"Nevertheless, although we are competent when it comes to regulating the matter, as the Rothley report is doing in relations between the different Member States, I feel that we ought to challenge the insurance companies to avoid blatant discrimination, to set the same premiums for all, to pay claimants what they are actually entitled to and to ensure that this sector is improved, or adapted in some way to the changing requirements of our society."
"In making these statements, I would like to declare that I particularly support this report and, once again, I thank Mr Rothley and the Commission for their endeavours on behalf of our citizens. I urge them to take action to resolve this matter as soon as possible."
"Mr President, I wish to express the heartfelt thanks of the Commission to Mr Rothley, the rapporteur, who has had a considerable intellectual and political input into this fourth motor insurance directive."
"Mr Rothley was extremely kind in thanking the Commission for what it has done."
"The Commission has perhaps been constructive in the formulation of this fourth motor insurance directive. However, as Mr Rothley said, it was in response to an initiative from the European Parliament."
"The Commission is duly thankful to him for that initiative."
"I wish to say that the Commission welcomes the adoption of this fourth motor insurance directive by Parliament."
"As Mr Rothley pointed out, every year there are more than 500 000 car accidents involving vehicles from different Member States."
"However, the current system of compensation for people involved in an accident outside their home country does not work satisfactorily."
"The new directive will provide for improved information, easier procedures and quicker settlement of claims, and these are things which concern the citizens of all our Member States most directly."
"This is also a measure which will bring the European Union closer to the citizens of the Union."
"As I have just said, the Commission's proposal was a response to a parliamentary resolution in which Parliament made use of its new powers under Article 192 of the Treaty on European Union."
"I should again like to thank Parliament explicitly and, of course, Mr Rothley, but also the competent committee and its chairperson, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, for the constructive discussions in the first and second readings of the directive and the subsequent negotiations in the course of informal trialogues."
"Mr Rothley has announced a fifth directive."
"He said that there will shortly be a conference in Trier on that directive and he has asked the Commission to help steer it through its legislative process."
"Perhaps it is a bit early to discuss the fifth directive now but I should like to take this opportunity to assure Mr Rothley that in any further legislative work in which this Parliament would like to engage, the Commission will take the same constructive attitude as it took with the fourth directive."
"Lastly, Mr Bigliardo draws attention to the fact that the premia for motor vehicle insurance in Italy vary from region to region, according to the number of accidents."
"He objects to that differentiation in premia according to the frequency of accidents in the various parts of Italy and he would like the Commission to intervene."
"I have to tell Mr Bigliardo that this is a matter which does not concern this directive."
"Strictly speaking, I could end my response there but his comments deserve a fuller answer."
"Therefore, I should like to say that if the situation had been that motor insurance premia were different for Italian citizens as compared with French or German citizens living in Italy, the Commission would be able to object."
"You cannot ask French or German citizens living in Italy to pay a different premium from Italian citizens."
"That is a clear case of discrimination."
"But that is not the case."
"The premia differ according to the number of accidents in each region and are therefore the same for Italians and non-Italians."
"They relate to the different areas of Italy."
"I do not think that the Commission can intervene on that point."
"It is a matter of how insurance companies calculate their premia, and if there are objective reasons for charging a higher premium for a particular region then the Commission is powerless."
"If Mr Bigliardo would like to substantiate his claim in more detail, I should be pleased to receive his letter and answer it."
"But if he would like a straightforward answer now, then it has to be that the Commission cannot intervene."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Bolkestein."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday at 12 noon."
"Development cooperation with South Africa"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0114/2000) by Mr Martínez Martínez on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council regulation on development cooperation with South Africa (C5-0100/2000 - 1999/0070(COD))."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a few days ago the Committee on Development and Cooperation unanimously approved the recommendation which is today being considered by Parliament."
"It had previously made a considerable effort to speed up and rationalise the negotiation of the issue, believing that voting on the new European Parliament and Council regulation on development cooperation with South Africa was an important and urgent matter."
"It was important because South Africa is one of the countries which receives the most funding from the European Union for its development process."
"It was urgent because the regulation which forms the basis of this cooperation and which has been in force for five years expired on 31 December 1999, from which date the different procedures in operation were left without a proper legal basis."
"It is very worrying that we should find ourselves in such a situation."
"In fact, in the first six months of 1999, our Parliament considered the first text proposed by the Commission, adopting six amendments and forwarding them to the Council for their consideration."
"This is where the delay occurred, since the Council took no less than eight months to present their position to us."
"This took us past the expiry date and led us to the legal vacuum which I just mentioned."
"The Council finally presented its proposal."
"Their text adopted most of the amendments which Parliament had approved on first reading and, in particular, the Council put considerably more emphasis on the references to combating poverty and achieving the international development objectives, agreed on the basis of United Nations conventions and resolutions."
"Having examined the Council' s proposal, the Committee on Development and Cooperation considered it necessary to try to prevent the negotiation being prolonged by a third reading."
"In other words, we intended to accept everything that seemed reasonable and limit our amendments to things which were absolutely essential, and even then in a spirit of great moderation."
"There only remained two questions which appear in the amendments and which, in the form of a recommendation, our committee is submitting to the plenary."
"The first question refers to commitology."
"The Council wanted the Committee of Experts to control all cooperation projects relating to South Africa with a budget of over EUR 3 million."
"However, we believed that this committee should guide and monitor the broad approaches to development cooperation with South Africa and only directly control larger projects, leaving the smaller ones to the normal procedures, which are the Commission' s responsibility."
"Having considered all the main issues, the amendment we are presenting today finally raises the Council' s proposal from 3 to 5 million, and this committee, whose members represent the various Member States, will therefore have fewer projects to deal with and will therefore be able to concentrate more on a global view of such an important field of action."
"The second proposal concerns the budgetary framework for development cooperation between the European Union and South Africa for the 7-year period, including 2000, which is referred to in the regulation under discussion."
"During the previous five years the budgetary framework had been EUR 125 million per year."
"The Council, with a view to budgetary restriction, decreased that allocation in its proposal and set it at EUR 112.5 million per year."
"For our part, while we are signing an important Trade, Development and Cooperation Agreement with South Africa, it does not seem politically acceptable to send a message of financial cuts."
"On the contrary, we should at least maintain and, where possible, increase these contributions, if only as a token gesture, although we share the concern with regard to the available resources."
"Finally, the proposal approved by the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on whose behalf I am speaking, was extremely reasonable: the EUR 123.5 million already allocated for 2000 and the EUR 127 million for each of the subsequent six years, amounting to a budgetary framework of EUR 885.5 million for the seven years laid down in the regulation."
"Both amendments seem well-considered."
"The aim is to avoid a third reading, put an end to the current intolerable legal vacuum and provide significant political impetus to our development cooperation with South Africa."
"By asking you to support our proposals, we hope that the common sense and moderation which Parliament is showing will be understood by the Council."
"We also hope that these proposals are acceptable to the Commission, despite the fact that theirs - 25 million for the commitology question and 850.5 million for the budgetary framework - are somewhat different to the ones that we are presenting."
"If we are not understood, it will be entirely down to the Council or the Commission that we become involved in a third reading, with the consequences which the lack of a proper legal basis may have on the projects in operation in our development cooperation with South Africa."
"The figure for the budgetary framework suggested by the Commission, which is very close to our own proposal, should in any event have arrived at the Committee on Development and Cooperation on time, so that Parliament could have approved it and above all with the certainty that, in the event that we had adopted it, the Council would also have accepted it."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report under discussion here on the Union's development cooperation with South Africa, on which I particularly congratulate the rapporteur, is, leaving aside its content, a striking example of the Council's delaying tactics towards the European Parliament."
"This is actually an unproblematic regulation and also, in fact, an unproblematic report."
"That the Union should support development cooperation with South Africa, bearing in mind that it is one of the more successful countries on the subcontinent, has never been called into question."
"This is therefore predominantly about renewing the legal base for this cooperation, as the preceding regulation expired in December 1999."
"Our former fellow-MEP, Mr Fassa, presented the report for its first reading in Parliament in May of last year."
"The Council accepted nearly all of the amendments."
"Nevertheless, I do wonder why the Council's common position was officially only sent to Parliament in March of this year."
"Of course, the rapporteur also referred to this."
"Delays of this kind, which might perhaps be explained by the trade agreement being negotiated in parallel, never fail, however, to amaze me."
"No doubt people in South Africa itself are also asking themselves what conclusions they should draw from the Council's behaviour."
"This is why I should specifically like to thank the rapporteur for making it possible, thanks to the fast-track procedure, for this report to be on the plenary agenda now, as early as May, thus allowing us to avoid any potential problems caused by a lack of legal bases in our development cooperation."
"As far as the content is concerned, some areas of uncertainty had been clarified in preliminary informal consultations with the Council, which meant that this report could restrict itself to two points, the first of which is increasing the total budget to EUR 885.5 million for the period for 2000-2006, a customary parliamentary request and a necessary one."
"Secondly, the threshold of EUR 5 million, which has now been settled on, constitutes a good compromise in my view."
"Small projects can be planned and implemented efficiently by the institutions and organisations on the ground."
"The limit of EUR 5 million gives sufficient room for manoeuvre."
"In making these efforts, the rapporteur has, for his part, done everything within his power to present a proper report on the regulation."
"I very much hope that we will indeed still be able to avoid the danger of a third reading, Mr Martínez Martínez."
"For the time being I offer you my warmest congratulations on this."
"The full significance of this report is, however, only appreciated when it is seen in the context of the other efforts being made to intensify cooperation with South Africa, first and foremost the trade agreement already mentioned."
"The Union continues to attach great importance to stable development in South Africa, not only for the sake of the people there, but also because this is in the interests of the development of its neighbours north of the Limpopo."
"The South Africans have already managed to put an end to legal discrimination against the majority of the population and to hold democratic elections."
"Today it is a question of anchoring the rule of law more firmly in the State."
"All sections of the population and all civil servants must feel a duty primarily to this State, which is under the rule of law and no longer, as they did in the past, only to their own section of the population or even to their personal associates of whom they need to take care."
"From a political point of view, the Union' s adoption of this new regulation is not only an acknowledgement of the results achieved by the reform process hitherto."
"It comes with definite expectations for the future, including securing law and order in all parts of the country."
"I read with concern reports about the misuse of tax revenue at provincial level."
"I hear with unease that corruption is also gaining ground in the police force, and that in rural areas and in townships there are police no-go areas where the poorest of the poor are left at the mercy of gangs."
"Conversely, those who have something to lose wall themselves in and for their own security hire those who previously had professional roles in the army and the police."
"Thus a two-tier society again emerges, and, what is more, this is in the sensitive area of internal security."
"Since law and order were de facto suspended in neighbouring Zimbabwe, the morale on commercial farms south of the Limpopo has hit rock bottom."
"This illustrates another decisive expectation which we have of South Africa: to set an example and be a stabilising influence on its neighbours to the north."
"I expect the South African Government to take on its regional responsibilities."
"President Mbeki should adopt just as clear a stance as has the former President, Mr Mandela - whom we all hold in high esteem - on the events in Zimbabwe."
"Standing by and letting it happen or talking up the situation helps neither the farmers nor the hundreds of thousands in Zimbabwe who are dependent on the farms for a functioning infrastructure."
"Food, housing, and sometimes clinics and schools are made available to farm workers and their families."
"The situation is similar in large areas of South Africa."
"Obviously these are not exemplary structures, but before they are abandoned we have to ensure that those who ought to be benefiting from them receive something better in their place."
"South Africa must now, in its own interests too, exert massive influence on Mugabe; otherwise it too will soon be threatened by waves of starving refugees if seed cannot be sown on the farms there now."
"In its own country, not only would the rand come under increasing pressure, but the faith in the government shown by important sections of the population who would normally supply the nation's food would be severely shaken."
"This cannot be in the interests of South Africa and it cannot be in our interests either!"
"By adopting this regulation, the Union is showing that it still backs the economic, political and societal reform process in South Africa."
"The South African Government needs all sections of society to have lasting confidence in the development of the country."
"I hope that this expectation too will be taken seriously in Pretoria."
"The PPE-DE Group will be voting in favour of the report."
"Mr President, I also warmly congratulate the rapporteur who has shown enormous commitment to this report."
"We thank you very much for it."
"We are clearly in a very serious situation."
"The regulation for South Africa expired on 31 December 1999."
"It is clear, as the rapporteur has suggested, that we need to proceed with some urgency in order to provide a legal base for our essential work in South Africa."
"This budget line is the work of the European Parliament."
"I was the budget rapporteur in 1994 when the Development Committee established the line."
"That was because we wanted to see practical and tangible assistance for South Africa's peaceful transition to a free and democratic country."
"Surely that has been one of the most encouraging events in recent history."
"Now the Republic, with its new President Mr Thabo Mbeki, faces new challenges which, in my view, require sustained partnership with the European Union."
"This is not the time, as others have suggested, to have the kind of mean-spirited delays that we have seen from the Council; neither is it the time for political point-scoring by other institutions of the European Union."
"Indeed, it is my view that the Council has rather cynically orchestrated the eight-month delay in response to the first reading in order that it could better manage its negotiations on the South Africa trade and development agreements."
"This has put life-saving programmes at risk and any delay now would exacerbate the existing impression in South Africa of a European Union which seeks only to serve its own interests first."
"Coming as this does after ouzo and grappa, we are in danger of sending a very bad signal to South Africa."
"Decisions need to be made."
"We cannot risk delay."
"For example, I am very familiar with the South African Human Rights Foundation."
"That would be endangered."
"The Foundation for Cultural Initiatives programme, the South Africa Labour Development Trust, policing in the Eastern Cape - all these programmes would be very seriously threatened by delays."
"If there is delay, if agreement is not reached on the regulation, then new programmes will be affected too."
"Even the 2000 budget of EUR 1.54 million would not be committed."
"Let us be clear what we are talking about."
"We are talking about water and sanitation programmes which do so much to improve the quality of life of people in the townships and rural areas."
"We would endanger the SADC HIV/Aids Programme, regarded by all as being one of the most efficient the European Union operates."
"We risk jeopardising economic developments in the Eastern Cape and work in the Eastern Cape with the Ministry of Education."
"We risk jeopardising support for social housing programmes in South Africa."
"In this Parliament we have to make every effort now, as the rapporteur has said, to make it possible for this money to move as speedily and as efficiently as it can to the people of South Africa."
"The European Parliament position is, and always has been, realistic and morally right."
"However I must express my grave concern about the possible misery which would be caused were we to delay."
"As usual we should make it very clear that we in the Development Committee regard the budget figure that we have here before us, as purely indicative."
"We see it as a reference point only, not as anything that we will not seek to change when it comes to our committee."
"It is the first year of the South Africa Trade Agreement."
"How does it look in our first year if we do not fully commit the funding and meet our obligations?"
"We must continue our commitment to supporting South African efforts to overcome the legacy of apartheid."
"To do that we have to have a regulation sooner rather than later."
"I hope that after we have heard the Commissioner we will have the opportunity to discuss his views further and to discuss the very deeply worrying issues which delay on this regulation raises."
"Mr President, apartheid in South Africa may have been abolished but it has not yet disappeared."
"For example, the disparities in income between the population groups are still shocking and deprived areas in terms of housing, education and health care have not caught up by a long way."
"Frustration is mounting, as is evident from the unprecedented crime rate and outrageous violence both indoors and outdoors."
"They may want to escape their past, but they are compromising their own future in the process."
"The key goal of development strategy should therefore be to correct the imbalance in growth created by apartheid."
"If not, that country will not be able to enjoy stability, will deter foreign investors and will remain poor when it could be rich."
"Needless to say, it is South Africa first and foremost that has to set its own house in order, but Europe can and must make a substantial contribution to the development process."
"We therefore lend our support to the cooperation agreement, on the basis of the EUR 885.5 million, as proposed by our excellent rapporteur."
"The Council has sat on the regulation for far too long."
"All the signs are there that its association with the negotiations regarding the trade agreement was spurious."
"The involvement of the Member States via the committee should focus more on the strategy and the indicative programme rather than on the individual projects."
"A maximum of 5 million seems very reasonable to me."
"This does not, however, relieve the European Union of its task of monitoring all projects well, down to the tiniest, and to evaluate them at regular intervals."
"The Commission delegation must be sufficiently equipped to be able to do this independently and to a professional standard."
"Mr President, South Africa has enormous potential."
"There is so much there which so few have enjoyed."
"Economic growth is a necessary but not an adequate condition for development."
"What is needed is for resources to be better distributed and correctly allocated to meet all social needs."
"The apartheid regime has been abolished, all that is left to tackle now is apartheid itself."
"Mr President, I would like to start by adding my thanks and congratulations to the rapporteur."
"I strongly support his aim of getting this regulation brought into force as quickly as possible with no third reading."
"The rapporteur has been very generous in his interpretation of the Council's inexplicable 8-month delay in responding to Parliament's six amendments during the first reading."
"If there were any evidence that the Council was deliberately holding back this regulation to give it greater leverage during the negotiations of the broader trade and development cooperation agreement, that indeed would be extremely worrying."
"To come to the substance of the issue, on the budget it is completely unacceptable that the EU should be offering a budget cut in comparison to former years, particularly at this moment in our relationship with South Africa."
"There is a very real risk of this triggering an even greater loss of faith by South Africa in the EU."
"Let us not forget that this follows hard on the heels of the protracted and frequently bitter negotiations of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement where the EU acted very dismally indeed."
"On numerous occasions, it was EU reluctance to improve access for South African agricultural goods which nearly blocked the whole deal and to follow this up with yet another dishonourable act would be extremely unfortunate."
"Perhaps there is an image abroad that South Africa is an increasingly developed country and does not really need these funds."
"Let us not forget that in spite of the great leaps forward that South Africa has taken, the life of many South Africans is still one of extreme poverty without work or land or a decent home."
"An estimated 42% of black South Africans are jobless as compared with just 4% of whites."
"A quarter of schools have no water within walking distance."
"Half of South African households are classed as poor."
"65% of adult South Africans are illiterate and 10 million South Africans live in informal shacks or on land they neither own nor rent."
"Let us not forget either that the Commission and Council turned down the idea of a separate new financial instrument to give support to neighbouring countries which need to adjust themselves to the new framework resulting from the Trade and Cooperation Agreement."
"I am not as reassured on this point as the rapporteur and I would have preferred to see a separate budget line which could have been seen and monitored more easily."
"It is quite clear that substantial funds are going to be needed to ease these countries' transition."
"The loss of customs duty alone is extremely high in some cases."
"In Swaziland for example, this accounts for up to 40% of all government revenue."
"In spite of its own challenges, South Africa is already demonstrating its commitment to support its neighbours in the region. For example, in its agreement to a highly asymmetrical liberalisation agreement with the other SADC countries which will benefit those countries."
"The European Union needs the same generosity of spirit."
"It should honour its initial financial pledges to South Africa and provide significant support to the neighbouring countries during their transition period."
"Mr President, it has taken a year, but we have finally reached the point where we can discuss the regulation on development cooperation with South Africa at second reading."
"This is not a day too soon, because the European Programme for the Reconstruction and Development of South Africa has been without a legal basis since late 1999."
"In the light of this, the continuity of the development connection has been in the balance."
"Accordingly, I would like to thank the rapporteur for the drive he has displayed in dealing with this subject matter."
"I share his criticism regarding the eight months which the Council deemed necessary to formulate its position."
"He is right in claiming that a distinction must be drawn between this regulation and the Trade, Development and Cooperation Agreement between Europe and South Africa."
"Although development cooperation and trade are very much interrelated, they should not be played off against each other."
"The deliberate delay in approving these regulations would seem to suggest that there is little real involvement with South Africa."
"This is irrespective of how fair the European negotiating position is in terms of trade."
"Moreover, such a stance does not fit in with the Commission' s strategy in terms of South Africa which it has outlined in its 2000-2002 Country Strategy."
"This document addresses both the fight against poverty and improvement in infrastructure."
"I did wonder, however, why it only mentions the European Union' s development instrument in passing."
"Would the Commission be able to answer that?"
"I would also like to know from the Commission to what extent South Africa' s qualified Lomé membership overlaps with the European Programme for Reconstruction and Development."
"I am, by the way, very grateful to the Commission for the large amount of information on South Africa which is available on the Internet and which has been laid out in a readily understood format."
"This is an example to draw on when it comes to determining the strategy for other countries!"
"I would like to finish off with just one remark for the rapporteur. I can imagine that he is intent on keeping the EUR 910 million budget for development cooperation with South Africa."
"I, however, attach less importance to this, given the limited financial resources for foreign policy and the major challenges in other parts of the world."
"What counts is the quality of cooperation with South Africa, which, in my opinion, is sound at present, particularly on account of the regional projects which have been financed over the past couple of years."
"This is why South Africa' s neighbouring countries can also benefit from European development projects."
"It seems that coherence and consistency are gradually gaining ground in the EU' s development policy."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur not only for the work he has put in to produce this report but also for the rather unique way he has had to handle the situation that the Development Committee and Parliament found itself in."
"It is perhaps a sad indictment on the European institutions that, five months after the expiry date of the legal base to this Council regulation, it has only now come before Parliament, thanks, as the rapporteur and almost every other speaker has said, to an 8-month delay by the Council in responding to Parliament's first reading."
"Surely we cannot continue to work in this way."
"It is interesting to note that half this report is taken up by the procedural points the rapporteur has had to work his way through."
"Now it has returned to us it is particularly pleasing that the Council has adopted the thrust of most of our amendments."
"Most welcome is the fact that the Council has made poverty alleviation a top priority."
"This should strengthen the partnership between South Africa and Europe."
"I have just spent a week in South Africa and there is much appreciation for all that the EU is doing to stabilise their fragile democracy."
"Only by rapidly improving living standards, particularly in health, education and employment, will stability remain."
"There was much resentment against some nation states at the hold-ups there had been over the new trade agreement with particular reference to spirit names."
"We are doing much for South Africa and I hope, in return, President Mbeki will work for peace in the region, with particular reference to Zimbabwe."
"The implication in the rapporteur's report that this regulation may have been delayed because it was being used as a bargaining chip is very worrying."
"The Commission might like to comment on this particular point."
"I would also like to hear from the Commission on how we can streamline the system."
"In the last session in Strasbourg we had another regulation that had also run out last December and this should not happen."
"I must strongly support the rapporteur and his suggestions that the Commission should be tackling the issues of major topics, such as the importance and the overall impact of the programme in relation to the agreed objectives rather than individual programmes."
"I would also like to see delegate offices strengthened with more and better staff to be able to cope more efficiently with monitoring and evaluations."
"This regulation is bound to have an impact on neighbouring states and I hope the Commission will take this into consideration."
"The rapporteur has broken new ground on commitology which can only bode well for the future."
"My group supports this regulation but asks for a speedy conclusion to the vacuum we are in."
"We would not like to see any disagreement on budget amounts hold up ratification."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in recent years South Africa has made a historic leap forward by abolishing the apartheid system and establishing a new political order based on the rule of law, respect for human rights and democracy."
"If the people of South Africa have regained their freedom, this is, of course, for the most part thanks to their persistence and courage, as well as to that of their leaders, but also, it must be said, to the political and financial support provided by European Union Member States for the reform process in South Africa."
"Quite clearly, the cooperation agreement signed on 10 October 1994 was a strong message that we sent this people treated so badly by history."
"I must confess that the slow progress in Council negotiations for its renewal leaves me rather puzzled."
"Our duty to show this country legitimate solidarity must not and cannot be sacrificed on the altar of national trading interests."
"On the trade agreement, which, need I remind you, we endorsed by a large majority in this very Chamber last October, we must avoid disagreements which obstruct the adoption of this cooperation regulation."
"Such an attitude would be tantamount to appalling blackmail on the part of Europe and would not be true to the spirit behind the new development and cooperation agreements with the ACP countries, i.e. establishing contracts which respect the identity, culture and dignity of each partner."
"With regard to the regional cooperation aspect of this regulation, I should like, in turn, to draw the Council and the Commission' s attention to the risks of economic destabilisation which may be engendered by the regulation, and even more so by the trade agreement with South Africa."
"We shall have to be particular attentive to the effects that these agreements may have on the ever vulnerable balance within the Southern African Customs Union."
"I am also thinking of Namibia and Swaziland, and even Lesotho and Botswana, which are a long way from receiving the same amount of aid from Europe."
"I feel that the European Union must, as a matter of urgency, take steps to arrive at an agreement with the authorities of these countries in order to compensate for any losses."
"Finally, in conclusion, acknowledging our rapporteur for his clear-sightedness and for his talents as a negotiator, I should like to express my complete agreement with him on the need to remedy the existing legal vacuum to enable these agreements to come into force."
"We must put an end, as a matter of urgency, to these long months of hesitation and delay, seen as so many negative signs by South Africa' s fledgling democracy, which expects more from Europe than narrow calculations in order to safeguard limited interests."
"Mr President, I am apparently not the only one who hangs her head in shame when it comes to South Africa."
"For years, we supported the fight against apartheid and welcomed the new South Africa with excitement."
"In 1995, it became our key partner in development cooperation."
"The fact that that country received most support from Europe was justified."
"After all, South Africa had to be - and still is - the driving force behind development in Southern and Central Africa."
"But it took too long for programmes to get underway and, when the date for the legal basis lapsed, we did not have a new regulation in place for our development cooperation."
"In his eminent report, the rapporteur emphatically referred to the expiry date of 31 December 1999."
"The Council needed no fewer than eight months to determine its position."
"This was, of course, not down to fundamental differences of opinion, but, as many of the delegates have already hinted at here, because the development money was used as a means of exerting pressure to secure European trade interests and to exact a trade agreement, in which our much talked of alcoholic beverages had to be protected once again."
"We are deeply ashamed about such a state of affairs, which resembles a cattle market."
"There is another reason to feel ashamed."
"A proportion of the money which we want to spend in the European countries to reconstruct Kosovo is being taken from the development cooperation with South Africa."
"Instead of increasing the funding by 1%, in line with inflation, and reaching the amount of EUR 885.5 million, as is also suggested by our rapporteur, we will be proposing a 10% reduction."
"I think this is disgraceful."
"Eventually, Commissioner Schreyer proposed EUR 850 million, or 121 million annually, 5 million less to invest in the fight against poverty which we deem so important."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we will naturally assent to the amendments tabled by the Committee on Cooperation and Development."
"Poverty is an injustice."
"We want the reconstruction of Kosovo."
"We are happy to finance it, but not with money intended to combat poverty."
"This is unethical."
"We also support the second amendment."
"It may seem less important, but I think that the resources for the procedure should be retained."
"If we oblige our committee to address the individual programme points, there will be considerably less time and energy for tackling the efficiency of the programme as a whole."
"This is why we give our wholehearted support to the rapporteur."
"Mr President, I want first of all to thank Mr Martínez Martínez for all the hard work he has put into this regulation."
"The European Parliament cannot possibly support cutting development aid to South Africa by ten per cent."
"Of course, I deeply regret the fact that the Council sat on this urgent matter for eight months so that there has been no legal basis for cooperation work since the beginning of the year."
"Relations between the European Union and South Africa must not be damaged."
"South Africa ought to - and must - be the European Union' s greatest and best friend in Africa, for South Africa will play a quite decisive role in the whole continent' s future."
"In times of large-scale conflict on the African continent, for example in Congo, Angola, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Sierra Leone, Uganda, Rwanda and Algeria - not to mention the intense unrest of recent months in Zimbabwe and the hatred which President Mugabe has been stirring up there - South Africa and the country' s remarkably strong democratic institutions constitute a constructive and stabilising factor in leading Africa towards a brighter and more peaceful future."
"South Africa has a vigorous constitution with a clear commitment to human rights and freedoms. The country has a constitutional court whose judgements are respected by the president."
"Free elections have been held. There is freedom of the press, and the office of president was in a peaceful and orderly state when the country' s great reconciler and nation builder, Nelson Mandela, left it."
"The Truth Commission, led by the Anglican bishop, Desmond Tutu, has demonstrated its willingness to strive for genuine reconciliation in South Africa."
"Sweden' s prime minister called the Cairo Conference, held earlier this year between the EU and Africa, ""the start of something new and great"" ."
"A democratic and reconciled South Africa is the prerequisite for this ""something new and great"" , in which Africa and the countries of Europe meet on a new and equal footing and look forward, instead of remaining stuck in the old colonial period."
"South Africa is a necessary engine of democracy for the whole of South Africa and for Africa in its entirety."
"It can show that it is freedom, together with democratic and strong ethical and moral values, through which Africa can advance furthest."
"- (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament is due to state its position at second reading on the regulation that forms the legal base for the general framework of cooperation between the European Union and South Africa."
"In the meantime, as you will remember, the Council of Ministers of the European Union adopted the General Agreement on Trade, Development and Cooperation last September on the basis of the Kinnock report, whose trade component was implemented in January of this year."
"One of the fundamental components of the trade agreement concerns wines, and South Africa committed itself, under the terms of the agreement signed at the Berlin Summit in March 1999, immediately to cease using certain Community designations of origin, such as, specifically, ""Port"" and ""Sherry"" , which it had been using illegally for twelve years."
"Following a few incredibly intricate episodes, successive adjournments and time-wasting manoeuvres by the South African negotiators in accepting a regulatory text for this agreement, both parties finally agreed that a new draft of the regulations for this agreement on wines, which is due to enter into force by 1 September, is to be laid down by the end of June."
"I have, however, received information to the effect that the South Africans are still raising problems with regard to a draft which faithfully reflects the Berlin Agreement. They are trying to have these wine-producing issues covered by the WTO TRIPS dossier, which the European Union feels does not adequately protect Community designations."
"Furthermore, it appears to be a position that has been reached in conjunction with other New World wine-producing countries, given that the South Africans were negotiating bilateral agreements on wines with the European Union and then they suddenly changed their minds and wanted to postpone everything."
"In view of these issues, I cannot agree with the rapporteur when he asks Parliament, as proof of good faith, to approve this framework regulation as a matter of urgency, without linking it to the trade aspect of the General Agreement on Trade, Development and Cooperation."
"I do not agree because all the European Union' s behaviour up until now has been nothing but a huge demonstration of good faith, to the extent that, contrary to what had previously been laid down, we accepted the commercial implementation of the agreement without the regulations for the agreement on wines being established."
"The time has come to say enough is enough!"
"Cooperation requires a positive attitude of good faith and responsibility on the part of both cooperating parties."
"As this has not been the case, I cannot, in all conscience, support the rapporteur' s position."
"Mr President, the Commission is appreciative of the rapporteur's excellent work and welcomes the recommendation on the Council common position which reflects Parliament's commitment to assist the new South Africa."
"We too are worried about the delays in the adoption of the regulation and share the view that quick adoption of the regulation on the European programme for reconstruction and development is now becoming essential and critical."
"It would be a signal to South Africa of our dedication to the effective entry into force of the agreement on trade development and cooperation and would prevent new tensions arising around issues still to be discussed concerning wines and spirits or fisheries."
"If, however, the Community is unable to adopt the regulation in time, our development programme for this year will be jeopardised and confidence undermined."
"We also totally share the rapporteur's view that the Council common position contains useful improvements to the Commission's proposal."
"However, on commitology and the financial framework, we also consider that the common position is inadequate and cannot be followed."
"Indeed, as regards Amendment No 1, on Article 8(5) and (6) on commitology, your proposal for a EUR 5m threshold is, to be frank, somewhat disappointing compared to the level of EUR 25m we had proposed."
"We proposed such a level in order to use the committed resources in a more efficient and useful way and to deal with strategic issues rather than the details of individual projects."
"But in the South Africa case, we are ready to accept the EUR 5m threshold simply in order not to delay a decision."
"It appears from our programming discussions with the South African Government that we will have a limited number of major sectoral programmes which we think have to be discussed in any case with the Member States."
"The EUR 5m level gives us enough room to proceed quickly with some small projects, for instance preparatory actions or pilot operations."
"But we definitely need to make clear that no precedent should be created for the Council to impose low commitology thresholds."
"I should like to retain the possibility of increasing this threshold for the South Africa budget line in the future, if need be."
"Regarding Amendment No 2, Article 10(1) on the financial framework: the Commission has been aware on the one hand of the need to respect the political commitment in the trade and development cooperation agreement to maintain assistance to South Africa but, on the other hand, we have to take into account the very difficult budgetary situation caused by the new commitments made for assistance in the Balkans."
"As a result, the Commission has agreed on the necessary budget adjustments to accommodate new needs."
"This exercise has been very complex: it has required a very sensitive balancing of the political priorities across the EU's regional programmes."
"But we envisage stabilisation for South Africa at the average level of around EUR 122m per annum, with a global figure of some EUR 850.5m in the period 2000-2006."
"This is below your proposal of EUR 885.5m but it is significantly higher than the EUR 787.5m the Council proposed."
"The South African programme is in fact one of the least affected by the proposed changes within heading IV and the adjustment will not affect the nature and scope of the programme as envisaged."
"I understand your determination not to reduce the financial amounts for development aid to South Africa."
"However, I find it absolutely necessary that the regulation is adopted in time to ensure uninterrupted implementation of activities in South Africa."
"This situation is indeed very critical and not a normal, routine situation - but unfortunately it is what we are facing - and I feel an obligation to do my utmost to secure agreement between the Council, Parliament and the Commission on the proposed approach."
"I am therefore anxious both to discuss the matter again with the Committee on Development and Cooperation in Parliament and before that to seek a response from the Member States."
"Bearing that in mind, I should welcome it if Parliament would consider whether the vote on Amendment No 2 could be postponed so that these discussions can take place."
"This is the safest way to reduce the risk of a much more serious and longer delay threatening the credibility of our cooperation with South Africa."
"Mr President, you have heard the Commissioner' s request that the vote be delayed, that is, that it should not take place tomorrow."
"I must say that this situation disturbs me, because we are all working very quickly and the Commission seems to be saying that, since we are in a hurry, we must drive the car very slowly."
"On principle, I am always willing to discuss issues again."
"Firstly, I must thank the spokespeople of the different Groups for their support, although I believe that they are lending their support to a very modest position by the committee, almost a critical type of support, because the Committee on Development and Cooperation should have gone much further than it decided."
"I repeat: in principle, I would not be opposed, but I do not believe that Parliament is in favour of delaying the vote."
"I do not feel at the moment that Parliament wishes to delay the vote."
"That would mean inviting the Commissioner to the Committee on Development next week and postponing our decision until June."
"I would not be opposed to that and I do not reject that possibility."
"But I must say, Mr President, that it worries me profoundly that Parliament should have to take responsibility for prolonging something which, in fact, has been prolonged by all parties."
"Everyone has prolonged this process: the Council and the Commission."
"Now the pressure is on Parliament because we have been told that, if we do not accept the positions of the Council and of the Commission, the development programmes will come to a standstill, which would be terrible."
"I agree that it would be terrible if the cooperation programmes came to a standstill."
"However, Mr President, we should take note of who is being pressurised and who really bears the responsibility for prolonging this process and taking it to a third reading."
"Therefore, Mr President, I would ask you to examine whether it would be proper to consult Parliament tomorrow on whether or not to vote on our positions."
"If we do vote on them tomorrow, it will fall to the Council and the Commission to ensure that the situation is not prolonged, which would create serious difficulties for South Africa and our own dignity."
"We must ask ourselves whether we are here solely to accept, at any time and under any kind of pressure, what the Council or the Commission proposes."
"If that is the case, then Parliament is unnecessary and all our dignity as an institution has been lost."
"I am therefore not opposed to the vote being delayed for another month."
"I believe that it would be very dangerous to prolong this process, but, in any event, we must not take responsibility."
"The responsibility falls to those people who have dragged it out until now and who seem to want it to last even longer, perhaps because the issue of the designations of origin of wines and alcoholic drinks is being negotiated."
"There has been a misunderstanding."
"The Commissioner can speak for himself but the Commission was not requesting postponement of the vote."
"The Commission was simply making a point on Amendment No 2, as I understand it."
"Perhaps the Commissioner would like to explain the point he was making on the amendment."
"As the President said, it is perfectly correct that I am not in a position to request anything, and it would be out of line with my own feeling and understanding of the relations between the Commission and Parliament if I did so."
"I said I would welcome it if a postponement of the vote were considered as a possibility."
"It is totally in the hands of Parliament, as it should be."
"However, I feel I have a responsibility vis-à-vis Parliament to make it totally clear that I see a real danger of this ending up in a long, difficult postponement - something that will create delays in our current activities in South Africa."
"It is simply in order to minimise that risk that I am expressing my views as I have here."
"The decision is, of course, totally in Parliament's hands."
"Decision on urgent procedure"
"Mr President, the Committee on Industry considers that this is an extremely important issue and should be dealt with as a matter of great urgency."
"We all know the reasons why the situation affecting Montenegro is a complex one and we should not, for obvious reasons, delay this matter any further."
"I therefore propose producing a simplified report so that we can vote on urgent procedure."
"Mr Wynn, chairman of the Committee on Budgets, asked for an opinion, has the floor."
"Mr President, we are in a strange situation because a decision was taken in the groups before the Committee on Budgets had decided on this issue of Montenegro."
"Also, I have not had a chance to speak to my good friend Mr Westendorp."
"I believe that the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy is sympathetic to the position of the Committee on Budgets, which I am about to state."
"However, since I have not spoken to him directly, do not quote me on that - it is only second-hand information."
"Firstly, I should like to make it clear that the Committee on Budgets supports any aid to Montenegro."
"It has done so in the past and will do so in the future."
"On this occasion there is no urgency for this to go through now."
"The monies will not be made available until August for the first tranche and the second tranche will be paid at the end of the year."
"We are of the opinion that the relevant committees need to study the details of this proposal."
"Whichever the lead committee is - Foreign Affairs or Industry - we would merely give an opinion, but those committees and Parliament need to evaluate these proposals."
"We should not be bounced into a decision because the Council deems it to be necessary."
"As for budgets, our main concern is where the money is coming from."
"It is great to make proposals but we feel this urgency should not be agreed upon until we know where the money is coming from."
"We should leave it until next month."
"The committees can debate it and we can vote on it at the June part-session."
"Thank you Mr Wynn."
"That is a very sensible opinion."
"Mr Newton Dunn, vice-chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy has the floor to explain his committee' s opinion."
"Mr President, we have not discussed it in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, but my personal view is that we should not accept urgency now."
"Mr President, in my opinion, this proposal has been submitted under rather strange procedural circumstances."
"Despite this, as speaker on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, I am of the opinion that the urgency is such that we need to take it extremely seriously."
"Accordingly, regardless of the mistakes in the procedure, I have to say on behalf of my group that we would like to support this request for urgent procedure after all."
"I also have a feeling that other groups in this House from the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy share the same view."
"It might be helpful to verify this."
"Mr President, I am in favour, although I take the view that it is not quite as urgent as the Council makes out."
"However, it would be an insult to the people of Montenegro if we rejected this urgency today."
"Montenegro is in great danger, especially from Belgrade, and I think we should send out this signal."
"However, we should wait until the Commission finally tells us where it intends to find the money."
"It cannot take it away from Bosnia."
"It cannot take it away from Kosovo."
"It needs to tell us where it intends to find the money and if we reach a decision on this today, we must carry out an evaluation half way through and say what has happened to the money and where the second tranche is to come from."
"Mr President, firstly, I am against the urgency for the reasons expounded by the chairman of the Committee on Budgets."
"There is, in fact, no urgency because the money would be released for August."
"Secondly, if we look carefully, in the line which has been applied until now, there are still EUR 20 million which have not been used."
"Therefore, there is no uncertainty and no urgency and we can study this issue again, calmly, at a later date."
"(Parliament agreed to urgent procedure)"
"2001 Budget - Parliament' s estimates"
"The next item should be the presentation by the Commission of the preliminary draft budget for 2001."
"Unfortunately, the Commissioner has not yet arrived, although she is on her way."
"I therefore propose that we examine the next item on the agenda."
"The next item is the report (A5-0121/2000) by Mr Ferber, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the estimates for the European Parliament' s income and expenditure for the financial year 2001."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it would truly have been a great honour to speak directly after the Commissioner' s presentation of the Commission budget 2001."
"Instead, I have the honour of presenting Parliament' s budget before the Commissioner presents the larger budget to us."
"As rapporteur for Parliament' s budget, I am in a position to submit a proposal to you which, in my view, has three main features."
"First, and I set great store by this, the budget which we have prepared for you is a highly economical one."
"Secondly, we have learned our lessons from the justified complaints of the Court of Auditors and the Committee on Budgetary Control, for which we are all to blame."
"Thirdly, and this is a particular matter of concern to me, we have strengthened the European Parliament as the institution which represents the interests of the citizens of Europe."
"What have we focused on in Parliament' s Budget 2001?"
"I should like to outline this briefly with reference to five main points."
"First: in the area of buildings policy, and this is an extremely important point, we must draw the right conclusions from the objections raised by the Court of Auditors."
"In other words, first, we must make the remaining payments in Brussels as quickly as possible - and we are putting the conditions in place for this - so that we can reduce costs - that is particularly important to the taxpayer - and, secondly, we must solve the problem of Strasbourg, of this building here, in a way which does not give cause for complaint."
"Both are provided for by figures in the draft budget."
"Secondly, we must also exercise extreme restraint in the area of staff policy in the coming year."
"We cannot allow Parliament' s staff numbers to increase exorbitantly just because there is some financial room for manoeuvre."
"And we must also solve the problem of promotion in the autumn in a way which is acceptable to all institutions."
"Thirdly, we must prepare ourselves for the enlargement of the European Union and this applies to Parliament even more than to the other institutions."
"However, this does not mean - and this is a particularly important point - that we will decide as early as next year on which new languages we can offer in our interpreting services and therefore which countries will be allowed to become members of the European Union in the first round and which will not."
"That is the wrong way forward."
"It is not the job of the budget to make such fundamental political decisions."
"They need to be taken elsewhere; in other words, we do, of course, need to talk to language schools in the candidate countries and we must develop and build up programmes, but we must also, of course, be clear that we cannot anticipate decisions which need to be taken at a political level first."
"I am pleased to see the Commissioner is now with us."
"I have taken over your role insofar as we are discussing Parliament' s budget first and shall then move on to the Commission' s budget."
"No I do not want your job, only you can do it, the role reversal does not stretch quite that far!"
"Fourthly, we must take account of the increase in the responsibility of the European Parliament since the Amsterdam Treaty entered into force."
"The current Members of the European Parliament have more responsibility and more work in comparison with all their predecessors than ever before and naturally that also makes itself felt when it comes to preliminary work and technical equipment."
"I should like to thank everyone who supported me in this matter of concern."
"My fifth point is that this increased responsibility must also find expression with regard to groups in the European Parliament."
"I want to see a political parliament fighting for just causes and that means widening the basis for group work; it also means - and I make no bones about the fact - limiting the official services of the European Parliament."
"That is the only way of achieving a parliament with an enduring public profile."
"I was pleased to note that the Bureau of the European Parliament is thinking along the same lines and that one of the vice-presidents from my group is preparing a report on the subject."
"That is the right way forward."
"I have taken note of the amendments to my report proposed by my fellow delegates with a great deal of interest."
"I hope you will understand that I can support very few, because they no longer follow, in fact, they abandon the line which I presented in the Committee on Budgets and which was adopted by a majority in the committee."
"We must prepare for enlargement, but we do not need to start recruiting interpreters from the candidate countries as early as next year."
"Even the buildings policy must be considered with a view to enlargement, but I see no need to do so in the Budget 2001."
"We need to be a bit more realistic in our approach to the important question of enlargement."
"We moved into a new building in Brussels three years ago, we moved into a new building here in Strasbourg a year ago and if we tap the taxpayer on the shoulder again so soon after and say we need more buildings, more office space, he is only likely to agree to so much."
"We need to take account of that in our calculations."
"A budget with EUR 987 million is not very much in comparison to the budget of over EUR 90 billion which the Commissioner will propose shortly, but this is the taxpayers' money and we must take our decision as the trustees of that money."
"The taxpayer expects us to take a prudent approach not only when we draw up the budget, but also when we implement and carry it out."
"We shall have to discuss this again in September during the first reading of this budget, once all the documents from the budget discharge procedure have been submitted."
"I should like today to thank the Bureau of the European Parliament, especially the vice-president responsible for budgetary questions, Gerhard Schmid, for their constructive cooperation, especially during the conciliation procedure between the Bureau and the Committee on Budgets."
"My thanks also go to the corresponding departments of Parliament' s administration for their prompt and conscientious preliminary work, without which this set of figures could never have been drawn up."
"However, I should also like to extend my special thanks to my colleagues in the Committee on Budgets for their fair cooperation."
"Bringing divergent opinions together to a consensus, mostly with too little time to spare, is not always easy."
"So my compliments to all my comrades-in-arms and finally, of course, a heartfelt thank-you to the secretarial staff of the Committee on Budgets for having prepared everything promptly and reliably in these difficult times."
"I think I can present you with a budget which has earned Parliament' s confidence."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on the excellent work that he is doing for our House in terms of getting value for money out of our budget."
"It is not right that we should be expecting the Commission to do a whole range of things in putting their House and their budget in order unless we also take the same kinds of rigorous steps."
"The approach which has been taken is absolutely correct, not only in making sure that we do not simply give money away if we have a little spare in the budget, but also where we have asked the Secretary-General of Parliament to come forward with a number of reports: for example, in paragraph 6 of the resolution where we have asked the Secretary-General to look at and identify job needs in the same way as the Commission so that we can match job needs to the staff which we have available in the longer term."
"That quite clearly is a way of long-term planning which is very sensible at this stage of Parliament's life."
"There are three things which I would like to emphasise in particular in this Parliament Budget 2001."
"The first is a plea from an individual parliamentarian that we should make sure that we have a date firmly fixed for the second network computer in our offices."
"It is a matter of frustration for many of us that our staff can access the net with their computers, of course, Parliament's computers, but if we as parliamentarians bring in our own computers, we do not have a place to plug them in and work effectively."
"It is important to have a date when this facility will be available to us."
"Secondly, on a matter of communication, under paragraph 21 of this resolution, I would like to draw the House's attention to the fact that we have on many occasions in these debates called for all Commission and Parliament offices in the Member States to work together within a European House framework by 1 January 2000."
"As we have now gone past that date and there are still one or two Member States, in particular my own, where Parliament and the Commission have different offices and where in terms of financing Parliament's office well over 70% of the expenditure goes on bricks and salaries, it does not leave much for communications."
"The sooner we can make sure that the image of the European Union is reflected by one European House, the better it will be."
"The last point refers to the question of the implications for enlargement."
"I would like to support what our rapporteur has said that we cannot suddenly leap into beginning to authorise posts for preparing enlargement if a political decision has not yet been taken; all the more so, because in Parliament's estimates, as I have understood them, we have in front of us an assumption that we are going to have more languages as a result of enlargement."
"Yet we have had no debate in this House to know how we are going to handle not a limited enlargement but an extensive enlargement following the Helsinki Summit late last year, with potentially 12 or 13 new countries, that is 27 - 28 countries with over 20 different languages."
"How, Secretary-General, are we going to handle this if we do not have some thinking from the Administration as to where we are going to put them all?"
"Are we going to have rooms which we are going to have to adjust for over 20 languages so that in every room where there is a discussion in this Parliament every person has the right to use their own language?"
"We are aware that in the last Parliament a lot of work was done on this by Vice-President Cot."
"His report was never released to Members."
"We never saw it as a report on suggesting how the hub and spoke system should work - the relay system for interpretation - nor, indeed, did we really have any thinking about the freelancing possibilities with modern communications where we can dispatch a large amount of our translation material to people who are in the Member States, rather than recruiting a whole range of people to come and work in Luxembourg as fixed and permanent employees of Parliament."
"Therefore, I strongly support the compromise which has been put forward by our rapporteur asking, by first reading, for the Secretary-General to come up with a strategy of how to handle the whole question of languages in Parliament and enlargement."
"I suspect the Commission might wish to do that as well, because it is a problem which rightly, in this amendment, relates to interinstitutional matters."
"I very much hope that the Socialist Group will change their mind, get their heads out of the sand and realise that this is the problem which we have to tackle and that it is better to do it now rather than later."
"Mr President, let me also start by congratulating Mr Ferber on a comprehensive estimate of Parliament's revenue and expenditure."
"I support the thrust of this report, which is in line with the policy of budgetary rigour, because the major challenges that this Chamber needs to address are greater accountability and transparency which will involve embracing institutional reform with vigour; secondly, the forthcoming enlargement of the Union and thirdly, a drive towards improving efficiency through effective budgetary control and better use of resources."
"Our main priority has to be to explain to European citizens what we are doing, why we are doing it and how we are doing it."
"We must win the confidence of the European taxpayer and we can only do this by improving accountability through simplifying - not mystifying - the work of Parliament, by reducing jargon, by improving the process of approving legislation and improving the legislative machinery and by making a clear connection between what we do here and how it benefits the individual."
"We are going a long way towards achieving this transparency through the introduction of activity-based budgeting and the proposal we have in this report to put appropriations for political parties in separate budget lines will contribute significantly to achieving this."
"These virtues are all the more important as we move towards the challenge facing the EU at the moment of enlargement."
"We in the Socialist Group strongly believe that the European Parliament should be giving every encouragement to candidate countries in their preparation to joint the EU."
"I have the impression that there are those in this House who appear to be frustrating this process of enlargement by placing unnecessary obstacles in the way and often using spurious arguments to limit the preparation for enlargement: for example, the rejection of the proposal to fill the 35 vacant posts in the language reserve between 2001 and 2002."
"The reason given, and also outlined by my colleague Mr Elles, is that we believe that this will pre-empt discussions with accession states."
"Do we seriously believe that this small step will influence all the institutions as to which countries are in the first tranche and which are in the second tranche?"
"Do we really believe that by committing less than half a per cent of Parliament's language budget the political decision will be made and taken out of our control?"
"I am somewhat confused and if I recall correctly, the rapporteur agreed previously and argued vigorously for setting up an interinstitutional recruitment agency in his last report."
"What is the point of approving a joint operation whilst at the same time we are preventing any recruitment of people?"
"I strongly favour planning properly for enlargement because experience has shown that there is a long lead-in time for the training of interpreters and translators."
"It is necessary if the admission of the new Member States into the Institution is to run smoothly from a language point of view."
"Of course I agree that we should not at any stage prejudice political decisions which have to be taken at a later date."
"On the other hand, we should avoid giving out discouraging messages to the applicant countries that are currently making great efforts to get themselves in shape to join the EU."
"I reiterate that we should not pre-empt any political decisions to be taken on enlargement."
"We need to plan and to be imaginative and to be creative as to how we prepare for enlargement because nothing will be more damaging to the EU if we make a bad job of enlargement."
"What we also need to do is have a vigorous implementation of reform to prepare for enlargement."
"Very recently the President of the European Court of Justice warned that it would be unable to cope with enlargement of the EU."
"The average time that it takes for a case to be heard has risen from 17 months in 1988 to 23 months last year."
"That is a very long wait."
"What we need to do is to have reforms, not just in the areas of staffing and procedures, but we also need to have a new approach in terms of buildings policy."
"It is vital that the preparations are made during the coming financial year to ensure that Parliament's buildings are able to accommodate new Member States of an enlarged EU."
"It is also important for provision to be made to set up information offices in the countries which have applied to join the EU."
"It is widely acknowledged that the systems that we have at the moment were set up for the EU when we only had 6 Members and they are creaking at the edges in terms of the Union of 15 Members."
"How are they possibly going to be effective with 25 Members?"
"It is important that we plan and prepare."
"I am a relatively new Member of Parliament and while I see a lot of good work going on in the committees, I am acutely aware that as a result of the new responsibilities in the Treaty of Amsterdam there is a need not just for individual support for Members but also scientific support for committees."
"Since the Treaty of Amsterdam came into force Parliament's workload has increased very significantly and it is important that this is taken into account in this budget."
"The Commission's Work Programme now incorporates a very large number of codecision procedures and these procedures have significantly increased our workload."
"If we are to convince the people of the EU of the importance of the European Parliament's work and persuade them to take it more seriously, we need to improve our systems of working."
"That is why I welcome the report's emphasis on the common statute for Members and assistants and I hope that we can adopt this as soon as possible."
"I have been disappointed by some aspects of the report's focus."
"It focuses too much on the minutiae of detail in sometimes preventing administrative changes in staffing and frustrating strategic vision."
"I am concerned at the wisdom of putting 30% of the appropriation into the reserve for security services as the rapporteur proposes."
"There is a contradiction in the rapporteur's argument."
"He has always focused on outsourcing of Parliament's services."
"Here we have an example of outsourcing that is not working."
"Rather than reducing the budget we should be looking at how we improve security services, and the question we should be asking is: should we have our own security services or should we be retendering it rather than just reducing the budget?"
"I am also disappointed that the report ignores one of the biggest inefficiencies we have."
"Members of the European Parliament are the only parliamentarians who have no say in the location of their seat."
"A seat on three sites is the most incredible waste of time, money, travel and transport."
"Surely, when we are looking at budgetary rigour we have the right to address this issue because until we do so the general public will be confused about what we are doing in so many places."
"It also confuses the roles of the organisation."
"Mr President, Mr Markus Ferber has produced an excellent report, on which I wish to congratulate him."
"The Parliament Budget is essentially an administrative budget, since wage costs constitute the largest item of expenditure."
"We are currently experiencing a significant period of change in administration, as we are aiming to introduce activity-based budgeting, to emphasise greater personal accountability and to improve the reallocation of resources."
"This is why, last year, Parliament approved an appropriation of EUR 300 000 for this year' s budget for the investigation of the efficiency and improvement needs of parliamentary administration."
"Mr President, this is why it is somewhat surprising that already at this early stage, i.e. before the investigation has even started, important decisions are being made on administrative development."
"In the Budget, appropriations for wages are being increased by an enormous 12.2 %."
"This increase is so huge that no other institution could even contemplate an increase of administrative costs of this magnitude."
"Already, at this early stage, the intention is to spend this increase on the creation of 33 new posts and, apparently, 12 more will be created as a result of the amendment by the Bureau."
"For the sake of comparison, I would like to refer to the 1995-1999 period, during which Parliament established a total of only 11 new official posts."
"It is worthy of special mention that in this proposal, a new post is even being created for the Financial Control Department, despite the intention to abandon prior inspection altogether."
"In addition, the Budget contains a significant number of new staff promotions."
"Such being the case, I cannot agree with those who claim that a policy of budgetary discipline has been observed in the drafting of this Budget. On the contrary, this Budget is uncommonly slack, and this will make it difficult to gain the approval of the general public."
"Mr President, it is necessary in this context to address the issue of the policy of the European Parliament in its capacity as an employer."
"Administrative reform, activity-based budgeting and downward delegation of accountability require consultation with the staff."
"Reallocation of resources is necessary, and consequently also reform of staffing regulations."
"Thus it would have been proper to save for the future such tools and opportunities for negotiation, with which these reforms are supposed to be furthered, and to refrain from granting new benefits before there has even been an opportunity to negotiate comparable administrative reforms with the staff."
"Mr President, I too would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur for his report and for facilitating open communication."
"Mr Ferber' s report does not just contain political aspects but is in fact largely composed of administrative aspects."
"I will start by quoting and commenting on a number of political statements."
"My group wholeheartedly agrees with the line taken in the report that the Council and Parliament should draft a statute in the short term and should do this in joint cooperation."
"They should compile a statute for the Members of the European Parliament, and, independently of that, a statute for the Member' s assistants."
"We support this and hope that it can be brought to a conclusion during the course of this year."
"The report also contains a political comment regarding the separate budget lines required for the parliamentary groups on the one hand and the European political parties on the other."
"We must avoid hidden subsidies for European political parties at all costs."
"We all know that it will be some time before a statute is drawn up for the European political parties and I welcome the fact that, in the meantime, the Secretary-General has been asked to establish transparency in the use of appropriations by the parliamentary groups and the political parties."
"Quite apart from this, the report also covers many administrative aspects."
"For example, we have been asked to pass judgement on the fact that the Directorate for Committees and Delegations must comprise five A posts, two B posts and one C post, and that one A post and two B posts must be added to the Directorate-General for Personnel."
"It is not because I am new, I think, that I have great difficulty in passing judgement on this."
"In my opinion, it is mainly up to a manager to take responsibility for the precise detail of personnel policy."
"It is also very difficult for the groups if it is decided in the plenary how many additional posts are to be created within the political groups."
"Surely, a great deal depends on the organisation of your group and maybe not every group wants to work in exactly the same way."
"I think that we should really re-think the system."
"I understand that during the reform of Parliament, consideration will also be given to allowing groups to take responsibility for their own affairs and I wholeheartedly support this."
"I would also like to comment briefly on the support which has been requested for the parliamentarians."
"We have agreed that a study will be carried out which will also be linked in with a study commissioned by Mr Rothley into what exactly it is that the parliamentarians need in the way of support for their work."
"I struggle somewhat with the fact that we are running ahead of this study' s conclusions because we do not give our verdict on the Bureau' s conclusion in Mr Ferber' s report."
"The Bureau concludes that expenses for assistants should be increased by 20%."
"In failing to pass judgement on this, we are giving the impression that we have accepted it."
"I am not against this increase, in principle. What I do object to, however, is running ahead of the report and I am also opposed to it because I am sure that in September, it will transpire that we will need to prioritise various issues."
"For example, the rent we pay for the buildings may increase."
"We will need to decide whether we want to inject more funding into other institutions in preparation for enlargement."
"We will no doubt return to these points of criticism in September when we will have the precise figures in front of us."
"As such, it is not really a criticism but I do object to running ahead of a decision."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are discussing a report on the European Parliament, and I am astonished first of all not to see one of Mrs Stauner' s letters appended to this document because, as you know, she likes to get involved in our business even though her own activities are concerned with something completely different."
"Perhaps this is due to the fact that the rapporteur is a member of her own group and, for once, she is therefore confining herself to making observations rather than sending a letter."
"I find this rather strange, but perhaps she has not yet said her last word."
"We shall see, in time."
"What I want to say is quite simply this: the situation is nonetheless rather surprising."
"On the one hand, we have engaged in a policy of rigour resulting in all our budgets and discharges being obstructed by a Parliament that is rigorous to the extent of obstructing discharge to the Commission, and even obstructing discharge to the European Parliament itself, out of fear of problems, lack of endorsement or money wasting attributable to the duties of officials who are required to shuttle back and forth between Luxembourg and Brussels, costing the taxpayer a fortune."
"Yet on the other hand, in the Ferber report, Members of Parliament are awarding themselves fortunes."
"We are awarding ourselves a second computer, claiming that one is not enough."
"We are awarding ourselves a 20% pay rise from a zero-growth budget."
"We are awarding ourselves a 20% increase to the budget heading for funding for our assistants because we are more than anything afraid that the rules will stipulate that this contract will have to be accompanied by a statute which would specifically require welfare contributions to be paid, and so, as insurance against the worst case scenario, we are increasing this line by 20%."
"After checking up, I have not found a single budget item in the Community, whether in the field of humanitarian aid, research, or agricultural expenditure where there are plans for an increase."
"Moreover, generally speaking, the objective is to reduce the budget."
"But not in this case!"
"Within the European Parliament a second computer is being awarded, 20% additional expenses and, as the Court of Auditors was particularly tough on the political groups, a paragraph is included, which, I quote, ""Underlines emphatically the increased workload and the particular responsibilities of the political groups."""
"This paragraph does Parliament no credit."
"If we adopt an attitude, we cannot express any indignation at waste while at the same time putting forward a budget of this type."
"On behalf of the radicals in this House, I must inform you that I shall be voting against Mr Ferber' s report."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I am sorry that my good friend, Mr Dell'Alba, is not in agreement with the draft budget by Mr Ferber."
"We are in agreement and we are very happy."
"I believe that the rapporteur, in drawing up this draft budget for 2001, has been rigorous, has made optimum use of resources and has, at the same time, been imaginative and looked to the future."
"We congratulate him wholeheartedly."
"Ultimately, we are talking about a European Parliament for the 21st century, when we will have to face three fundamental challenges. We will have to respond to the MEPs' new obligations, as laid down in the Treaty of Amsterdam, incorporate new technologies into our work and react immediately to the huge administrative, organisational and political obligations presented by enlargement of the European Union."
"These three challenges faced by the European Parliament should be set in a context of great budgetary rigour and complete transparency in the use of public funds."
"We must consider - and the rapporteur has done this - what kind of Parliament we want in the future. Do we want a more administrative and bureaucratic Parliament or do we want a more political one?"
"Do we want a European Parliament that is centralised or do we want one which is compatible with a European Union which is becoming increasingly federalised but at the same time more subject to subsidiarity and decentralisation?"
"I believe - and I agree with him on this - that the rapporteur wants a Parliament that treats the MEPs' political work, both in Strasbourg and in Brussels, as well as in their individual political constituencies, as a priority."
"In this case it is necessary, as he says, for there to be new information points, new IT resources and new staff - if necessary - to help MEPs carry out their bureaucratic tasks."
"I hope that in September new appropriations will be provided for these lines."
"I am very glad that Mr Ferber has reacted to the report of the Court of Auditors on the funding of the political groups."
"An independent budget line will allow us to present a clearer and more transparent public image until we finally have a statute for the European political parties."
"Let us not forget that these parties are the cornerstone of European democracy and there must be no doubts as to whether they are being funded in the correct manner."
"We fully agree with the rapporteur' s view concerning the linguistic staff necessary for enlargement."
"We must initiate the preparatory administrative measures. Six new countries - with at least five new languages - in 2004 means that we will have to make a great effort to adapt."
"In order to fill these vacancies, we will need to know the exact order in which the candidate countries will join the Union, and that is something that cannot happen now or in this budget."
"We therefore support all Mr Ferber' s amendments."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by expressly welcoming Mr Ferber' s report in its broadest outlines."
"We have enjoyed extremely positive collaboration over recent weeks and months, cooperation marked by the fact that we expressed our opinions in no uncertain terms on the points where we diverged widely, but when you can reach a common line, then that is the path you should take."
"The challenge which faces us has been described."
"One can in fact do no more than repeat it."
"In the wake of Amsterdam - and I say this now in anticipation of what is yet to come in relation to this Parliament - we must reconcile the powers which Parliament now has with its potential, because at present they do not stand in a very balanced ratio."
"We must ensure that we can achieve equality in arms with the other legislative authority, namely the Council, both in respect of the scientific service and scientific research."
"We cannot allow the potential of this democratic and directly-elected Parliament to lag behind what the Council can do."
"If we take our work seriously, if we take ourselves seriously, we must operate under the same conditions so that we really can stand up for ourselves."
"There is no point in the President of our Parliament just putting her mark at the bottom of the page."
"That is not enough; it is the work beforehand which is crucial and it needs to be carried out seriously and it needs to be carried out well."
"In this respect it is both right and important - and I expressly disagree with Mr Dell'Alba here - that we prepare ourselves properly."
"Nor can there be any question of exorbitant cost increases now."
"Mr Dell'Alba knows full well that, thanks to a clever buildings policy - let there be no mistake about that - we have been able to release considerable funds over recent years."
"Having scrimped and saved this money ourselves, we then need to use it to good purpose."
"To good purpose means improving the potential and capabilities of this Parliament."
"We are still within the 20% margin which we set ourselves and we are keeping to it."
"At no point do we go over Parliament' s 20% share of administrative costs."
"I think that shows that our approach is very serious here and we do not want to promise any cloud cuckoo land."
"Another challenge before us - admittedly we have been pushed into action here by official discussions in various quarters - is the need to bring some transparency into this Parliament."
"We shall accept this responsibility and take up this challenge."
"Not because we are afraid of being forced to do so."
"No, we want the public to know that we have nothing to hide here."
"We are endeavouring to create a serious basis for what we do here, i.e. financing for the groups, and we want a set of rules so that the European political parties and party organisations can raise funds."
"You cannot call for this sort of development at European level without financing the basis commensurately, that is quite right."
"The basis must be clearly visible so that our citizens know what money is going where."
"We shall do everything we can to make progress on this point and to bring more transparency into the process, so that everyone can see what money is going where and can judge if it is appropriate or unsuitable and criticism can then be levied where criticism is needed."
"And it is needed."
"However, we must head off criticism on procedural grounds or because we have accommodated certain sums under various budget headings."
"Transparency is needed here and, as we said last year during the budget debates, we have our work cut out here."
"Allow me to comment now on the question of enlargement, because that is the only point on which we disagree with Mr Ferber and, above all, with our colleagues in the PPE group."
"What worries me here is that Mr Stoiber' s visit to your group last week had a greater impact than we all feared."
"My next comment is addressed to my honourable friend, Mr Pöttering: it was you who said at a European Union conference ""onwards and upwards"" , and that enlargement should be speeded up for political reasons, because we cannot afford to put it on the back burner."
"But, when we are specifically called upon to move forwards, we should do so decisively."
"I know that the issue of when and how enlargement should take place can be the stuff of first-rate political debate, a debate which could set the axe at the very roots and I call for extreme caution here."
"As far as specific preparations are concerned, we need, for example, to make preparations for more buildings."
"And if you do not start looking for buildings, for example in the candidate countries, until things are so far down the road, you will be faced with prices which make your hair turn grey."
"So we need to get our act together and make preparations which allow for sound financial management."
"As far as preparing for new languages is concerned, if you read the Cot report, called for by the honourable Member of your group, Mr Elles, you will see that we shall have an additional 460 language combinations in the future."
"According to one estimate, this will mean another 500 translators and interpreters."
"Do you expect us to believe that you are suddenly going to jump up like a jack in the box with a list of people who are highly specialised in Estonian, Latvian, Czech, in all these new languages which we shall have?"
"No, preparations need to be made now."
"And in order to avoid falling into the trap, as Mr Ferber rightly explained, of taking administrative decisions which anticipate political developments, we must, of course, ensure during the course of the year that we have a precise discussion on the distribution of these posts between the various languages."
"We shall support the release of the Cot report - that is one part of Mr Elles' motion."
"We are in favour of discussing this during the course of the year, but we are expressly against saying as of now that we refuse to fill the 35 posts."
"That would be frivolous and would send completely the wrong signal to the Member States and to the people who hope to become an integral part of the Union."
"Mr President, allow me to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Ferber, for the good work he has done."
"There is a lot in this report which has been well thought-out and which it is very easy indeed to support."
"I want to talk about an issue which, in the long term, will be very important for Parliament and for the EU as a whole and which many Members have already touched upon here today, namely the language question."
"Rarely perhaps is the linguistic diversity of Europe seen so incredibly clearly as in a debate in this Chamber in which eleven different languages are being interpreted between."
"Naturally, this is expensive and time-consuming."
"Yet it has been assumed without question, throughout the history of the EU, that whoever is present here should be able, if at all possible, to speak their own language."
"A good deal in the report under discussion is based on the assumption that the EU will be enlarged by six new Member States in 2004."
"What is more, that may be an underestimate."
"A few days ago, the Commission said it was its own objective to be able to welcome ten new Member States by the year 2005."
"I am among those for whom the greatest challenge for the EU is an enlargement whose ultimate goal is the reunification of a Europe which has always been divided by artificial borders."
"I nonetheless believe that it is more realistic to proceed on the basis of the somewhat lower figure quoted in the report by the Committee on Budgets."
"Even that figure is awfully large, bearing in mind the number of new languages involved."
"Proceeding on the basis that there will be ""5+1 countries"" in the first round of negotiations - a lot can obviously happen during the next few years, but these six countries nonetheless have a two-year head start in terms of the negotiations - this means that five new official languages will be added to the eleven we already have at present."
"There is no question of these newly welcomed countries and their languages being treated any differently from the way in which the existing Member States are treated."
"It must equally go without saying that Hungarian, Polish or Estonian Members of this Parliament should be able to speak their own languages, just as we existing Members are entitled to speak ours."
"Nor can we put ourselves in a situation whereby a country with access to trained interpreters and translators can become a Member State of the EU, while another country which does not have professionals of these kinds cannot."
"That is precisely why it is so important that the issue is highlighted right now. That is what the rapporteur is doing, and I think it is excellent."
"We must not, in a few years' time, find ourselves in a situation in which the issue has still not been resolved."
"We should also be clear about the fact that things are happening very quickly right now."
"We are dealing with countries which are developing very rapidly, which means that we too must act quickly in order to have settled the language question by the time these countries join the Union."
"Mr President, I congratulate Mr Ferber on his report."
"These types of reports are never easy and he has done a good job."
"My only criticism is that Amendments Nos 4 and 5 should have been tabled in someone else's name for the PPE Group."
"By saying that I am being consistent: I said the same to Mrs Müller in the Green Group when she did that."
"I shall explain why shortly."
"Parliament demands that the Commission and the other institutions are prudent with taxpayers' money, and we think the same should apply to the European Parliament."
"As chairman of this committee, I have discovered that your loyalties are spread very wide."
"I have a loyalty to the committee, and when the committee takes a decision I feel duty-bound to defend that decision."
"I have a loyalty to the rapporteur, and that is why I have made the comments before because the rapporteur should reflect the opinions of the committee."
"I also have a loyalty to my political group which has given me this speaking time."
"This sometimes leaves me bereft of my own loyalties to myself and what I want to say."
"I was somewhat sympathetic to what Mr Dell'Alba was saying because we have to be careful of criticising everybody else if, at the same time, we are giving the impression that we are ignoring that prudency and just doing what we want to do."
"I am not saying that we have done that."
"However, if that is the impression we are going to give, we have to be very careful and realise the consequences."
"Having said that, the Ferber report has tried to balance the needs of Parliament coming into a new millennium - new needs, enlargement on the horizon - and to make it function effectively."
"Not all the decisions will be taken when we vote this report through."
"The first reading will be time when the final decisions are taken, and cognisance has been taken of that."
"When they see a budget of EUR 965m, the newspapers will easily deduce that is over EUR 1.5m per Member."
"The British newspapers will be full of GBP 1m per MEP - that is what they cost!"
"However, we are trying to reduce those costs, especially on buildings."
"If people would look at what is being done with the buildings: we are trying to reduce the payments over the shortest possible time, thereby reducing the total burden on Parliament's budget."
"One only has to look at paragraphs 15 to 18 to see how serious we are about the buildings policy."
"The policy of ramassage has been a great success for this Parliament."
"What we have done with the Belliard building may not be ideal but at least it is a step in the right direction, and it is now off our backs."
"Finally, one of the great problems in our institution is that we have no statute for Members, assistants or political parties."
"What is being proposed is to try to make some headway towards resolving those factors."
"- (PT) Mr President, the proposals put forward in the report that we are now considering interpret - or should interpret - the will of the European Parliament to prepare itself to meet the challenges facing the European Union."
"It has to be this way, as we have been through a tricky time, and there are permanent tensions and glaring contradictions."
"It seems that we expect everything and, at the same time, we expect nothing at all from the European Union' s priorities, as we can see from the level of budgetary transposition - or lack thereof."
"It is our ability to take advantage of something that could potentially transform tensions and to reduce the amount of contradictions which will make the difference between the stagnation and the consequent decline of the project and the dynamism that its implementation requires."
"Have the competences of the European Parliament increased substantially with the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam and the consequent extension of the codecision procedure to further areas of policy, for example?"
"If that is the case, we would have to provide Members of the House with a greater ability to carry out their mandate, more and better information and we would have to ensure that the political groups are more accountable and that the staff of the European Parliament is more efficient."
"Does enlargement require subtle changes in the membership and functioning of this Parliament?"
"If it does, then we need to prepare for them, anticipate the challenges and how to respond to them and not fall into a situation of 'wait and see' , which would leave us trailing in the wake of events that we can neither prevent nor influence."
"This applies to the European Union as a whole."
"We are at a turning point and, now that we have reached this point, nothing will be the same as it was before and things will not remain as they are now."
"Now that economic and monetary union has been achieved, the euro cannot be a point of arrival but a starting point, which, in time, will bring about and require further changes."
"Now that the process of enlargement has been launched, fundamental changes are required as well as renewed ambition."
"The need to make the economic sphere correspond to the political sphere is becoming increasingly clear. We are swinging between deepening and dilution, solidarity and selfishness, decisiveness and delay, coherence and contradiction and convergence and divergence."
"By increasing the influence of core principles, amongst which I would highlight subsidiarity and social and economic cohesion, we will be able to launch and see through new initiatives."
"I congratulate Mr Ferber on the care he has taken over this work."
"Mr President, as other colleagues have said, dealing with Amsterdam and preparing for enlargement are major challenges for this institution."
"As far as I am concerned - and we should be very clear about this - new challenges require new resources."
"As the rapporteur has indicated, you start by looking at existing resources and see where staff and resources which are under-utilised or no longer appropriate can be transferred."
"Once that has been done, in the new situation in which the European Parliament finds itself, there is no alternative but to expand our budget."
"I hear what Mr Wynn, the chairman of the committee, has said about prudence."
"Prudence is in danger of becoming a false goddess: if we put too much emphasis on prudence it will be at the expense of the efficiency and the effectiveness of this Institution."
"There is a delicate balance to be struck, and I know that in his report the rapporteur has striven towards it."
"I broadly welcome Mr Ferber's report."
"However, there are three fronts to which Parliament needs to pay more attention between now and September."
"The first, as other colleagues have mentioned, is the issue of languages."
"I had the honour of sitting on Mr Cot's working group on multilingualism."
"Frankly, if this institution wishes to continue to practise multilingualism - and perhaps that is a debate we should have - there is no alternative but to start recruiting now."
"If we leave it any longer, once we start enlargement we will not be in a position to continue multilingualism."
"The decision will be taken for us."
"We were almost in that position with Finnish at the last enlargement."
"As Members will notice, the Finnish interpreters do a good job speaking English and other languages because we could not recruit Finnish-speaking English interpreters."
"We shall find ourselves in that position again come the next enlargement unless we take hard decisions now."
"So I want Parliament to rethink the 35 language posts."
"The second area where we still have much to do as an Institution is informatics."
"We have come a long way, but there are further benefits to be obtained from informatics."
"In particular the President of the Bureau is looking at how to reach a position where every Member has a portable computer with access to the European Parliament's computer system so that, no matter where they are in the world, they can get their own committee reports, agendas and so on. That does not require a massive increase in investment but it does require new money - an increase in Parliament's resources."
"Finally, again, something I have heard you, Mr President, talk about: the issue of legal advice."
"The new Amsterdam situation means that when we pass amendments and resolutions in this Chamber we have to be more aware of the legal consequences as well as the political consequences of what we are deciding."
"We need to enhance the legal advice we have as a Parliament to support us through the conciliation and other procedures."
"Finally, I should like to make it clear that I am not asking Parliament to spend massive amounts of new money."
"However, to spend one or two per cent more in order to ensure that we remain effective is worth it, and we should look at prudence in the context of the wider demands of this Parliament."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Ferber, I should like to make a point of congratulating you on your report."
"Of course it is not the Commission' s job to evaluate individual proposals, but I would like to welcome the fact that Parliament is endeavouring to ensure that, in future, the buildings policy will reduce the burden on the budget from interest payments."
"Of course, I also welcome, from the point of view of interinstitutional relations, that your proposal has remained, as it were, within category 5 of the agreement."
"The agreement makes provision here for this joint estimate of personnel and administrative costs to be distributed between the institutions on the basis of a specific ratio and you have based your proposals on that distribution."
"I think that again shows that many aspects of the financial perspectives facilitate work and planning, especially where firm agreements are concluded between the institutions."
"Above all, however, what is important is that you have paid a great deal of attention in your report to the question of enlargement and staff policy in the translating and interpreting sector and, of course, the question of what measures are taken here is a highly political one."
"More importantly, preparations do, of course, have to be made and you have pointed out - even though the question looks somewhat different from the point of view of the individual institutions - that it should be a matter of interinstitutional concern to address the subject and find a solution."
"In this respect, congratulations once again on your report, especially on the fact that the report on the Budget 2001 looks beyond the Budget 2001."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"Presentation by Commission of preliminary draft budget for 2001"
"The next item is the presentation by the Commission of the preliminary draft budget for 2001."
"Commission. (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in February, the Commission debated the priorities for the European budget for next year and had the opportunity to discuss these priorities in detail with the European Parliament both here in plenary and, more importantly, in the Committee on Budgets and in the various trialogues between the Commission, the European Parliament and the Council which have taken place since."
"The Commission has used this debate as the basis for its preliminary draft budget for 2001, which it now has pleasure in presenting to you, as adopted by the Commission."
"As it is the first preliminary draft budget which I have presented, allow me to comment on the procedure and the timing."
"I think it makes a great deal of sense to debate priorities intensively first, before getting down to specific numbers. More importantly, I think it is most helpful to present the preliminary draft budget so early, thereby allowing time for intensive discussion."
"Now to the budget proper: as with every national budget, most of the figures in the European budget for a given year are determined by contracts, by previous decisions in past years and by legal bases in past years."
"This is particularly true of agricultural expenditure in the area of the organisation of the markets, the largest item in the budget, including in the Budget 2001, and of the Structural Funds and multiannual programmes, be they in research, youth measures or foreign policy."
"Despite the fact that figures are determined by previous years, the Budget 2001 also sets clear political priorities and, following discussions over recent months, I think I can say that the priorities in the Commission' s preliminary draft budget tally to a large extent with Parliament' s priorities."
"Take, for example, the priority under the second pillar of agricultural policy; the highest rate of increase in the Commission' s preliminary draft budget is for promoting the development of rural areas and I think that this in fact highlights that the Commission considers that we need to focus on the second pillar of agricultural policy."
"Secondly, economic policy prioritises the need to develop and promote Europe as a knowledge-based society, which is why the Commission' s preliminary draft budget has set a very large plus against research and a new edition of the programme to promote small- and medium-sized enterprises and, more importantly, contains a proposal to combine them with the promotion of technology, which was also a matter of concern to the rapporteur, Mrs Haug."
"Access to new technologies is not very well developed in small- and medium-sized enterprises."
"Of course, with the economic structure which we would like to have and which is strongly supported by small- and medium-sized enterprises, and which we want to use to push Europe forward, it is necessary and it makes sense for Europe' s development in information and communications technologies to combine these two aspects."
"The preliminary draft budget also contains a new focus on foreign policy."
"We have already had the opportunity to debate this in great detail, especially assistance in the Balkans."
"Another priority which I should like to mention is the need for budgetary rigour in the European budget and the Commission' s preliminary draft budget is in line with this objective."
"So now a few figures on the overall budget."
"Without agricultural expenditure, the preliminary draft budget makes provision for an increase in commitment appropriations, i.e. the financial commitments which can be entered into, of 1% in comparison with last year."
"I think that this figure clearly illustrates that the preliminary draft budget is in keeping with the overall policy of budgetary rigour, and that the rate of increase in payments as a whole, without agricultural expenditure, is 3%."
"I should point out that the average growth forecast for the budgets of the Member States is 3.1%."
"I stress this because it will certainly play an important part during the debate with the Council."
"However, we have included a considerable increase in agricultural expenditure in the preliminary draft budget, namely 7.6% or, in absolute terms, a total of EUR 3.12 billion."
"This is mainly as a result of the resolutions passed by the Heads of State and Government at the Berlin Summit last year and these agreed financial perspectives form part of the interinstitutional agreement concluded last year between the Parliament, the Council and the Commission."
"I should point out that this figure for agricultural policy actually makes provision for the draft budget for agricultural policy to remain under the ceiling decided in Berlin because the Commission proposal includes shifting EUR 300 million from the agricultural budget to foreign policy, yet still there is such a high rate of growth for agricultural policy."
"To sum up, the preliminary draft figures as a whole make provision overall for a rate of increase of 3.9% in commitment appropriations and 5% in payments."
"The rate of growth of payments is higher because we have a large backlog of payment commitments and the Commission currently takes the view that this should not get any bigger; on the contrary it should be reduced, which is precisely why the rate of growth for payments needs to be higher."
"What does this mean for the European state quota?"
"By that I mean what proportion of the total gross national product of the European Community is absorbed by the European Union budget?"
"In other words, how high is the European state quota based on the strong growth in gross national product expected in the countries of the European Community next year?"
"There are very positive growth prospects here."
"Is the change in the ratio of gross national product to budget from 1.11% in the year 2000 to 1.07% in the year 2001 a step backwards?"
"I highlight this - we also have extremely intensive debates in the Member States on state quotas, which are between 40 and 50% - in order to illustrate the fact that the European budget accounts for 1.07% of the total gross national product."
"This clearly illustrates that the budget of the European Union is worth its weight in gold."
"The European Union acquired a new remit following the war in Kosovo and the resolutions on the Stability Pact in the Balkans."
"The Council stressed the importance of this remit once again in Lisbon."
"Now we have to provide the funds and so the Commission has presented a proposal in its preliminary draft budget which reflects the importance of this remit."
"EUR 815 million have been earmarked for aid to the western Balkans in 2001, following on from EUR 540 million this year."
"This is the aid which has been earmarked in order to reconstruct the civil society, i.e. it does not, for example, include expenditure by Member States for KFOR troops."
"Is expenditure of EUR 815 million for the entire region too high an estimate?"
"We have already discussed whether these countries are able to absorb this figure in the trialogue debate with the Council."
"I think that, to an extent, this debate is somewhat cynical because requirements are, of course, extremely high. But of course the political decision as to how much aid the budgetary authority wishes to provide from the European budget rests with the budgetary authority alone."
"I should point out that the proposal for Serbia for the year 2001 makes provision for a fixed sum of 40 million."
"The Commission has proposed that, if the political situation changes in Serbia, additional funds will be provided from the flexibility reserve."
"But I should like to stress once again that the Commission has made provision for a very large sum for Serbia in its proposed amendment to the financial plan for the period up to 2006, and I think that we should send a signal to Serbia, to the political opposition in Serbia, that the European Union is prepared to come up with large sums of aid if and when political democracy becomes a reality."
"This is the Commission' s first budget in the form of activity-based budgeting; in other words, all budget expenditure has been allocated to political areas."
"Now we can see at a glance how much is being spent on which political areas."
"I think that it is an important step in the direction of greater transparency and stronger public political debate to stop talking in categories, because apart from us here in this House and a handful of officials in the Member States and a few well-informed journalists, who knows what internal policies are, for example?"
"I think that ABB, i.e. this proposal, this new structure, will really make public political debate much easier."
"What is the European Union spending its money on?"
"This is therefore a very important step, not a technical step, but an important political step."
"I should briefly like to point out that the Commission proposal includes a proposal for a letter of amendment on the Budget 2000."
"More importantly, it also includes a whole series of technical adjustments and, in particular, the consequences of the annual accounts for 1999 for the European Union budget."
"The European Union budget for 1999 closed with a large surplus of EUR 3.2 billion."
"In other words, EUR 3.2 billion will be refunded to the Member States."
"These refunds will be offset against the contributions for this year."
"Of course, all Member States will be included and the money will be refunded in the ratio to which the Member States finance the European Union budget. There was some confusion in relation to Great Britain in the report."
"I should point out that the refund was offset but a different figure was obtained because of the rate of the euro to the pound."
"Great Britain' s contribution in euros appears to be higher than in the plan, but if the calculation is carried out in pounds, it appears to be different."
"So we need to take a good look at the question of exchange rates in the European budget."
"I have highlighted this balance in order to illustrate - and this very point was raised in your debate on the European Parliament budget - that the term budgetary rigour is certainly not a concept which is foreign to the European budget and it is being applied."
"The next step is for the Council to examine the Commission' s preliminary draft budget and to draw up a draft budget for the year 2001."
"Of course this will be followed by intensive debate."
"I trust that the rest of the procedure will be marked by less harping on about principles and more joint endeavour to use the funds in the European budget efficiently and for the benefit and in support of the objectives of the European Union."
"Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for your presentation. I should like to pick up straight away on your closing words."
"I do not think that we should harp on about principles during our discussion of the Budget 2001."
"But I also think that this is a call directed at the Council rather than a call directed at us, notwithstanding what has been submitted to us parliamentarians so far from the preliminary draft budget for evaluation."
"This leads me to say that, first and foremost, the Commission has taken account of the Council' s wish that it present as economical a budget as possible."
"You, yourself, said just now that the Budget 2001 is only 1% higher than the Budget 2000 without agricultural expenditure and we all know that agricultural expenditure accounts for a huge part of our budget."
"To then talk of rigorous financial management to us alone is, of course, completely misplaced, especially as we here in Parliament are in favour of economical financial management."
"The debate and the budgets which we have voted in the past demonstrate this and that is the way it should stay."
"Allow me to remind the House: agricultural expenditure for the organisation of the markets is to rise by 7.6%."
"Expenditure on rural development - and you stressed that we of course set great store by rural development - is to rise by 10.1%."
"On the face of it, these relative figures alone, i.e. the percentages, are highly satisfactory."
"But we all know that market expenditure in the current budget is over eight times higher than expenditure on rural development and that market expenditure in the next budget will be over nine times higher than expenditure on rural development."
"This may take account of the wishes of the Council and of Council' s decisions, but it does not take quite such good account of the wishes of Parliament."
"It is through Category 3, which encompasses all our priorities - not only Category 3, Category 4 also of course - but it is mainly through internal policies that all citizens perceive the European Union."
"When you see that the budget has been set at around EUR 6.13 billion and then you compare that with market expenditure, then you see that market expenditure is six times higher than the whole of Category 3."
"Knowing that four-fifths of all expenditure is tied in with multiannual programmes, and that, of course, 80% of all these multiannual programmes are decided under the codecision procedure, then the 1.4% increase proposed by the Commission is purely and simply the effect of the increase in research expenditure."
"Nevertheless, you want to increase this expenditure by 8% and research expenditure accounts for over 60% of Category 3."
"I know that the Commission is endeavouring to take account in the budget of the priorities it has accepted, namely creating a knowledge-based society and improving the quality of life of our citizens."
"So far so good."
"We can support that."
"But what about Parliament' s priorities?"
"We discussed our priorities well in advance both among ourselves and with the Commission, and we adopted our guidelines well in advance, including for Category 3."
"You have just picked out a few points but when we see that education and youth policy are to rise by 1.2% then we must say - looking at the entire heading - that that is because next year is the European Year of Languages and the expenditure for it will rise by 275%."
"That is perfectly normal and we have supported that."
"If you look at the Culture and Audiovisual Media heading, there is a 2.7% increase."
"I would have expected it to be higher."
"Information and communications have risen by 4%."
"But what about social dialogue and employment - down 4.7%."
"What about energy policy, which we have fought for tooth and nail time and again?"
"You have cut it by 8.2% and you have cut environmental policy by a hefty 28.2%."
"To my mind, the preliminary draft budget, as it now stands, takes no account of Parliament' s priorities."
"Mrs Schreyer, what I personally hold dear to my heart, namely innovation and supporting small and medium-sized enterprises - yes, you have put a figure in the budget for this, but you have cut what we still had in the last budget by nearly 70%."
"We urgently need to discuss this so that the budget also clearly sets out our priorities."
"I have just this to say about Category 4: I think it is asking for trouble to support Serbia with such a small amount in 2001 and, at the same time, to say that once Serbia has democratised we can again use our flexibility instrument."
"And one last comment which cuts across both Categories 3 and 4: what about the timetable on the legal framework for the offices for technical and administrative support or transformation promised by you and Commissioner Kinnock?"
"You wrote to us last December saying that a proposal would be submitted in the middle of April."
"We are all dying to see it."
"It is now the middle of May and we hope that it will make an appearance shortly because it is also important for our budgetary procedure."
"Thank you, Mrs Haug."
"Remember that you will have many months ahead to discuss this matter and to speak at length."
"Furthermore, this is simply a dream on the part of the Commission."
"The serious discussion will begin in July with the Council' s draft."
"Mr President, Mrs Haug attended the Detlev Samland school of speaking to the clock and just carried straight on, as Detlev always used to."
"Though we are talking about a PDB for the year 2001, it is somewhat difficult not to link it to the revision of the Financial Perspective."
"I know we should not do so, but there is that link between the two which makes me want to comment on both."
"For the Commission proposals to be successful three factors will be crucial."
"The first is the assessment of needs for the western Balkans."
"In a couple of weeks' time, Parliament will send an ad hoc delegation to Kosovo to try and make an assessment."
"We will need to opt for the Commission proposal of EUR 5.5 billion in total or move towards the Council which is proposing a somewhat lower figure."
"The second factor will be Parliament's attitude to redeployment, especially in Category IV, not just for 2001 but for the whole of the Financial Perspective."
"That is why I say they have to be linked."
"I will give you an example."
"One area of great interest for me - I make no secret of it - is South Africa."
"The proposal to take EUR 2 million per year away from South Africa for six years may not seem much."
"But EUR 12 million is a lot of money for the projects in South Africa."
"I would not be happy with that and I am sure other people in other areas of interest in Category IV would adopt a similar attitude."
"Then we have Parliament's attitude towards redeployment in Category I. Similarly, we have to consider our approach to the use of the flexibility instrument if it was invoked for Serbia, as you suggest."
"We have to bear in mind what the Interinstitutional Agreement says about a rule not being used for the same things in consecutive years."
"Once again that would be a challenge for Parliament."
"The third factor, and probably the most important one, is the attitude of the Council."
"If they reject what you are proposing, especially as far as the revision goes, the question remains: what will you do next?"
"I know we have a trialogue and a conciliation before their first reading but it is a problem we have to resolve before the Council's first reading."
"What happens if the Council is adamant and rejects the Commission's proposals?"
"Mrs Schreyer, you are something of a juggler and an illusionist at the same time, with the proposals that have been made."
"You have to keep several balls in the air and, at the same time, because of what is proposed after 2003, you have to make more appear."
"One of the great mysteries in your proposals on the revision is where the money will come from after 2003."
"But that is not for next year."
"That is for the future."
"In the meantime we await developments on those three factors."
"Hopefully, at the end of this process, we will get a satisfactory outcome."
"Protecting the Communities' financial interests and the fight against fraud"
"The next item is the report (A5-0116/2000) by Mr Bösch, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the 1998 annual report by the European Commission on protecting the Communities' financial interests and the fight against fraud."
"Mr Dell'Alba has the floor on a point of order."
"Mr President, I should like to ask a preliminary question, pursuant to Rule 143."
"The fact is, I think that tolerance can only be taken so far, and that it is no longer acceptable for a parliamentary committee to set itself up as a public welfare committee, going into anything and everything with every report, setting forth considerations which are far removed from the subject under consideration."
"Some 80% of this report entitled ""report on the 1998 annual report by the European Commission on protecting the Communities' financial interests"" , on the legal basis of Rule 47 of the Rules of Procedure, refers to OLAF, the White Paper, the reform, all sort of subjects covered by other reports, and even other committees, but has nothing to do with what Mr Bösch was supposed to be dealing with."
"According to my rights under the Rules of Procedure, I should like my preliminary question, which is a question of principle, to be put to the vote."
"The Committee on Budgetary Control must stop meddling wholesale, as has been the case recently, with the subject areas of other committees."
"We have seen rapporteurs, particularly Mrs Theato, obstructing documents outside their own area of competence for weeks at a time."
"Some of us are starting to become annoyed."
"In this specific instance, I move that this report be deemed inadmissible and that we move on to the report which is the next item on the agenda."
"I request that this be put to the vote."
"Thank you, Mr Dell'Alba."
"Allow me to remind the honourable Members by quickly reading Rule 143(1) out loud: ""At the beginning of the debate on a specific item on the agenda, its inadmissibility may be moved."
"Such a motion shall be put to the vote immediately."""
"According to the Rules of Procedure, one person may speak for and one person against the motion, after which it is put to the vote immediately without further debate."
"Mrs Theato, are you speaking against Mr Dell'Alba' s motion?"
"Mr President, I am somewhat surprised because this report was duly and unanimously adopted by the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"I would have expected such matters to be clarified in committee, rather than here in plenary."
"The report has been available for some time and I therefore see no reason why we cannot debate and vote on it."
"Secondly, I would be obliged if Mr Dell'Alba could tell me what he means by saying that I have blocked documents for weeks."
"I fail to understand Mr Dell'Alba' s choice of words and assertion and I would welcome an explanation."
"As no one wishes to speak for the motion, the vote shall now take place."
"(Parliament rejected the motion.)"
"Mr President, allow me to start with a few comments on the judgement of the Court of First Instance of 2 May on the rights and duties of the members of this House vis-à-vis OLAF."
"I welcome this judgement."
"It clarifies that, as elected representatives of the people, we may rightly claim a special status and that, in the event of doubt, protecting our independence takes precedence."
"That was my position from the outset, incidentally."
"That was why, during negotiations with the Commission and the Council, we made all the sensitive passages in the OLAF regulation subject to the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities."
"That was why we suggested last autumn in the Committee on Budgetary Control that the provisions for members should be kept separate from the provisions for officials."
"Unfortunately, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs did not subscribe to this view."
"I said from the outset that members' offices were off limits for OLAF."
"Obviously, the Commission' s legal service took a different view."
"Now it has been taught a lesson by the Court."
"However, the court judgement has put us in a position of inequality, because only the plaintiff can cite this judgement."
"This state of affairs may last for a ridiculous amount of time, perhaps until a judgement is returned on the main issue, which may not be for two years."
"I have therefore taken recourse to Rule 181 of the Rules of Procedure and proposed an amendment to the Rules of Procedure."
"The text which I have proposed is in line with the original proposal of the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"It keeps to the letter of the interinstitutional agreement with the Commission and the Council and takes full account of the stipulations of the Court of First Instance."
"I urge you to support this initiative to amend the Rules of Procedure."
"It would allow the matter to be clarified as quickly as possible and, I think, would even allow the members who took recourse to the Court to withdraw their action."
"If the proposed amendment to the Rules of Procedure is implemented, their action would, as a matter of course, be pointless anyway."
"This too is perfectly clear from the Court' s judgement. Parliament' s internal decision was out of order, but the Parliament and Council regulation of 25 May 1999 on the work of OLAF is here to stay and is not open to question."
"This is why I fail to comprehend why a number of proposed amendments to my report claim that the Court' s judgement has strengthened the position of the European Investment Bank and the European Central Bank in their opposition to the regulation."
"It is true that both banks maintain that the Parliament and Council regulation cannot under any circumstances be applied to them because this would encroach upon their independence."
"I totally fail to understand that; we have no intention of interfering in the banks' work."
"What we do want is to guarantee that they have a minimum degree of protection against fraud, or do they want us to end up using private detectives to carry out this work?"
"The European Court of Justice and the Court of Auditors have duly implemented the provisions of the OLAF regulation in corresponding internal decisions."
"They certainly would not have done so if they had felt that their independence was being jeopardised."
"Neither bank has a plausible explanation as to why they do not accept what the independent judges of the European Court of Justice have accepted."
"Three points on the content of my report."
"Point number 1 concerns OLAF as an investigation unit which identifies and investigates suspicious cases quickly and efficiently."
"The legal basis for this is in place."
"Together with the Council, we have done everything within our power."
"The development of OLAF is well under way."
"Point number 2 concerns the European financial public prosecutor who, in the initial stage, has the right to support the national courts in prosecuting criminal offences committed by officials or employees of the Union."
"Point number 3 concerns really effective disciplinary procedures."
"The Staff Regulations and Financial Regulation have long made provision for the competent decision-makers to pay for damage for which they are responsible out of their own pocket in cases of gross negligence or intent."
"This provision has never been applied."
"The Commission is planning even now to delete it from the Financial Regulation."
"That would be precisely the wrong signal."
"We urge the Commission to reconsider such a move."
"What is wrong with the present disciplinary procedures is that, of necessity, they lead to huge conflicts of interest."
"In the case of senior officials, the College of Commissioners decides whether or not disciplinary proceedings should be instituted and it is the Commission which passes the final judgement, at the proposal of a disciplinary board on which senior officials have to advise on the fate of senior officials, i.e. colleagues sit in judgement on colleagues."
"That cannot work and it does not work."
"As long as this system is maintained, the accusation will be made time and again, rightly or wrongly, that proceedings are open to manipulation."
"Nor will this change once the disciplinary board becomes an interinstitutional board, i.e. a board of officials from various institutions."
"It will only change if the Commission takes up the proposal of real externalisation, as agreed by the House in the vote on the Hulten report on 19 January, in which Parliament called for disciplinary proceedings in the case of infringements of the Financial Regulation to be referred to an external chamber of the Court of Justice or the Court of Auditors so that proceedings are objective and fair beyond doubt."
"We even stipulated in this report that the Chamber should form part of the Court of Auditors, with the Court of Justice sitting in appeal."
"The report also includes a number of points from the White Paper on the reform of the Commission in connection with OLAF."
"And yet I have just heard from some quarters that we should postpone a decision on these points and not take a stand on them just yet."
"Except that the Commission wants to implement all the points addressed here before the summer recess."
"If we do not take a stand on them now, then we can spare ourselves the trouble altogether."
"One last word to Mrs Schreyer: I know from conversations last week with the members of the OLAF Supervisory Committee that the recruitment and appointment procedures for OLAF are proceeding too slowly."
"Clearly one reason for this is that the Commission is obviously proving to be too inflexible, despite the fact that, on paper, it has transferred full powers to the director of OLAF in a decision in due and proper form."
"I can only urge you to stand by your own decisions and not create difficulties where none exists."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, I speak on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. I am standing in for the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee, my colleague Mr MacCormick, who is unable to be here today."
"In our Community, there is hardly anything worse than fraud to undermine public confidence in the activities of the Union, and so the views of the rapporteur deserve our full support."
"Fraud, of course, affects only a small fraction - i.e. just over 1 % - of the EU' s total budget, but it is a very serious problem which seems to extend to almost all political sectors."
"The EU budget, however, is largely administered within the Member States, and this is where huge potential for fraud exists."
"We must also remember that applicant countries, i.e. the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, should be involved in this fraud prevention process for the very reason that such a large share of the Community budget is administered within the Member States."
"So far, fewer than half of the Member States have ratified the protocol on protecting the Union' s financial interests. This process should therefore be speeded up considerably."
"Furthermore, some Member States are particularly unwilling to undertake the mutual exchange of information concerning fraud. Therefore it is important for Member States to have a direct obligation to report cases of VAT fraud, for example, to the Commission."
"It is quite appropriate to examine the possibilities of creating the post of public prosecutor, expressly from the point of view of the fight against fraud, and this should be done, but even that will be to no avail, if the Member States lack the political will to protect the Communities' financial interests."
"As far as OLAF' s position is concerned, it is important to protect its independence and equally important for the European Parliament to come to an agreement with OLAF with regard to the conditions on which Parliament can obtain information about its operations."
". Mr President, in the time available, I wish on behalf of the Economic Committee to stress three issues that we considered to be of cardinal importance when we examined the annual report on the Community's financial interests and the fight against fraud."
"First was the issue of definition."
"It is the case that the Commission have come under a significant amount of attention in recent years from Parliament and from the European public at large who want the Commission to deal with allegations of fraud, but it is also important that we should know what we are talking about when we define fraud."
"The annual report itself indicates that for the first time there has been an attempt made to try to assess what amounts to fraud and what is general irregularity, and I am of the view that it does not help the reputation of our European institutions if we are lax with definition."
"It is important that the work being undertaken by the Commission should be expanded because, in a situation in which 20% of irregularity amounts to fraud, the fact of the matter is that by referring to it as fraud and irregularity, European citizens can often be left with an impression that all of the claims are fraudulent ones."
"The second point that I want to make is about the commitment of Member States to deal with fraud."
"The fact of the matter is that Member States have a high responsibility here."
"They are responsible for administering some 80% of the EU's budget and they must recognise that they are, at the very least, partners if not prime movers in attempting to address this important issue, and the report indicates that the performance of Member States has been mixed to say the least."
"My final point concerns the accession countries."
"We must demand that the accession countries also endeavour to work in conjunction with the European Union and to the highest standards."
"Mr President, Commissioner, when deciding here in Parliament whether or not to grant discharge to the Commission, we check that there is no irregularity in expenditure by the administration."
"In the past - as we are now all aware - there have been irregularities within the Commission."
"Each report by the Court of Auditors also highlights the decisive role of the Member States in distributing Community funds."
"A number of errors for which the Member States are to blame occur during the distribution of funds, which makes us apprehensive, especially as a considerable percentage is the result of fraud."
"Consequently, it is not just within the Commission that we need to wield an instrument to fight fraud, which we call OLAF."
"OLAF is the outcome of the modus operandi of the Member States and the Commission and should take on an objective role precisely so as to get to the bottom of these errors and prevent them from arising."
"The EU must use European measures such as the introduction of the euro to prove its European competence to the outside world, because the accompanying counterfeiting industry, to name but one example, is an external matter."
"Nevertheless, deeper causes for error rates clearly lie in the different handling systems in the Member States."
"Right from the outset, legislative texts are often worded differently and allow perfectly legal but differing definitions of fraud."
"This opens the door to fraud."
"Just think of the example of the collection of value added tax."
"Under no circumstances should OLAF become nothing more than a help desk."
"OLAF is not one of your broadcasts for DIY enthusiasts, along the lines of ""How can we build a model railway?"""
"The issue should not be taken lightly."
"Protecting the financial interests of the Union and fighting fraud are a necessity, pure and simple, which call for a uniform instrument which can act independently, preventively, efficiently and as a deterrent, and which depend upon transparent regulations both internally and externally, so that everyone knows where they stand."
"I would like this financial instrument to have an additional name such as prosecutor, a broad-shouldered European financial prosecutor."
"This prosecutor must be accepted by the Member States, take on an active role and, at the same time, be integrated into the national jurisdiction of the Member States."
"I would remind you at this point that Parliament called for an external chamber for budgetary discipline in its resolution of 19 January."
"In my view this is a good idea and is not only worth considering, it is indispensable if we are to create a comprehensive area of justice and law."
"A neutral, objective judgement will serve the cause and the individual concerned, condemnation of colleagues by colleagues will not."
"OLAF is no Big Brother à la Orson Welles, but is limited in its remit by the rule of law."
"The immunity of members, for example, will of course continue to be protected."
"I call on the Intergovernmental Conference to take our concerns on board."
"We are fighting here for technical measures which, hopefully, will not turn into a long-running saga."
"We must concentrate once again on European values so that, for example, our money is not misappropriated for the drawing up of military measures."
"I know it is difficult to impart ideals and virtue to another person."
"But that is where our efforts should be concentrated."
"Because worthlessness soon turns into helplessness."
"- (PT) Mr President, the current year is the first in which OLAF is fully operational."
"It needs to be pointed out here that this is a decisive step in protecting the financial interests of the Union, the impetus for which came from this House and, in particular, from the Committee on Budgetary Control and from the present rapporteur, our colleague, Herbert Bösch."
"With an increase in staff, with a new structure and independence, all the conditions are now in place for OLAF to concentrate on fighting fraud in an area where the objective and verifiable figures point to a more serious situation."
"Fraud and other irregularities in the traditional own resources reported by Member States reached a total of EUR 538 million in 1998, an amount unparalleled in any other area of Community expenditure, either in absolute or relative terms."
"Special report No 9 of the Court of Auditors on the protection of the European Union' s financial interests in the area of VAT on intra-Community trade points to an even more serious situation."
"According to the Court of Auditors, the gap between actual receipts and their theoretical amount is EUR 70 thousand million."
"Unlike the main areas of expenditure, which the Commission monitors and on which it imposes a system of sanctions, there is nothing comparable in these two vital areas of the Community' s own resources."
"The Commission, specifically in its recent reports on administrative cooperation and on procedures for collection and taxation, describes a situation which is characterised by the maintenance of a system for VAT collection, which was only intended to be used on a temporary basis but is being used permanently. This system is also characterised by the increasing complexity of the system and by the widespread shortage of human resources and monitoring materials compared to the volume of transactions."
"Despite the fact that there is widespread agreement on the need to overcome the problems of fighting fraud which result from restrictions imposed by national legislation, or to the lack of a legal basis in Community legislation, the Commission' s proposals have not, until today, met with any response and the anti-fraud sub-committee in the area of indirect taxation has found it impossible, in the words of the Commission ""to achieve meaningful progress and cannot take the necessary decisions to improve the fight against fraud"" ."
"What is more serious than this is the fact that the Commission' s reports on VAT collection have been scandalously disregarded by the other institutions and have not been followed up to any degree by the Member States."
"Compliance with Article 280 of the Treaty, specifically where it requires the effective and equivalent protection of the Community' s financial interests will be dead letter unless we overcome the situation of there being a loophole in the law in the area of traditional own resources and VAT."
"The protection of the Community' s financial interests, and particularly those of the taxpayers, who comply, cannot continue to be disregarded when it comes to indirect taxation."
"Mr President, I too would like to start by congratulating Mr Bösch on his relentless efforts to turn OLAF into a success."
"There are many points in the present resolution which the Liberal Group can endorse."
"Firstly - and this cannot be repeated enough - we think that at the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference, a decision should be made in favour of setting up a European Public Prosecutor, which in its capacity as an independent body, will work to safeguard the financial interests of the European Union."
"We would call on the Commission to submit proposals to this effect as soon as possible."
"Also, the date mentioned in the report is important, in our opinion."
"We also endorse the proposal for an external chamber to enforce budget discipline, which will mainly be concerned with examining the financial liability of officials."
"In our opinion, it is important that this task is taken from the Commission, so as to take away any semblance of nepotism and such like."
"OLAF starts its first full working year this year."
"We will all have to wait and see what the outcome of that will be."
"Expectations are naturally very high."
"One aspect, however, could be improved on, namely the Supervisory Committee, as Mr Bösch calls it in his report."
"Everyone has a right to a defence, including those who need to be investigated by OLAF."
"We must see to it that these investigations are carried out as independently and fairly as possible."
"I would call on the Commission to submit proposals to this effect too."
"There has been a lot of publicity lately surrounding the issue as to whether or not OLAF should be able to investigate the European Investment Bank regarding the use of European funding, as well as the European Central Bank."
"The Liberal Group is of the opinion that this should clearly be the case as these are European institutions too."
"They cannot remain outside OLAF' s general scope of investigation."
"We support the Commission so as to make this possible."
"Finally, over the past few years, the European Court of Auditors has become increasingly aware that fraud and irregularities in structural funds are on the increase, whilst those in agricultural funds are still excessive but are dropping."
"This is diametrically opposed to the opinion held by the Commission, which believes that fraud and irregularities occur far less in structural funds than they do in agricultural funds."
"This anomaly must be resolved without delay."
"The structural funds are gaining in importance all the time and form a large area of investigation for OLAF and the Commission."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I too would first of all like to congratulate Mr Bösch on his sound report and, unlike Mr Dell'Alba, I think that Mr Bösch has indeed drawn the right lessons from OLAF' s annual report which was published late last year."
"We might as well admit it, there are a great many money-grubbers active within the European Union, and organised crime no longer concentrates solely on drug smuggling, the arms trade, trafficking in humans, meat fraud, alcohol and cigarette smuggling, VAT merry-go-round fraud and oil fraud, and has not done so for a long time."
"They are all forms of crime which cause serious harm to the EU' s budget, both on the revenue side and the expenditure side."
"We may have had a single market since 1993 which accommodates the free movement of goods, services, people, capital, as well as organised criminals, but this single market does not exist - and this is so unfortunate - for police services and magistrates alike."
"On my own behalf, I will therefore stick my neck out and endorse all paragraphs of the Bösch report which call for the setting up of a European Public Prosecutor' s office."
"I know it is a controversial issue, even within my own group."
"Despite this, I believe that such a European Public Prosecutor' s office should be set up."
"I would therefore ask the European Commission, as a matter of extreme urgency, to meet the request of the Bösch report to add an extra clause to the present OLAF regulation before 30 June, providing for a kind of trial project in which a European Public Prosecutor is appointed from within OLAF who can only act on behalf of members and staff of the European institutions."
"I entreat Commissioner Schreyer to give very specific answers to this request and would ask her whether she would be prepared to take any initiative in this matter before 30 June."
"Mr President, Mr Bösch's report deals clearly and relevantly with the problems bound up with protecting the EU' s financial interests and combating fraud."
"Fraud is a scourge as far as the EU is concerned."
"I do not know how large a percentage of the Member States' budgets disappears due to fraud and irregularities."
"In my own country, it is close on zero per cent, and I think that what we have noted in recent years in the EU' s accounts reflects the fact that common funds are not handled so carefully and meticulously as money which the States regard as their own."
"Mr Bösch's report goes a very long way towards representing the positions adopted by my group, most especially in its observations concerning the European Investment Bank and the European Central Bank."
"We have a problem in relation to appointing a European Public Prosecutor, whose office we would regard as an integral part of the federal EU we do not wish to see."
"We think that the problems highlighted can be solved at national level."
"We are quite clear about the fact that these provisions are aimed especially at the new Member States whose legal arrangements differ from those of the EU countries. We think, however, that this ought to be an incentive to engage in negotiations designed to promote cooperation between the legal systems."
"However, it is not, of course, by means of the present report that we are to decide this matter and, against that background, I should like to inform you that my group is voting in favour of Mr Bösch's report because we think that there are clear demands which Parliament is making here and with which the Commission must comply."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to emphasise the point I raised to the effect that, out of the 19 recitals and the 30 paragraphs of the Bösch report, there were only 11 recitals and 6 paragraphs to do with the subjects that Mr Bösch was supposed to be discussing."
"The other paragraphs are about something completely different."
"Important matters, I do not deny, but matters which have already been dealt with in the van Hulten report and the Theato report, or matters which will be dealt with when we come to discuss the White Paper, the reform and OLAF, with the judgement and the ruling of the Court of First Instance."
"I am astounded that Mr Bösch is pleased with this because he was one of the people who thought that Parliament' s text was fine and that OLAF was entitled to poke its nose in everywhere, though this is not the case."
"The European Central Bank was thus quite justified in saying that it was not very sure what authority OLAF actually had in this area."
"My criticism of the Bösch report, then, is the very simple reason that we have other instruments."
"A situation whereby the Committee on Budgetary Control' s many reports keep bringing up the same subject is not normal."
"Let us take the proposal for an independent Prosecutor."
"Mrs Theato attempted to have this adopted as a legislative initiative."
"She did not succeed."
"The Committee on Budgetary Control tried to do so, and Parliament rejected it."
"This is not a proposal for a legislative initiative."
"What, then, is the point of harping on all the time about something which is, obviously, a problem area?"
"Even though the fraud problem primarily affects the Member States, you wish to set up a special court, ad hoc courts."
"You know, Mr Bösch, in the past, in Italy and other countries, they had special courts."
"Probably in your own country too, and these were not exactly models of democracy."
"So I would adopt a more cautious approach."
"I think this report is a waste of a lot of paper."
"Mrs Stauner might well write another letter asking why so much money has been spent in order to repeat things that have been said already, Mr Bösch, but which it was not worth repeating."
"What is more, many of the amendments seek to remove paragraphs."
"We shall readily vote in favour of these because we must confine ourselves to the points included in the reports and it is high time that this practice, which is common to all the committees, were adopted by the Committee on Budgetary Control too."
"Mr President, Mr Bösch has prepared a good report on protection against fraud."
"We agree with the way in which the problems are described, but I do not believe that crime and theft are combated by establishing a common public prosecution service and common penalties and by appointing more inspectors within the EU."
"I believe that it is through transparency that irregularities can most effectively be cleared up: complete openness about the budget procedure, complete openness as to who has been involved in deciding upon an appropriation, complete openness about who the recipient of the appropriation is and complete access to all documents for the ombudsman and for the European Parliament' s and the national parliaments' auditors and supervisory committees."
"If it can always be seen who has obtained what, fraud will be revealed by journalists and a critical public - perfectly free of charge and with far greater preventative effect."
"I would therefore ask the Commissioners to promise us that, in future, Parliament, the Court of Auditors and the ombudsman will be allowed to see any document."
"What are we not allowed to see?"
"What is the ombudsman not allowed to see?"
"When will we be given a complete overview of all the committees and working parties, together with their members?"
"Will our rapporteurs be allowed to check on any payment from the funds?"
"Lack of transparency is the fraudsters' best friend and makes it more difficult to clarify matters."
"It is due to a lack of transparency that the new Commission too will, unfortunately, be concealing fraud instead of bringing every instance of it into the light of day and so deterring anyone else who might have the same idea."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we are dealing with the first report sent to us by OLAF and I would like to thank Mr Bösch for the excellent work he has presented to us."
"The most interesting parts of his work are surely those which refer to the subject of the report, that is to say 1998, and OLAF, the body which is presenting its first piece of work."
"I agree that this report perhaps prejudges certain aspects which should be subject to further debates in the Committee on Budgetary Control and in this House, but I would like to highlight the positive aspects of its contribution."
"With reference to 1998, I believe that we should recognise that, after having intensified the task of control, which should be initiated by Parliament and which OLAF carries out, the number of cases of fraud and irregularities has stabilised."
"Without relaxing our efforts to control expenditure - of which we have shown signs in the past - we can see that this stabilisation has been the result of an increase in control."
"We should therefore be pleased about this and hope that this work continues, so that cases of fraud can be reduced rather than merely stabilised."
"It is clear that, in fundamental fraud, there are discrepancies between what the Court of Auditors says and what OLAF says."
"In OLAF' s judgement, it appears that it is not in the Structural Funds that fraud and bad management prevail."
"It is other expenditure that we should be concerned about."
"In any event, returning to OLAF, by means of this report, we should, in my view, ask for OLAF to be provided as soon as possible with the officials which have been allocated to it."
"However, I think it is very important that, in this first stage - precisely because we are interested in control - we do not increase OLAF' s scope of activity so soon after it has begun its work."
"I understand that there are and there will be - although we hope that this is not the case - great problems with the counterfeiting of currency, trademarks or VAT."
"It is essential that we allow OLAF to continue to pursue its scope of activity little by little and that we expand its role at a later date."
"Finally, we should not duplicate responsibilities."
"In order to use resources correctly, one body should be responsible for each issue and we should not have a situation where everybody is responsible for everything."
"I therefore believe that we should clearly separate objectives and not allow confusion to reign."
"At the end of the day ""he that too much embraceth, holds little"", as we say in Spain, so if we want to manage control, we cannot all have the same objective."
"Mr President, I would like to join the many speakers who have congratulated Mr Bösch on his report."
"As usual - and as has already been mentioned - the annual report shows that in 1998 too, an excessive proportion of the European resources was not spent according to the rules."
"As usual, most irregularities pertain to expenditure in the Member States and vary in nature. The irregularities are partly caused by deliberate abuse of the regulations, partly due to errors in the implementation of European legislation or simply down to bad policy."
"I would like to distance myself somewhat from what Mr Mulder said on this score."
"The fact that so much fraud is being committed using agricultural funds is a sign that something is wrong with the way in which we organise our support for agriculture and this needs to change."
"The steps required to fight fraud have been mentioned on countless occasions, including today."
"I would like to highlight two."
"Firstly, there are still Member States that have not signed the Convention on the Protection of the Financial Interests of the EU."
"My own country is one of them and I hereby call on the Dutch Parliament to ratify the act which ratifies the Convention and which has been with the Chamber since October."
"In addition, it is also important that steps are being taken within the Intergovernmental Conference to appoint a European Public Prosecutor."
"To my amazement, I noticed that in one of the amendments to this report tabled by the PPE-DE Group, an attempt was made to limit the mandate of this public prosecutor, whilst I was under the impression that the PPE-DE was actually in favour of it."
"The PPE-DE Group would like to limit the European Public Prosecutor' s mandate to the European institutions only, while we have just seen that most fraud takes place within the Member States."
"The PPE-DE Group had better have a good explanation for this."
"We have made a new start with the independent OLAF."
"In my opinion, it is rather important for the functioning of OLAF that its work be open to public scrutiny, and for there to be set rules governing investigations, which are available for perusal by Parliament too. This will prevent us from running behind the facts in future, as is now the case with the 1998 discharge procedure."
"Mr President, my last point concerns the European Parliament itself."
"As you know, the Court recently decided in an initial ruling that OLAF only has limited access to the European Parliament."
"I regret that the Court has reached this decision and hope that it will arrive at a different decision in the final ruling."
"Meanwhile, however, I would like to make it clear that immunity for parliamentarians does not mean that we are above the law."
"If the Court' s final ruling stipulates that OLAF has no access to Parliament because the rules will not permit this, we must adapt our rules rather than overrule the decision, so as to grant OLAF access to Parliament, including parliamentarians, because, I repeat, we are not above the law."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this report is an excellent illustration of what should be done and what should not be done."
"As far as we are concerned, combating fraud is more than a priority, it is a commitment we have to the people who elected us."
"This principle has been emphasised all the more by the revelation of inefficiencies within the Community institutions."
"In this respect, our determination to implement sound management procedures beforehand that are capable, subsequently, of being monitored must be absolutely foolproof."
"In order to do so, we must focus on the effectiveness of the procedures set in place, particularly under OLAF."
"So, I beg you, please, do not try, for ideological reasons, to come and complicate matters, adding yet more structures and procedures."
"This is the reason why we are not in favour of creating a European Public Prosecutor' s Office."
"We must be able to have confidence in relying on the national structures."
"In fact, the proposal to create a European Public Prosecutor' s Department is unacceptable since this requires us to be effective immediately."
"In the same spirit, we shall support Amendment No 13 from the Group of the Party of European Socialists, which will prevent us creating a budgetary discipline body just for show."
"These declarations of intent are more than anything motivated, I fear, by the determination to establish a European sovereignty on the pretext of protecting the Community budget, which, I must remind you, is made up of contributions from our Member States."
"From the point of view of the effectiveness of the fight against fraud, these creations are no more than fresh grounds for sterile conflicts."
"In conclusion, I feel that the Commission' s watchwords must be rigour, discipline and proper collaboration."
"I sincerely believe that the rest can be achieved by adhering to OLAF' s prerogatives, combined with proper cooperation between national and European audit authorities."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a few days ago, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung published a survey which showed that an overwhelming majority of my fellow countrymen were in favour of a more common approach to judicial matters."
"No other area attracted nearly as much support for new initiatives at European level."
"Other surveys in the past have always confirmed that this applies both to Germans and to the citizens in most other Member States of the Union."
"We are therefore responding to the expectations of the people in tabling proposals on how to strengthen effectively the protection of the European Union against fraud."
"There are without doubt more pleasant topics of conversation than fraud and corruption, I grant you, but discussing them demonstrates clearly that we are not sweeping this tricky question under the carpet; on the contrary, we are setting ourselves this challenge, in precisely those cases which affect the institutions of the Union itself."
"This is why the Bösch report deserves particular attention and support."
"It was not adopted unanimously by the Committee on Budgetary Control for nothing, as I have already explained."
"Allow me to congratulate you on this report."
"It clearly illustrates that creating the European Anti-Fraud Office OLAF is an important step, but is only a step on the path towards the European prosecutor which I have called for time and again both in a personal capacity and as rapporteur."
"A public prosecutor' s office to protect the interests of the Union against fraud would be the only really effective instrument to counteract the threat from organised crime."
"Organised crime has identified the institutions of the European Union as a particularly easy target."
"I am delighted that both the Commission and Parliament have included this question in the Intergovernmental Conference."
"The Committee on Budgetary Control has gone one step further in this report."
"We want an even more proactive approach and are therefore waiting for the Commission to present proposals for the first stage of a European public prosecutor' s office on the basis of the current Article 280 and I really do hope, Commissioner Schreyer, that you will revise your unfortunately somewhat wait-and-see attitude and accommodate us here."
"Mr President, allow me to refer to what was indeed said earlier but could not be answered."
"My question is to Mr Dell'Alba; could the honourable Member explain what I, as chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, allegedly blocked for weeks."
"I require an answer and I should like it recorded in the minutes."
"Mrs Theato, you know perfectly well what I am talking about."
"The matter was discussed at length in the Conference of Presidents."
"In your capacity as chair of the Committee on Budgetary Control, not in a personal capacity, you were assigned to assist the Conference of Presidents and the President, Mrs Fontaine, in drawing up the Parliament' s position on the code of conduct for relations with the Commission."
"I contend, together with the group chairmen, who have, moreover, disclaimed you, that on the 13 April you informed the Conference of Presidents that on the whole you were in agreement with the spirit of Annex III on the exchange of information with the Commission."
"I contend that twenty days later, to the outrage of your partner, Mr Napolitano, you sent a letter in which you said you could no longer agree to this annex."
"You mentioned points in German which no one had checked, causing uproar among the group chairmen who thanked you, saying that they would take the dossier back because in effect the situation was no longer tenable."
"One group chairman even left the room on an occasion when the matter came up on the agenda one day."
"Do not pretend that you know nothing, you know perfectly well what happened."
"There are perhaps some of my fellow Members of Parliament who do not know, but I am stating this for the benefit of the House, so that it can be entered in the Minutes: for several weeks Mrs Theato obstructed an agreement with the Commission, thereby putting the President of Parliament and the chairmen of the political groups in an awkward position."
"That is the truth of the matter."
"I do not wish to interfere in the debate but the issue of OLAF and Napolitano was of course a highly controversial one in the entire House and we are all aware of the problems associated with it."
"That has now been cleared up."
"Mr President, today we are debating a report which goes much further than the figures on alleged fraud or errors in the Community accounts. It demands that the Members of this Parliament act responsibly."
"We must address the lack of moral responsibility on the part of bureaucracies, which was condemned in such a masterly way by Kafka."
"This lack of moral responsibility is perversely able to involve people in a labyrinthine quest for their exact legal position and subject them to phantom judgements regarding unknown crimes. These situations have happily been overcome in Europe."
"The creation of an effective and transparent office to fight fraud is a task with which all Members of this Parliament agree, and I hope that all the institutions agree."
"The creation of an omnipotent mechanism, designed to pursue officials on the basis of secret denunciations, accusations and lists of suspects, riding roughshod over the individual guarantees, statutes and regulations which provide basic legal security for people working in the institutions, is a form of irresponsibility which this Parliament or any Community institution should have nothing to do with, because such a climate of suspicion would only benefit the eurosceptics."
"The Socialist Group, which is interested in combating fraud as well as protecting the rights of citizens, including officials, and the construction of a Europe based on the principles of fair play, democracy, proximity to the citizens, transparency, efficiency and solidarity, has presented an amendment to paragraph 29 of this report, which lays down the principle that combating fraud should not take precedence over the basic rights of officials."
"To demand lists of suspects, as suggested in the report, would be a form of McCarthyism which is beneath the dignity of this House and, furthermore, it may possibly be illegal."
"I would like to remind you that claims have been made that no action has been taken against this type of action and that OLAF' s monitoring committee, in relation to these appeals, is aware that certain aspects are not functioning properly within this body."
"While accepting that, with the dynamic of European construction, the increase in the budget and the growth of the administration, there may be more fraud and errors, we must not fall into a kind of policing paranoia, or at least this Parliament must not."
"The immunity which we enjoy as MEPs must not be confused with impunity."
"It is important that this report does not simply create a Kafkaesque type of system, but that it also provides a guarantee for officials."
"Mr President, I have to depart a little bit from what I intended to say."
"I have some sympathy with the last speaker: sometimes the Committee on Budgetary Control gets so involved with the important work they are doing, that they are unable to see the wood for the trees."
"I also welcome the presentation on behalf of the Legal Affairs Committee and the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee which took a balanced approach to the major and indeed legitimate concerns of the Committee on Budgetary Control about fraud."
"I heard Mr van Hulten's reference to the fact that OLAF should have the right to investigate Members of Parliament."
"He has a point and a minority of people in this Parliament agree with that."
"But before we embark on such a radical decision, we should look at the history, particularly in the United States, of the relationship between security authorities and public figures and recognise that we could overstep the mark by giving such powers to OLAF."
"In the end, OLAF might have the political leverage and power to demand as much money and staff as it wanted."
"We should not throw staff, money or powers at an organisation just because problems exist."
"Those problems exist and we have dealt with the solution to the problem."
"Mr Bösch has rightly dealt with the problem of identifying and prosecuting fraud when it occurs."
"I do not agree with all of his report."
"There are a number of paragraphs I have doubts about - 14, 15 and 16 for example, regarding the legal basis and whether it is necessary to involve both national and European responsibility to resolve problems of fraud that affect national states more than they do the European Union."
"I have run out of time without saying what I wanted to say but I wanted to respond to some of the points already made."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on a very good report. The very fact that my Italian colleague is opposed to it means that it really is a report of very high quality."
"Even though there was a slight decline in fraud and irregularities between 1997 and 1998, there is nonetheless still a need for more effective supervisory mechanisms."
"Reform of the Commission is now under way."
"Mr Kinnock has submitted a timetable, and it is now up to us to applaud it."
"I am very impressed with the reform plan."
"In general, it is both visionary and realistic."
"There are nonetheless a number of sticking points, and these are what we ought to draw attention to and criticise."
"Parliament has already proposed, in the Van Hulten report, that an external court should be established under the aegis of the Court of Auditors. This would deal with disciplinary matters and help recover money which has been paid out unlawfully."
"This idea is one we should stick to, I think."
"If such a body were to be established, this would mean that disciplinary matters would be taken away from the Commission."
"We have had a lot of bad experience with internal disciplinary councils."
"At present, officials who have had actions brought against them by the disciplinary council have colleagues of theirs sitting in judgement over them."
"That is indefensible."
"Both the ECHO and MED cases are all too well-known examples of this state of affairs."
"I also agree with the rapporteur when he criticises setting up an advisory panel to deal with irregularities."
"We have, of course, established OLAF to deal with suspicions of fraud and irregularities."
"Another panel would serve only to undermine OLAF' s powers."
"I cannot, however, vote in favour of setting up a European Public Prosecutor' s office."
"I can well understand people' s being tired of all the fraud and therefore demanding that we have a common public prosecutor' s office."
"It would, however, be a colossal enterprise to set up when the problems are, in reality, elsewhere."
"In actual fact, there is a need for a fundamental staffing reform."
"It is, for all that, only the most serious cases which will have penal consequences."
"Ninety per cent of cases will be disciplinary matters concerning negligence or incompetence."
"Instead, there is a need for public, internal supervision and for more leeway when it comes to sacking people."
"We need changes to staff regulations and to the disciplinary procedure, as also proposed in the report."
"I would also point out that I had three minutes in which to speak."
"I spoke for only two, but I am very disciplined."
"I am happy to let someone else use my time. You should also, of course, be allowed to make mistakes from time to time."
"Mr Blak, allow me to apologise officially."
"You are quite right, you had three minutes."
"I was not wearing my glasses."
"Do you wish to add anything else?"
"No?"
"Well that puts the friendship between Denmark and Bavaria back on terra firma."
"Thank you Mr Blak for overlooking my error."
"Mr President, this is just the sort of issue which gives rise to lofty declarations."
"But I should like to go into a few points which, as far as I am concerned, are relatively unclear."
"Problem number one: every year the media present the refusal to issue a declaration of assurance as an indication of the alleged or actual state of corruption in EU finances."
"At the same time, however, both the Court of Auditors and the Council of Ministers grant this refusal to issue a declaration of assurance the status of a mere water-level report, while we here in Parliament and the media see it as an indication of the poor state of the Union' s finances."
"I think we need to amend and clarify the basis of the matters about which we are talking."
"Otherwise we shall find ourselves in a situation in which every year we regularly and hence permanently, as it were, negligently cast an air of general suspicion over the state of EU finances, if this state of affairs is allowed to continue."
"Problem number two: of course further investigation may show that some financial irregularities are in fact cases of fraud."
"Nonetheless, these two points need to be kept apart both in terms of how they are defined and how they are measured, because otherwise they will both be lumped together and this will give the impression of a huge level of fraud which is not justified to that extent."
"Problem number three: clearly - and I am grateful to Mr Bösch for pointing this out - the findings of the Court of Auditors differ from those of the Commission as to the extent of financial irregularity which has occurred in relations between the agricultural budget and the Structural Funds."
"Clearly there are measuring problems, statistical problems which we must solve so that we know what we are talking about when we start investigations or conduct further investigations."
"Mr President, I also congratulate Mr Bösch on his report."
"He is the acknowledged expert within the European Parliament and, to a large extent, was the architect of the new OLAF."
"One thing that is certain to create a stir in terms of the EU is big stories about fraud."
"They always get big coverage."
"That is quite right too because any fraud is unacceptable."
"The figure that is being attached to it is about 5% of the EU budget."
"But there are two important points to remember, which have been touched upon several times here today - and Mr Cunha has just raised them again."
"The Court of Auditors does not distinguish between fraud and administrative and financial irregularities; that is, administrative mistakes and people who set out to cheat the EU of money."
"To give you an example, a farmer may fill out a form incorrectly."
"That is not to say that he means to defraud."
"It may be that he measured his land incorrectly."
"And then there are the big fraudsters: the people who, for example, import cigarettes illegally, avoiding tax."
"There is a huge difference between these two things."
"We need to have them distinguished much more clearly."
"Let us not forget that 80% of the fraud takes place within Member States."
"Yesterday the Commission made a commitment to us that they want to cut irregularities by 2%."
"We want to know whether the Member States will follow that lead."
"It is clear that a lot of the problems lie there, in particular with the Structural Funds."
"To take up Mr Dell'Alba's point, the Socialists will be voting against a number of paragraphs in this report, not necessarily because we do not agree with them, but because it is not the right context in which to discuss these points which relate to the White Paper."
"Finally, I want to read out a list of shame - Member States which have not yet ratified the Convention on the Protection of the Financial Interests of the EU: Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece, Ireland and France."
"It is about time they signed up."
"They have had five years to do it."
"Let us see them ratify it."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the fight against fraud and protecting the financial interests of the Community are among the top priorities of the new Commission."
"The fight against fraud includes activities such as preventing, uncovering and prosecuting customs and subsidy fraud or tax evasion, as well, of course, as uncovering and prosecuting irregularities within the institutions of the European Union."
"But I am most pleased that numerous contributions to the debate have stated that we need to make a distinction between financial irregularity and fraud."
"When we talk of the Court of Auditors' report, this covers the whole spectrum of financial irregularities."
"We are talking here of the UCLAF or OLAF report on fraud, i.e. deliberate damage to the financial interests of the European Union."
"The report before you, which is the subject of Mr Bösch' s report, is the last report drawn up by UCLAF on the fight against fraud in 1998."
"Although UCLAF only had 120 employees at the time, this annual report illustrates the considerable success of their work, in my view."
"There were 5,318 cases of suspicion of irregularity or fraud investigated by UCLAF in 1998, in cooperation with the Member States, and around 20% of these cases were classed as fraud following the investigation."
"I should also point out in connection with the question as to why the findings in the Court of Auditors' report are different, that it has been ascertained that the number of irregularities is falling in the area of agricultural policy, while it is clearly highlighted here that regulations as to which cases of fraud or suspicion must be reported to the Commission differ from one Member State to another, and this explains the difference between the two reports."
"Mr Blak stated in his speech that the citizens of the European Union are sick and tired of fraud."
"Unfortunately, I must point out that duty- or tax-free cigarettes still sell like hot cakes and tax evasion is often regarded as a national pastime."
"In this respect, we face a situation in which we must acknowledge that we cannot completely eradicate fraud which damages the European Union's financial interests."
"We must of course do everything within our power to fight customs offences and offences in connection with subsidies and taxation which damage the Community' s financial interests."
"I should like briefly to go into the individual proposals in the Bösch report which now come within a wider context; this applies, for example, to the proposal on disciplinary procedures or the chamber at the European Court of Auditors."
"The Commission explained in its statements on Parliament' s demands in connection with the 1998 discharge procedure that it did not think that the right way forward was to call in a chamber of the Court of Auditors or the Court of Justice to issue orders in disciplinary proceedings against employees on the grounds of irregularities in connection with the budget, because the European Treaties had granted each of these bodies its own specific remit."
"It is precisely the European Court of Justice to which employees can take recourse if they wish to appeal against a judgement in disciplinary proceedings."
"As a result, such a move cannot be reconciled with the present Treaties."
"The Commission therefore decided to take up the proposals contained in last year' s independent experts' report, which are extremely comprehensive and relate to overall financial management, fraud prevention and disciplinary procedures."
"The Commission explained that it also shared Parliament' s view that confidence in the objectivity of disciplinary proceedings would be enhanced by involving an outside agency."
"It explained this in its White Paper tabled on 1 March and will also make detailed proposals on reforming disciplinary law in the paper on the overall future disciplinary procedure to be published by the Commission in October."
"Naturally we shall include Parliament' s considerations in the overall procedure and in our proposals during discussions."
"It was rightly pointed out in numerous debates and in the report that good cooperation and the involvement of the Member States are essential if the fight against fraud to the detriment of the financial interests of the European Community is to be efficient."
"Article 280 of the Amsterdam Treaty also makes this clear."
"The complaint was also rightly voiced that the corresponding agreement between the Member States has only been ratified by a few Member States."
"I should like to thank all the speakers who wrote home calling for the necessary steps to be taken at long last."
"OLAF, the European Anti-Fraud Office, is itself working intensively with the Member States and, in certain areas, with other countries, in order to conclude cooperation agreements."
"Since the UCLAF report was filed, the European Anti-Fraud Office OLAF has succeeded, for example, in concluding an agreement with the Anti-Mafia in Italy, the aim being to achieve good cooperation at all levels and with all organisations dedicated to fighting fraud."
"A conference on this subject is to be held in Ancona at the end of the week."
"The Commission welcomes the fact that some enlargement countries are already taking steps to set up and activate structures similar to those set up by the European Anti-Fraud Office."
"In Poland, for example, it has been decided to set up a Polish OLAF."
"I should like briefly to go into the subject of ""What happens next in the legislative area?"" and point out that the Commission has proposed for the Intergovernmental Conference, which is responsible for revising the Treaties, that the present system for protecting the financial interests be supplemented by a legal basis creating a European Public Prosecutor and allowing provisions on the criminal prosecution of cross-border fraud to be adopted."
"The Member States have indicated that they will not amend the Treaty in this area."
"However, the Commission does not intend to give up on this and we are continuing to refine this proposal and will ensure that it is on the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"I should like to comment briefly on the complaints filed by the Commission against the European Central Bank and the European Investment Bank."
"The aim is to implement precisely what was introduced into the OLAF regulation by the European Parliament, namely that OLAF is responsible for fighting fraud in all the institutions of the European Community."
"Unfortunately, neither bank has made a move over recent weeks."
"They too have probably been waiting for the outcome of the litigation pending as the result of the proceedings instituted by a number of members against the amendment of the European Parliament' s Rules of Procedure."
"I think that the summary procedures of the Court of First Instance have in fact made it clear that what is at issue is not the legal bases for OLAF - in this respect neither bank can withdraw or hide behind this - the issue is, of course, the need to safeguard the independence of the institutions."
"Not that this was ever disputed for the European Central Bank."
"Of course, the other issue is that it needs to be made clear that the immunity of members is a democratic achievement and cannot be interfered with under any circumstances."
"I should like to thank you for calling for account to be taken of the principles of the rule of law in all procedures, including the work of OLAF."
"I think that the new director of OLAF defends this view very vigorously, including in a personal capacity."
"We shall have the opportunity of debating other reports on the subject of fighting fraud this year."
"The OLAF Supervisory Committee, which monitors the independence of OLAF, will soon submit its report, which we shall also have the opportunity to debate."
"I should point out that the Commission is currently working on a fundamental strategy paper on the fight against fraud."
"This too will certainly lead to further intensive and fruitful debate."
"I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Bösch, for his report and, above all, I should also like to thank the House for supporting the introduction and the work of OLAF so unwaveringly."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
"(The sitting was suspended at 11.55 a.m. and resumed at 12.00 p.m.)"
"Vote"
"Madam President, in order not to delay a decision on this regulation, the Commission is ready to accept Amendment No 1 on commitology."
"However, I regret to have to inform you that the Commission cannot agree to Amendment No 2."
"The Commission proposes an amount of EUR 850.5m as part of a comprehensive package for the programming of heading IV to take account of the commitments made for the Balkans."
"(The President declared the common position approved as amended)"
"Report (A5-0115/2000) by Mrs Jeggle, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the Commission proposals on the prices for agricultural products (COM(2000) 77 - C5-0121/2000 à C5-0126/2000 - 2000/0045(CNS) à 2000/0050(CNS))"
"(In successive votes, Parliament adopted the six legislative resolutions)"
"Report (A5-0124/2000) by Mrs Schierhuber, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1251/1999 establishing a support system for producers of certain arable crops to include flax and hemp grown for fibre (COM(1999) 576 - C5­0280/1999 - 1999/0236(CNS)) and on the proposal for a Council regulation on the common organisation of the market in flax and hemp grown for fibre (COM(1999) 576 - C5­0281/1999 - 1999/0237(CNS))"
"Madam President, the following problem has arisen in connection with the report by Mrs Schierhuber now being put to the vote: the Group of the Party of European Socialists and the Group of the European United Left filed a motion for a split vote on a number of points."
"However, for some technical reason, the services did not receive it."
"Now we have the following problem: either you now allow an oral motion for a split vote on the article in question during the voting procedure and we vote today or, if that is not possible, then I move that we postpone the vote until tomorrow."
"The services have, however, said that we have a tightly-packed voting programme tomorrow, so that it would perhaps make sense to vote today."
"We would be happy to vote."
"The vote is not the problem, the problem is that you did not receive the motion for a split vote in time."
"Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, indeed, I checked the situation: it was only this morning that we received the request for split voting, which was therefore not within the time limits set by our own rules."
"In Parliament we have certain rules that are applicable to everyone."
"They must be observed, and I cannot make any exceptions."
"I must be frank and tell you that, even though I appreciate the problem."
"We shall then proceed to the vote, unless you are going to propose postponing the vote, which is a proposal I would, of course, put to the vote."
"Madam President, in that case - I understand your position - I should like to move that we postpone the vote until tomorrow or Thursday."
"I would like to hear the opinion of our rapporteur, Mrs Schierhuber."
"Madam President, I am sorry that the Socialists' voting list was not received by the services in time."
"I should like to state unequivocally that I personally, as rapporteur, have no problem in accepting this split vote, even during today' s vote, and it would be good if we could vote today because, as you know, the Council of Agricultural Ministers is meeting today and tomorrow and it would be good if the agricultural ministers knew what we had decided here."
"Unfortunately, if we vote tomorrow, it will be too late."
"Mrs Schierhuber, let us be clear on this."
"Personally speaking I would not have any objection to split voting either, but, once again, there are rules, and I cannot make exceptions."
"This would establish a perfectly dreadful precedent and then there would no longer be any rules to govern the tabling of split voting requests."
"You have just expressed your view to the effect that you prefer to have the vote today."
"I shall give Mr Goepel the floor and then we shall proceed to vote on Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf' s proposal to postpone the vote until tomorrow morning or Thursday morning."
"Madam President, I should like to explain on behalf of my group that we too have nothing against this oral amendment and I should like to support Mrs Schierhuber again here."
"The Council of Agricultural Ministers is waiting for our decision and a postponement would not be a good idea."
"(Parliament rejected the proposal to postpone the vote)"
"Following the vote on legislative proposal No 1 and adoption of the Commission proposal as amended"
"Madam President, I should like to ask the Commission if it has changed its opinion in the last twelve hours on the proposed amendments adopted by a large majority in the Committee on Agriculture."
"Mrs Schreyer, can you give our rapporteur an answer in the affirmative?"
"Mrs Schierhuber, the Commission has not changed its opinion."
"The Commission presented this proposal as the outcome of experience in past years."
"We discussed a report on the fight against fraud on a previous occasion and that has a direct bearing on this."
"I can only repeat that, if the question of the division of land is again discussed in the Council - and this was an important issue in the Committee on Agriculture - then the Commission is of course open to suggestions."
"However, as the Commissioner for the budget, I am bound to say that a solution must be found which does not affect the budget."
"Madam President, the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development are also very keen to put a stop to fraud in all areas in the Union."
"We still do not have any right of codetermination in agriculture, which is why our only option is to refer this report back to committee and I urge the House to vote in favour of my motion."
"Our rapporteur, Mrs Schierhuber, proposes referral to committee."
"Is there anyone who wishes to speak in favour of referral to committee?"
"Madam President, exactly the same applies to this second decision as what you said for the first decision."
"Two proposed amendments in this second file are of fundamental importance to the Committee on Agriculture, namely Amendments Nos 28 and 29."
"I therefore again ask the Commission if it has perhaps revised its opinion here."
"Madam President, my colleague Mr Fischler made a statement on this yesterday."
"The Commission has not changed its position."
"Madam President, in that case may I again ask the House to vote to refer the report back to committee."
"(Parliament decided to refer the second part of the report to committee)"
"Report (A5-0116/2000) by Mr Bösch, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the 1998 annual report by the European Commission on protecting the Communities' financial interests and the fight against fraud (COM(1999) 590 - C5-0058/2000 - 2000/2032(COS))"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)EXPLANATIONS OF VOTES"
"Rothley report (A5-0130/2000)"
"Madam President, I voted for this European Parliament directive regulating insurance against civil liability in respect of the use of motor vehicles which may injure citizens who come from States other than the State in which they are insured, but I would have liked the report to have been more audacious."
"Many pensioners, with whom I often discuss matters in Italy, say to me ""Mr Fatuzzo, I have had a serious car accident."
"I was the victim of a road accident."
"The insurance company asked me my age, and when I replied that I was 80 years old, they said 'You are worthless, you count for nothing, and so we are not going to give you any compensation.' """
"Now, it does not seem right to me for a person who is 70 or 80 years old to be considered worthless, and I therefore call for care to be taken that morally acceptable payments are made when the victims of road accidents are elderly."
"- The proposal for this directive deals with situations in which a traffic accident occurs in the country of residence of the person causing the accident or in a third country."
"The objective of this directive is to ensure that the injured party has a right of action against the insurer of the person who caused the accident."
"We must remember that we live in the European Union where the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital is in operation."
"This directive which streamlines the issue of civil liability in respect of accidents involving motor vehicles is a logical extension to directives which have been put in place over the last 13 years to complete the European Single Market."
"It is only right and proper where there is a system of wholesale freedom of movement of persons and cross-border traffic that a streamlined and structured procedure is in operation so that recourse is available to injured parties in the case of accidents."
"To that end every insurance undertaking operating within the European Union must now appoint a representative within each Member State to be responsible for settling claims on its behalf if an accident occurs involving an EU national."
"This proposal would also involve information centres being set up so as to enable victims to identify appropriate claim representatives."
"A compromise has been reached between the institutions at a recent Conciliation Committee meeting which was held last March."
"The most complex problem concerns the directive's territorial application."
"This matter is now resolved."
"The directive will apply to accidents involving nationals of a Member State of the Union on Union territory or in any third country operating the Green Card system."
"The Conciliation Committee has also agreed to enable Member States to retain and implement more favourable arrangements in respect of the victim than the provisions required so as to ensure compliance with this directive."
"I fully support this proposal and would like to commend Mr Rothley for his work in bringing these proposals to this stage."
"The European Union, as a result of the Treaty of Amsterdam, has greater powers to bring forward legislation in the field of consumer rights."
"This legislation governing the issue of civil liability in respect of the use of motor vehicles and accidents in Europe will ensure that the rights of the 370 million consumers in Europe will be enhanced in the case of accidents taking place within any of the territories of the European Union."
"- I welcome my Socialist colleague, Willi Rothley's recommendation on protecting motorists abroad."
"We are sadly all too familiar with the high figures of road accidents across Europe."
"As many as 500 000 drivers in the European Union are victims of road accidents abroad every year."
"This is 500 000 too many."
"We must put safety first and ensure that as much as possible is done to protect our citizens whilst travelling abroad."
"The proposal extends current EU directives on the handling of motor insurance claims to cover cases where a person visiting another Member State is the victim of an accident caused by a resident of that country."
"Every insurance company will, therefore, need to appoint a representative in each Member State."
"The European Parliament has gone even further, calling for cover for accidents which take place in non-EU countries, provided that the vehicles involved are registered in the EU."
"Under the compromise, the directive will apply to such accidents in a certain number of countries outside the European Union."
"Thousands of British holidaymakers travel by car or hire cars every year in France, Spain, Portugal and many other countries in Europe."
"Surely we owe all of our citizens the right to ensure that things are made as easy as possible for those involved in car accidents abroad and for their families."
"This is not about high-and-mighty insurance companies hindering claims, it is about the European Parliament driving forward a lifeline for our citizens."
"For my own constituents and for all of Europe's citizens, I give the green light to this proposal."
"Martínez Martínez report (A5-0114/2000)"
"Madam President, I also voted for the measure tabled by Mr Martínez Martínez confirming aid for development cooperation with South Africa, but, also in this case, with some reserves."
"Why do we not make one of our inspectors responsible, one of our Commissioners, whenever - every year - we give financial aid to South Africa?"
"Why do we not monitor, firstly, the use to which this financial aid is put, and, secondly, the human rights situation in South Africa?"
"The situation is not, of course, as bad as it was - there have been improvements - but even I have received news of all sorts of appalling acts of delinquency perpetrated in South Africa as well as elsewhere."
"We should take this into account whenever we provide aid to any third countries, including South Africa."
"Madam President, the situation in South Africa is difficult - and it is by no means an easy country to run."
"Yet South Africa presents itself as a beacon of hope in an otherwise turbulent continent."
"We should therefore be doing everything possible to assist the economic, social and democratic development of that country."
"That is why I regret that the Council proposes only EUR 787.5 million for South Africa, which is effectively a 10% cut on the amounts we agreed five years ago."
"Parliament, in its Amendment No 2, proposes that we give EUR 885.5 million to South Africa, EUR 98 million more than the Council."
"EUR 98 million is not an insignificant sum of money in South African terms."
"In terms of the European budget it is not something we would struggle to find."
"I would urge that we be generous to South Africa, that the Council finds this EUR 98 million, does not go to conciliation but accepts Parliament's amendments and gets on with implementing this new regulation with South Africa."
"Thank you, Mr Martin."
"In future, I shall ensure that the Commission remains in attendance during explanations of votes."
"They may then hear some interesting information."
"The most scandalous aspect of what they are daring to call an agreement on ""development cooperation with South Africa"" is that this cooperation is subject to the trade agreement with South Africa and that the Council is using it as a means of blackmail in order to foist its own terms on Pretoria."
"Such cynicism borders on candour: the European Union grants aid to South Africa on condition that it is able thereby to make a commercial profit."
"Although Parliament' s proposals are, financially, better than those of the Council, we have not voted in favour of the amendments, as we do not wish to sanction this farce."
"The only reason why we are not voting against the amendments, however, is to affirm our conviction that cooperation between Europe and the whole of Africa is essential."
"While, however, it is designed and implemented to profit merchants, bankers and industrialists, it is of benefit only to them and, incidentally, to a select class of privileged Africans."
"In these circumstances, ""combating poverty"" and ""achieving development objectives"" as mentioned by the Council is nothing but gross untruth that could not be counteracted by any vote here."
"Thank you, Mrs Cauquil."
"I am given to understand that Mrs Laguiller and Mrs Bordes are also involved in the explanation of vote that you have just given."
"Jeggle report (A5-0115/2000)"
"Madam President, I voted for the measure tabled by Mr Jeggle on the Commission proposals on the prices for agricultural products."
"This measure deals, once again, with the European Union' s common agricultural policy."
"I welcome our action to support farmers, but I feel that we need to change direction, in some cases completely and in others only in part."
"For example, this measure does not contain any initiatives to support the small-scale, family-based elderly mountain farmers who operate, particularly, in the furthermost parts of Europe."
"This land is increasingly being abandoned and the European Union' s vast expenditure does not go far enough towards meeting the needs of the farmers."
"In future, we must pay more attention to the needs of elderly family-based farmers."
"My vote is intended to support the rapporteur' s efforts but prevent the proposed reduction in the monthly increments for cereals."
"The European Council stated clearly in its resolutions following the Berlin summit that the monthly increments should be maintained at the current 1 euro per tonne and frozen at this level for the entire period, i.e. from 2000 to 2006."
"The planned reduction in the monthly increments would therefore clearly be breaking our promise to the farmers."
"Given the worrying economic situation of the rural population, further erosion of their income is unjustifiable."
"The income of people working in farming has fallen by a total of nearly 10% in real terms since 1996."
"A reduction in the monthly increments would further exacerbate the economic situation of farmers."
"- (SV) A transformation of agricultural policy is a prerequisite for enlargement of the European Union."
"We Swedish Social Democrats (Pierre Schori, Anneli Hulthén, Jan Andersson, Maj Britt Theorin, Göran Färm and Eva Hedkvist-Petersen) therefore believe that the EU' s agricultural subsidies should be considerably reduced and we welcome the Commission' s proposal for a progressive reduction in the monthly increases in the intervention price of cereal."
"Because the report opposes a reduction in the intervention price of cereal, we are voting against the Committee' s proposal."
"With regard to the proposal for a Council regulation fixing certain sugar prices and the standard quality of beet for the 2000/01 marketing year, we would make the following point. The reconstruction of Kosovo is an important issue for the EU and something we wholeheartedly support."
"The extra resources required for Kosovo should be obtained from general reductions in subsidies for the whole of the common agricultural policy and not only through reductions within the sugar sector."
"- (DA) Agricultural aid is a heavy burden for the European Union."
"It is indispensable to undertake a radical review of this aid, especially when enlargement to include the Eastern European countries is to become a reality."
"I am very pleased that the first step to be taken towards such a review entails a long-term plan for a certain reduction in agricultural aid."
"It is problematic, however, that there is not the courage to engage in a full and candid discussion of how our agricultural sector is, in the longer term, to cope under quite different conditions and with a quite different aid scheme than that which is in place at present."
"We are forced to reduce aid to the absolute minimum, and we should have the discussion now."
"On the other hand, the reduction in agricultural aid should be gradual and carried out at such a pace that there is no risk of EU aid being replaced by national schemes designed to compensate for its disappearance."
"It would also be problematic if the Commission were to withdraw aid from agriculture with a view to using the resources for another purpose."
"Aid should not be reduced for the wrong reasons."
"Schierhuber report (A5-0124/2000)"
"Madam President, I voted against this measure on the European policy on flax and hemp."
"This is because I feel that we should change the way we support and provide aid to agricultural products in the European Union."
"We should start to let go of the policy of giving a sum of money to the producers of a particular agricultural product which we want to support, and endeavour, instead, to reduce the burdens of production costs, burdens which are mainly the result of national State policies and which push up the cost of labour, tying the hands of those who wish to work, produce and increase the number of jobs in their sector."
"Basically, we must start to change the way we provide aid to agriculture in Europe."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of Mrs Schierhuber' s report."
"I consider proposed Amendments Nos 28 and 29 to be particularly important."
"She rightly points out that any limitation on maximum quantities must correlate with actual processing capacities."
"Introducing national maximum quantities as proposed by the Commission would create a system which fails to take account of national processing capacities."
"The 50 tonne per annum limitation would exclude many Member States from cultivation in advance."
"The aim must be to develop a flexible system which also takes account of regional sales potential, thereby allowing all Member States to cultivate on an equal footing."
". (SV) We Swedish Social Democrats (Pierre Schori, Anneli Hulthén, Jan Andersson, Maj Britt Theorin, Göran Färm and Ewa Hedkvist Petersen) believe that the EU' s agricultural aid ought to be considerably reduced and we are therefore also opposed to aid for hemp production."
"Furthermore, the mechanisms for supervising the cultivation of hemp are problematic because it is not possible, with the naked eye, to distinguish hemp grown for fibre from hemp grown for the production of drugs."
"It is, therefore, difficult to guarantee that there is no cultivation of hemp for the purpose of manufacturing drugs."
"We therefore believe that hemp production ought not to be promoted through increased aid, and we are abstaining from voting on Mrs Schierhuber' s report."
"(SV) Regarding the proposal for a Council regulation (EC) No 1251/1999 establishing a support system for producers of certain arable crops to include flax and hemp grown for fibre, we would state the following. As liberals, we believe that agricultural policy should be adjusted to the market and de-bureaucratised."
"If Parliament is serious about eastward enlargement, there must be a drive extensively to cut back on the costs of agriculture."
"All direct forms of support for agricultural production ought gradually to be abolished."
"Bösch report (A5-0116/2000)"
"Mr President, I have taken the floor for the last time to declare, once again, that it was with no reservations that I voted against the Bösch report on the 1998 report on the fight against fraud."
"This is not because I do not approve of fighting all types of fraud - of course I do!"
"Naturally I support this fight. However, I feel that in order to genuinely fight fraud in the European Union we need to change Europe' s expenditure system."
"The same report states that these EUR 1 019 million which have disappeared as a result of fraud are only the tip of the iceberg."
"Now, we know that 10% of an iceberg is visible but the other 90% is underwater and therefore hidden. Therefore, the European Union is being defrauded of something in the region of EUR 10 000 million."
"It is absolutely essential that we change the way we spend our money."
"Madam President, you have just congratulated the rapporteur on his work."
"I do not see what reason there is to congratulate him as many of his original paragraphs have been dropped, particularly because of his own Group which, in its wisdom, decided to table a great many amendments to delete sections, and these were adopted."
"These particularly concerned all the sections to do with the White Paper."
"Consequently, many amendments which went beyond the report and the content of the report that Mr Bösch was supposed to be drawing up have been dropped."
"I therefore ask the following question: why did we waste money making Mr Bösch draw up texts that have nothing to do with his work and which Parliament has, quite rightly, rejected."
"You can discuss the matter with Mrs Stauner, who is very interested in other people' s reports, and whom you should really meet, and ask her if she is not interested in knowing why the members of the Committee on Budgetary Control are undertaking work which has nothing to do with their assigned tasks."
"All honour and tribute, then, to the wisdom of this Parliament for restoring order."
"- (DA) We have voted today in favour of Mr Bösch' s report on the more effective combating of fraud and irregularities involving EU resources."
"Even though there was a slight decline in fraud and irregularities between 1997 and 1998, there is still a great need for more effective supervisory mechanisms."
"Mr Kinnock' s reform plan is, on the whole, both visionary and realistic."
"There are, however, a few sticking points."
"Parliament has already proposed, in the Van Hulten report, that an external court should be established under the aegis of the Court of Auditors, part of whose task would be to deal with disciplinary matters and which would help recover money which had been paid out wrongly."
"If such a body were to be established, this would mean that disciplinary procedures would be taken away from the Commission."
"We have had a lot of bad experiences with the internal disciplinary council."
"At present, officials who have had actions brought against them by the disciplinary council have colleagues of theirs sitting in judgement over them."
"That is indefensible."
"Both the ECHO and MED cases are all too well-known examples of this state of affairs."
"We ought likewise to criticise the proposal in the white paper to the effect that an advisory panel should be set up to deal with irregularities."
"We have established OLAF to deal with suspicions of fraud and irregularities."
"Another panel would serve only to undermine OLAF' s powers."
"We have voted against establishing a European public prosecutor' s office."
"It would be a colossal enterprise to set up when the problem, in reality, lies elsewhere."
"In actual fact, there is more need for a fundamental staffing reform."
"It is, for all that, only the most serious cases which will have penal consequences."
"Ninety per cent of cases will be disciplinary matters concerning negligence or incompetence."
"Instead, there is a need for public, internal supervision and for more leeway when it comes to sacking people."
"We need changes to staff regulations and to the disciplinary procedure, as also proposed in the report."
"- The British Conservatives abstained on the Bösch report overall because we are unhappy with the concept of a European Public Prosecutor, believing that this could well lead to corpus juris."
"We were also unhappy with the references to VAT made within the report."
"- (FR) I abstained from the vote on the resolution on protecting the Communities' financial interests and the fight against fraud."
"I did not wish to vote against the resolution since I fully share the rapporteur' s objectives of intensifying the combating of fraud against the financial interests of the Community."
"I did not vote, however, because of the establishment of a new control body."
"The Community is not going to achieve the desired goal by creating a tangled multiplicity of such bodies."
"(The sitting was suspended at 12.50 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies"
"The next item is the report (A5-0117/2000) by Mrs Roth-Behrendt, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation laying down rules for the prevention and control of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (COM(1998) 623 - C4-0025/1999 - 1998/0323(COD))."
"Mr President, our discussion today on transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, transmissible diseases which include BSE or scrapie, is one of the many follow-up reports or one of the follow-up discussions to the final BSE report and I think that it is also of great interest to the visitors in the gallery."
"We have a report here before us which the Commission promised together with its final report on the 1997 BSE report at Parliament' s request."
"It has now presented it."
"We have drafted a report on it, although not as quickly as we would otherwise have done, due to the break last year."
"The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and Mr Böge have drafted opinions on it."
"In other words, we have been able to keep the BSE team going well."
"I should like to tell you briefly how I, as rapporteur for the committee responsible, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, assess the proposal."
"The Commission' s proposal is a good one; like so much of what the Commission has presented on BSE and follow-up problems and has satisfied us in previous years, we are also satisfied with this proposal but, like most things, it still has room for improvement, Mr Byrne."
"I said that your proposal on BSE testing had room for improvement and I say so again here today."
"The involvement of the European Parliament certainly needs to be improved."
"We must ensure that the European Parliament can act in the codecision procedure as the real guarantor of consumer and health protection in the European Union."
"Only then will we have a high standard and only then will you be able to work in proper collaboration with us, because the Council of Ministers, the individual Agricultural Ministers have not exactly been at the vanguard of the movement over recent years, as we here in the House are only too aware."
"It is also important, and here too another proposal needs improvement, for us to hold further discussions on the rapid BSE tests."
"You tabled a proposal after this TSE proposal which you then needed to adjust, but the proposal is still inadequate."
"If we are to be able to make a real appraisal of the BSE situation in the Member States, we must make it clear that fallen stock are also to be tested for human health safety in a screening process."
"So far you have presented no proposal on this."
"What we also need, and we have tried to achieve this in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, is to strengthen the Member States' obligation to inform the Commission and to give the Commission information and data on incidents in their countries, on BSE problems or on suspicious circumstances."
"Here too we need to take the Member States to task more."
"Here, too, I repeat: mistrust is always shown of the Member States, including my own, and rightly so."
"Mr Böge rightly pointed out - as I am sure he will again in his presentation - that we need a Community definition of geographical areas."
"The definition here is clearly inadequate and the Commission must explain - and I call on you to do so Mr Byrne - how it intends to deal with derogations for cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and other medicinal products."
"I am convinced of the need for the Commission to make proposals in order to close any loopholes in current legislation."
"Allow me to make a few comments on the proposed amendments and then, thanks to the speaking time for my group, I shall still have time for a comment at the end of the debate."
"I agree with nearly all the proposed amendments, but there are some and here I would ask how you evaluate them, Mr Byrne."
"This applies in particular to proposed Amendment No 50, which includes cat food in the proposal tabled by Mr Böge, who I know takes a very careful approach to everything."
"But you have said that you have a problem with cat food."
"Please say something about the risk of infection from cats."
"Mrs Attwooll and others have proposed a number of amendments, specifically Amendments Nos 53, 54 and 55."
"These proposed amendments limit the present proposal and do not represent any improvement, not even for the situation in the United Kingdom, which I would have understood."
"For example, no distinction is made between breeding and fattening; that is a completely inadequate proposal."
"I sympathise with the suggestion in the second part of proposed Amendment No 56 that certain materials should be removed if a Member State has a specific and efficient system, but I must also say unequivocally that, at the present stage of the discussion on special risk materials, it is a dangerous signal to Member States such as my own, which are very reticent."
"Allow me to repeat quite clearly: the repercussions on the Member States have obviously been overestimated by some members in the House."
"In countries which have a good, operational system and a high level of protection, this regulation will not cause any deterioration."
"But in countries which do not, it would at long last force them to buckle down and give priority to safety and health protection."
"That is why I fail to understand much of the mistrust of many members, but perhaps we can clear that up in the debate."
"Mr President, I shall have another three minutes at the end of the debate, which I shall use to comment on some of the interventions by the honourable Members."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development also welcomes in principle the Commission proposal, which is in line with the promise made by the Commission to Parliament."
"I should also like expressly to praise the excellent collaboration between the committees and the rapporteurs."
"We pointed out on a previous occasion that it is strange that there are still no common provisions for fighting scrapie, despite the fact that scrapie and BSE have somehow been linked since the beginning."
"We think it is important to seek a differentiated approach to preventive consumer protection by achieving an understanding of the facts and without panicking."
"In addition to what the rapporteur has said, we felt it was important that the Commission had incorporated the principle of regionalising the fight against TSE in order to reconcile strict measures and a sense of proportion."
"I should also like to point out that we feel it is important, in the case of the livestock affected, to have a proper discussion on how data on age can be adapted for the purpose of measures to fight TSE."
"I would also add that, when we talk of the possibility of introducing tests, for example in the event of dispute between the Commission and Member States or in the event of dispute between the Commission and third countries, carrying out tests can also help to decide if a country belongs in risk category I, II or III if, for example, certain statistics cannot be organised differently."
"However, I will not conceal the fact, Commissioner, that the problem of third countries in general will continue to remain an issue for us, as will the question of including pharmaceuticals and cosmetics."
"We also expect the Commission to quickly submit legal provisions on animal waste, on meat meal, so that we can define safety keys, thereby ensuring that there is a future for a responsible recycling system and guaranteeing preventive consumer protection."
"One issue will continue to remain on the agenda and that is the difference between some Member States and the majority of Member States in their approach to the question of what is more important: to define risk materials or to remove entire stocks from the food chain in the event of one case of BSE."
"Even scientists have so far avoided committing themselves on this point."
"Mr President, if the BSE crisis taught us anything, it is that health takes top priority over all other policies."
"This is essentially the basis on which this proposal for a regulation has been drawn up and we really must use this opportunity to make a concerted effort to prevent, control and eradicate transmissible spongiform encephalopathies."
"We have been well aware of this problem for many years now. Unfortunately, however, we have still not managed to eradicate the disease, nor have we managed to identify all the causes for it, hence all the concerns, restrictions and irregularities in the production and marketing of products of animal origin."
"It is therefore essential that action be taken throughout the Community so that firstly: we can effectively guarantee public health protection and, secondly, we can restore consumer confidence which, in turn, will help the internal market to develop and operate properly."
"One of the important measures recommended in the regulation is the establishment of rapid diagnosis tests, because rapid detection is one of the keys to combating this disease."
"Consequently, these tests, which produce results within a relatively short period of time, will most certainly help us to take immediate and appropriate action."
"Three tests have already been proposed, although we predict that we shall see future improvements in this area, together with rapid diagnosis tests on live animals, so that we can monitor better how the whole epidemiological picture of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies is developing in the European Union."
"A second key measure is to establish an ongoing epidemiological study based partly on laboratory tests using an established protocol."
"The introduction of uniform procedures and truly comparable results from analyses by national and Community reference laboratories will help us to monitor the situation closely and to create reliable scientific data and methods of diagnosis which include rapid diagnostic tests."
"It would be a good idea if, at the same time, we monitored scientific progress on the new variant disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob, which, as we all know, attacks humans and is caused by food from animals contaminated with BSE."
"Finally, the slightest suspicion of any form of spongiform encephalopathy in any animal must be notified to the competent authorities so that we can take appropriate action."
"I should like to stress at this point, that in my view, we will in fact only eradicate the disease effectively if we destroy the whole herd, regardless of how much this would cost both in economic and sentimental terms."
"That is why the compensation paid by the Commission to beneficiaries must be quite substantial."
"Of course, it is hard when just one animal out of a whole herd is sick, as it is very difficult to discern if there are animals which appear healthy but which may fall ill later on. That is precisely why we are proposing this measure."
"""Prevention is better than cure"" , as Hippocrates said all those years ago, thereby paving the way for preventive medicine. This is particularly true today, given that there is no cure either for BSE or for the equivalent human disease, the new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob."
"In closing, I should like to commend and thank both Mr Böge, the rapporteur for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and Mrs Roth-Behrendt, the rapporteur for the Committee on the Environment. Thanks to their cooperation and with the help of all their other colleagues, I feel this is truly a much better regulation, and is a vast improvement on what the Commission originally presented to Parliament."
"Mr President, I also wish to endorse and praise the work of Mrs Roth-Behrendt and Mr Böge on this issue and the initial proposals from the Commission."
"Safety must be a priority and we all understand that if we are to have equal precautions throughout the Member States, we need a variety of measures in place which have not so far been instituted."
"Commissioner Byrne is to be congratulated on moving that closer."
"These proposals take us a good deal further down the line in the field of diagnostic testing, in a more sceptical attitude to animals which ought to have been under suspicion but in some Member States were not, and in terms of the general prospect of fallen stock being tested for the possibility of BSE."
"I want to say something, however, coming from the Member State which first suffered the full rigours of BSE and which has also, as a result of that, been in the vanguard of cleaning up this problem."
"We have now had for a considerable period of time in the United Kingdom an over-30-month cull of all animals which have been taken out of the food chain."
"We have been able to tackle the problem of the possibility of maternal transmission by also taking out those animals that might be at risk because of their ancestry."
"From our position, given the measures we take, we do not see any reason at all why we would need to introduce, additionally, whole-herd slaughter of the kind done in some other countries."
"We are being asked not just for a belt-and-braces policy but also to buy a new pair of trousers just in case."
"This would cost a great deal of money."
"It would not remove a single additional suspect case of BSE."
"I would remind those present that, with our additional safety measures, we in the UK are only exporting to the Community de-boned carcasses which have gone through maximum checks and security."
"In the circumstances, therefore, there are a number of amendments tabled by a variety of Members in the United Kingdom which I would commend in this debate."
"I should be very glad to hear whether the Commissioner feels he can accept that in some circumstances - particularly in view of the over-30-month cull in the United Kingdom - for those countries which are admittedly very high risk but also with a very high level of precaution now in place a certain number of derogations are necessary and would be satisfactory to him."
"I sincerely hope so."
"Mr President, I would first of all address the Commissioner and say that I naturally welcome the present proposal."
"Secondly, I want to congratulate Mrs Roth-Behrendt on a very good piece of work."
"I also want to thank Mr Böge."
"I wish to support in principle all the amendments from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection."
"Nowadays, we know a very great deal indeed about the living world."
"Life is not, however, complete, as it were, but is evolving all the time."
"It is evolving not only in a positive way, but also in a negative way."
"As time goes on, we are faced with new viruses and new problems."
"The BSE crisis is an example of such a phenomenon."
"There are, however, also many more examples."
"There are therefore two things which must be done."
"The first is the matter with which we are occupied at present, namely trying to ensure that we get the better both of BSE and of TSE, which is, of course, a broader concept."
"We must make sure that the situation does not occur again."
"However, we must also find ways of overcoming similar tragedies in the future."
"Such tragedies will clearly not occur in precisely this area but will crop up elsewhere."
"This illustrates what the present debate teaches us: that we must have comprehensive regulations for the whole of the common market constituted by the EU."
"We must have the same rules, monitored in the same way."
"Everyone must be treated the same."
"Understandable differences in attitudes have emerged in the course of the debates which we have conducted in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and in the party groups and which are also being conducted here and now in this Chamber."
"I am thinking of the last intervention."
"The United Kingdom has been affected badly."
"I can well understand why people there have points of view as to how it might perhaps be possible to make savings."
"Allow me, however, to say something which is extremely important. We must never suffer for having looked to short-term economic gains at the risk of long-term security."
"There is a danger of the short-term economy' s taking over at the expense of reason and caution."
"To my party colleague, Mrs Attwooll, I have to say that I understand the current amendments very well but that I cannot support them."
"That would mean our becoming unclear and sending out false signals."
"I believe it is extremely important that when, in this context, we decide about this report, we send out a crystal clear signal about the firmness of our judgement on the issue of food safety."
"This is important prior to the forthcoming debate on the whole project entailed in the white paper which has been announced."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Roth-Behrendt, according to a Flemish saying, prevention is better than cure, and I assume that this pearl of wisdom is used in each of our Member States and regions."
"I would like to expressly congratulate Mrs Roth-Behrendt on her report."
"My group has not tabled any amendments and is in full agreement with you."
"We give you our full support and have every confidence in you."
"After all, the proposal follows on from a pledge which was made previously regarding the follow-up committee. This is therefore to be welcomed."
"I would like to home in on the following issues."
"Firstly, it makes sense to include regionalisation and regional differentiation in the goal-oriented fight against TSE."
"If you are in any doubt about this, just ask my Scottish and Welsh colleagues."
"Secondly, there are tests for a rapid diagnosis and to identify TSE in cattle."
"We, as Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection want to make these methods available so as to improve our monitoring procedures, and rightly so."
"As it happens, we all know that these tests are not yet scientifically accurate and that when these tests are applied, we do not know precisely whether infection actually occurs at each stage of the disease."
"I believe that these tests are at least heading in the right direction and that we should support the scientific research carried out in this field."
"Thirdly, I welcome the requirement to destroy or remove the entire herd on farms where the disease has broken out."
"Fourthly, there is indeed a need for additional legislation for products such as cosmetics, medicines and pharmaceutical preparations which are excluded from the present proposal."
"Finally, I would like to draw your attention to a number of amendments which actually provide for a number of points to be lifted from the appendix and included in the body of the text."
"I think that it is important to bring about more democracy, to get away from comitology, and to increase parliamentary control."
"These are cardinal amendments, to my mind."
"Mr President, the proposal for a regulation under discussion does not aim to address the problems, as the Commission hypocritically claims, but to cover up the problems which have arisen in certain countries, thereby generalising them and making them everybody' s problem."
"This is why this proposal needs to be changed, particularly where it specifies classifying countries into categories."
"If the Commission really wanted to protect public health from spongiform encephalopathies, it would have proposed rules to prevent such risks a long time ago, but it did not."
"It would have made provision for the necessary procedures and penalties."
"But the interests of multinational food corporations, which have subjugated everything to the rationale of excessive profit, precluded any such action."
"So, this Commission initiative only made its appearance once the situation had got out of control - with dioxin for example - and is now endeavouring to show that it has some control over the situation."
"The conclusion which we draw from this draft regulation is that it is probably an attempt to cover up the situation."
"That is the direction in which things are heading with the classification of countries, which, rather than taking into account the most basic factor, which is the existence or non-existence of cases of encephalopathy in their raised cattle, takes account of other factors when allocating countries to a particular category."
"The worst thing about this is that, theoretically, if a member state in which cases of encephalopathy have been reported can prove that it has established systems for monitoring production, it could be placed in the same category as a country in which no cases have ever been reported."
"This same spirit, this ""lowest common denominator"" approach, pervades the rest of the proposed measures, such as the mandatory removal of various organs (spleen, brain, spinal cord, etc.)."
"Such measures will blacken the reputation of meat-producing countries in which there have been no cases of encephalopathy and will also discredit sheepmeat and goatmeat, since there is no substantial scientific evidence as to whether this meat is sensitive to spongiform encephalopathy pathogens."
"At the same time, the proposal to remove the aforementioned organs and tissues is a recipe for disaster for sheep- and goatmeat, which will be impossible to market; in other words, this measure will indirectly oust sheep and goat meat from the market, demand will be met by other types of meat from larger animals and traditional recipes using offal such as intestines and spleen will be banned."
"We therefore oppose the Commission proposal."
"Mr President, I welcome the opportunity of making a brief contribution to this debate and I congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work."
"Parliament has certainly devoted considerable time on behalf of its citizens to addressing the important agenda of food safety, while at the same time ensuring that our farmers can operate within a production framework of traceability which is the only way to fully restore consumer confidence in the wide range of quality food products produced by European farmers."
"For this reason, the creation of a uniform legal basis for controlling and preventing the spread of BSE and scrapie is paramount and there is still, as other speakers have suggested, a lack of consistency in relation to the application of the regulations within individual Member States."
"I would urge Commissioner Byrne to prioritise introduction of that level of consistency which is the only way that we can convince our consumers that we have a common policy in relation to ensuring public health."
"As I have said in previous debates, farmers are the victims of circumstances beyond their control and those responsible for the manufacture of animal feed which puts public health, our entire livestock sector and indeed farm incomes at risk, have much to answer for."
"This House must be vigilant in ensuring that it can never again be repeated."
"I welcome the availability of rapid diagnostic testing for improved detection of TSEs in cattle and believe, Commissioner, that further consideration should be given to its use as a means of establishing the health status of animals in Member States."
"For my country, Ireland, food exports and in particular beef are of paramount importance to our economy and the income of farmers."
"I can say that we have left no stone unturned in tackling this problem, including the removal of entire herds where an infected animal has in fact been diagnosed."
"May I say in conclusion that farmers have always responded in a positive way to the introduction of regulations governing public health and the health status of animals raised for food production."
"Their task as guarantors of food security and quality is, as everyone in this House knows, becoming increasingly difficult."
"Far too often their contribution to society has been taken for granted and certainly not always adequately rewarded with a reasonable income."
"Mr President, Mrs Roth-Behrendt, Mr Böge, Commissioner, we have before us a proposal for a regulation on the prevention of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, which is to say degeneration of the brain in bovine animals, sheep, primates, antelope, cats and even humans, since there have been 53 cases of atypical Creutzfeldt-Jakob in Great Britain, all fatal."
"So now we are going to adopt regulations to prevent an epidemic that we have known about since 1986, i.e. for fourteen years."
"It is rather late in the day to react, but even so over the last fourteen years we have done a great deal."
"Last month, for example, we decided to stick labels on meat to warn consumers."
"The Commission told us that it was impossible to enforce such labelling before 2002, sixteen years after the outbreak of the disease, but we have done something all the same."
"We have had discussions with Mr Delors, with Mr Santer, with Mr Prodi, with Mr McSharry, the Commissioner responsible for agriculture, then Mr Steichen, and Mr Fischler. We have set up a committee of inquiry chaired by our fellow Member, Mr Böge, a temporary monitoring committee; we have even tabled a motion of censure, against Mr Böge' s wishes."
"We have heard expert opinions from Mr Dirringer, the German virologist, Mr Picoud, Mr Dormont, Scottish specialists, our Portuguese fellow Member, Garcia, was a specialist."
"We have had debates, topical and urgent questions on the embargo, etc."
"After fourteen years of discussion, there are few survivors of this war of nigh on twenty years - Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, Mr Cunha, Mr Böge, and myself."
"Mr Happart left us and Mr Pagel died."
"So I think it would be useful for the more recent Members, in the end, if I gave a sort of debriefing on the subject, quite apart from the problems with the legal basis under Article 100 A or BSE monitoring problems."
"The starting point for this business was the 1984 milk quotas."
"To improve their milk reference, our British friends drove their cows like some sort of engines, overfeeding them, and, in order to save on the cost of fodder, they fed their cows on meal made from carcasses."
"Then, again, to save fuel oil when manufacturing meal, they reduced the cooking temperature, thereby enabling the pathogen to survive."
"BSE is the tragic product of the race for profits and the British farm model."
"The disease has been identified since 1986, but nothing much was done until 1996."
"Why not?"
"The public could not be thrown into a panic because the Maastricht Treaty had to be sold to them."
"So the press, the Commission and the European Parliament all knew about it, but did not say a word."
"So when, in March 1996, the British, via the British Ministers for Agriculture and Health, admitted that the disease could be transmitted to human beings, the necessary measures were not taken."
"Why?"
"Because this time the reason the public could not be thrown into a panic was no longer to sell the Maastricht Treaty but the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"So, met first with silence and then with lies, the epidemic spread and we all know what the outcome of that was."
"In the first place, BSE has not been eradicated in Great Britain, and will not be eradicated."
"Secondly, the belated ban on meal did not serve to eradicate contamination."
"Thirdly, either contamination crossed over to the meal fed to poultry, or there is a third transmission route."
"In addition to maternal contamination, there may be transmission via the fields, the grazing land, the grass, and there may be badlands, as in the case of ovine scrapie, where the prion would be encysted and would return as soon as bovine animals were put to pasture there."
"Fourthly, Great Britain and the industrialists causing the contamination have not, as polluters, paid."
"It is innocent farmers, grain farmers, who are paying the price, in the same way that the farmers are paying for Kosovo."
"All in all, then, the directive and the regulation are all well and good, but they are somewhat hypocritical."
"We all agree that we need regulations on prevention, we are all agreed on adopting the amendments from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, to whom the matter should have been referred."
"We all agree that scientific measures are needed, methods to be used in abattoirs to remove the ilia, the ganglia, the duodena, the inguinal, medial, lateral, renal, prefemoral and cervical lymph nodes, but this is not the key issue."
"In the BSE crisis, at the moment of truth, when protective action had to be taken, it was taken by the national states."
"That is the main lesson to be learnt from the TSE business."
"Firstly, protection is always led by the states."
"Secondly, the precautionary principle means safeguarding nations."
"This is no obstacle to the construction of Europe but, like children making tree houses, it is just a game."
