"I can imagine the following points: there should be efforts to create a separate Community initiative to safeguard or improve the environment and a certain percentage of structural fund monies should be set aside for compensatory measures."
"The principle of compensation should be a routine part of the planning procedure."
"In some countries of the Union this is the case, but it certainly is not in those countries which receive the lion's share of structural fund money."
"It has come to my notice that some people do not even know about this principle's existence."
"So what should we go for?"
"In large-scale infrastructure projects, for example, for the building of ʼwildlife overpasses'."
"This will preserve the habitats of rare animal species at a relatively low cost."
"We hear a lot of talk about a certain percentage of the total costs of building a road or railway line."
"I should like to hear what the Commissioner thinks about these compensatory measures."
"Does she think it feasible to have provision for these included in the structural fund regulations?"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report. It is a thoughtful and well-corroborated piece of work."
"After the speeches and comments of the other members, there is very little left for me to say, but it will not be futile, I think, or a waste of time, if I add a few words about certain points."
"The environment is unquestionably one of the most crucial issues with which the European Union - and not only it - has to grapple, and I think everyone now recognizes that. The time when the environment was a subject of concern to just a few people on the margins of politics has gone."
"Today the requirement for economic and social choices and activities to be adapted to the environment's capacity to withstand them is accepted almost universally."
"The European Union's cohesion policies must provide for a substantial strengthening of the environmental dimension in the framework of their future implementation."
"These policies have done much to promote development and progress in recent years, but it is a fact that development very often increases the burden on the environment."
"It is essential, therefore, that economic policies are targeted towards the goal of sustainable development."
"Protection and conservation of the environment is now a top priority. If that priority is ignored, the results for us, in our own time, will be devastating, and future generations will be left with a massively devalued inheritance."
"The supranational and, frequently, global scale of certain environmental problems demands cooperation at the local, regional, trans-frontier and international levels."
"The European Union has great moral, economic and political standing in the world, and it must use its influence more effectively to promote international efforts to solve the global problems and foster sustainable development."
"As I finish, let me stress this: the environment depends on what we do collectively; the environment of the future will depend on the actions that we take now."
"Madam President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, human welfare is inconceivable if the ecosystems are not protected. Their deterioration would make growth unsustainable."
"So environmental protection must be a crucial objective of regional policy."
"Cohesion and environment are, and must increasingly be, two basic objectives of European Union action."
"The horizontal nature of both and their priority application to all Community policies already appear in the treaty - articles 130 A to 130 E."
"The Commission is on the right track with its communication, although it should be required to augment both policies."
"The backward regions need aid to protect the environment - their environment, our environment."
"We must move to real convergence in quality of life as well."
"Maintaining and empowering the cohesion fund in the future, strengthening structural funds measures and Community initiatives targeted on the environment and, in particular - I want to stress this - raising awareness, not only of national governments, but also of regional and local authorities and of citizens in general, are the essential routes to regarding the environment in the rural and backward peripheries of Europe as an investment in the future, generating employment and balanced and sustainable development."
"Let me end by congratulating Mr Hatzidakis on his report and on having succeeded in intelligently incorporating the valuable contributions of the Committee on Environment and the Committee on Budgets of this Parliament."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, once again the European Parliament is definitely going to reassert its commitment to the principles aimed at guaranteeing the environment dimension in the elaboration and application at all levels of the European Union's cohesion policy."
"These are the unalienable principles and guidelines which we have always defended and which we demand, and which we still continue to consider vital for making it possible to achieve sustainable development."
"The introduction and observance of new and better rules in the environment field is, of course, something positive: to achieve and reinforce controls and actions underpinning their respective implementation is something which can only, obviously, be supported."
"These good ideas and examples, together with the good guidelines put forward, could continue to take up all of my time - and I should also congratulate Mr Hatzidakis on his excellent work."
"But there is always a 'but' ."
"Sometimes more than one."
"In this debate there are also buts, and I should like to refer to them."
"We should like to see the implementation of these rules and guidelines simultaneously applied with equal consequence and effectiveness in every aspect of Community action, from agricultural policy to agro-industrial policy to industrial activities, more generally, in particular where - in the less developed countries and regions of the European Union - it is responsible for a large share of highly harmful toxic emissions which could actually damage the future of human life."
"We, therefore, find it hard to comprehend the huge relative deficit and even the virtual non-existence of basic infrastructures supporting economic activities in the cohesion countries, from transport to the infrastructures related to water supplies and provision - for example, in my country using the waters of the Alqueva - and it is incomprehensible that these should not be analysed with more thoroughness."
"Insisting on subjecting cohesion policies to environmental criteria is absolutely defendable but we doubt the goodwill of those promoting it - as they support it in an almost exclusive or obsessional way."
"Therefore, we have more or less serious fears that, behind the unquestionably good ideas and guidelines, lurk strategies which aim at making it more difficult to restore the balance and or at impeding genuine economic competitiveness rather than being truly interested in defending and promoting internal cohesion in the European Union."
"Madam President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, while travelling to Strasbourg today I read an article in a Spanish newspaper on concern about the environment amongst the international scientific community."
"It has an ambitious proposal: to gear all its forces towards the century of the environment - the coming century - and provide all possible information to those taking the decisions."
"The report Mr Hatzidakis is presenting today on the Commission communication on cohesion policy and the environment specifically mentions the wide concern this issue arouses, not least amongst ourselves."
"The need for Community structural measures to prevent the environment deteriorating, highly rational use of environmental impact studies, sharing the cohesion fund 50-50 between infrastructure and environmental projects, more effective monitoring committees, creation of a specific Community initiative on the environment... ladies and gentlemen, all this cannot remain a mere wish list, but has to be transformed into tangible reality."
"Development and the environment - as our colleague points out in his report - cannot be opposing concepts but must be complementary."
"Systematic dialogue with local and regional authorities, investment in better training for women and men working in the sector - 80 % of whom are fairly unskilled, greater attention to preventive measures, better technical assistance from the Commission and enshrinement of the principle for selecting the most beneficial or least prejudicial measures for the environment are - as Mr Hatzidakis says - fundamental factors for making progress on the road to a Community regional policy increasingly committed to our environment and with the already established principle of sustainable development."
"Madam President, Madam Commissioner, to avoid repetition, I will just emphasize a few points:"
"First, I note that the results of the cohesion policies in terms of regional development are positive overall."
"Second, it is good not only for the less developed regions, but also for the rich regions - thus fulfilling the forecasts for the single market."
"With criticism of the regional development policies growing, the European Commission must evaluate the beneficial repercussions of the regional development policies on the richest regions of the Union."
"Existing preliminary data on the transfer of wealth and capital between more and less developed countries could surprise those critics."
"Third, I agree with the rapporteur that the regulations on the cohesion fund are not always complied with, either in letter or in spirit."
"The Commission must be vigilant and ensure that the 40 % of the fund allocated to environmental policies really does go to them."
"Fourth and last, there should be a more binding obligation to carry out an environmental impact study, not just a formal one as at present."
"Similarly, for the concept of sustainable development to be effective, projects in progress must be monitored and on completion their environmental cost must be evaluated."
"I end by congratulating Mr Hatzidakis on his excellent report."
"Madam President, I think that, on the whole, we have a good report before us."
"It highlights several weak points in our environmental policy."
"It also states categorically that care of the environment must permeate all parts of the Union's policies."
"For this to happen, there needs to be a firm legal basis."
"This is why I think that point 13 in the report, which discusses the Directive and the environmental implications is especially important."
"It is quite clear that this Directive, in the current climate, is too weak and vague on several important points and that it needs to be improved."
"I would like to give a concrete example of this."
"It concerns the building of the Öresund bridge which forms a permanent link between Sweden and Denmark and which will have grave environmental consequences."
"It is extremely doubtful that this Directive was considered when the decision was taken to build this bridge."
"While building work has already commenced on the bridge there is a court case underway in Denmark to establish how far the EU directive has been fulfilled."
"It is quite obvious that environmental concerns are put to one side if they happen to be in conflict with greater economic interests."
"It is precisely for this reason that a firmer legal basis is needed to enable us to intervene and prevent implementation of a project until we are certain that the Directive has been properly complied with as far as environmental consequences are concerned."
"I would also like to express my support for amendment proposal No. 2 from the Green Group which concerns the provision of financial support for environmental organisations which participate in the supervisory committee."
"I think this is a very important issue."
"Madam President, Madam Commissioner, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Hatzidakis, because I think he has done excellent work. He has focused our attention on a key issue today and in the future."
"The structural funds certainly needed a pretty strong and radical rethink, and he has done that. It would be a major advance if the proposals made in the report became reality."
"When we talk about the structural funds and employment, we must recognize that the structural funds are not designed to generate immediate jobs, and we need to concentrate on what we should expect of the structural funds."
"First, no environmental abuse must be committed in the use of them, as has happened in the past, and serious and far-reaching mistakes that have occurred must be corrected; secondly, European Union cohesion policy must contribute to the protection, improvement and empowerment of the environment in Europe."
"I think that is the report's objective framework."
"We must not expect things of this report that it cannot and should not provide."
"We should concentrate specifically on its aim: to guarantee that environment policy is implemented along with cohesion policy."
"The report also gives a clear warning - and I shall end with this point, Mr President - that the cohesive character of European Union environment policy is not always guaranteed."
"It could be said that environment policy is actually liable to be accused of being 'anti-cohesive' ."
"As the report states, environmental issues should not be used to disguise competitiveness."
"Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Hatzidakis, on his excellent report and on initiating a rethink as well."
"For too long environmental issues have been seen as a brake on development, as an obstacle, principally in the countries of the south of Europe which need that development most."
"But this report sets out a different scenario, viewing the environment and its inclusion in cohesion policies as a development factor in itself."
"First because respect for the environment helps create agreeable surroundings, which is in turn a vector of productive investment, be it industrial or in the services sector."
"And secondly because the environment is a productive sector in itself, and a great generator of jobs too, with some growth indicators higher than in traditional sectors."
"I also want to stress that this report seeks to involve regional and local authorities in the planning, monitoring and evaluation stages for the structural and cohesion funds, and I would add implementation, where the regions have that power."
"Madam Commissioner, I imagine you are highly sensitive towards the European nations and regions which do not have statehood, but which, in full application of the principle of subsidiarity, bring decision-making closer to natural reality and the citizens."
"So you will quite understand that my message to you is to pay particular attention to point 16 of the resolution."
"Just as in the Middle Ages certain kings who were powerless in comparison to the feudal lords sought alliance with the towns to progress political and social development, so the European Commission and the regions must give each other mutual support to progress regional cohesion and the construction of Europe, rising above the inertia of the States in this regard."
"So I am convinced that greater regional participation in the planning, monitoring, implementation and evaluation of these funds will help improve and optimize them, and that this improvement will include the deepening of the environmental aspect of cohesion policies."
"Madam President, as has often been observed here, and as the rapporteur has clearly shown, cohesion policy is inseparable from environmental policy."
"The environmental dimension and sustainable development absolutely must be taken into account in all Structural Fund and Cohesion Fund measures."
"For this reason I do not particularly like the idea of setting up another new fund, this time for environmental policy, because the environment ought precisely to be an element in the operations of the Structural Funds."
"No such step should be permitted, because it would damage the environment."
"I also support the use of EU budget and Structural Fund and Cohesion Fund resources for direct environmental protection measures because employment and the environment are often seen as being in conflict with each other, but this is actually a misconception."
"There are regions where sustainable development can be achieved only through sustainable development of the environment, for example where tourism is concerned - a field in which it is predicted that a great many new jobs will be created in the future."
"It does not make sense to develop tourism services unless at the same time measures are taken to ensure that we have clean water, clean beaches and unspoilt nature."
"Regional development or regional planning is a new element in the Union's activities."
"By means of it, an effort is being made to devote attention to environmental aspects on a European scale."
"Here I should like to stress only that in order for this Interreg II C initiative to succeed fully in those regions where it is implemented, it is essential to ensure that both the EU Member States and the third countries involved in the programme can participate fully."
"At present only Member States receive support under the Interreg II C programme, and this could mean that the third countries are not sufficiently motivated to play their part in this cooperation."
"Madam President, environment and cohesion, two priorities which, albeit recognised in the letter, are not effectively applied to political practice in the European Union."
"But why?"
"Because, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, they hit at the heart of the matter."
"Indeed, the thorough application of a concept of sustainable development is undoubtedly the solution for the future but it creates problems for those looking for immediate results."
"If Europe wants to be a future force, or rather a force with a future, it must rely on these two essential values: protecting the environment and cohesion, not only economic but also social and educational cohesion."
"These are the poles of the axis which defines a sustainable Europe."
"The Cohesion Fund and the Structural Fund were not and are not questions of the European Union's generosity."
"They were an act of lucidity because strengthening cohesion is just as essential for the strong countries as for the weak members of this open and competitive society."
"Let us not lower the tone of the debate by attributing the defence of this point of view to national interests."
"I defend here the interests of Europe as a whole and I think that by defending a better European Union, I am defending my country."
"The exceptionally high quality report by Mr Hatzidakis, which takes up many points in the equally excellent opinions accompanying it, sums up the essence in points 1, 2 and 3."
"I shall not repeat them but I would insist on their political importance."
"In points 6, 8, 12, 15, 19 and 21 he puts forward solutions which deserve the full attention of the Commission."
"Instead of a 50/50 balance, as suggested by the report, for transport and the environment, in my view it would be better for the Cohesion Fund to stimulate integrated policies on these aspects."
"And I will be the first, ladies and gentlemen, to urge my country to do the same."
"Madam President, Madam Commissioner, first I want to congratulate Mr Hatzidakis, because in his report he has made it clear that one of the prime objectives of the cohesion policies is to achieve sustainable development which does not destroy the environment."
"To achieve it, the various cohesion programmes and measures must be directed not only towards regional development but also towards strengthening respect for the environment."
"So the Commission itself must effectively respect the 50 % split between transport infrastructure and environmental measures in the cohesion fund."
"We must applaud the ever greater sensitivity that exists both at Community level and at regional and state level to target sustainable development which does not regard economic development and respect for the environment as essentially contradictory objectives, but as compatible and indeed complementary."
"To give just one example, the annual report on the structural funds, which I am studying for the Committee on Regional Policy, deals transversely with the environment."
"The various instruments the European Union has available must be strengthened and environmental impact studies must be made compulsory."
"We must give the committees monitoring work in progress greater power, and increase cooperation between the Commission and the Member States and NGOs."
"The various Community initiatives and measures covered by article 10 of the ERDF must have a more profound effect on the protection and promotion of the environment, providing support systems for the SMEs involved and sectors like ecological and rural tourism, and indeed agriculture."
"More extensive and continuous dialogue with the regional and local bodies is fundamental because they are the direct recipients of cohesion policies and jointly responsible for their implementation."
"Unfortunately, the policy the European Commission is pursuing has not always respected the spirit in which the structural and cohesion funds were created and has occasionally been anti-cohesive, because, when presenting the various proposals in environmental matters, the Commission does not really take account of the differences that exist between the various Member States of the Union nor their consequent financial obligations for the conservation of their natural heritage."
"Environmental problems are different in countries in the north and south of Europe and, logically, the economic and financial solutions will therefore be different too."
"This should prompt a change in European Commission policy towards presenting the various proposals after studying - and accepting - the particular characteristics of each Member State, and their own environmental problems and particular financial obligations."
"All this means - and I am finishing, Madam President - the European Union must put all the necessary resources in place to finance a new policy deriving from the Single Act - environment policy - in order to support the tremendous efforts countries in the Mediterranean crescent, like Spain, have to make to apply certain Community provisions because they have a greater natural heritage."
"Madam President, I hope you will allow me to detain you for a while but I believe the careful report drawn up by Mr Hatzidakis and the discussion in this House make it urgently necessary for me to clarify one or two points."
"First I want to make it clear - and you will realise that if you look at Mr Hatzidakis' report and the communication from the Commission - that we broadly agree on the principles involved."
"However, I would have hoped that you would take more account of the written information passed on to the Committee on the Environment on 3 July last year."
"I would also urge you to take account in your conclusions of the fact that we are adhering to Community law currently in force and have to observe the principle of subsidiarity, which means that even if we agree with your demands we simply cannot infringe the rules that currently apply."
"Finally, we must not forget that the structural funds are already promoting very substantial environmental investment, e.g. in the Objective 1 regions where this assistance accounts for about ECU 1 600 million, and I think this is indeed an example of cohesion in environmental policy."
"Nevertheless, we are actively engaged on translating into practice the measures announced in the communication of 22 November 1996 on cohesion and the environment and the letter of 8 December, known as the declaration of intent."
"In relation to the cohesion fund, we are aiming at dividing the funds equally between environmental and transport projects over the entire 1993-1999 planning period."
"Indeed the most recent planning figures demonstrate that we can achieve this if we act consistently, thanks to the improvements in 1996 and the very strong pressure the Commission will exert in future years too."
"Let me also point out that no major project is authorized without the necessary, prior environmental impact assessment and that compensatory measures are not just required but are also co-financed from the structural funds."
"But, firstly, as one speaker pointed out, the environmental impact assessment directive is not as watertight as we would all have wished and secondly, I would have liked the ministers and the governments, with whom I had very serious differences on the question of taking account of the environment and sustainability in their investment policy, to have heard this debate now, for they sometimes see me as something of an environmental visionary rather than as someone who wants to carry through this Parliament's common objectives."
"For the rest, of course we also involve local and regional authorities, but unfortunately they are not always on the side for which you have fought here today either and there is some conflict among them too, which I hope we can resolve jointly by making them more aware of these issues."
"At programme planning level, we want to tighten up the preventive measures in future and encourage a change of course towards sustainable development."
"But I would ask you to consider that all the major programmes for 1994-1999 were already approved before this Commission took office and that this is the legal basis on which we have to work."
"We had one practical opportunity and we have made use of it, namely for the second programming stage of Objective 2 for 19971999."
"In April 1996 we set out guidelines for the new Objective 2 programmes, in which the environment was one of the four priorities on which we laid special emphasis."
"And we were successful in this, as can be seen today, for new programmes are only approved if they place priority on the environment and the provide the requisite environmental details in the form of what are called environmental profiles."
"Progress has also been made in involving environmental authorities."
"The mid-term review of Objective 1 and Objective 6 programmes which will occur this year also offers the Commission an opportunity to evaluate not just purely economic aspects but also questions of sustainable development."
"However, I must point out that the cohesion fund and the structural funds are not environmental funds but that they are regional development funds and that we have to try to establish a sensible balance between what are at time very disparate interests."
"For the Objective 1 and Objective 6 mid-term reviews the Commission is establishing a new matrix for qualitative environmental indicators and we hope that will take us forward a little too."
"For the rest, the INTERREG 2c Community initiative also places emphasis on the environment, the protection of resources and water management."
"Even the current programmes contain some - admittedly only some - qualified information on environmental objectives and indicators."
"Mrs Bjerregaard, Mr Fischler and I have therefore set up a working party to work jointly with environmental experts in define certain key indicators that can be identified fairly easily and then applied."
"Since the funds are administered decentrally and the Member States' national and regional authorities are solely responsible for selecting the individual projects, we have to start with the Member States themselves; and let me point out again that there is no obligation on them to notify smaller projects."
"So we can only try to raise their awareness of these issues."
"That is why we are organizing environmental seminars for fund managers and members of the monitoring committees in the Member States."
"The first pilot seminar was held in Ireland in November 1996 and there will also be seminars in Portugal and in Greece in the first six months of this year."
"At the same time the Commission is carrying out further training schemes for its own staff, aimed primarily at the strategic evaluation of environmental effects and environmental impact assessments, and over the past year trained environmental officers have been appointed in nearly all the services of my departments."
"In reply to the call for new structures let me say that in my view we do not so much need to create new structures as to integrate the environment in all regional assistance measures and we will seriously endeavour to do precisely that."
"As speaker just said, the seventh annual report on the 1995 structural funds attaches great priority to the environmental dimension."
"The annual reports on the cohesion fund and the structural funds will do the same in future and we will thus comply with our obligation to make a report."
"In accordance with the letter of 8 December 1995, for new large projects of a value of more than ECU 50 million the Commission will confirm in an environmental impact note that the project in question will not have any harmful environmental effects or that any such effects will be remedied during the execution of the project."
"My services, working together with DG XI, have now drawn up an improved testing document."
"I will submit the new environmental impact forms to Parliament as soon as the ongoing analytical work is completed."
"The project lists will also be published in the Official Journal and appear in the annual reports on the cohesion and regional funds."
"Lastly, the Commission has continued its constructive dialogue with representative environmental organizations and non-governmental organizations in order to improve the transparency of structural policy projects."
"But I do realise, because I have discussions on these matters constantly and almost every day, how far we still have to go and how much support we need, particularly in the Member States, if we are to achieve our aims."
"So I continue to rely on your support."
"Thank you, Mrs Wulf-Mathies."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"(The sitting was closed at 8.10 p.m.)"
"We have been told of another act of terrorism in Spain: a police officer was murdered yesterday in Bilbao."
"On behalf of the whole European Parliament, I should like to express our condemnation of this act and our sympathy for the victim's family and for the whole Spanish people."
"Our thoughts are with all those who risk their lives to maintain a peaceful society, and we shall stand by all the resolutions we have adopted regarding the fight against terrorism whenever the law is broken, in Spain or in any other country."
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, on page 14 of the minutes: the list of questions called."
"I tabled a question on working time specifically addressed to Commissioner Kinnock."
"This appears way down as Question No 100, and not in the section addressed to Commissioner Kinnock."
"There may be a simple explanation, and this may be due to a little slip-up or mistake in the administration."
"However, as Mr Smith and Ms Oddy also had sensitive questions on transport covering the transport of nuclear waste and they were also put into this section, I am getting rather suspicious that there are some dark forces manipulating the agenda."
"I seek your assurance that this is not the case and I seek your help in getting this matter raised properly."
"Mr McMahon, I am not aware of the existence of any dark forces manipulating our proceedings."
"I certainly hope that no such forces exist, and that the error you point out can be corrected."
"Mr President, just to confirm what Mr McMahon said, my question was on the transport of nuclear material."
"I do not know whether that comes under the umbrella of dark forces but I would appreciate an investigation into the matter."
"I can only tell you that it is not we who decide which Commissioner answers questions: the Commission decides that, but, as I said before, if there has been an error it will certainly be corrected as far as the drafting of the text is concerned."
"Mr President, the same dark forces have not been at work on my question."
"My question on the same issue does actually appear under Mr Kinnock."
"So, there is something strange going on: sexism, perhaps?"
"Thank you, Mrs Ahern."
"We shall pass these comments on to the Commission so that matters can be put right."
"(Parliament approved the Minutes)"
"Decision on urgency"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to oppose the use of urgent procedure."
"The Council began by taking some months to complete its deliberations, without any regard for the decisions of this House; it then high-handedly amended the programme as it saw fit; and finally it asked the Legal Service to clear up any procedural questions."
"The response of the Legal Service was to issue a warning: it told the Council to consult Parliament again because the proposed amendments were so far-reaching."
"This is not the proper way to proceed."
"I think that the committee must carry out a fundamental re-examination of the issue."
"(Parliament rejected the request for urgent procedure)"
"Mr President, I ask you to refer to the services, please."
"Today's session news - the Strasbourg Notebook - about yesterday's opening session absolutely gives the wrong impression."
"It is absolutely wrong on what happened yesterday regarding the request to change the time of the vote on the BSE motion of censure."
"It states that Pauline Green, London North PSE, requested the House to delay the vote on the motions for resolution scheduled for voting on Wednesday at 12 noon."
"That is absolutely wrong."
"I did nothing of the sort."
"It misleads the media and the outside world."
"On behalf of my group could you please get it withdrawn immediately."
"Thank you, Mrs Green."
"Your remarks are authoritative; of course they have nothing to do with the Minutes, but we have taken note of what you say."
"Social security schemes"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten (A4-0018/97), on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a Council Regulation (EC) amending, for the benefit of unemployed persons, Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 on the application of social security schemes to employed persons, to self-employed persons and to members of their families moving within the Community and Regulation (EEC) No 574/72 laying down the procedure for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 (COM(95)0734 - C4-0116/96-96/0004(CNS))."
"Mr President, the Commission's proposal is designed to enable those who are unemployed to spend longer than the three months currently allowed looking for work in another country without losing their entitlement to unemployment benefit."
"The Commission put forward a similar proposal in 1980 to give people freedom of movement and the best possible chance of finding work."
"That proposal came to nothing, but this time, I gather, it stands a good chance of success."
"The conditions for transferring unemployment benefits to another country are very strict."
"You have to be really determined, because getting permission to do it and looking for work in other countries is not so easy, however pleasant they may be."
"You have to have savings behind you, because looking for work in another country means that you will get the lowest rate of benefit for the shortest period of time."
"This prevents abuses of the system, and means that only job-seekers who are genuinely motivated receive help."
"The proposals on the amount and duration of the payments and the requirement to register as unemployed and actively to seek work have the full support of the Committee on Social Affairs and your rapporteur."
"There are two more minor points on which I have tabled amendments."
"What do we do about someone who is unemployed but undergoing training?"
"Does that person also have the same rights if he is registered in another Member State?"
"I have put forward an amendment on this."
"Then there are the frontier workers."
"They too are now free to choose: whereas before they had to be covered by the statutory scheme in their country of residence, they can now elect to come under the scheme in the country where they work."
"This is good news, and is something which the European Parliament and I myself called for in the 1995 report by the Committee on Social Affairs."
"However, there is something slightly strange here."
"In one Member State, Luxembourg, where there are many frontier workers, workers are free to choose, but it is the country of residence, in other words Belgium, which foots the bill."
"This is a proposal which may be fine for the workers themselves, since they will not notice any difference, but it is an anomaly in the system, and I think that systems which constantly need exceptions are not acceptable."
"The Committee on Social Affairs shares this view, and I have therefore tabled an amendment to the effect that, since the Luxembourg Government will suddenly be facing enormous costs, the transitional scheme agreed should apply for no more than five years. I would point out to our colleagues from Luxembourg that they must remember that frontier workers who become unemployed in their country have also contributed to its social security budget."
"So this is another point on which I have tabled an amendment."
"I should like to take this opportunity to tell the Commissioner, through Mr Flynn, that Parliament has greatly appreciated working with officials at the Commission, particularly those directly involved with the very difficult dossier concerning Regulation 1408/71. I should also like to reiterate our thanks to Mr Rob Cornelissen and wish him every success in his new job."
"We know that Mr Verschuren, who is now also there beside you, will certainly show the same commitment in tackling this dossier, and I would ask the Commissioner to pass on our congratulations to him and his colleagues."
"There is one final comment I should like to make."
"We have recently encountered a number of problems in dealing with Regulation 1408/71 because one Member State after another has been introducing cutbacks in social security and trying to bring it under their tax systems, which are not coordinated."
"I would therefore urge Mr Flynn to bear this in mind and to make sure, if we really are to coordinate social security and taxation for frontier workers, including in Regulation 1408/71, that there is only one choice."
"The University of Maastricht has just produced a report on behalf of employers' and workers' organizations calling for this one choice, so let us try to streamline things a little better."
"It is something I feel strongly about, because it could help us to solve many problems in future for our frontier workers, who are after all the daily embodiment of what Europe means."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mrs OomenRuijten, not only on her excellent assessment of the Commission proposal that we are discussing today, but also on her ability to look ahead."
"Indeed, certain aspects of the Commission proposal, such as those concerning the unemployment benefit rights of frontier workers, were mentioned by the rapporteur in her report adopted by the Social Affairs Committee on 15 May 1995."
"Hitherto, when employed persons who have always resided in another Member State have become wholly unemployed in the Member State of employment, there has been a problem in defining their rights."
"The solution adopted has varied according to the type of worker involved."
"While frontier workers have automatically been subject to the legislation of the Member State of residence, other types of worker - in particular, seasonal workers - have been able to choose between the systems of the two Member States concerned."
"This has been a significant form of discrimination against workers who, every morning, have to cross a border - which is often no more than an artificial demarcation line - in order to go to work in a neighbouring locality."
"On the one hand, these workers have to deal with the regulations of two different countries: their country of employment and their country of residence."
"And, on the other, this situation represents a major obstacle to the completion of the internal market, in particular the establishment of the free movement of workers."
"In this context, the Commission proposal seeks to extend the possibility of choosing between the unemployment systems of the Member State of employment and the Member State of residence to frontier workers."
"I therefore welcome this proposal, which will bring about a significant improvement in the circumstances of this group of workers."
"It is true that a number of matters concerning these workers - those relating to the health benefits of their families, for example - still have to be resolved before the free movement of workers, which constitutes a central pillar of the internal market, is achieved."
"But it is also true that this proposal represents a major step forward for a large number of European Union workers; and you have the honour, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, of having promoted and fought for those workers' rights."
"This report also deals with some important matters concerning the movement of persons who are in receipt of unemployment benefit."
"A system is proposed whereby an unemployed person who is in receipt of unemployment benefit and wishes to go to another Member State to look for work - or to accompany his or her spouse - will, for the first three months, retain his or her entitlement to benefits under the legislation of the competent state, namely the Member State in which he or she was last employed."
"Payment of those benefits will be made on behalf of the institution of the competent state by the institution of the Member State in which the unemployed person is looking for work."
"And, after the initial three-month period, should he or she not yet have found a job, the unemployed person may continue to draw benefits in the Member State in which he or she is looking for work, with some restrictions as to duration and rate."
"I should like to end, Mr President, by congratulating the rapporteur and underlining the fact that this report represents a major step forward in the promotion of workers' rights - promoting the mobility of EU workers - and in the completion of the internal market."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking on behalf of Mrs Hermange, as you have been informed."
"The regulation under consideration today guarantees real freedom of movement for workers in the European Union, by ensuring that social benefits will be continued and social security schemes will still apply."
"But this text is now inadequate, given that unemployment has become an inescapable reality."
"Indeed, it is now more vital than ever to enable those wishing to seek employment in another Member State to do so, and to broaden their horizons, by simplifying the relevant procedures and protecting their living and working conditions."
"President Chirac has, on several occasions, drawn attention to the importance of such a process, encouraging young people to look further afield and to demonstrate professional and geographical mobility."
"They must, however, be given the wherewithal for this mobility, and not discouraged from finding a niche on the broader European job market."
"That is why it now seems necessary to me to amend the regulation in favour of the unemployed, who must be allowed to seek work in another Member State without losing their entitlement to unemployment benefit, currently restricted to three months."
"Someone seeking work in another Member State must be able to obtain social benefits in kind without any difficulty and, above all, must have access to health care."
"In this way, we will strengthen both the European social model and the competitiveness of Europe's economy, based on a skilled and well-motivated working population."
"I should like to thank the rapporteur for her text and, on behalf of the UPE Group, I fully endorse this report."
"I should like to add, in my capacity as rapporteur for the opinion on the Green Paper on obstacles to transnational mobility, presented by Mrs Cresson, that - as Mrs Hermange says - the scope of this regulation should be extended as a matter of urgency to cover students, since they are preparing for the future of Europe when they study abroad in another Member State."
"It is up to us to give them hope by recreating the conditions for a more prosperous and more humane Europe."
"Mr President, I think that Mrs Oomen-Ruijten has given us an excellent assessment of the legal aspects of this regulation and the issues arising from it, so I shall concentrate in my speech on a number of points which I think the Commission and the Council should consider."
"If these amendments to the regulations are to be successful, there needs to be close cooperation between the national authorities responsible for employment and the payment of benefits."
"I myself have experience of how employment organizations in different Member States cooperate, in my case Belgium and the Netherlands."
"I can assure you that it is not easy to get these organizations to work together, not least because they are unable to exchange data because their computerized registration systems are not compatible, for example."
"The Member States do not take account of the fact that this sort of cooperation involves extra costs, particularly in border areas, and it is often difficult for the authorities concerned to find the money. This is a point that I would ask you to put on the agenda for the Council, Mr Flynn."
"I also hope, and I would refer here to the report by the Committee on Legal Affairs, that these amendments to the regulations will also help to solve various problems that are still dragging on, such as between Belgium and the Netherlands, for example, where pension rights have been accumulated in one country, but neither country will pay the pension."
"I entirely agree with what Mrs Oomen-Ruijten said about taxation, and I would go so far as to say that national legislation should not be introduced without some kind of assessment of its impact on frontier workers."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this may appear to be a technical report, but in fact it is a very political one, and I should like to thank Mrs Oomen-Ruijten for taking a step in the right direction."
"Until now, border regimes have been black holes in our system of social security; as far as people in or seeking paid employment are concerned, Europe has allowed the existing national social security systems to be side-stepped."
"Mrs OomenRuijten's proposal, which we support, is to move from that situation at least as far as a system based on the highest common denominator - and that would be better than nothing."
"However, in our view, if unrestricted freedom of movement across borders is really to be feasible, we need to go beyond that model to one based on the lowest common multiple: in other words, one which effectively applies the best arrangements of both the countries in question."
"Such a system is financially feasible, and it would clearly make cross-border job-seeking a more attractive option."
"For this reason, we have tabled an amendment."
"We take the view - and I would put this to Commissioner Flynn - that our borders must be transformed into thresholds, linking and offering access to people who are in or seeking paid employment."
"Europe must become a place of greater social justice where social solidarity is ensured; it cannot continue to be a black hole, swallowing up existing social security systems."
"Mr President, the Commission welcomes the positive attitude of the European Parliament on this particular proposal."
"The Parliament shares the Commission's opinion that unemployed persons should be able to spend more than three months as currently foreseen looking for work in another Member State without losing their entitlement to unemployment benefit."
"You also endorsed the proposal to grant frontier workers who become unemployed the right to choose between the benefit schemes of the Member State of residence or the Member State in which they were last employed."
"Mrs Oomen-Ruijten has produced a very good report; I thank her for it."
"She suggests three very useful amendments."
"The first is in line with the Commission's Green Paper on obstacles to transnational mobility in the areas of education, training and research."
"Mr Pompidou made particular reference to this matter as well."
"The second seeks to delete an exception foreseen for Belgium."
"That seems justified to me following the very narrow interpretation of the Court of Justice which it gave in the Spataro judgment just last June."
"Thirdly, the ten year transitional period on the refund to Luxembourg by the neighbouring Member States of certain unemployment benefits could indeed be reduced to five years."
"There is an amendment tabled by Mr Schörling and Mr Wolf which would affect the balance of the Commission proposal and we are not in a position to accept it for that reason."
"So the Commission is prepared to forward a modified proposal endorsing the ammendments proposed by the rapporteur Mrs Oomen-Ruijten."
"I would also like to thank her most sincerely for her very kind words concerning the services and the staff and I would be glad to convey that to them."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
"Social protection"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Weiler (A4-0016/97), on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the report from the Commission on social protection in the European Union (1995) and on the Commission communication - The future of social protection: a framework for a European debate (COM(95)0457 - C4-0518 and C4-0524/95)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am glad that we are about to deal with an issue today that ought to have been back on the European agenda some time ago, and I am glad that the Commission has provided us with a very useful discussion document."
"We have debated these matters at some length in committee, with experts and NGOs, and I am also pleased to say that both the Irish presidency and now the Dutch presidency have taken the opportunity of working with us to organize specialist conferences."
"I should also like to thank all my colleagues for their constructive help with my report, and I would ask them to appreciate that I have not been able to take on board all the amendments that were submitted."
"I had to disregard some of them because they would have distorted the clear line I wished to take in my report, or because they tended too far towards privatization of the social security system."
"On the other hand, while I have a great deal of sympathy for Amendments Nos 27, 28 and 29, they are unrelated to my report, and in fact belong in another context."
"Over the past six months, there has been a basic consensus throughout the debate that the European social model is a positive factor for Europe as a location for business, and that what we all need is to reform the system, not to cut it back."
"I should like to make it equally clear that reform does not mean harmonization."
"National parliaments will continue in future to decide what form their social security systems ought to take."
"Nonetheless, the European Parliament and our institutions need to become more closely involved in and committed to the process than they have been in the past."
"Demands are being placed on us, for example as regards the urgent need for directives that will ensure freedom of movement for workers."
"Demands are being placed on us in terms of changing social structures and the need for measures to accompany new patterns of work in Europe: for example, atypical conditions of employment - not only part-time employment, but the many and varied individual forms of atypical employment conditions that now exist in Europe."
"And demands are being placed on us - and this is the nub of the matter - in terms of working together with regional and national bodies to combat unemployment, because we all know that unemployment is the main cause of the financial problems in our social security systems."
"That is also the reason why we have asked for an employment chapter in the revised Treaty."
"One important call from the committee is that systems should be made more employment-friendly, in other words some of the burden should be shifted away from the labour factor, and new sources of funding should be found."
"The Member States could, and indeed should, seize the opportunity to take a more environmentally-aware approach, with environmental tax reform."
"We are making a proposal along these lines."
"It will be up to the Member States to decide whether or not they wish to include such new sources of funding in their plans."
"We have worked out responses and suggested solutions to problems in Europe that are similar in all the Member States and all industrialized countries."
"These include, for example, the ageing of the population in Europe, the legitimate desire of women to have paid employment, and the new patterns of work and employment flexibility that I have already mentioned."
"We wish to pursue the debate with the Commission, the Council, the social partners, NGOs and welfare organizations in the Member States."
"Ladies and gentlemen, in my report I have put forward a package of proposals."
"I should be grateful if you would give them your approval; if you would support the need for further work on the subject and our desire to do that work; if you would back our call for some type of institutional forum for jointly exploring solutions and pursuing the debate."
"I would therefore ask you to vote in favour of my report."
"Mr President, I should like to thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak to Parliament on this very important subject which is before the House today."
"I should like to begin by congratulating Mrs Weiler and the Commission on this report, which deals with an issue of crucial importance for the future development of the European Union, and which comes at a time when the Union and its Member States are preparing for a new phase in its socio-economic development after the introduction of EMU."
"It will then be vitally important to redefine the links between economic and monetary integration on the one hand and the coordination of socio-economic policy between the Member States on the other, and this can only be done through dialogue between the governments and the European Parliament."
"Mrs Weiler's report provides some very important pointers here."
"The list of the Union's objectives in the Treaty makes it clear that maintaining high levels of employment and social protection is one of the main tasks facing the Union."
"At the same time, we all realize that the process of actually putting these key objectives into practice is still in its infancy."
"Although a great deal of important work has been done in recent years, not least by the Commission, we have still barely scratched the surface and urgently need to make more progress."
"The White Paper on growth, competitiveness and employment, the Delors White Paper, is still extremely relevant to the further development of our ideas on this point."
"Although it is now several years old, it would be a mistake to consign this report to our historical archives, since we are still working on the development of a number of the main themes it covers, and it is now our aim to put these into practice."
"This was one of the reasons why the Dutch presidency felt it important to have further discussions on a number of topics arising from the White Paper during its period in office."
"We organized a conference entitled 'Social policy and economic performance' at the end of January in Amsterdam, where we attempted to see social policy not just as a social desideratum, but also as a production factor for generating growth, employment and prosperity in the Union, in order to have a clearer view of the synthesis between social policy and economic performance."
"With the valuable input that we had from Commissioner Flynn and his directorate-general at the conference, I think I can say that we contributed to the discussion which Mrs Weiler's report here also prompts."
"We wish to try to make further progress during our presidency by looking in greater detail at two subjects in particular at the informal meeting of the Social Affairs Council in Rotterdam in March."
"Firstly, there are the employment policy indicators which should enable the Member States in future years - using the benchmarking method - to learn from the positive experiences of other Member States, and it is hoped that this will also act as a catalyst for policy coordination at European level."
"This should also make it possible to accelerate the convergence of labour market and employment policy, as a further important element of economic and monetary integration."
"The second subject we intend to discuss at the informal Council meeting will be the need felt by almost all the Member States to bring labour costs down and thereby make it easier to integrate job-seekers with low skill levels in particular."
"The Commission rightly points out in the report on the economic situation in the Union that the substitution of capital for labour and the low level of investment in the Union are the two main causes of the negative employment balance which has evolved in recent years and which urgently needs to be corrected."
"These are the two areas in which we hope to make a contribution, and I see this as a parallel exercise to the Weiler report's proposals for focusing attention in Union policy on the conditions for generating growth and employment."
"Speaking of the conditions for generating growth and employment and also social cohesion, I should also like to mention a few points which I feel should be given priority in further policy developments and in discussions with Parliament."
"First of all, there is the need for greater flexibility on the labour market."
"The fact is that rigid labour markets can stifle employment growth and need to be adapted."
"But it is also true that the adaptations cannot come from just one side: they need to involve both employers and workers."
"This is why we wish to look at the idea of flexibility and social security at the conference in Amsterdam."
"Flexibility from the workers, so that they can be genuinely available on the labour market in a way which will benefit economic growth, but also greater social security and pension security, so that the employers too help to create a motivation to work, which is also important for meeting the second condition I would like to mention: creating a higher level of work productivity."
"In future, productivity will increasingly depend on training, greater possibilities for time off for education and so on, and also greater involvement of workers through information and consultation on company policy."
"This is an area where we hope to make some progress during the presidency on the theme of 'Information and consultation of workers' , taking account of the report by the Committee on Social Affairs and also, shortly, of the results of the working party led by Mr Davignon, which the Commission and the Council asked to look into this issue."
"The third condition for growth and employment which I should like to mention is the establishment of greater social stability by various means, in particular the improvement and maintenance of stable industrial relations."
"Social dialogue with employers and workers is particularly important here, and I hope that the Social Affairs Council will make progress in modernizing social dialogue at Union level."
"We need to involve job-seekers much more if we are to utilize their talents and those of immigrant and especially female workers on the labour market."
"We need to do more to combat poverty in order to safeguard social involvement and social stability in society."
"These conditions must be created irrespective of the level of affluence in the Member States."
"All the Member States face the same agenda, and it is also important for the Union to act as a catalyst and coordinator, and to create an agenda for achieving work and income distribution that is not based solely on market conditions or dictated by them."
"In order to develop a medium-term strategy, as was also called for in the Delors White Paper, we in the Council will be discussing the issue again in Rotterdam, when we will also be looking at the role the Commission can play here. I see the Commission as a motor, examining the subject in greater detail and collating experiences from the Member States so that joint conclusions can be drawn, based in part, the presidency hopes, on a new section on employment in the Treaty which the Intergovernmental Conference is to discuss."
"This would provide a platform for coordination and, ultimately, a basis for complementarity which will be not just desirable but absolutely essential once the European Union achieves economic and monetary union. People will then understand that economic and monetary integration has to be linked to employment, and it will also become clear that we cannot have a strong, internationally competitive and stable single currency without genuine economic convergence and labour market convergence in the Member States."
"Mr President, first I should like to thank Mrs Weiler for her report and also Minister Melkert for his overview of the Dutch presidency's position on matters relating to this report."
"We all have a common point of departure in this debate and an understanding that social protection is the cornerstone of the European social model."
"That has been very clearly stated by Mrs Weiler."
"However, the challenge we are facing today is how to modernize Europe's social protection systems and how to adapt them to a new situation in a rapidly changing world without abandoning the core values of solidarity and cohesion."
"This is quite difficult and is going to be a complex task in which there is no overnight or miracle solution."
"Because of the complexity and uncertainty, I proposed at the end of 1995 the launching of a new initiative on social protection which I called the framework for a European debate on the future of social protection."
"The idea was that each Member State should find its own set of solutions to satisfy its own particular systems."
"At the same time the ability to learn from one another and to react quickly is a key factor for success."
"The European Union has a valuable role to play in acting as a catalyst in this process and in learning and in adapting, and I am grateful to the European Parliament for its contribution to this debate."
"I am pleased that you have reacted so positively."
"The discussion here today reminds us of two things: firstly, the future of social protection is a complex question; secondly, the debate is an essential one and one that cannot be ducked."
"In that framework for the European debate on the future of social protection, the communication from the Commission has analysed a lot of the common challenges that are facing us: how to make social protection more employment-friendly; how to improve the financing of the social protection systems and how to cope with the ageing of European societies, especially as far as old age pensions are concerned; and how to better manage health care systems."
"There is the other great challenge which has a clear European dimension too: how to accommodate the full implementation of the internal market with the diversity of all of the national systems; and how to better reconcile that diversity with both freedom of movement of people within the Union and the freedom to provide services."
"I regard a lively debate as being fruitful and I welcome such a debate, not least because I see the rich diversity of experience, culture and opinion that exists in the Union as one of the great strengths of the Union and it is reflected in this debate."
"This richness and diversity are the source ultimately not of the problems, but of the innovative solutions to the problems."
"So the question has to be asked - and Mrs Weiler makes this point too - where do we go from here?"
"Let us not forget that we have the clear backing of the Member States in this exercise."
"All of them agree that highly-developed social protection systems are important, worth keeping and worth building on."
"But they also recognize that preserving the systems means reforming them, not least because so much has changed since they were first put in place."
"In 1992 the Council outlined in a recommendation on social protection what it saw as the common objectives which would determine the reform of these national systems."
"The Weiler report states in Part V of its explanatory statement that today the aim must be to continue that debate, and I agree with that."
"But not just to continue."
"We have to take on board the need to move it up a gear, to move it up to the next step."
"That is why I am so pleased to see Mr Melkert here today giving us an overview as to how he sees this debate progressing during the Dutch presidency."
"He is quite right when he says that in Amsterdam just last month at the conference which was organized by Mr Melkert on behalf of the Dutch presidency on social policy and economic performance, I announced that the Commission would soon be presenting a communication on improving social protection systems in the Union."
"The communication will seek to map out the next stage in this process."
"This communication will have two purposes: to indicate the route along which that modernization can be pursued, and secondly to present some specific proposals for European-level support."
"In all of this we must get around to finding some practical and feasible solutions."
"In presenting the communication we will obviously seek to take careful account of Parliament's contribution to the debate so far, as set out in Mrs Weiler's report."
"Today's debate has shown that this is an issue of particular importance to all the institutions and in particular to Parliament."
"I should like to emphasize that I very much welcome the active interest which has been shown in this debate and I hope we can count on the full support of Parliament as we carry forward this process."
"I believe this is one of the great debates of our time."
"First of all, Mr President, I should like to welcome Mr Melkert to the House of which he himself almost became a Member some time ago, but the selection committee thought he was too young and needed more experience at national level, a recommendation which he has more than fulfilled."
"I thought one of the best things about the conference on social policy and economic performance was that for the first time in years, social policy came out of the shadows, and none of the speakers felt the need to defend themselves against right-wing criticism, but spoke confidently about how important social policy is in itself and for the economy."
"Many studies carried out for the committee clearly show that a fair system of social security and sound economic performance are not mutually exclusive but mutually supportive, and that good social protection is not just the icing on the cake, but one of the essential ingredients of the cake itself."
"There is also an implicit criticism here of the way in which the European Union has launched and conducted major projects up to now."
"Whether it be the internal market, EMU, the information society or enlargement, the social dimension has always been the poor relation."
"It is therefore not surprising that there should be serious discussion in the Member States, and finally also in the Netherlands, about whether it makes sense to go through with EMU."
"Now, I myself support EMU and the stability pact, but we must not forget that social progress and employment are the aims, and monetary policy is simply the means to achieve them."
"It is important for us to be having this debate today on the future of social protection in Europe, as discussed in Barbara Weiler's excellent report, but we must also realize that we have to start building this future now."
"This means reforming our social protection schemes, because otherwise they will not be affordable in future, and because at the moment they are not sufficiently employment-oriented, and so we need to try to find a balance between flexibility and security."
"But it should also mean developing a common economic policy which is not primarily designed to meet the EMU criteria, but should also aim to create jobs."
"We need social objectives and instruments at European level if we are to balance our one-sided monetary policy."
"This was one of the conclusions of the conference in Amsterdam, and it is one of the reasons why we need a chapter on employment in the Treaty and why the social protocol needs to be improved and to apply to all Member States."
"Many of the social protection reforms needed would have to remain a matter for the national and local authorities, but as Europe becomes more integrated and with the single market, the purely national interest is less prevalent."
"Social cohesion in other Member States is now in all our interests."
"One of the most controversial issues in the debate on this report in the Committee on Social Affairs was the question of convergence."
"There has been quite a commotion in the United Kingdom and elsewhere about whether even the very word convergence should be mentioned in the texts, and I find this very strange."
"Article 17 of the Treaty, which the United Kingdom also signed, makes it quite clear that the common market is to promote the harmonization of social systems and free trade, and is to combat unfair competition."
"This is also spelt out in a 1992 declaration which also calls for progressive convergence, for the same reasons."
"It is extremely ironic that this declaration was adopted under the UK presidency, and bears the signature of one of the most Eurosceptic Tories."
"I hope that this will encourage all UK Members in the vote tomorrow to stop complaining about such issues."
"I think this is really all that needs to be said."
"It is, I think, generally accepted that the various systems need to be reformed, and the main thing now is to decide how and to what extent we can win the support of the people of Europe for this."
"Mr President, there are currently several challenges facing our systems of social protection: a demographic challenge resulting from the ageing of the population, an economic challenge due to unemployment, and a social challenge, not least because in Europe we must preserve the concept of solidarity."
"Faced with these challenges, it is not enough for us in Europe merely to adjust the present system by introducing rules designed to remove obstacles to freedom of movement; the EU must also square up to its responsibilities."
"The issues concerning the future of social protection are fundamental ones; they are tangible ones too for our fellow citizens, who wish to see a Europe which is closer to them, and it is through the concept of social Europe that they will gain a better understanding of Europe's problems."
"It is now vital, therefore, to open up a debate at European level on the future of social protection, comparing our experiences and ensuring that a thought-provoking exchange of ideas will produce - if not immediately a convergence of views - then at least a coordination of provisions, whilst respecting national cultural differences."
"However, I believe that social security schemes should certainly not be reformed in a rigid way, but must be adapted to new conditions of employment, particularly with regard to flexibility and mobility, as a number of other Members have pointed out."
"I would also add that this notion of solidarity is compatible with greater personal involvement, with more individual responsibility on the part of our citizens."
"Furthermore, given the extent of sociological and economic change, greater protection should be afforded to the family."
"That is why I have my doubts about the rapporteur's proposal that, to take account of changed family structures, there should be independent schemes for men and women."
"I think that to individualize social security schemes in this way would in fact be detrimental to the cohesion and harmonious development of society."
"Mr President, I too should like to thank Mr Melkert for coming here today, and I should like to take the opportunity to raise an issue of considerable concern to me: the democratic deficit in social security and employment."
"The Minister said that he wants a dialogue with Parliament, on which I believe him to be sincere, and I think he has put forward some very good proposals on the convergence of the social labour market and employment policy, and on employment policy indicators."
"But what guarantee do we have that once the Dutch presidency is over, the whole thing will not go off the boil and Parliament will scarcely have a say in the matter?"
"In the meantime, life goes on and, in the follow-up to Essen, the first steps are about to be taken in the process of renewal and change on the labour market."
"I would point out to the House that if the Member States do not achieve convergence and, as Mr van Velzen has already said, they have to make great efforts to catch up on various issues like EMU and the stability pact, we could well find ourselves in a situation where industrial unrest makes our Europe look a great deal less solid than it does now."
"I would therefore urge the Minister to ensure that this dialogue between the Council and Parliament remains on track throughout the Dutch presidency."
"The question here is whether we wish to preserve or change. I think the Weiler report makes a number of good points, but I also think that we need above all to dare to make changes."
"My proposals both in committee and in the amendments before the House are not so much about whether we need to dismantle as whether we want to change."
"On the subject of pensions, I do not think we need to worry about having capital cover schemes instead of redistributive schemes, and I would urge Mrs Weiler seriously to reconsider our amendments so that our group too can vote for this report, which contains a number of good ideas."
"Mr President, when we speak of the future of social protection in Europe, we are at the same time speaking about the whole future of Europe."
"In my opinion, Barbara Weiler's report demonstrates very clearly how important it is for us to overhaul social protection systems in order to meet the requirements of a changing working environment and that we should also try to find new sources of funding for social security in order to maintain it at the same high level in the future."
"The Weiler report calls for the adoption of common EU minimum objectives for social protection."
"I entirely agree with this."
"However, the issue is not an easy one to us in the Nordic countries, for reasons to which Mr Hatzidakis, among others, has referred here."
"We are afraid that the minimum could easily turn into a maximum."
"It is therefore important to ensure that common minima can always be exceeded if a decision in favour of this is taken at national level."
"I also endorse the view expressed in the report that the EU's social policy requires a stronger legal basis."
"The Social Protocol should become part of the Treaty, and it should be possible to take decisions on its application by a qualified majority."
"On the subject of social security funding, I should like to stress that this is not just a question of an expenditure item, as is readily assumed."
"Spending on social protection pays for itself many times over."
"This applies both to society and to enterprises."
"Employees who feel socially secure are in a better position to place their creative abilities at the service of enterprises."
"It is not only more humane but also economically more efficient to support people when they have problems rather than allowing the problems to lead to exclusion or crime."
"Cuts in social protection necessitate many times greater expenditure on prisons and the maintenance of strong police forces."
"If we wish to guarantee the security of Europe's citizens, the answer lies rather in improving social security and social services than in stepping up policing."
"Mr President, the Commission's document, which formed the basis of Mrs Weiler's report from the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment on the future of social protection, was meant create a framework for debate and to establish a basis for joint discussions."
"I would like to congratulate Mrs Weiler because, in my opinion, she has put her message across very clearly prior to this discussion."
"My own interpretation is that, if a society is unable to share its resources to achieve social protection and social solidarity, but creates divisions and social exclusion instead, that society has failed."
"Civic solidarity is a fundamental requirement for a modern and democratic society; it is important that we remember this in our discussions."
"I also agree totally with the statement from the Economic Committee and the argument that there is reason to be deeply concerned over the future of social protection in Europe."
"A large proportion of the Union's activities actions are currently concentrated on promoting markets and competition."
"Large-scale reductions in public expenditure, convergence criteria for EMU, stability packages and high unemployment create social unrest and social exclusion."
"It is dangerous when economic growth and competition have to increase whatever the price, at the cost of social protection."
"This is why I consider our amendment proposal No.9 to be so important, where we point out that reductions made in unemployment and social benefits are aimed at lowering the general level of wages."
"Under no circumstances must this be allowed to fall below the current level of the minimum existence wage."
"This applies equally to social security benefits."
"I am also of the opinion that social protection should be covered primarily by collective social insurance, in other words, protection provided by the State and a system based on a collective agreement between employers and employees."
"Social protection systems in the EU are all structured very differently and pitched at differing levels."
"For this reason I consider that harmonisation is neither possible nor is it desirable."
"There is a description of harmonisation in the report which, according to Mrs Weiler, is a translation error."
"But, looking closer at point 19, I find that I cannot support this point because it means that explanation 23 is to be included in the Treaty and it refers to Article 117, which just happens to concern harmonisation of social systems."
"On the other hand, I do think that coordination is required and also a number of minimum levels of social protection agreed between Member States to avoid social dumping and to satisfy employees' rights and promote free movement of people."
"The requirement for the regulation of unsocial working hours is also an important point in the report as is our amendment proposal on financing social systems."
"We must look seriously at the idea of alternative forms of taxation, i.e. to move the burden of taxation from work to environmentally related taxes, such as the carbon dioxide tax."
"Mr President, the Weiler report is an extremely important one and has come at just the right moment, in my view."
"When we talk to people in the street, they often see a growing conflict between free trade and social responsibility."
"They say that the free single market is increasingly abandoning its fundamental social role, and they give a number of examples of this."
"The phenomenon of relocation is now on the increase throughout the European Union, technological production methods are given precedence over labour, and there is discrimination against frontier workers."
"Within the Member States themselves there are widening psychological gaps, such as between those in work and the unemployed, and between young people and pensioners."
"This is why we urgently need a new social model which re-establishes the link between social security and the real role of the economy."
"The rapporteur proposes a very useful model in which our most valuable achievements are regarded as the cornerstone of society."
"Of course, we need to recognize a number of facts that have affected most Member States in recent years."
"There have been, and still are, serious problems with financing, and most of our social protection schemes are still based on social orders which are now outdated."
"What I mean is that 40 or 50 years ago, it was quite reasonable for social security to be mainly financed by contributions from labour, since it was a period of high employment."
"Other sources of funding were simply unthinkable."
"But society has changed, and high unemployment, a falling birthrate and changes in family structures mean that there are fewer and fewer people to keep the system going, while on the other hand the need to fund the social security system from labour taxes has caused labour costs to rocket."
"In my country, for example, the difference between a worker's gross wage and what he actually receives is reaching surreal proportions."
"These are the sorts of conditions that kill jobs, and they are the start of a vicious circle which will ultimately undermine the very foundations of the social security systems."
"One of the central paragraphs in the Weiler report is paragraph 9 on alternative methods of financing, which I think presents a very useful and fair proposal."
"There is just one more point I should like to make about this whole situation."
"In all the discussions on European monetary union, there is far too much talk about taxation and far too little about social issues."
"It is high time that we adopted a much more practical approach, and the Weiler report sets us an excellent example."
"Mr President, when I read Barbara Weiler's report, I was reminded of a Danish song which goes something like this:"
"(The speaker sings) ' Tread carefully, young lady, because the stage is uneven' ."
"I have heeded this advice, because taking careful steps in the socio-political arena is something which for me, as a Dane, is a very important point to emphasize."
"As has already been mentioned, social policy is a very sensitive area in Scandinavian countries."
"I agree with Mr Hatzidakis that it is important for us to have a high level of social protection in Europe and in the European Union."
"But I do not at all agree that we should harmonize social legislative systems."
"What I mean is that it is important to be careful when recommending in the report that, amongst other things, there should be increasing co-ordination of social protection regulations."
"It is also my view that we should be careful about formulating minimum requirements, because my Finnish colleague is quite right in saying that there is good reason to fear that minimum requirements would become maximum requirements."
"This is what we have experienced in Denmark in the area of the working environment where the excellent Danish employment regulations we had earlier subsequently became very poor regulations, precisely because of considerations regarding competition."
"What I am saying is that there are possible grounds for fearing that coordination along the lines of competitiveness will adversely affect the social protection regulations."
"I also believe it to be an extremely bad idea to introduce social insurance regulations at a Community level based on a qualified majority."
"In general it is my view that one would be misusing employees' freedom of movement in order to attribute greater legislative powers to the European Union than it currently has."
"I think it too much to expect that citizens in the European Union will want to move from one Member State to another."
"From my past experience as a social worker I can say that it is very difficult for an individual - especially if one has a family - to pull up the tent pegs and move from one country to another where the culture may be very different."
"I would therefore ask that considerable thought be given to this, not least in the context of the conference of governments, and that we tread carefully."
"You have a fine voice, Mrs Jensen, but you caused a few problems for some of the interpreters who were unable to rise to your level."
"Mr President, I hope you will forgive me for taking the floor without being able to break into song like our colleague, but I do nevertheless have a few words to say."
"We can welcome the repeated statements from the Commission, and in the Weiler report, concerning the need to preserve a European model of social protection as a factor of social peace."
"It seems to me, however, that the Commission must be cautioned against any attempt to downgrade our social security schemes in the name of so-called European harmonization."
"Since each of our countries has its own social traditions and social history, it would be more advisable to retain and restore the most advanced national schemes, and to develop the others."
"It is in fact the responsibility of each state, nationally, to take clear steps to safeguard and further develop a system of social protection which guarantees everyone health insurance, unemployment benefit and a pension, but also a system that will promote and support the family."
"State policy and intervention in support of the family, primarily through parental pay, should be used to boost the birth-rate, if we are to prevent our redistributive pension schemes from collapsing under the weight of our ageing populations."
"In social terms, it is a matter of urgency and a vital necessity to introduce a broad-based family policy in the nations of Europe."
"I would add that any policy designed to unravel national social security schemes would expose our citizens to market forces or the inevitability of private insurance, both of which are completely antisocial options."
"Each national state should act as a guarantor and provider of social protection, and should reassert its social function."
"I would also say to our colleagues that if they wish to maintain effective models of social protection, Europe must turn its back on its ultra-liberal, free-trade, internationalist economic policy, the main effect of which is to produce unemployment in Europe."
"Opening our borders to international competition is totally irreconcilable with preserving our social security schemes, and the lack of social clauses within the WTO is criminal for our economies and social systems in Europe."
"Customs duties must be reintroduced immediately and allocated to family and social policies; a social VAT must be levied on imports so as to reduce the economic imbalances caused by differential social costs; and the terms of trade - of which we are victims rather than beneficiaries today - must be redefined. Otherwise, the good intentions and the fine social sentiments expressed here in the House today will be swept aside by the devastating effects of international economic competition."
"Mr President, in recent years the problems facing social protection systems have become dangerously acute."
"Policies designed to curb public spending, the widespread tendency for companies to relocate outside the European Union and the placing of capital in short-term unproductive investments and in speculative stock market activities have led to unprecedented levels of unemployment in the Union."
"Social exclusion and poverty are tending to encompass ever wider sectors of the populations. Those trends are likely to become more marked."
"We should be deeply concerned at the unfavourable evolution of social protection systems - not only on social grounds but also for economic reasons."
"Reducing the workforce to poverty and dissolving the social protection system cannot be a basis for any kind of growth."
"Mr President, we need to be worried and to take account of the risk that an untested switch in funding from work-related contributions to alternative tax solutions could lead to a total collapse of the social protection system, particularly in the atmosphere of budgetary pressure that is prevalent in all of the Member States because of EMU."
"I consider it vital that the Commission should carry out an urgent study of developments regarding the ratio of workers to pensioners which is evolving very unfavourably and with unforeseeable social consequences. In addition, a study must be made immediately of the trend in production and in employment and working hours in the coming years and of the implications for the social protection system."
"It is high time we recognized that truth, for the sake of the peoples of Europe."
"Mr President, the main contribution to society of the so-called 'conservative revolution' of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan was to attempt to dismantle the welfare state."
"Fortunately, they did not succeed; but I am not so naive as to think that the attempts to dismantle all aspects of state social protection now belong in the past."
"The one-track approach, which now seems to permeate and contaminate everything, insists on reducing reality to the market-place, deregulation and individualism, denying any role for the public sector, politics or the State in the structuring of society."
"The supporters of the new one-track approach have abandoned the most wanton elements of the past, but still maintain the urgent need to dismantle all aspects of the welfare state, on the pretext that it will not be viable in future."
"Clearly, they see themselves administering what today is managed by the public authorities."
"But why is it that individualism is viable and solidarity is not?"
"Why should a private pension fund be more viable than a state social security scheme?"
"Some years ago, when we in Spain were seeking to join the common project of European integration, we did so because Europe meant freedom, but also because it provided a reference point for a society which had adopted the principles of the welfare state: indeed, in difficult times, it was the European social model that provided the backbone for our society by institutionalizing the social rights of citizens."
"The fiscal crisis of the State must not lead to the dismantling or reduction of a system that has provided the backbone of our societies."
"It is better to think in terms of reforming, correcting and modernizing, with a view to giving rights to those who really need them."
"Opting to reform, correct and modernize is the best way to shield the State from its detractors."
"And the best way to avoid being conservative is to face reality boldly."
"The common Europe which we champion as social democrats is built on the defence of human rights, pluralist democracy and social protection."
"In the face of the challenges now before us, which are addressed by this excellent report - defending social protection, an issue closely linked to that of employment - we cannot act timidly or stay on the back foot."
"Achieving a high level of employment will strengthen the prospects for state social protection. Defending flexibility and security is a commitment, just as making progress towards social convergence - and making the same efforts to achieve it as we do to achieve economic convergence - is a commitment too."
"Hopefully this report - which, I repeat, is a good one - and this debate will serve the cause of progress and construction, and not that of destruction - although for that we have to continue to believe in politics, the public sector and the role of the State, to believe in ideas and values."
"Mr President, the subjects dealt with by the Weiler report are very complex ones, because changing demographic realities in the Union are characterized by a general increase in the average age, a fall in the birthrate and - we must not forget - an increase in the age at which young people enter employment."
"All this inevitably results in a state of crisis in the present social protection system, further heightened by the increased globalization of markets and the resulting need for greater competitiveness on the part of enterprises and of the entire European economic and production system."
"The logical result of this must be greater flexibility in the regulations governing employment, and certainly not a further increase in tax burdens."
"It is not the principle of solidarity that is at issue here - indeed, we would particularly stress the importance of family protection - but the current system of social protection is no longer able to continue as it is: it is too cumbersome and too inefficient."
"That is why we believe it is necessary to encourage people to arrange additional, supplementary private insurance, so that in the field of social protection, as elsewhere, public and private schemes compete against each other to increase the overall efficiency of the system, and so that new, atypical forms of employment can also be taken into consideration: the Council has blocked this issue for years, but we believe that concrete results must be achieved quickly."
"This report provides a solid basis for argument."
"However, because it fails to satisfy us on certain points that we regard as fundamental, we do not think we can approve it, although it does include some passages of high quality."
"Finally, I would like to emphasize one last point contained in Amendment No 29, where it is stated that it is necessary for multilateral agreements to include environmental and social clauses based on the model of an international labour organization."
"That is a point which we will support."
"Mr President, a secure social welfare system is an important part of a democracy but it is primarily the responsibility of Member States."
"The EU can assist through coordination and cooperation."
"Establishing minimum standards is one way of doing this but there is always the risk that minimum standards can become maximum levels."
"The principle task for the EU in this area is to coordinate activity and any decisions should, as I see it, be taken unanimously so as not to change for the worse those social security systems already in place in Member States, as there is a risk that this could happen."
"Today's society is at present demanding changes."
"The level of knowledge is constantly changing."
"We must establish systems and methods of ensuring that further education becomes a process for life and not, as it is today, something which takes place during the first 7-10 years."
"We must develop an active labour market policy which includes further education and training as a component of lifelong improvement."
"All forms of social dumping must be stopped."
"Mrs Weiler's report is very positive in many respects."
"New protection systems must be developed and we must prevent variation in levels of provision."
"There should be a guaranteed basic pension in all Member States, but it ought also to be possible to increase this through personal insurance."
"A very important proposal is the change in the method of financing the protection system through alternative forms of taxation, which reduce income tax and increase tax on the use of environmental resources and energy."
"Mr President, the Weiler report - and I must congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work - deserves our support and should be paid our full attention."
"But the fact is that people are so concerned with other things, with other areas which they see as national when in fact they are transnational, that very little attention is paid to the questions of social protection in Europe and its future, in what really should be the subject of a Europe-wide debate."
"The two Commission communications, the basis of this report, offer food for thought in this debate and the motion for a resolution which the European Parliament is due to transform into its resolution makes good use of them through the Weiler report."
"But no less important, quite the contrary, is the explanatory memorandum accompanying this proposal which contains material for considerable thought and debate."
"Any position based on Article 2 of the Treaty of Rome, which the Maastricht Treaty did not alter, defining the general objectives of the association of the Member States, and on Article 117, which Maastricht also did not change, or undermine, clearly imposing the principle of political orientation, almost appears strange since it is becoming increasingly necessary."
"The principle of social equalisation in progress represents or should represent the cornerstone and philosophical basis of the construction of a Europe forming a mosaic of different national situations and the product of cooperation and solidarity between and on behalf of its people."
"We must congratulate Barbara Weiler on emphasising this legal basis and, in particular, the progressive characteristic of a dynamic which seems perverted because all that is mentioned is technical and nominative harmonisations, and divergencies or negative convergences are confronted on the social plane."
"Obviously this debate cannot be exhausted in the discussion of a report nor should it be."
"But it is already positive that we can recall that these subjects are both vital and urgent."
"I only have time to make one particular remark, and I would like to draw attention to point 21 in the proposal as the subject for debate which has to remain open in terms of evolutions in employment, working time and free time."
"As the results of a point in the opinion issued by the Committee on Economic Questions, by Mr Theonas, I should like to say that we really must begin to look upon the social aspect as the very kernel of all discussions as well as the organisation of men and women's free time, articulating working time and leisure time, and we should not refer to 'unemployed' time because there can be and has to be, also, living time."
"Mr President, what distinguishes Europe from the United States, Japan and many other countries today is a social model which is unparalleled anywhere in the world."
"What in fact is the advantage of the unemployment rate in the USA being only 6 %, if almost 40 million Americans are without any kind of social cover?"
"Let us never forget that the European social model has been shaped by history, by suffering and by the campaigns which were waged - as soon as the industrial revolution began in the late eighteenth century - in mines, in workshops and wherever men, women and children were being exploited."
"Let us never forget the often unequal battle fought by the trade unions."
"And now we often hear it said, in various quarters, that this system is old-fashioned, out of date and too expensive."
"That is outrageous!"
"Some even go so far as to hope that it will collapse."
"Let us not use the building of Europe and social harmonization as an excuse to call for the dismantling of our achievements, in other words to look for a 'social lowest common denominator' ."
"It is undoubtedly too soon to move towards complete harmonization in the fields of social protection, pensions, family policy and health."
"But it is certainly not too soon to coordinate all our efforts, and to bring about truly progressive and genuine reforms."
"A social code of conduct is desirable as of now."
"We do have one, but it is not being respected."
"The British Government rejects both the social charter and the Maastricht social protocol, and Mr Major has taken it upon himself to undermine various directives, despite the reprimands of the Court of Justice in Luxembourg."
"What is the point of the Fifteen building a house together, if one of the architects rejects the plan for the foundations?"
"I fervently hope that political change will take place very soon in the United Kingdom, so as to clarify matters in a country where casualization is spreading, and where the unemployment figures have deliberately been underestimated - by the admission of none other than the Employment Minister."
"Have lies become the doctrine of the British Government?"
"I see three major challenges in terms of modernizing and harmonizing our social security schemes."
"The first, and by no means the least important, is unemployment: 20 million people are unemployed and 50 million marginalized!"
"Our social expenditure is set to spiral."
"We need to attack this evil at its root, by devising a fully-fledged European policy to relaunch and boost the economy in order to create jobs."
"The same applies to pension schemes: we are blandly told that there will not be enough young people to fund pensions by 2005; pension funds and other financial mechanisms are therefore being set up, but without any thought being given to a European family policy that would break away from the individualism which is pervading society."
"The second challenge is the single currency."
"Once our countries use the euro, in other words when they all have the same exchange rates and interest rates, they will be left with only two weapons for attracting investment: one fiscal and the other social."
"In both cases, unless we are careful, we shall see a lowering of standards."
"The third challenge is the funding of our social security schemes, which are too heavily based on income from employment."
"I believe that the burden must be shared, and that a system of funding through capital taxation must be introduced."
"Mr President, will it be possible in the future to maintain the diversity which exists among the social systems of the different European countries?"
"The Commission's report on social protection in 1995 does not give a clear answer to this question."
"Everyone will no doubt agree that discussion should be encouraged and experiences exchanged at European level, which could lead of its own accord to some degree of alignment of national laws."
"But that is not exactly the question asked by the Commission."
"It is in fact asking, in a roundabout way, whether a supposedly integrated economy should be matched in the near future by an integrated system of social security."
"It would seem more logical to us for diversity to be maintained, so that each country keeps the right to govern itself in accordance with the real needs of its citizens."
"However, this diversity will of course have to be accompanied by a regular exchange of ideas and experience at European level, and must also preserve freedom of movement for workers through mechanisms for the transfer of acquired social rights from one country to another."
"The Commission does not seem entirely satisfied by this type of answer, however, since it is raising other arguments."
"Firstly, its document states that transnational companies, which are becoming more and more numerous, will experience increasing difficulty in setting wages in different countries and in moving employees from one country to another."
"This argument seems to us to reflect a vision of Europe which we cannot share."
"It is not convincing, and must not lead to the systematic subordination of national freedom of management."
"Secondly, the Commission expresses concern about the distortions in competition which could be caused by diversity in social security systems, since companies in countries where social protection is generous might be put at a disadvantage."
"This is a valid question, but we are surprised that the Commission is raising it with regard to Europe, but does not raise it more often where it is a hundred times more glaring: with regard to international trade relations."
"That is where the Commission could operate most usefully."
"Mr President, Commissioner Flynn, Mr President-in-Office, the invitation to the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs to approve a motion for a resolution on the two documents transmitted by the Commission - the communication on the future of social protection and the report on the state of social protection in Europe - confronted the rapporteur, Barbara Weiler, whom I congratulate on her efforts, with the task of clarifying the term 'social protection' , which is not to be understood simply as social security, in the sense of collectively arranged insurance, but also as including social protection provided by the government and schemes resulting from collective insurance arrangements as well as private ones."
"There are two ideas that interest me."
"First, it is necessary to clarify the role of the European Union in the field of social protection, which must be more active and provide for schemes organized in consultation with the Member States, and support the gradual convergence of social protection systems in those States, developing a set of joint minimum criteria and preventing competition from causing a steady erosion of social protection."
"Secondly, and I find it difficult to go into more detail here in the two minutes available to me, some agreement will have to be reached both with the Commission and with the rapporteur on the fact that the social protection schemes will have to be adapted to the changing needs of the labour market."
"It is worth recalling the tendency to reduce contributions payable by employers and employees, especially those on lower incomes and, consequently, lower wages."
"The buttressing of the pension system by means of supplementary insurance is to be encouraged and diversified, with a view to achieving a further reduction in the number of victims of social exclusion and guaranteeing an appropriate living standard for all our citizens, who, whatever happens, must be able to feel protected and able to look to the future with confidence."
"The national parliaments must give more debating time to social security, bearing in mind the need to encourage and sustain a high level of employment."
"Where there is unemployment, clearly, there can be no social security."
"Nearly 20 million unemployed people in Europe can tell us about that."
"Mr President, I was particularly pleased to hear Mr Melkert say that he feels it is extremely important for Parliament too to discuss social protection, because I have to say that I find it astonishing how some Members seem to be allergic to any mention of Community action in this field."
"I think Wim van Velzen hit the nail on the head when he mentioned the 1992 recommendations, when it was apparently still possible to talk about convergence and financing at European level."
"Now the word convergence has practically become taboo, whereas joint action at European level is actually quite possible, while still respecting the historical differences between the various social security schemes."
"There are a few points I should like to make in the three minutes available to me."
"There is growing consensus that we need to bring down labour costs, particularly at the bottom end of the labour market among the lower-skilled jobs."
"All well and good."
"However, there is much less consensus at European level about how the refinancing of the schemes is to be organized."
"People are even talking about quite the opposite: ' slimming down' the schemes, selective benefits and the privatization of certain risks."
"To those who support this kind of modernization, I would say this: a very interesting study has been published in Belgium, commissioned by the OECD, on the links between poverty, the labour market and social security."
"I should like to quote two of the findings of this report."
"First, there is a particularly strong link between the level of social security spending and poverty."
"In other words, proper social security costs money."
"Selectivity has very clear limits."
"Secondly, there is a direct link between the level of unemployment and the level of poverty, and between low benefits, low wages and poverty."
"This does not mean that we should not be getting people back to work, on the contrary, I am all in favour of 'activating' benefits, but it does mean that we should now consign the American model to the dustbin once and for all."
"I would call for a European convergence strategy which takes full account of subsidiarity and involves at least the following: firstly, urgent measures to refinance social security."
"I would urge the Dutch presidency to force a breakthrough in this extremely important area - there are already proposals on the table."
"Secondly, Europe needs to tackle the issue of social rights, and the right to a minimum wage is just one part of this."
"People who have less than 50 % of the average income of their fellow citizens are poor, and it is therefore clear where the lower limit should lie, in our view."
"Thirdly, the Union spends on average 28 % of its gross domestic product on social protection, but this figure conceals some major discrepancies."
"We should start to think about developing a European 'social spiral' , on which Member States are positioned according to the percentage of their wealth which they have to spend on social protection."
"I hope that this debate on the Commission communication will finally lead to effective European action in this field."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the communication from the Commission on the future of social protection and its report on social protection in Europe 1995 form the basis for Mrs Weiler's resolution."
"Social harmony is, in my opinion, a valuable asset."
"That is something that South Korea has had to learn by bitter experience in recent weeks."
"Therefore, it should not lightly be put at risk."
"The fact is that we must overcome the difficulties which have emerged in Europe's various social systems as a result of rising unemployment and the growing proportion of elderly people in the population."
"It is important to discuss these issues at European level."
"However, discussion is not enough."
"Action is needed, and reforms are inevitable."
"But they should not be viewed simply in terms of reducing or axing parts of the social security net."
"Efforts to improve employment opportunities in the EU, particularly for women, have not been very successful so far, to put it mildly."
"Under Article 117 of the Treaty, progress should be made towards harmonizing living standards and working conditions as we move forward."
"Unfortunately, we have not yet made a great deal of headway."
"There are many problems to be resolved. Some of them arise from the multiplicity of systems and the question of freedom of movement."
"Earlier today, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten delivered a report on this aspect."
"Unfortunately, the Council representative was not present."
"Perhaps, Minister, it is not too late for you to express a view on that report."
"We would be very interested in what you have to say."
"Turning now to the reduction of non-wage labour costs: non-insurance benefits are a burden on labour-intensive small and medium-sized companies and, of course, on employee contributions."
"This is an area where action must be taken."
"Yes, working hours should be made more flexible, but not merely in order to suit employers, without regard for the needs of families and workers."
"Greater flexibility should only be introduced where it takes account of the interests of both sides."
"I believe that active social partnership can solve many problems."
"But they will not be solved if employers concern themselves only with shareholder value and fail to see further than their profits."
"Nor will they be solved if trade unions are concerned only for those in work, without giving any thought to the unemployed."
"The future of social protection is a matter of great importance for the European Union."
"It is time for the social protocol to be included in the Treaty."
"Coordinating social protection systems at European level will not be easy."
"I am talking about coordination: harmonization is something that will take much longer, because these systems have developed over more than a century."
"The situation is further complicated by the impact of globalization."
"In the future, appropriate clauses must be included in trade agreements to ban social dumping in the form of child labour or forced labour; these practices simply cannot be accepted as the norm."
"The WTO agreement in Singapore was a small step in the right direction, but unfortunately only a small one."
"The rapporteur has done an enormous amount of work."
"How the Group of the European People's Party decides to vote on the report will depend on whether certain amendments are adopted."
"Unfortunately, if compromise on these points proves impossible, we shall be obliged to reject the report, and I would regret that very much."
"Mr President, the rather woolly wording of this resolution and in particular the Commission documents on which it is based actually masks a barely concealed desire to Europeanize the entire social security sector, which was, incidentally, exactly what the former Commission President Jacques Delors wanted."
"As a Fleming, I can say as a matter of principle, and I speak with some knowledge, that this would be a very bad idea."
"In my own country, the question of splitting up the social security system is currently very high on the political agenda."
"What this means in practical terms is that both nations, Flemings and Walloons, are better off running their own social security schemes than leaving it to the federal government."
"So what experience has taught us in my country is that Flemings and Walloons have different ideas of what social security should involve, different priorities and very different mentalities when it comes to using and funding the scheme."
"Now, if we are already facing fairly dramatic problems within the common Belgian social security scheme, where there are only two nations with fairly similar levels of prosperity involved, think of the exponential increase that is likely if social security is organized on a European scale."
"In short, a genuinely social system of social security would be best organized by the individual Member States and nations in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, and this is not being selfish and by no means excludes other forms of solidarity between nations."
"I also have to say that the various social security schemes in Europe have managed to achieve genuine and extensive harmonization over the last few decades without interference from European bureaucracy, and we are not in a mess, despite what some people seem to think."
"Finally, it must be said that the economic strait-jacket that Maastricht is tightening around us is threatening to lead to social disintegration in many countries, and this too is a lesson that we really have to take on board today."
"Mr President, I would like to start by thanking Mrs Weiler for an excellent report."
"Our great challenge is to combine growth and employment while still maintaining, or preferably improving, existing social protection systems."
"The question is sometimes asked, is there really a European social model?"
"We have, in fact, three or four different social models in Europe."
"It is true that there are differences, based on historical traditions but there are also similarities, considerable similarities."
"Above all, every social security system is based on solidarity, solidarity with those who are sick, with those affected by unemployment or industrial injury and also solidarity with the elderly and with families."
"In addition there are a number of problems or challenges for the future, and it is this which makes the discussion so interesting."
"The greatest challenge is of course unemployment which affects the cost of the system and its income."
"I think that we should create a social system which aims to prevent social dumping, and which facilitates as much mobility as possible."
"I do not share the view expressed by many here during the debate that we should avoid minimum standards."
"I think that a strategy of introducing minimum standards and the opportunity to achieve a better social standard is a truly excellent strategy for the social sector."
"I also think it is important that the decisions for this sector are adopted by a qualified majority."
"History has shown the necessity of this; we have one country which is continuously obstructing and preventing social development in the other countries."
"The second challenge is that of demographic development."
"This can be viewed as a problem or as an opportunity."
"We will have a greater proportion of elderly people in Europe but this will also introduce an opportunity to create jobs."
"This point is also connected with the third challenge, that is the entry of women into the workplace; the opportunity for men and women to be able to combine work with children which also involves the development of care for the elderly and for children."
"A previous speaker said that Weiler's report favours the harmonisation of finance."
"This is not the case."
"On the other hand, Mrs Weiler does indicate a number of possibilities for finance."
"I have already mentioned the most important which is that we must reduce unemployment to reduce costs and increase employment to bring in a higher income to be able to finance the system."
"But there is also a question of shorter working hours and changes in tax which I strongly support."
"Many say EMU is a barrier to this work."
"I do not think so."
"Naturally, I do not fully support the economic policy, I think that there are too many cutbacks and not enough growth promoting measures."
"But from a long term point of view a balanced budget is good for the social system as well."
"Finally, Mr President: this is an important debate."
"I do not want to see a social system with basic protection or standard security but a system which contains both of these and a system which as far as possible is financed through solidarity in order to minimise the need to look to the private sector for solutions."
"Mr President, I believe that the high level of participation in this debate bears witness to its timeliness and importance."
"It is rare that so many Members speak on an issue of concern to us: in this case the future of European social welfare systems, which have many points in common - as previous speakers have pointed out - in the sense that all the Member States have some kind of state and collective provision for social protection and income support for those citizens who need it most."
"We believe that social protection in Europe is under threat: because there is a trend towards privatizing certain aspects of these social welfare systems; because there is growing unemployment and job insecurity, and a rapid increase in the number of single-parent families in which the head of the household is a woman; and because of the drive for competitiveness, the relocation of firms and the continuous movement of capital for speculative rather than productive purposes."
"That is the harsh reality, therefore; and it is a harsh reality which the European Union has to face."
"We therefore share the concern expressed by the rapporteur and draftsman at the fact that economic and market considerations are being put before social considerations."
"We believe that this situation must be reversed, and that social cohesion has to be our prime concern."
"So we believe that there is a need for active policies on employment - a high level of employment is essential for us to meet the social security bill; for a guaranteed minimum income for those persons that require it; for the role of the State in social security provision to be maintained; for the creation of a European observatory to determine whether poverty and social exclusion are increasing or declining; and for the Member States to cooperate amongst themselves and with the non-governmental organizations working in this field."
"Mr President, the two communications from the Commission and Mrs Weiler's report prompt me to offer my thoughts on two fundamental facts which I believe must be central to our deliberations."
"The first is demographic change, partly the result of social achievements and their success; the second is the changes in the structure and forms of employment, partly as a result of the application of the IT revolution to manufacturing and the processes of globalization."
"It is from these two basic facts, I believe, that the crisis in the welfare state has arisen, bringing with it the need for us to intervene across the board in this area."
"The crisis in the welfare state is not just a crisis of public funding - rather, I believe, the key lies in the other aspect of the welfare state, which was the high level of employment."
"Unemployment, therefore, has been the main reason for the crisis."
"Development, of course, is one answer but it is not the only answer: it is necessary but it is not enough, precisely because in the present circumstances it does not automatically guarantee a return to fuller employment."
"This, then, is an area in which government must intervene, both nationally and at European level."
"The first task we face, as I see it, is to tackle these new problems realistically and not to be afraid of our own ideas."
"I am thinking about the caution which I have noted in this House, and in the European Union, regarding such matters as reduced working hours and policies on working time. Yet these could be a valuable way of transforming restrictions and rigidity into greater freedom and greater opportunities for personal choice."
"We need, then, to add new words to our vocabulary, words that could be conjugated so as to make them serve the needs of a plan for positive social change: as I said previously, reduced working hours, time policy, flexibility."
"It is important to realize that flexibility is not painless or free of charge and that public funding -properly and scrupulously audited and designed to encourage productive retraining of human resources - will continue to be essential."
"So, while our points of reference will continue to be social justice, equality and democracy, we need to redefine welfare to make it easier for men and women to move from one profession to another, from one job to another, from one place to another, from one age to another."
"And this is where Europe comes in, with a part to play which does not usurp the functions of the Member States but is nevertheless fundamental."
"Well, then, I believe that the notion that budgetary discipline and monetary stability are sufficient to survive in the world of economics is a senseless one."
"The single currency and the Stability Pact, in the form of straitjackets and without a similar pact for development, will not motivate Europe; without a pact for development and without a social Europe, Europe cannot stand on its feet."
"So among those matters that call for greater commitment I would mention, specifically, rethinking the concept of Europe to strengthen - and certainly renew - its social model, its elements of social cohesion, protection and development of individuals and of human resources, which will be able to set their mark on a new, positive European identity."
"Mr President, it seems to be becoming politically fashionable now to say that we cannot afford to maintain the European model of social protection."
"Barbara Weiler says quite clearly and, in my opinion, quite correctly, that we cannot afford not to maintain that system and that we should not even want to."
"It would be morally wrong to remove or reduce the support that we offer to people when, for whatever reason, they are in need, be it as a result of age, disability, health or unemployment."
"The only way that we can act efficiently, effectively and humanely is to provide that support from the public purse and through public institutions."
"Hiving it off to the private sector will be less effective in terms of meeting people's needs and also inefficient in purely financial terms - it is more costly."
"Apart from being morally wrong to abandon the social protection model that we have in Europe, it would be a huge mistake in practical terms."
"Social solidarity is not just about altruism: it is about ensuring that our society can function properly and move forward progressively."
"As the rapporteur says: ' social protection systems help to establish social consensus which is an important precondition for sustainable economic development' ."
"I strongly endorse the call in the Weiler report for the European Union not just to debate this issue but to act to ensure that Member States respect the commitment to a high level of social protection, and to assist in the convergence of social protection systems to prevent harmful competition in the single market from eroding social protection systems."
"We should look at making our systems more employment-friendly and seek to eliminate barriers to moving from benefits to work."
"The most important point in the Weiler report - and this focuses on the real problem, the real reason why our social security bills are so high - is that we are faced with such a high proportion of unemployed men and women, so the real challenge to all of us here in the European Union is to create a Europe of full employment."
"The rapporteur clearly knows this and knows that you do not punish the victims of society's failures just because benefit bills are going up; you tackle the real problem, which is to get people back to work."
"Mr President, I should like to say at the outset that I fully endorse the excellent report by my colleague Barbara Weiler, and the Commission's report."
"I shall be voting in favour of both."
"Since my time is short, I shall confine myself to just one very specific point of detail, but one which I believe is of the utmost importance."
"Paragraph 11 of Mrs Weiler's report states that: ' the European Parliament warns against privatization of social risks, particularly in the field of health care' ."
"I would draw your attention, Commissioner, to the fact that our social protection as a whole will be at great risk unless we guard against a trend, in a growing number of countries, towards a reduction in health cover, on the pretext of making savings, improving management or giving beneficiaries more responsibility - all of which are valid arguments - and towards a transfer of risk from compulsory schemes to top-up schemes."
"On this basis, topup schemes may gain more and more ground, to the extent that, as is the case in certain fields - eye care and dentistry - and in some countries, they will become a condition for primary care, since the residual burden can be so substantial."
"Indeed, unlike compulsory schemes, voluntary top-up schemes are not subject to any rules; it is the law of the market-place, of business geared to profit, which is applied to them."
"The danger is that welfare institutions based on solidarity, inclusion and mutual benefit will lose out to commercial firms attracted only by a growing market, whose approach would be risk selection, exclusion and individualization."
"You will remember, Commissioner, the unfortunate experience of the Blue Cross foundations in the United States, which were so full of life 50 years ago, but which are now dead and buried."
"There we have the key to what has become of the American health care system."
"I urge you as of now, Commissioner - and I have appealed to the authorities responsible for social affairs in the Commission to follow this approach - to subject the entire health insurance sector to rules which ensure solidarity, inclusion and non-selection of risk, and to make it impossible for providers to profit from illness."
"Conflict between insured persons and shareholders must be avoided."
"Health, a sector that concerns us all, cannot be regarded as a profitable market-place."
"That applies equally to top-up schemes."
"I would urge the Commission to take up this matter, and to generate a debate on compulsory and supplementary health schemes as they affect the population as a whole."
"Mr President, I have listened to the debate with great interest, and I think it has shown that there is now greater support for more detailed discussions on the whole issue of social protection in the Member States and coordination at European level."
"I have just one brief comment to make on what Members had to say."
"It strikes me that in this discussion on support for social protection, it has been suggested that there are conflicts of interest where none should really exist."
"It is an accepted fact, I would point out to Mr van Velzen, that it is in everyone's interests to achieve a higher level of social cohesion, but this need not be incompatible with the existence - both now and in the future - of a wide variety of schemes."
"It is not scheme diversity but a communality of purpose that should guide our policy-making over the next few years."
"The suggested opposition between economic independence and support for the special situations of families need not exist if men and women have greater freedom of choice both on the labour market and in bearing responsibility for the family; any suggestion of a conflict of interests here will simply lead to unnecessary polarization."
"Thirdly, the suggested opposition between individual and mutual social security and pension schemes also does not necessarily exist."
"It is true, as Mr Rocard pointed out, that where there is no statutory obligation to provide cover, the advent of individual insurers on the social security and pensions market could bring risks that ultimately undermine the very foundations of social security."
"But combinations of public and private schemes are possible and are being tested in the Member States, including in my own country."
"It is worth developing these possibilities further, provided that a number of statutory conditions are applied."
"I would warn against attempts to contrast what people refer to as atypical forms of work and the usual forms such as full-time work, in terms of the basis for the functioning of the labour market."
"Is it not the case that even the expression 'atypical forms of work' is increasingly at odds with what is actually becoming the norm on the labour market, and will have to become the norm if work is to be divided more fairly between men and women?"
"Today's atypical forms of work may become tomorrow's typical forms."
"This is something else for the Commission to consider when it looks further at this whole issue."
"In conclusion, on the subject of a European social model, I would point out that we are not yet in a position to define the broad outlines of this, but we know we must work on it if we are to be able to establish, in five or ten years' time, a system which is truly balanced: balanced between the rights and obligations of employers and workers, between flexibility and security, with institutionalized confidence in and between the social partners that will symbolize a European system which the Member States will also use as a basis for the inevitable process of convergence between employment and labour market policy."
"Mrs Weiler's report has been a most important contribution to this whole discussion, and it is also extremely important - if I may make so bold - that the House should approve it tomorrow, since it is vital to bridge these alleged conflicts of interest with sound arguments, and to send a political signal to both the Council and the Commission."
"It will also be doing justice to the visionary work of Jacques Delors in his White Paper a few years ago, which showed us exactly how greater cohesion and reliance on partnership should form the basis for the Europe of tomorrow."
"Thank you very much."
"I must inform you that for technical reasons it was not possible to translate, print and distribute all of the amendments to this report in all languages."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Price indication"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-0015/97) on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the common position of the Council (C4-0530/96-95/0148(COD)) with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on consumer protection in the indication of the prices of products offered to consumers (rapporteur: Mrs Oomen-Ruijten)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a directive on the indication of the prices of products offered to consumers has a very lengthy history."
"For years now, since as early as 1979, attempts have been made in various directives to introduce rules for indicating the prices of products, but the rules were complicated and did not seem to work."
"The system included compulsory and voluntary pricing at European and national levels from which exemptions could also be granted, again at European and national levels."
"The result was a jumble of different indications, and consumers were still not able to compare prices with one another, which was actually the aim of the whole exercise."
"When in December 1994, barely six months before the transitional period expired, the Commission asked for the system to be extended, Parliament could not agree, and we asked the Commission to come up with an entirely new proposal for a simple, clear system that would apply in principle to all products, a system that would make it easier for consumers to compare prices when choosing which product to buy."
"The new proposal which the Commission put forward in April 1995 followed Parliament's recommendations, which we were pleased to see."
"It makes it compulsory to indicate the purchase price and, where relevant, the price per unit quantity."
"I say where relevant, because exceptions are made to this requirement where the nature or purpose of the product makes the unit price meaningless, or where indicating it does not provide any clear information for the consumer."
"Another point which I would like to clarify is the issue of wine, whisky and so on. The report includes a very clear amendment in the definitions which states that with units of measurement customarily used in the Member States for certain products, such as wine in 0.75 litre bottles, the price per litre need not also be indicated."
"This has meant deleting some provisions from the Council text because they were superfluous or likely to be confusing."
"There are also a number of sectors which are entirely exempt from the requirement to indicate unit prices, and here I would prefer to go further than the Council and exclude from the directive goods sold in hotel and catering establishments, in hospitals, by itinerant traders, in vending machines, recreational establishments, canteens and so on."
"A great deal of nonsense has been talked about price indication."
"People have said that the report does not take account of small retailers, a claim which I absolutely reject."
"We do take account of the corner shops of this world, which - I would point out to my British colleagues in particular - are to be given a six-year conversion period."
"And unless they already do so, they do not have to indicate prices on the shelves as is customary in large retailers, they simply have to obtain a list from their suppliers to be displayed somewhere in the shop, so that customers can see what the prices are."
"So I am not discriminating against small retailers by any means."
"The next problem, particularly for the UK, is what constitutes a small retailer?"
"We have tabled an amendment here giving the Member States the chance to determine who is 'small' and who is 'large' , and what exceptions need to be made."
"I would urge Members to look very closely at Amendments Nos 23 and 24 which, far from making life more difficult for small retailers, actually make it easier for them."
"There was also some concern about the euro."
"A number of colleagues have said that introducing compulsory price indication will immediately mean having to show the unit price, the selling price, plus two extra prices during the transitional period."
"And, if there is a special offer, another two prices again."
"I have taken up a proposal from the Economic and Social Committee here by saying that there should be a maximum of three prices, including for large retailers."
"I would also ask Members to read the report again, and you will see that the euro will be in circulation long before the completion of this transitional period."
"The transitional period will last for six years, plus another two years for the directive to be transposed into national law, which makes eight altogether and brings us to the year 2005, by which time the euro will, I hope, have long been in circulation."
"Whatever problems there may be, there are answers to all of them, as people will see for themselves if they only read the directive."
"In our report, I and the other members of the committee followed the lead given by the Economic and Social Committee, which delivered a unanimous recommendation. Parliament has taken this as the basis for the position it has adopted in its amendments, and I have added flexibility where necessary and where possible."
"I hope that you will support these amendments."
"Mr President, once again it is my pleasure to compliment Mrs Oomen-Ruijten on her emphatic pursuit of these consumer interests and the care she has taken over the amendments which we are presenting here at second reading."
"I want to say at the outset, on behalf of my group, that we are supporting all the amendments that were tabled in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection."
"We will also support, on reflection, Amendment No 24 in the name of Mrs Oomen-Ruijten and her group."
"I want to say why we feel this confidence at this stage."
"It is not because we have no misgiving about this proposed legislation, or indeed about the burden that it may in time place upon people, some of whom will be vulnerable."
"Mrs Oomen-Ruijten has referred already to the position of small shopkeepers in the United Kingdom and I shall come back to that."
"But the bedrock principle of this proposal as amended, which I hope it will be by Parliament, will be to give consumers the power to compare prices quickly and easily, not to be misled by packaging and to assess the kind of value for money that they are receiving."
"It is absolutely imperative that they get that."
"The directive can deliver it and I hope will do so."
"But it has to be able to deliver mindful of the concerns and worries that have been expressed, not just in my country, but in other Member States as well."
"One of these concerns has been the definition of what a unit price is and how it can indicate not merely the kilogramme, the litre, the metre or whatever, but also that unit of quantity which is widely used in the Member States concerned."
"I am glad to say that I believe that the British loaf, and other items cherished in my country, can be appropriately indicated in terms of price notification."
"Parliament has also said that certain products should be excluded where it would be nonsense insisting on unit pricing, such as furniture and so on. We have an amendment here which also protects, I am very glad to say, those who are selling products where the total price is not the unit price."
"This is what the consumer needs to know, particularly for home sellers and those who are going door-to-door with products, e.g. cosmetics salespeople and so on."
"My last point is about the position of small shops with regard to implementation."
"It is right that we provide here for a six-year delay in implementation, that we have a thorough review before that deadline approaches and that all the Member States enlist the relevant professional organizations to ensure that small retailers are adequately informed in due time of what the provisions must be, particularly in relation to the marking on the shelf of the products concerned."
"There is a potential for trouble here but there also is a potential for much good for the consumer."
"Mr President, I was very interested to hear what Mr Whitehead said about supporting the amendments from the rapporteur, and we shall certainly not let him forget that."
"This is a very difficult directive for the European Parliament to consider."
"It certainly looks as though it is a good thing."
"Ostensibly the idea of giving consumers more information ought to be a good idea, but I contend that this has been ill thought out by the European Commission and is in fact likely, as Mr Whitehead said when he raised these misgivings, to mean that consumers have, in the end, possibly fewer outlets from which to purchase goods, as small shops may close down as a result of this very directive being put into operation."
"I would like to draw attention to some of the amendments which I have difficulties with. My difficulties are shared by the other British Members."
"Amendment No 5 is a very curious amendment indeed."
"The amendment means that the Member States will be unable to exempt sales of works of art and antiques from the unit pricing obligation."
"I cannot see how you would apply unit pricing to antiques."
"With the best will in the world, what does this mean?"
"Does it mean that if you are selling Chippendale chairs they are quoted as price per leg, for example?"
"Amendment No 7 is a crucial one where the report seeks to delete the exemption for small firms."
"I have noted what the rapporteur has said on this about the transitional period of six years, but I think that would simply be a period of six years when some small shopkeepers would decide simply to throw in the towel and go and work for Honda - in my constituency - because it would not be worthwhile continuing to try to struggle with the extra weight of regulation which this directive means."
"I note what the rapporteur says about Amendments Nos 23 and 24 regarding the possibility of putting up a list of products and unit prices."
"I do not think that would work, given that some even quite small shops sell a very large number of things."
"Amendment No 10 deals with the question of the one-year period by which time the Commission shall review the directive."
"It seems to be quite extraordinary to say that the Commission shall review this directive one year before it comes into operation."
"What happens if the Commission then finds that there is indeed a burden of cost on small shops?"
"It has commissioned a survey on this already."
"What happens then?"
"It seems to me that the Commission's text is far better than the one being proposed in the report."
"I agree that Amendment No 13 contains good and sensible exemptions, but Amendment No 18 is also useful in the sense that it draws attention to my problem with the Chippendale chairs."
"If it is useless and indeed meaningless to apply unit pricing to certain areas of goods, then why not allow the Commission the original text covered by Recital 7?"
"To sum up, I am afraid that this directive is not one with which I have sympathy."
"I am always in favour of giving consumers more information, but I am afraid, as I say, that the likelihood is that the extra burden of regulation which it will entail will simply mean that small shops close down and consumers' interests are hurt."
"Mr President, this directive - and the rapporteur, whom I thank for all the work she has done - have set themselves two ambitious objectives."
"The first is to protect the consumer, and the second is to simplify the administration of the regulations."
"Protection of the consumer does not at present include the provision of clear price information, especially regarding any indication of the sale price per unit of quantity for products marketed in pre-packaged form, whose prices the consumer is unable to compare with the prices of similar products."
"The second major objective, on which I would like to dwell for a moment, is the simplification of the existing regulations."
"As far as simplification is concerned, this falls within the scope of the principle of subsidiarity, for which reason it will be a matter for the individual States to say what they understand by a 'small shopkeeper' ."
"We can imagine two possible systems: one based on the type of service, in other words self-service or traditional, and one based on floor area."
"Obviously, however, a store with 100 square metres of floor space is not the same thing in Greece as it is in Germany, and so it is right that it should be up to the individual Member States to determine what they will understand by 'small shopkeepers' ."
"There is one final aspect which I would emphasize with a degree of concern - the need to help small catering and entertainment concerns, so that they are not forced to bear overheads which would eventually have an impact on the final price of the products."
"The Commission has recently, and rightly, invited tenders for a product coding and reading system."
"We hope that this reading system will be as close to the market as possible, precisely in order to prevent some form of technological intervention from creating irregularities and disparities between small and large outlets, and to enable the entire retail trading system to respond to the requirements of a changing market."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her work on this directive."
"I think it important to stress that we must endeavour to unite two opposite views."
"One of these is the perspective of consumers, and the other is the perspective of companies."
"Some of the speakers from the different groups have already referred to this problem."
"We in the Liberal Group are very conscious that consumers must be able to use the internal market and to compare prices."
"We therefore agree with the directive and also support the Committee's amendments."
"Regarding Amendment No 24, our group is in favour of this."
"Having said that, I would like to draw the Commission's attention to two questions."
"The first is that there are some situations which are not mentioned in the directive, but which I regard as important."
"The second is that there is more than the perspective of the consumer; there is also, for example, the perspective of crime prevention."
"I am thinking of the example of shops that sell gold and silver items for whom it may be particularly difficult to show prices in the window because it might encourage some people to smash the glass and steal the diamonds, gold items and precious stones on display."
"If prices are shown, it is obvious that thieves will only take the most expensive items."
"This is an important area and I would like to hear the Commission's views on how we can attempt to solve this problem."
"The other is the question of how the prices are shown, i.e. the question of price marking or price indication ."
"Price marking is a technologically poor solution if each individual item is to be marked, whereas price indication can be displayed on the edge of a shelf or in some other position."
"It is important that we strive for a system which does not work against technological development in the retail trade."
"All of us here in this hall have been through Brussels Airport where they have a very smart, informative system for giving prices in a display."
"We must ensure that this directive facilitates technological development in the retail trade, both for large and for small enterprises."
"Mr President, Parliament adopted a number of amendments at first reading, some of which the Commission has incorporated in its amended proposal."
"There are just a few amendments left to which it still objects, for one reason or another."
"We know what a tremendously sensitive subject this is for shopkeepers, who are all going to have to put these requirements into practice in their shops."
"We feel that the rapporteur has made a number of useful and practical proposals for price indication, and I think that Amendment No 15, which states that there should be a maximum of three prices shown on the product after the introduction of the euro, is particularly practical."
"Consumers must not be confused by having too many prices on or by the product, and I cannot understand why the Commission has not accepted this amendment."
"Perhaps it could give us an explanation."
"I also think a clear distinction must be made between foodstuffs and non-foodstuffs."
"I myself would not find it so terrible if the directive only applied to foodstuffs, since the unit price is always the most useful for consumers doing their daily shopping, whereas with non-foodstuffs there are all kinds of quality factors involved which make comparisons more difficult."
"I fear that the Commission system is simply going to create a great deal of administrative fuss, and I cannot see how this will benefit the consumer."
"The procedure proposed by the Commission in the new Article 6, requiring the Member States to produce lists based on the common nomenclature, seems particularly long-winded."
"We are talking about thousands of products here."
"Fortunately, Article 7 offers scope for this requirement to be waived for a number of products."
"In trying to protect the consumer, we could end up going to the other extreme and creating more problems than we solve."
"For the rest, I am happy to support this report."
"Mr President, I too would like to compliment Mrs Oomen-Ruijten on her report."
"It is an excellent report and I support the call on Commissioner Bonino to initiate an information campaign dealing specifically with the difficulties of the introduction of the euro into the consumer's pocket in the year 2002."
"It is very important that consumers are aware well in advance of the actual physical changeover of currency of the real worth of the euro compared with the punt."
"One of the issues which should be raised in this consumer campaign must relate, as has already been mentioned by the rapporteur, to the introduction of dual pricing in our shops and supermarkets in euros and in punts."
"This is a recommendation which I have supported as a member of the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection Committee."
"The time frame for economic and monetary union has been set out and, as we all know, those countries who will be the first to join the EMU will be selected in 1998 on the basis of the 1997 economic statistics."
"I am pleased to say that Ireland is well to the front in that regard."
"That was initiated, of course, almost ten years ago by former Commissioner Ray McSharry as Irish Minister for Finance."
"Incidentally he was aided by the present Commissioner Padraig Flynn who was a member of the cabinet in Ireland at that time."
"This has, of course, put Ireland in the solid economic position which it is in today to meet the convergence criteria of EMU."
"The central banks of these countries will then converge under the auspices of the European Central Bank in 1999."
"In the year 2002 the euro coins and notes will become a reality and we hope be jingling in plenty in the pockets of the citizens of Europe."
"However, we must not make the same mistakes that surrounded the introduction of decimalisation in Ireland in 1972."
"Many people, especially old people, were confused as to the worth of the new Irish coins and notes at that time and were taken in by unscrupulous dealers."
"We must learn from our mistakes in regard to decimalisation and ensure that they are not repeated when the single European currency is introduced."
"I am confident that the Irish and European consumer organisations will support this proposal and that EMU will become a reality in the near future despite the apprehensions of certain members of the Union."
"We must all face up to this fact and facilitate this process as much as possible."
"Mr President, there are a few points I feel I have to make to the Commission and also to other Members."
"First of all, I think it would be advisable for those who tabled Amendment No 24 to withdraw it in favour of Mr Garosci's amendment, Amendment No 23, which spells out for the second time the exception which applies to small retailers."
"Secondly, I would point out that there is a mistake in Amendment No 15 on the euro, which states that three prices shall be indicated, whereas the recital says that they may be indicated."
"The wording of Amendment No 15 should be altered to read may instead of shall."
"Thirdly, there is the question of whether or not the unit price should be indicated for non-foodstuffs."
"I agree with those speakers who commented on this, and I would draw their attention to Amendment No 18, which states that the unit price need not be indicated where it is meaningless to compare a number of products with each other, such as at an auction or for items such as nails, and so on."
"Finally, I would urge Mrs Jackson to look again at the entire directive and its consequences."
"She has picked up a number of points from the recitals which are actually already covered in the articles."
"If she does this before 12.30 p.m. I think she will feel happy about voting with the rest of her group."
"Mr President, I have a question for Mrs Oomen-Ruijten."
"I did not quite understand whether Amendment No 24 had been withdrawn."
"Is it therefore Amendment No 23 we are to vote on?"
"What is meant by the words - and I will quote them in English because I have the English edition: Member States shall specify which small retail businesses shall be permitted to defer application of this Directive?"
"What are the criteria we are to choose?"
"Is it each individual Member State which must determine these criteria?"
"I think Mr Garosci was quite right to point out that 1000 m² in Greece is very different from 1000 m² in Germany."
"How do we ensure fair competition, and how do we ensure observance of the principle of proximity at the same time?"
"I would very much like to have an answer to this."
"I would prefer to leave it up to the Member States to decide on the exceptions to the rule."
"The example you gave was a good one, Mrs Riis-Jørgensen."
"The situation in a town with many small shops in Greece is entirely different from the situation in the Netherlands, for example."
"I want the Member States to be able to decide for themselves what they classify as small and what they classify as large."
"Mr President, the second reading on the proposal for this directive on the indication of the prices of products offered to consumers gives me the opportunity to say how happy I am with the very favourable attitude of the European Parliament to consumer protection and information."
"That is really what this directive is about: improving consumer information and simplifying the existing mechanisms."
"In particular, I want to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, for the very substantial work that she has done on all of this."
"As at the very first reading, the Commission supports Parliament's position."
"Hence, I am pleased to inform you that the Commission is ready to accept the majority of the European Parliament's amendments."
"The few amendments that we cannot endorse - Nos 9, 15 and 16 - concern the dual pricing in national currencies and euros at the time of introduction of the single currency."
"This is not to say that the Commission is opposed to dual pricing; on the contrary, I wish to stress that price transparency is a priority in the framework of economic and monetary union."
"However, it is too early at this stage to lay down such detailed rules and, moreover, accompanying measures should be the subject of a global presentation."
"Nor can the Commission accept Amendments Nos 23, 24 and 25."
"Amendments Nos 23 and 24 relate to the detailed rules of application of price indication and the Commission considers that the Member States are in the best position to determine them."
"Amendment No 25 cannot be accepted because it contradicts Amendment No 6, which the Commission has accepted."
"Insofar as Mrs Jackson's point on Amendment No 5 is concerned - the recital on unit pricing for antiques - the Commission can empathise with Mrs Jackson's observation."
"However, I wish to point out again that this amendment only relates to a recital and that her point is more substantially covered by Amendment No 13, which the Commission is prepared to accept."
"And that particular amendment will cause the change that Mrs Jackson wants to be incorporated into Article 2 - rather than as a recital."
"Of course, it simply means that antiques will be excluded."
"I hope that, thanks to the proposed amendments, the remainder of the legislative procedure concerning this proposal for a directive on price indications can advance now rapidly without any hitches."
"I wish to thank the rapporteur again for her very good work."
"If I could just add one more comment, I had some very detailed discussions with the officials from the Commission on Amendment No 9, the fifteenth recital, and the article on the euro."
"The aim of the Committee on the Environment is that when the euro is introduced we should not then have a system where two, four or even six prices are indicated, but only a maximum of three."
"The Commission sent me a document suggesting how we could be more flexible about the three prices, and it is now proposing to do nothing at all, which means that we will have the six prices."
"But this is not what I want."
"I would urge you to have another look at this with your legal experts."
"I have looked at it very closely, and we actually share the same opinion on the matter, but the effect of not adopting this amendment is not what either of us would want."
"Then there is Amendment No 25."
"I myself was not in favour of supporting this."
"Amendments Nos 23 and 24 make it easier for small retailers to apply the system, and I would urge you to consider them."
"I have no great difficulty in principle with what Mrs Oomen-Ruijten says."
"What we are saying is that we would like to see it in a broader context and a little later on, dealing with the 'ins' and the 'pre-ins' and the whole question of the general framework of the process."
"That is the only difficulty we have and we would ask you to consider that it might be better if we dealt with it a little later on."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12 noon."
"(The sitting was suspended for five minutes until voting time)"
"Votes"
"Madam President, I should just like to make something clear to honourable Members to prevent this vote becoming a repetition of the misunderstanding which happened with the previous one."
"We are voting today on three - and only three - amendments which have been the subject of a negotiated compromise between the rapporteur and the Commission."
"Some Members may still have the ten amendments preceding these latest ones, which have already been voted on and adopted during the previous vote."
"I would therefore ask you, Madam President, only to put the last three amendments to the vote, all together, partly because they have already been approved by a large majority in the Committee on Agriculture."
"That is what I was proposing to do."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"I should like to congratulate Mrs Matikainen-Kallström, since I believe this is her first report in Parliament."
"Many congratulations to you."
"Madam President, the amendment regarding Recital F is quite simple: it is simply concerned with updating certain data on unemployment in order that the most recent data available can be inserted."
"In Recital F, on page 4, last line, after 'rate of unemployment' we read: ' which is 21.3 % in the south, compared with 7.1 % in the north and 10.2 % in central Italy, the national average being 12.2 % (ISTAT figures - December 1996) and the community average 10.8 % (EUROSTAT figures - September 1996)' ."
"So as you present it, this is both simple and complicated."
"This simply means updating the rates of unemployment, but since there are seven or eight such rates, this might seem rather complicated."
"There are a number of problems in the translations, and I would therefore ask that we should work from the original document and have the translations checked again, particularly the German version."
"If I understand you correctly, you are objecting to the oral amendment."
"I am referring to the written document."
"We should use the original document for the vote, because the translations are not entirely accurate in every case, especially in the German version."
"The meaning is quite clear in the original, but not in the German text."
"So in short, if the House - which I am about to consult - has no objection to voting on this oral amendment, you wish the figures to be checked to ensure that everything is in line with the original version."
"Madam President, I do think it is probably incumbent upon this House to produce up-to-date reports but I would also insist that the statistics are checked not only by national or regional indicators, but with Eurostat, to make sure that we have the latest, up-to-date figures and not figures which some Members may wish to insert to make their case look worse in terms of their structural funds."
"Mrs McCarthy, I can assure you straight away that it is the Eurostat figures which are referred to in this oral amendment."
"(Parliament agreed to the tabling of the oral amendment) - On paragraph 4"
"Madam President, I asked for the floor merely to point out that paragraph 4, in the last few lines, provided for the verification of certain data which could be done on 31 December 1996."
"This has been done, and so the proposal is to delete everything which, in the English text, comes after 'to the weak regions of Italy might be lost' ."
"So the last sentence of paragraph 4 lapses."
"So, Mr Podestà, you are proposing to delete the final part of paragraph 4, following the phrase you quoted from the Italian text."
"I put that to the House."
"(Parliament agreed to the tabling of the oral amendment) - On Amendment No 7"
"Madam President, I had asked Mr Dell'Alba, as the signatory, to withdraw this amendment, except for the last phrase, reading: ' therefore calls upon the government to consider the matter more carefully' ."
"This last phrase should be added to the original text."
"In other words, you would like the ARE Group to propose an oral amendment to its own amendment."
"I would therefore ask for the opinion of Mr Dell'Alba."
"Madam President, bearing in mind what the rapporteur has said, I would ask you to put the first part to the vote, as the rapporteur is clearly opposed to it, and then to put the remaining phrase to the vote."
"Madam President, my group does not have a copy of this amendment, nor does it exist in the actual amendments which have been tabled."
"Therefore, I feel we cannot vote on it."
"I really do think that all this is becoming very confused."
"There are two solutions."
"Either Mr Dell'Alba agrees to an oral amendment, in other words to his amendment being limited to the final phrase, as Mr Podestà has proposed, and I would then see if the House accepts that oral amendment; or he maintains his amendment as it stands, and I put it to the vote."
"What is your view, Mr Dell'Alba?"
"I can accept the oral amendment."
"Madam President, I would simply like to make it clear that the whole original text is unaltered, apart from the addition of the phrase read out a few moments ago."
"The phrase in question therefore reads: ' invites the government to give further attention to this matter' ."
"Madam President, I should like you to give us the sense of the amendment again, because we are voting on a text and we must know what we are approving."
"Would you be kind enough to say again to what paragraph and to the end of what amendment this phrase is to be added."
"It seems to me that the situation really is very confused."
"I shall therefore put the amendment to the vote in the form in which it was tabled by the ARE Group, and as it now stands."
"I think that will be much simpler, since otherwise we shall produce something very confused."
"Madam President, we are going to object to that."
"In fact, the amendment has not been tabled and has not been circulated."
"Obviously it was not tabled within the deadline and I have yet to receive a very clear explanation."
"Therefore, on that basis we do not wish it to be moved and will vote against it."
"The amendment was tabled, Mrs McCarthy."
"I have Amendment No 7 by the Group of the European Radical Alliance which was tabled in the proper way."
"Mr Podestà asked the group to withdraw it."
"That has not been done, but the amendment was indeed tabled."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"I would point out that this is another instance where the translations need to be checked."
"Some parts of the German version read quite differently."
"It is therefore important to look again at the original text, including that of the amendment on assistance with the costs of training the monitoring committees."
"This is a particularly important amendment which is needed in the report, and I would therefore ask that it should be checked again and that the House should support it."
"Thank you for pointing that out, Mrs Schroedter."
"Clearly, if there were to be a mistranslation of such an important amendment, or indeed of any amendment, it would be a very serious matter, and we shall check that very carefully."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, amongst other problems, Mrs OomenRuijten's report raises that of frontier workers, whose situation, I can assure you - as a Member for northern France, a frontier region - has been deteriorating in recent years."
"The more progress is made in European integration and - in theory - the less important borders become, the more national, not to say nationalist, reactions are complicating and adversely affecting the lives of frontier workers."
"This is an intolerable situation!"
"The Commission really must take this matter up with the Member States, and the European Union must bring forward rules which are in keeping with our principles and our Treaties."
"It is, after all, somewhat remarkable that in many cases frontier workers, who might be called the first Europeans, should now regard the building of Europe as a setback in respect of their own circumstances."
"From this point of view, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's report goes in the right direction, and I compliment her on it, but there is still a great deal of work to be done."
"The Danish Social Democrats have today voted in favour of the European Parliament's report on the Commission's proposal to extend by three months the period in which an unemployed person moving to an EU country other than his homeland is entitled to receive unemployment benefit."
"The Danish Social Democrats have a positive attitude to an extension of the existing three-month period in which an unemployed person is entitled to seek employment in another Member State."
"There are, however, certain points in the proposal on which we would like further clarification, to ensure that an unemployed person's situation is not made worse on expiry of the three-month period."
"These have to do with the administration and control of an unemployed person's benefit, and with the question whether, according to the proposal, it is the Member State in which an unemployed person is seeking work that is required to take responsibility for that unemployed person."
"Recommendation for second reading by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten (A4-0015/97)"
"The two main subjects of this recommendation for second reading are: firstly, the protection of consumers by ensuring that adequate information is provided on product prices; and, secondly, the simplification of prices through indication of both the selling price and the unit price."
"This is the most appropriate - and simplest - way of informing consumers, since it enables them to compare the prices of the products they wish to buy."
"Indication of the unit price will be helpful to consumers, because it will enable them to choose between products sold in different quantities."
"This new system, which will replace the old system of giving only the package price, without referring to the unit price, will provide consumers with more information and increase their ability to compare and choose."
"I shall therefore be voting in favour of the recommendation."
"We have chosen to support the report, although we do not think that the EU has anything to say on this issue. We believe that consumer protection through price labelling on products for sale is best handled at national level."
"We have chosen however to support what we consider is best for the consumer, hence our support for this report."
"We cannot support the amendment proposals concerning the single currency because we do not support the principle of a common currency, nor do we believe that this will ever come into being."
"As for consumers, we think it will be very hard for them to make sense of all the different prices which will be displayed."
"Santini report (A4-0337/96)"
"Madam President, I hope that Mr Santini's report will bring this banana saga to an end."
"I would briefly remind the House that we import just over 800 000 tonnes of bananas from Guadeloupe, Martinique, Madeira and so on, and from what might be described as former European possessions in Africa and elsewhere, with two million tonnes coming to us from Central America."
"In seeking to protect its company, Chiquita, the United States - for some inexplicable reason, since it does not produce any bananas itself - decided that two million tonnes, with a customs duty of only ECU 75 per tonne rather than ECU 825 per tonne, was not enough. It obtained 2 200 000 tonnes, then 2 300 000, and is now asking for 2 500 000."
"Our German colleagues, or more precisely Germany, has always been very supportive of Chiquita's position, probably because all the German political parties were receiving backhanders from this multinational company."
"That is an open secret."
"At last, thanks to Mr Santini, we have arrived not at a half-way position, but at a moderate one."
"To my mind, this issue is very symptomatic: it shows how the building of Europe is completely dependent on the wishes of the United States."
"An increase in the customs quota would definitely benefit Swedish consumers."
"We would like to see a more open market for bananas on the world market."
"Our goal is that Swedish consumers be given a choice when buying bananas."
"They should be offered best quality bananas at the lowest possible price."
"Naturally, we would like consumers to be able, if they so wish, to buy bananas which have been produced by the best methods from an ecological and social point of view."
"There are very good grounds for opposing the EU's current joint organisation of the banana market."
"We are against the EU's current trade policy concerning the import of bananas."
"The current policy is bureaucratic, it is unfair to many countries, particularly in Latin America and leads to higher consumer prices."
"We cannot therefore vote for a proposal which does not reform the current system."
"We support those proposals which favour the import of fair trade bananas which have been grown under approved ecological and social conditions."
"We consider the compromise proposal (No 16) to be much too weak to support the import of fair trade bananas."
"For this reason we have chosen to abstain from voting on the Santini report."
"We, as consumers, should be able to buy whatever bananas we like and we cannot accept a quota system or any other type of restriction on the type of bananas which should be given priority."
"The Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations was opposed to the adoption of the amendments tabled by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, but supported the final resolution contained in Mr Santini's report."
"Our group takes the view that this resolution preserves the main structure of the trading preferences granted to the banana-producing ACP countries, whereas the Agriculture Committee's amendments contain provisions which conflict with the interests of those countries."
"Given the unchecked globalization of trade flows, this text has the virtue of preserving one vital and effective aspect of our cooperation policy: tariff quotas."
"The fact is that for several years now, a campaign has been under way to outflank our traditional partners, for the benefit of the multinationals."
"This is not a question of pitting certain economic interests against others, but of defending a tried and tested form of development cooperation."
"It is also a question of protecting those producers who have opted to apply much higher social standards than many others."
"I am pleased that the efforts of certain model producers have been highlighted in Mr Santini's report."
"Our group is opposed in principle to the possibility of transferring ACP quotas to other producers, especially since the definition of 'exceptional circumstances' jeopardizing Europe's supply of bananas from the ACP countries does not strike us as a sound basis for a lasting relationship of cooperation."
"On the contrary, this constitutes a major break with a preference system which was established for the benefit of some of the poorest economies in the world."
"If it is to operate effectively, this system must be based on reliability and trust, and not on constant doubt."
"Matikainen-Kallström report (A4-0041/97)"
"The thinking behind this Energy Charter protocol is positive and the proposal contains many good suggestions and views which we support."
"Regrettably, most of the positive points in the report are lost, because environmental regulations have not been included in the report, but are only to be found in an attached protocol."
"In addition these regulations are not legally binding, which means that they will not be a force to help change the energy system to an ecologically sustainable system."
"Unfortunately, it is our experience that non binding environmental regulations are rarely implemented."
"There are a large number of examples from within the EU of countries which have not even complied with the binding environmental decisions which have been adopted."
"This is not a good basis and we would have liked to have seen an energy regulation agreement which included binding environmental regulations."
"Podestà report (A4-0405/96)"
"Madam President, I wish to make this explanation of vote on Mr Podestà's report mainly to thank him and congratulate him on his work in producing this important summary on behalf of the European Parliament on the problem of the administration of the Structural Funds in Italy, but also because I feel that something must be said about the annoyance that we, as elected Members of the European Parliament, cannot help feeling about the way in which the Structural Funds are administered in our country."
"As we know, an important meeting took place on 22 January between Mr Ciampi and the Commissioner, Mrs Wulf-Mathies, at which it emerged that Italy's total backlog at the end of 1996 exceeded one and a half billion ECU, equally distributed among the various Funds."
"Well, in a situation of budgetary rigour, in a situation where Italy and its government are asking the Italian people to make sacrifices to secure entry into Europe, the fact that one of the founding States of the Community is in serious structural difficulties, not to say incapable of administering these funds correctly -so that we are constantly having to ask for delays and extensions, and then the national authorities are forced to step in to remedy the shortcomings of the regions - is absolutely intolerable."
"I would have hoped that the European Parliament would be more critical, providing more of a spur to the Italian government, not by way of intervening in its internal affairs but simply in the interests of the proper functioning of the institutions."
"In particular, we believe that the Control Centre is no longer an appropriate instrument, and that what is needed is a body with greater authority and greater powers."
"This is the only way in which we can make up the backlog and achieve the objective of administering the Funds with greater awareness and consistency between expenditure and commitments entered into."
"In this hope, my group has voted for the resolution, motivated by the desire to spur the Italian government to greater efficiency in its administration of the Structural Funds."
"Without wishing to question the objectivity of the rapporteur, I consider it dangerous, in principle, that Parliament's rapporteur is from the same country whose support is being evaluated."
"For reasons of principle, Parliament should always make efforts to use a rapporteur who has no interest whatsoever in the issue under discussion."
"Botz report (A4-0002/97)"
"Without wishing to question the objectivity of the rapporteur, I consider it dangerous, in principle, that Parliament's rapporteur is from the same country whose support is being evaluated."
"For reasons of principle, Parliament should always make efforts to use a rapporteur who has no interest whatsoever in the issue under discussion."
"That concludes voting time."
"(The sitting was suspended at 12.45 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"BSE"
"Mr President, the European Parliament's right to set up committees of inquiry was laid down in the Maastricht Treaty of 1992 and developed further in an interinstitutional decision of 1995."
"To date, Parliament has set up two committees of inquiry: one into fraud in the Community transit system, and the other into BSE."
"For reasons of timetabling, the Committee of Inquiry into BSE completed its work before the other committee, with the effect that I have the honour of being the first rapporteur to speak in the House on behalf of a committee of inquiry."
"The Committee of Inquiry had to work within certain time constraints, since the BSE crisis has had an enormous impact on European public opinion and Parliament was receiving a message of social alarm. Indeed, Parliament had been receiving this message for some time, and this led it to decide last summer to set up the committee."
"The Committee of Inquiry was set up for a limited period of time, in principle three months."
"This initial period proved inadequate, and an extension was obtained. The committee finally completed its work on 6 February, after a marathon sitting at which it considered some 250 amendments."
"The committee's work took around five months, and its results, like those of all work carried out under pressure of time, will no doubt present some difficulties."
"I hope that as Members read this report, they will take note of any shortcomings it may have, so that these can be reviewed and rectified before its publication."
"As the House will be aware, the report consists of a first part, part A, containing the results of the inquiry and the recommendations, with a series of annexes comprising the minority opinions, plus a summary of the hearings and a number of other documents."
"In the course of our work, we received several kilos of documentation from the Commission, the Council, government bodies, and national and international scientific institutions."
"Over that period, moreover, we held a series of highly detailed hearings: we had the privilege of hearing the testimony of the Presidents of the Council and the Commission, as well as that of various members of the present and previous Commissions; and we had the honour, in particular, of welcoming a number of distinguished members of the scientific community, who took the trouble to come to Brussels and give evidence to our committee on an objective basis, offering us their full cooperation."
"I believe that our hearings, which were chaired efficiently by Mr Böge, have produced a valuable report, which will be useful to all those who care to read it."
"The Committee of Inquiry is now presenting to Parliament part A of its report, which consists of the results of the inquiry, recommendations for the future, and the minority opinions."
"There are seven minority opinions, and I shall not go into them in detail, because they will be presented by their authors. I would point out, however, that the report as such was adopted unanimously by those present at the vote on 6 February."
"Consequently, whatever flaws it may have - and, of course, your rapporteur acknowledges those flaws - they are the responsibility of the members of the Committee of Inquiry as a whole."
"The problem is that while the Committee of Inquiry had a fairly wide brief, in the sense that it was mandated to investigate alleged contraventions or maladministration in the implementation of Community law in relation to BSE, it was subject to an important restriction, which was to carry out that brief without prejudice to the jurisdiction of the Community and national courts. In other words, the committee could not act as a court of law."
"On this basis, therefore, the Committee of Inquiry's concern was to identify the responsibilities of the various institutions. In doing so, it found that, because of the European Union's structure, whereby responsibilities are shared between the Member States and the Community institutions, it had to focus primarily on the responsibilities of the Member States, in particular those of the British Government."
"There is no doubt that the BSE crisis had its origins in certain actions by the British Government which caused enormous damage, albeit unexpected and undesired."
"The starting-point for the crisis was the introduction of a new method of manufacturing meat-and-bone meal from animal remains, the so-called Carver-Greenfield process."
"As a number of scientific experts explained to our committee, at some point the British Government relaxed the rules governing this process, with the effect that the meal was not completely sterilized."
"A number of the members of the Committee of Inquiry went to the United Kingdom and visited the plants in question; they found that what had been happening was that animal remains - many of which were probably infected with other diseases - had been used in the manufacture of animal feeds and allowed to enter the food chain, without any kind of control."
"There is also a whole series of problems regarding the lack of identification."
"On the farms that we visited, for example, we saw sacks of animal feed which contained absolutely no information as to the origin of their contents."
"There was no way of knowing where they had come from; and this explains precisely the form, behaviour and development of the disease, which appears in isolated cases on farms a long way apart."
"All things considered, with the cooperation of the Community institutions, the problem could have been tackled effectively from 1989 onwards, when the first scientific evidence that the disease could have consequences for human health was obtained in German, French and other laboratories - including, and above all, British laboratories."
"I believe that if, at that time, the UK Government had offered to cooperate with the Community institutions, and the Community institutions had acted in harmony with the UK Government, we could have begun to tackle the problem in 1989 or 1990, and we would now perhaps be on the way to resolving it."
"There was then a second crucial period, when the UK Government attempted to prevent investigations into BSE in the United Kingdom by all means possible."
"Indeed, although Commission officials carried out 37 veterinary inspections in the UK between 1990 and 1994, none of those checks was on BSE. This leads us to believe that the UK Government actively wished to prevent such checks being carried out and that the Commission was not firm enough to impose them."
"Curiously, documents relating to the period reveal that, although detailed checks on foot-and-mouth disease in Greece and similar matters were then being carried out, there was no Community research into the major epidemic in the United Kingdom - BSE - which was then beginning to concern us."
"However, I shall not go into detail on this subject, as I do not have enough time, and I should now like refer to the second main set of responsibilities: those of the Council."
"The Council is composed of the representatives of the Member States' governments and acts as the legislative authority. But it also acts as an executive authority - and therein lies a major anomaly."
"One of the principles of our constitutions is the separation of powers."
"In order to be a Member of the European Community, a state must abide by the principles of the EC. However, the European Community itself does not abide by the principle of the separation of powers - and it has even been said that if the European Community asked to join the European Community, it could not be accepted because it does not abide by that principle."
"And this raises a serious problem: the Council, which is the legislative body, delegates some executive responsibilities to the Commission, but it retains the fundamental power."
"It is as if it had given the Commission a bullet, but that bullet is on a cord, so that after each shot, the Commission has to return it to the Council. As a result, decisions of an executive nature which are adopted in the Council are then counteracted by the way in which committees made up of representatives of the Member States' governments operate - in this case the Standing Veterinary Committee."
"When it comes to voting in these committees, the votes are weighted, with the effect that the influence exerted by the different governments is not a function of scientific reason, but of those governments' political will or weight."
"In cases of diseases, therefore, the UK Government has a greater say than, for example, the Greek or Portuguese Governments."
"I believe that this is a totally unacceptable system, which violates the constitutional principles of all our Member States, and that it will be unacceptable if the Intergovernmental Conference results in these executive powers being retained by the Council."
"I now come to the third main set of responsibilities, which are those of the Commission."
"The European Parliament is accusing the Commission of weakness."
"That is to say, the Committee of Inquiry considers that there was a point at which the Commission did not adopt the measures that it should have."
"When, at one time, the governments of certain Member States were seeking to apply Article 36 in order to restrict the import of beef products from the United Kingdom, the Commission intervened - even threatening to bring an action against those Member States before the Court of Justice. We believe that was the correct thing to do, but that the Commission should have simultaneously taken action against the Member State in question and required it to comply with the relevant standards."
"At one point in the hearings, I specifically asked the Commissioner responsible at the time if he had requested the opinion of the Commission's legal services. His reply was that he did not have sufficient political power, at the time, to confront the Council."
"In politics, Mr President, you have to be decisive."
"It is a considerably more difficult activity than it appears to be, and I believe that if an institution has some kind of basic or legal power, then it must use it."
"At that point, and for some time afterwards, the Commission displayed tremendous weakness."
"I do not wish to go into detail on all aspects of the Commission's responsibilities, but I would stress the fact that, in 1996, the British Government's threat to use its veto to paralyse Community business was met by weakness on the part of the Council and, once again, the Commission."
"This weakness reached the extent that the decision to lift the embargo on gelatine seems to have been taken on the basis of an inadequate preliminary report, which was then contradicted by a subsequent report making it clear that the use of gelatine - and lifting the gelatine embargo - did indeed present a possible risk to human health."
"All in all, on the one hand because of the refusal of the UK Government to accept the intervention of the Community, and on the other hand because of the concentration of powers in the Council and the Commission's weakness vis-à-vis the Council and the Member States, we are now faced with a crisis which, as far as we know, has resulted in the death of 165 000 cattle - although there are apparently a further half a million infected cattle in the United Kingdom - the suicide of 23 farmers in the UK, the infection of 15 people with a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease - which is attributed to BSE - and the collapse of the beef market."
"I believe it was Commissioner Fischler who said that this was the greatest disaster that the European Community had ever had to face."
"The Committee of Inquiry could have restricted itself to recording these contraventions or cases of maladministration, but it seemed appropriate for it to make some kind of recommendations based on its experience and what it had learnt."
"Our recommendations cover a range of topics, but one of them is, of course, aimed at increasing transparency throughout the beef sector."
"The Community's citizens are currently alarmed at the development of mysterious institutions which meet in Brussels, and in which there are possibly lobbies at work, and they have no assurance that the food they eat, the products they consume, are provided with adequate health safety guarantees."
"Consequently, the citizens of the Community are now calling for increased transparency and information."
"We are proposing a series of measures aimed at ensuring the widest possible dissemination of information on this crisis and on future developments."
"The Committee of Inquiry is also proposing another set of measures aimed at improving the monitoring of all health issues."
"At present, the very structure of the Commission, the structure of the system of scientific and other committees, is not designed to guarantee health protection."
"As the Community has developed, with the emphasis being placed on its essentially economic aspects, it has been forgotten that the fundamental purpose of economic activity is to protect people and enable them to develop their potential."
"If we continue to subordinate everything to the economic interests of particular business sectors, we shall ultimately condemn the common market and cause harm to the Community's citizens as a whole."
"For this reason, the conclusions of the Committee of Inquiry are based on a wish to foster cooperation between the Commission and Parliament, not least through the creation of a joint body to monitor, over the coming months, the implementation of all the measures aimed at strengthening public confidence, enhancing the protection of public health, and improving the functioning of the Community institutions."
"I believe that with this report, Mr President, Parliament is making an important contribution to the development of the Community institutions and the improvement of the welfare of the Community's citizens."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this committee of inquiry has spent six months on the trail of madness, in every sense of the word."
"As chairman of the committee, I should first of all like to thank our rapporteur, Mr Medina Ortega, for the effort he has put into this report."
"Thanks are also due to all my colleagues for the commitment they have shown, and especially to our committee secretariat, which has worked very effectively."
"This has been a new experience for all of us, and it certainly also involved testing out a number of grey areas in the interinstitutional agreement on the right of inquiry."
"In accordance with the mandate given to us by the House and on the basis of that agreement of 19 April 1995, to which all the institutions have committed themselves, we have tried to find out the truth and determine any responsibility for negligent and culpable behaviour."
"Despite our limited right of inquiry, there is now a wealth of facts and evidence which make two things clear."
"Firstly, this Parliament is in a position to use the right of inquiry as an instrument of control at any time, and it can be applied in other cases too."
"This is a clear warning to everyone, and perhaps this alone will help us to move forward."
"The European Parliament has an obligation to our citizens, and to our citizens alone."
"Only by completely clarifying matters, establishing where responsibility lies and drawing the necessary political conclusions can we succeed in restoring the damaged confidence of our citizens."
"Secondly, we wish to end the madness of this BSE saga once and for all, and ensure that nothing like it ever happens again."
"This means, of course, that our efforts must be centred on bringing about an agricultural sector based on sustainability and on production methods best suited to each type of animal."
"There is a common interest here, for both consumers and farmers."
"We also need a commitment from the Commission, the Council and Parliament that the relevant precautions will be taken, through appropriate initiatives and legislative proposals, including budgetary policy."
"The details of this strange and alarming mixture of ignorance, mismanagement and misjudgement are very well documented in the report through many examples."
"On the other hand, of course, it is clear that errors and omissions committed in the past, in 1989 and 1990, must be judged differently - not least given the new scientific findings made since March 1996, which were not previously available."
"However, this does not absolve the policy from its responsibility of concentrating efforts on preventive consumer protection."
"In that respect, there were shortcomings."
"Serious technical mistakes were made in combating BSE."
"Many of the measures adopted and implemented in 1996 came several years too late, and practical errors committed in the past are still hampering us in combating BSE today - and not just in the United Kingdom."
"There was an inability to make preventive consumer protection a central issue within the internal market, and a lack of interest in doing so."
"I very much welcome the ruling by the European Court of Justice of 12 July 1996, which gave internal market case law a new quality in terms of health and consumer policy."
"There was a shared responsibility as regards the omissions, firstly in the United Kingdom, of course, and secondly on the part of the previous Commission in particular."
"But the Council too did not particularly distinguish itself by activity at every stage of the proceedings, even if there were repeated initiatives by individual Member States."
"We are naturally aware, Mr Santer, that in many areas, the Commission can only be as good as some Member States allow it to be."
"I said to you during the debate in July, Mr Santer: ' Please do not cover up the mistakes of the past' ."
"I am referring first of all to the phoney debate on gelatine. Even if no one has suffered harm because of this decision and this toing and froing, Mr Santer, do you really think that our citizens can understand such stage management and see it as a credible policy?"
"Secondly, I feel it has been somewhat detrimental to you in our assessment that people who used to be responsible in the Commission's services were also entrusted with the task of dealing with and responding to the questions and activities of the Committee of Inquiry."
"That was a strategic mistake."
"(Applause) And presenting this appalling press release of 16 December at the end of the investigations, as if this committee of inquiry had never existed, struck me as an insult."
"(Applause) The same applies, I am sorry to say, to the fact that at the end of the proceedings, the full set of documents requested from the meeting of the BSE Subgroup of 8 January 1997 was not forwarded to us in good time, but only selected items."
"After Mr Fischler had given his approval, we then received these documents late on Friday afternoon, but for the first time in the seven and a half years that I have been a Member of Parliament, my trunk has not arrived in Strasbourg."
"So I have not yet been able to check on this."
"I think you were badly advised in this respect, Mr Fischler and Mr Santer."
"Our citizens are confused and dismayed, and are saying to us in the world outside: if this is Europe, then we have some serious doubts, in view of the challenges we are all facing."
"You should therefore see the recommendations made by the Committee of Inquiry as an opportunity to improve matters."
"Those who recognize and admit mistakes and learn from them are strong and acting responsibly, unlike those who minimize debate and disregard minority wishes and opinions."
"On the basis of this recommendation from the Committee of Inquiry, the Commission and Parliament can become natural allies once again."
"Some very clear and strict recommendations were made in this respect by the Committee of Inquiry: the question of reorganization; the question of responsibility, including disciplinary measures; the question of a joint body to solve the animal meal problems once and for all; and also the legal basis, Mr Santer."
"Wherever the Commission has scope for interpretation, it should accommodate Parliament more than it has done in the past when determining the legal basis, even before the Intergovernmental Conference."
"(Applause) Furthermore, the fact that the British Agriculture Minister, Mr Hogg, did not attend is an insult not just to Parliament, but to all the citizens of Europe."
"(Applause) And it must be made clear that this is a breach of the interinstitutional agreement, which everyone has signed."
"A more vigorous approach from the outset would also have limited the economic damage and would have turned out very much less expensive than the strategy of minimal debate, which has ultimately backfired."
"A resolution has now been tabled which has the support of several groups."
"You should likewise see the text of this resolution, Mr Santer, on which we shall be voting tomorrow, as an invitation, as an opportunity to improve matters."
"Parliament will have to check and monitor the future progress of events, and at the moment, when things are going well, you still have our confidence."
"But if things are not changed satisfactorily and we see serious shortcomings, then in the coming months there will have to be a very serious debate and some very serious initiatives will have to be taken, including the question of applying Article 144 of the Treaty."
"We owe that to the citizens of Europe, as their representatives."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, with your permission, I rise to speak on the order of business."
"Is there any reason why the Council has not deigned to attend this extremely important debate this afternoon?"
"There are no political representatives of the Council present."
"The Commission is well represented, and I am grateful to it for that."
"The Council seems to be indifferent to this matter."
"All I can say, Mrs Lalumière, is that the Council was contacted by the presidency of Parliament, but replied that it was not able or did not consider it appropriate to attend today."
"That is all I know, and all that I can tell you."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we are dealing with an extremely important matter."
"Whatever has to be said to the Council will be said through the appropriate procedures, which anyone may use."
"But we are not going to become sidetracked and enter into a question which - however important it may be - is incidental to this debate."
"I give the floor to Mr Happart, the first signatory of the motion of censure."
"Mr President, I should like to borrow a remark that Winston Churchill reportedly made before the war: ' You have the choice between dishonour and war' ."
"Mr Santer, you have the choice between dishonour and resignation. It is not too late, and it is high time."
"On behalf of the institution to which I belong, and in keeping with my idea, as a democrat, of the Europe that we are in the process of building, I call on you to cease humiliating yourself, and humiliating us, by attempting to justify the unjustifiable."
"Do you not realize that you are building Europe without the involvement of its citizens, that you are building Europe in the interests of business and against those of its citizens?"
"You are strangling at birth the Europe of our children, and all because you refuse to assume your political responsibilities in respect of the extremely serious affair - if ever there was one - of BSE."
"In adopting this attitude, you are undermining the confidence of our citizens further still."
"You should be spearheading the building of a genuine people's Europe, Mr Santer, a Europe of the future."
"However, on reading Mr Medina Ortega's excellent report - or rather his indictment of the failures of the Commission and successive UK Governments - you will see, like everyone else, that your responsibilities in this affair require a radical and immediate sanction: the resignation of your Commission."
"People will reply, and I am used to hearing this, that it is not the right moment, that there are other things to do, and that the Commission must be given a chance to put its house in order."
"I firmly reject these arguments, Mr Santer, because the Commission's actions, its serious mistakes in this affair, deserve a sanction."
"Political responsibility must be assumed!"
"Of course, the necessary administrative steps must also be taken to punish the officials who - under your authority and that of the Commission as a whole - committed acts which exposed hundreds, if not thousands, of human lives to serious danger."
"We are living in a time - it seems to be part of the current climate - in which we are obliged to make savings."
"We are obliged to make things pay, to be competitive - but for the sake of whom, for the sake of what?"
"For the sake, of course, of the unbridled pursuit of profit of monetarism and high finance."
"By allowing a handful of - mainly British - undertakings to cheat in order to reduce the cost of producing beef, a situation was created which today, ten years on, is costing many - far too many - human lives, as well as billions of ECU to society."
"Mr Santer, the way in which the Commission - your Commission - treats the European Parliament is a disgrace."
"Indeed, at the very time when the Committee of Inquiry was carrying out its work - which, as Mr Medina Ortega's report shows, was extremely useful and enlightening - you were approving the uncontrolled import of genetically modified maize."
"Your Commission is in the process of approving the production and distribution on the European market of new medicinal and other products, the harmlessness of which in the short and medium term is far from guaranteed."
"Please stop telling us that we have to choose between technological progress, growth and modernity and the kind of opposition to change that will mean the regression of our European societies."
"What is the purpose of being modern, of making money, if in doing so we endanger human health or the future of our environment - which is the environment of our children and grandchildren?"
"Mr Santer, I do not know if you are a father or grandfather - and I hope that you are - but I would ask you to consider, leaving aside purely commercial considerations, what kind of planet we are bequeathing to our children."
"Do you not believe that the time has come for us to have the courage to make a U-turn, to start to give priority to people and their future, rather than to a handful of economic and financial interests?"
"With regard to research, if a decision were taken for research to be funded by the community and geared to increasing welfare rather than profits, the citizens of Europe and the rest of the world would be eternally grateful to you."
"Mr Santer, I am aware that the choice I am calling on you to make - that of resigning - is more difficult for you than it appears to be to observers."
"Tomorrow, the Members of the European Parliament will be called upon to vote on a resolution stemming from the Committee of Inquiry's report."
"If that resolution is forward-looking and explicit, I shall vote in favour of it, because it will form the terms of reference, the manifesto basis, for the Commission that will succeed your own."
"On Thursday, I shall call on all the Members of the European Parliament to imagine, leaving aside partisan divisions or whatever interests they may have, that tomorrow, in a year, in five years, in perhaps ten years, their son or daughter is afflicted by the terrible disease known as new variant CJD."
"If that were to happen, how would they vote?"
"I have made my choice."
"In collecting the necessary signatures and tabling this motion of censure, I consider that I am fulfilling my role as a Member of the European Parliament and doing my duty."
"Some people will perhaps call it populism."
"But I am not a populist!"
"I am simply defending the health and future of our fellow citizens."
"Today, we must let our conscience be our guide, and not some reason of party or state."
"Mr Santer, you have the choice between staying with dishonour and resigning with honour."
"For the sake of Europe and its citizens, I call on you to resign."
"There is still time for you to do so!"
"Mr President, the Socialist Group welcomes and endorses the report and recommendations of the Committee of Inquiry into BSE."
"This Parliament is today demonstrating that we take our role of monitoring and controlling the unelected institutions of the European Union very seriously."
"This is the first time that the powers given to us in the Maastricht Treaty to investigate alleged contraventions or maladministration under the auspices of a committee of inquiry have been used."
"My group wants to pay tribute to those colleagues who have been engaged in the committee of inquiry."
"They have worked hard to identify and expose the tragic series of events which have devastated the beef industry across Europe, ruined the livelihoods of so many farmers, rural workers and people engaged in the ancillary food business and, worst of all, has led to debilitating illness and death for some of our fellow citizens and put so many others at risk."
"I wish to make clear that for my group at all times the paramount concern has been the health of the people of the European Union."
"The work of the committee of inquiry has demonstrated unequivocally that the blame for the BSE crisis lies fairly and squarely on the shoulders of the current British Government."
"It was its single-minded, blind, ideological commitment to deregulation that led to a catalogue of disastrous decisions on which BSE evolved."
"(Applause) My group has long believed that a simple commitment to deregulation is as outmoded and dangerous a concept as is a simple commitment to regulation."
"What is needed is appropriate regulation: regulation to protect the health of the public and regulation to secure the safety of consumers is, in our view, necessary in a single market."
"The BSE tragedy is a sad and dramatic example of what can happen when the health of the public and the safety of consumers is sacrificed on the altar of business expediency and profit-enhancement."
"(Applause) The British Government is to blame not just for the impact in Britain but because, by its mismanagement of the crisis, far from containing BSE in Britain it allowed its contaminated animal foodstuffs and infected calves to continue to enter the market and food chains in the rest of Europe."
"This really was negligence of the worst sort."
"I am confident that all decent-thinking British people know that if such games had been played with their health and safety by any other government in the European Union they would be unforgiving."
"The British tabloid media would do well to ponder on that fact before they indulge in any further xenophobia on this issue."
"(Applause) The sight last night of the British Minister of Agriculture, Mr Douglas Hogg, being saved from a motion of no confidence in the House of Commons on his mishandling of the BSE crisis by a disreputable political fix with the Ulster Unionist Party really beggars belief!"
"If, as we are assured, beef from Northern Ireland and other specified herds in Britain has not been infected in the same way as other beef in Britain, why was it not acknowledged months ago, thereby saving Northern Irish farmers from the catastrophic financial consequences of recent months?"
"Why is it that the British Government only agrees to pursue so-called special measures when it faces a motion of no confidence in the House of Commons?"
"It is this kind of cynical, opportunist behaviour which destroys confidence in Britain and the rest of Europe and demonstrates that the British Government does not put health and consumer safety - let alone economic good sense - at the top of its agenda."
"Mr Douglas Hogg, the hapless Agriculture Minister, refused to come and give evidence to our committee of inquiry, despite the fact that all the governments in the Union - including the British Government - had given an undertaking that they would support the work of Parliament's committee of inquiry."
"Last night in the House of Commons Mr Hogg said that it would be an abnegation of British sovereignty for him to give evidence to us here."
"He is one of those who argues that sovereignty in a democracy rests in its parliament."
"I am one of those who believes that sovereignty resides in the hands of the people."
"(Applause) However, the Council cannot hide from criticism in this affair."
"It succumbed to pressure from the British Government; it watered down Commission proposals in the Agriculture Council and generally used the elite club of the Council to look after national interests rather than those of the people of the Union."
"It reinforces the view of my group that the Council, when acting as a corporate body, hides behind the members' individual democratic legitimacy and acts together in a secretive and unacceptable way."
"I want to say now to the President of the Commission that this was a disaster waiting to happen."
"The European Commission is culpable: it was not as if the Commission had not been warned that its structures and decisionmaking on food safety and public health were seriously flawed."
"As long ago as 1989 in the Raftery report this Parliament stated: ' If we want a genuine single market for food then we must establish a genuine, independent, strong and open regulatory body which will be seen to put the interests of consumers above those of producers, processors, distributors and the catering industry.'"
"Yet again, in March 1992, in my report on the reform of the Scientific Committee for Food this Parliament said: ' The process of achieving a satisfactory scientific base for matters relating to food safety will be judged by Europe's consumers according to whether it is sufficiently independent, transparent and effective.'"
"In that report Parliament demanded a single unit in the European Commission to deal with food under the auspices of the consumer policy service, a common food policy, an independent scientific committee for food, proper consumer representation on that committee, transparency in the appointments made to the committee and proper consideration of the public interest in areas of food and consumer safety."
"How much more could this Parliament have done to demonstrate that European decision-making in food safety was in a mess?"
"The litany of shambolic decision-making, lack of accountability and evasiveness shown by the Commission and its officials throughout the BSE saga has left the Commission weakened and vulnerable."
"So, sadly, it has taken a crisis of this magnitude to create the conditions for change."
"If the President of the Commission is to be believed, then change we shall have, and we welcome his statement."
"But we are not content with promises."
"That is why in our resolution to wind up this debate we commit ourselves to watching very carefully just what action the Commission takes to fulfil its promises made here today by its President."
"If the reforms are not genuine, appropriate or fast enough to deal with the recommendations of the committee of inquiry, then my group will join with others in tabling a motion of censure on the Commission at an appropriate time in the months before or during November of this year."
"Finally, my group will not support the motion of censure on the European Commission before this House today."
"We do not consider it an effective political strategy to censure this Commission before it has had the opportunity to put its own house in order."
"We are interested in a serious attempt to reform in the interests of public health."
"Furthermore, we are convinced that a successful motion of censure at this stage would simply lead to an institutional crisis which would last for months and not do one single thing to strengthen public health or consumer protection at European level."
"(Applause) There are those who consider that the publicity and chaos which would accompany the dismissal of the Commission would somehow cleanse the system."
"My group does not believe that to be the case."
"That the President of the Commission has come here today to set out before this Parliament a package of reforms which, if carried through, should go some way to really cleansing the system, is a tribute to those who have worked so hard in the committee of inquiry and a measure of the effect which this Parliament, if it takes its powers seriously, can achieve."
"The committee of inquiry identified the faults and the reforms necessary to end those faults."
"It is now our political responsibility in this House to see through those reforms to completion, and we intend to do so."
"(Loud applause)"
"I should like to begin by congratulating the chairman of the Committee of Inquiry, Mr Böge, the rapporteur, Mr Medina, and all the other committee members."
"Our group endorses the findings of this report."
"The description of the mismanagement that occurred at the height of the BSE crisis between 1990 and 1994 is absolutely incredible."
"In 1990, it had already been scientifically proved that the infecting agent could be passed from one species to another, and this should have added urgency to the scientific research being carried out."
"Yet the research results from 1990 onwards were meagre, to say the least."
"Between 1990 and 1994, veterinary BSE inspections were suspended in the UK."
"The Medina report says that the then Commission attempted to hide the truth and to blame Parliament for the suspension, whereas the decision was actually taken by the Commission itself, having caved in to pressure from the UK."
"During the same period, with the sole exception of the directive on embryos, no Community legislation on BSE was passed at all."
"Between the extraordinary Council meeting on 6 and 7 June 1990 on the first BSE crisis and 1994, in other words over a period of four years, there was not one single Council debate on BSE, yet it was during this period that 75 % of the cases of BSE were identified in the United Kingdom."
"In mid-1990, France and Germany considered imposing trade restrictions on British beef, but Commissioner MacSharry threatened to take them to the Court of Justice."
"The Medina report also says that there is written evidence that the then Commission supported a policy of disinformation towards the general public which also affected the Community institutions themselves, in that when the supply of genuine information was cut off and the Commission was no longer doing its job, the Council too was kept in the dark."
"The report identifies the UK Government as the body mainly responsible for the BSE crisis, and it points to six occasions when successive governments violated Article 5 of the Treaty and refused to obey the rules of fair and transparent cooperation."
"As you know, Article 5 of the Treaty sets out the principle of loyalty to the Community."
"However, the Council is also to blame for the passivity and delays in fighting the epidemic in the UK, for taking wrong decisions and providing poor coordination in protecting public health, and for the disinformation of the public."
"The Committee of Inquiry's report makes it quite plain that the previous Commission also made serious errors and showed critical failings during the period of mismanagement at the height of the BSE crisis between 1990 and 1994, and that the political responsibility lay with Commissioners MacSharry and Steichen."
"We think that Commissioner Fischler should take the opportunity in this debate to explain the two errors which he is accused of making in the report."
"However, as the Committee of Inquiry said, the political consequences of this inquiry will be felt in the changes of structure, policy and personnel which have to be made in order to repair the serious omissions and errors of the past."
"The Commission's political responsibility now lies in carrying out these fundamental reforms, because, as the Medina report says, this will serve the Committee of Inquiry's purposes better than simply dismissing the Commission outright."
"Our group therefore confirms that it has confidence in the Commission to implement these reforms."
"It needs to take urgent action to restore the credibility of the European Union by giving public health and consumer protection precedence over economic interests."
"Ladies and gentlemen, would even Dr Faustus ever have thought of breaking with an age-old tradition and feeding meat-and-bone meal to ruminants?"
"How has anyone ever dared to take risks with infant foods?"
"It is quite obvious that the Commission has a clear legal basis here for exercising its powers under Article 129 in the field of public health and Article 129a in the field of consumer protection."
"There is an important issue here for the IGC."
"The Commission must quickly bring forward proposals for setting up an independent 'public health protection' unit."
"We must support the introduction of codecision for agricultural matters."
"We must have a general ban on feeding meat-and-bone meal to ruminants or waste products from sick animals to other animals."
"Individual disciplinary measures must be taken where officials have acted incorrectly, Mr President of the Commission."
"Those responsible must be punished for their mistakes."
"The public must not be allowed to think that no sanctions are being taken."
"Our political position is this: we reject the motion of censure, and we reaffirm our confidence in the Commission to carry out the necessary reforms, but if they have not been carried out within a reasonable period and at the latest by November this year, we will be obliged to withdraw our confidence."
"Mr President of the Commission, we worked together in the Maastricht negotiations on a new Treaty on European Union, and even at that stage we identified certain inadequacies."
"We were forced to accept a compromise that we intended to improve at the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference."
"We have now reached a stage where many of our fellow citizens no longer believe in what we are doing at European level."
"Social problems, the despair that people feel when they are faced with unemployment and see no future for their children, the despair they feel in the face of international organized crime, the mafia, the drugs problems, and the despair they felt when their very health was put at risk, must make all those in positions of responsibility in the European Union who are currently preparing the new Treaty realize that not only must our decision-making procedures be changed - though this too is important - but we must also try to get to the very heart of the social problems that millions of people face and the fear they feel, and we must let them know what we are doing about it."
"I hope that the BSE tragedy has brought this home to all those responsible for giving the European Union a more hopeful and human face once again."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Union for Europe Group, I should also like to congratulate most sincerely the rapporteur of the Committee of Inquiry into BSE, Mr Medina Ortega, its chairman, Mr Böge, and all the members of the committee on the exceptional quality of their work, despite the numerous and unacceptable obstacles put in their way in carrying out this task."
"The report before the House today is well-documented, precise and objective, and does not confine itself to recording the serious failings on the part of the European institutions but, in a very responsible way, seeks to propose measures to remedy those failings and ensure that unacceptable bad habits do not persist."
"I would even say that the members of the committee have done more."
"After listening to Mr Santer, I feel they have achieved a miracle: the Commission was suffering from blindness, but suddenly it can see clearly what is going on in its departments."
"The committee's report nevertheless remains a crushing indictment of the functioning of the European institutions as a whole."
"The revelation of such widespread failings fully justifies the loss of confidence in the European institutions on the part of our citizens that we are witnessing today."
"The total and deliberate lack of transparency in the conduct of European affairs prevents the instruments of democratic control - Parliament and the press - from performing their function on a day-to-day basis."
"Furthermore, this lack of transparency allows national or private lobbies to prevail over the Community or general interest."
"These lobbies have virtually taken over some Commission departments, as well as the extraordinary advisory scientific committees, whose variable geometry is determined by the particular interests that are being pursued in them."
"More seriously still, the Committee of Inquiry's report reveals a de facto abdication of responsibilities by the Commission and, to a lesser extent, the Council: by the Commission, in its inability to resist the political pressure of certain Member States; and by the Council, in the effective delegation of powers to management committees with no political legitimacy."
"Consequently, from 1990 to 1994, the Commission carried out no veterinary checks whatsoever on the United Kingdom's measures to combat BSE, for the sole reason that it would have annoyed the authorities of that country."
"Lastly, the report reveals that, in the implementation of Community policies, there are grey areas in which the responsibility for taking action is poorly defined."
"This ultimately results in each institution passing the buck to the other institutions, or to the Member States, in a show of total incompetence."
"If we wish to restore the confidence of Europe's citizens in the Union's institutions, there is an urgent need to take action."
"Should this take the form of imposing a political sanction, through an immediate vote of censure on the present Commission - which undoubtedly bears some of the responsibility for the failures identified, although a much smaller share than the British authorities - or on the previous Commission, whose President we would have liked to give evidence to the Committee of Inquiry?"
"For my part, I believe that if we wish to be effective, we must enjoin the present Commission to take all the measures within its remit proposed by the Committee of Inquiry, as a matter of urgency."
"It is a question, above all, of establishing transparency in the decision-making process - something which is fundamental to all democratic activity."
"If the Commission does not do so within a reasonable period of time, then we must not hesitate to censure it."
"We should interpret the proposals for the reorganization of the Commission's services and for the reform of the consultation and inspection procedures, which Mr Santer has presented, as a sign of goodwill which will have to be confirmed."
"Over and above this, however, I believe that the report of the Committee of Inquiry should be forwarded to the Intergovernmental Conference, so that the representatives of the Member States can draw the necessary conclusions from it as regards the structure and functioning of the European institutions."
"In sensitive areas such as public health - and, in future, public security, if it is decided to bring the third pillar into the Community domain - is it not appropriate to make it absolutely clear who does what, so as to eliminate the grey areas which serve as a pretext for failing to take action when it is necessary?"
"Is it sensible to transfer powers and responsibilities without ensuring beforehand that the recipients of those powers and responsibilities are able to take them on?"
"Is it possible to guarantee that a Commission with 30 members will be capable of functioning in accordance with the principles of collective responsibility and independence from the Member States that are laid down in the Treaty?"
"The Member State governments that will soon be facing national elections, and the Members of the European Parliament who will be standing for election in 1999, will be judged by their answers to these questions."
"Let us take advantage of the coming months, ladies and gentlemen, to give a positive response to the concerns of our fellow citizens, which the BSE crisis has highlighted to an extraordinary degree."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, the report from the Committee of Inquiry is now been presented, and it is our responsibility to determine what consequences the report will have."
"We have already heard a response from the chairman of the Commission, Mr Santer, and I would like to refer back to this."
"In 1986 BSE was quite unknown."
"No one knew much about it, but it was thought to be similar in nature to scrapie in sheep, not infectious and not transferable to humans."
"This was at the start of the disease."
"But on 20 March 1996 the British Government admitted that it could not be ruled out that the disease could be transferred to humans."
"At the same time there emerged a new form of Creutzfeldt Jakob's disease which affected young men in particular."
"These announcements spread panic amongst consumers and the beef market collapsed."
"It is clear that consumers were nervous, since the disease - if it could be transferred - did not manifest itself for 3 to 7 years."
"The Commission was very hesitant in dealing with this, and Parliament was not satisfied."
"It was therefore decided, as a provisional solution, to set up this Committee of Inquiry to determine whether, on the basis of the Treaty, this new Committee could really serve the purpose of resolving those problems in the Commission which people felt were unresolved."
"On behalf of the Liberal Group I am able to say that the task has been resolved by the Committee."
"This has involved very intense, but justified, criticism of the Commission, about which more can be read in the report."
"There is also strong criticism of the British Government."
"Most of all it is difficult to understand how the British Government, which initially took the right decisions, allowed 5 years to pass before implementing them."
"This is why BSE was able to become so extensive, and why it was carried over to France, Switzerland and Portugal."
"But it is not we who elect the British Government; that is the responsibility of others."
"We are left with the question of how we are to protect consumers."
"I can say that our proposal to separate consumer protection and veterinary control is a right solution."
"I must say, however, that it is not so easy to implement because we come up against the principle of subsidiarity, and states tend to defend this jealously."
"But I am in favour of having a supranational body which can control the national authorities and inform them as to what the problems are."
"Finally we come to the question of confidence and loss of confidence."
"Parliament has shown that it is equal to the task of controlling the Commission."
"It also has power to assume the Commission's role if it feels that the latter is not fulfilling it correctly."
"The Committee's work shows that we have brought to the Commission a number of proposals which we expect it to examine and to resolve on the basis of the principles we have put forward."
"I can now state that the Commission is ready to go a considerable way, further than I had expected."
"Before the autumn comes we will see how far it is able to go in practice."
"Otherwise we have the weapon of article 141, namely that of bringing a vote of no confidence, preferably after the summer holidays, if the Commission does not live up to what it promised and to the wishes we have expressed."
"So I believe Parliament has been given significant powers, and these are being used, but they must be used sensibly."
"One must never misuse the significant powers one has been given."
"They must be used with care, and I believe that this is what will happen in the autumn if the Commission does not live up to its own formulations."
"Madam President, the members of our group have signed the motion of censure after reading the conclusions of the Committee of Inquiry."
"However, I can assure you - and I can assure the Commission - that we had no preconceptions with regard to this motion."
"The Medina report lays bare the serious political and administrative errors committed above all by the British Government, with the complicity of the Council, but also by the Commission, both in the days of Mr Delors and under the current presidency of Mr Santer."
"The report leaves no room for doubt."
"The way in which the Commission dealt with the serious BSE problem, which turned into a crisis with incalculable social, economic and health consequences, was disastrous."
"The Commission is charged with having put economic and political interests before the protection of public health and consumers."
"The previous Commission failed to ensure the necessary veterinary controls, and it is clear that absolutely no checks on BSE were carried out in the United Kingdom between May 1990 and June 1994."
"As for the present Commission, there is the unacceptable lifting of the embargo on gelatine, and its attempts to conceal the truth and shift its own responsibilities onto Parliament when the latter decided to carry out this inquiry."
"The fact that the Commission's mishandling of the crisis has had consequences for human health, cattle breeding and the Community budget which to a large extent can no longer be rectified is particularly grave."
"For all these reasons, we are fulfilling our difficult duty of tabling a motion of censure."
"The European Parliament must fulfil its obligations and exercise the powers of control conferred on it by the Treaty."
"The British Government is subject to the control of the House of Commons."
"The European Commission must answer to this Parliament - which has repeatedly called for increased powers, without having exercised successfully those it already has."
"The Committee of Inquiry's conclusions make clear the vital need for this motion of censure, which calls for the Commission to assume responsibility for the errors and omissions in its handling of the BSE crisis over a period of seven years, in accordance with the principle of the continuity and collegiate nature of the Commission, although the actions of the successive Agriculture Commissioners are particularly reprehensible."
"Today, we should be expressing political condemnation of acts committed in the past - the recent past - before putting forward recommendations for the future or giving such a favourable welcome to Mr Santer's statement, which was more like an optimistic speech of investiture."
"While recognizing the good intentions of those who are confusing the past and the future in their resolutions and threatening to table a motion of censure in a few months' time - in November, so they say - we profoundly disagree with their approach, which is not in keeping with the European Parliament's basic duty to exercise control, or with the priority of tabling an unconditional motion of censure, without any strings attached."
"In a democracy, the majority decides, but the minority may be in the right."
"Today, the rightness of our stance is based not only on proper parliamentary procedures or Parliament's unavoidable duties."
"Beyond opportunistic motives or party discipline, it is based on our position as Members of Parliament and defenders of the health and interests of the European citizens who elected us."
"I should like to end by adapting a traditional saying: ' Friends of Plato, but friends of the truth even more' ."
"The European Parliament must be a friend of the Commission, but a friend of the truth and Europe's citizens even more."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee of Inquiry has carried out its task."
"I should particularly like to thank the chairman, Mr Böge, and the rapporteur, Mr Medina, for the excellent work they have done."
"There was a good atmosphere in the Committee of Inquiry."
"Every effort was made to bring the truth to light, and this is also reflected in the report we have presented."
"When we began our work, we were almost speechless at what we encountered."
"You tell us, Mr Santer, that it could not be known at the time how dangerous this BSE disease was."
"If this was not known at the time, then no measures could have been taken, and we would have had to say: we do not know this, or we take a different view."
"But that did not happen."
"Measures were taken, but they were not implemented."
"The ban on feeding animal-based meal was ignored."
"What did happen?"
"Animal-based meal was used as feed up to 1995."
"One has to assume that all the mad cows went through the cycle of being fed animal-based meal, and 700 000, a million or one and half million animals at risk from BSE - we do not know how many - entered the human food chain."
"It was said to us: we had no powers to carry out inspections."
"It finally turned out that between 1990 and 1994, 37 inspections were carried out in the United Kingdom. However, BSE was removed from the check-list, in other words tests were carried out on meat quality in the United Kingdom, but no longer on BSE."
"It is quite clear that an inquiry report in 1990 revealing scandalous conditions in British slaughterhouses was deliberately mislaid in the Commission; it did not reach the political leadership."
"So far, we have not been able to establish where it went astray."
"Attempts have been made to discredit scientists, the opinions of minorities have been trivialized and the WTO has been used as a tool."
"I do not need to spell out the details once again."
"You have seen the report of the inquiry - and in any event, it is incredible."
"And all this justifies a vote of censure against the Commission."
"If we are saying that we do not wish to hold this vote of censure now, it also has to do with the fact that we know you are an expert when it comes to making announcements, Mr Santer!"
"You have made an excellent speech today, and it is somewhat difficult to send you packing after such a speech."
"But while we hear the message, what we lack is the belief."
"We want actions, not words."
"That is why there was quite a long and intense debate on this vote of censure in the Committee of Inquiry, and I then made a proposal to suspend the vote."
"It was thought that you might say today: this is of no interest to us."
"Then we would have tabled the motion of censure. The votes are here, and we have collected the necessary one tenth of Members' signatures."
"But it was clear to us that you would make these announcements today, so we are putting you on probation for a year, and we shall see what is produced by these demands."
"You have dealt with them today, and I have to say I am surprised at the generosity and also the determination with which you have announced reforms."
"If they come, there will not be a vote of censure in December, that is fairly clear."
"If they do not, then the vote of censure will be held."
"Make no mistake, Mr Santer - you cannot, as in the past, pick all the good things out of Parliament, do what suits you and file away the things that do not."
"Through this committee of inquiry, Parliament has gained a new degree of self-confidence."
"After BSE, nothing in Europe is the same."
"We shall have our say on issues of health, nutrition and agriculture."
"We shall no longer allow an arrogant administration - which is still in place and of which you are now the political leader, namely this Commission - to think that it does not need to take any account of the proposals and initiatives of the European Parliament."
"If Parliament's proposals had been implemented, if we had had a right of codecision when the mad cow problem was at its peak, then this BSE crisis would not have assumed such proportions."
"We should very probably not have had to deal in this way with the consequences which may lie ahead of us."
"So I would say that the point is definitely to use this crisis to move forward, to give the European Parliament the rights it needs in order to exercise legislative control over the administration and to ensure that the Commission moves in the right direction."
"I am particularly grateful to you, Mr Santer, for saying that we must embark on a fundamental overhaul of the agricultural policy."
"These have always been our demands."
"If we proceed in that way, we shall not experience another crisis, but benefit the people of Europe, do our job properly and assume our political responsibility."
"Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, when, despite strong resistance, Parliament decided to set up a committee of inquiry into this affair, I did not expect the facts revealed to be so serious."
"The final report, which is an excellent piece of work, is utterly damning."
"And I note that the comments made since the beginning of the debate this afternoon have all been extremely critical."
"What is to be done?"
"Will words be matched by deeds?"
"What can Parliament decide on this issue, which relates to human health and demonstrates the extent of the aberrations that can be produced by an economic system which puts profit above all other considerations?"
"More than other people, perhaps, I am strongly affected by these aberrations, since the similar - though less serious - tragedies which I had to face when I was France's Minister for Consumer Affairs, from 1981 to 1984, have left their mark on me."
"We should like to apply sanctions to those principally responsible, which - as the report makes clear - are the Council and certain national governments, first among them the British Government."
"Unfortunately, however, the Treaty provides us with no means of imposing sanctions on the government of a Member State."
"Nor do we have any power to bring civil or criminal actions against the presumed culprits."
"Only the victims or their families can do that."
"We do have a political means available, however, which is to adopt a motion of censure against the Commission, on the grounds that the report indicates that it too made serious mistakes."
"We are afraid of this high-profile and powerful weapon."
"So we are turning to the idea of a conditional or deferred motion of censure."
"Certainly, I endorse the recommendations put forward by Parliament with a view to improving the way in which the Commission is run."
"Let me point out, however, that the proposed approach of a qualified motion of censure goes both too far, and not far enough."
"It goes too far, in the sense that it will allow Parliament to pursue its recommendations to the extent of interfering in the Commission's areas of competence by leaving the constant threat of censure hanging over it."
"And it does not go far enough, in the sense that we fear that many of the advocates of this approach do not actually wish the motion of censure ever to be adopted."
"Furthermore, the qualified motion of censure only concerns the Commission's future conduct, and not its past actions."
"However, the report lays bare the Commission's past errors, including the incontestably bad organization of its departments."
"Moreover, Mr President of the Commission, the reforms that you have initiated - which are a step in the right direction and will be of help to the Commissioner responsible for consumer affairs - clearly demonstrate the extent to which the controls were badly organized."
"The report also reveals the damage caused within the Commission by this culture, by this productivity-driven approach geared solely to the market, in which the protection of consumer health is pushed into the background."
"Ultimately, Mr President of the Commission, it is because we wish to have strong European institutions that we also wish those institutions to be politically responsible."
"The two things are connected."
"Mr President, your admissions, your promises of reforms, your commitments are not enough."
"There is a need for a more powerful political gesture to exorcise past misdeeds."
"We believe that the Commission is not so fragile that it is in danger of being shattered by a political crisis."
"On the contrary, we are convinced that the Commission's authority, its credibility in the eyes of public opinion and its confidence will only be increased if it acknowledges its mistakes and fully assumes its responsibilities, including those relating to the period prior to the new team taking office."
"Clearly, this need to assume responsibilities applies equally to Parliament, which must adopt the motion of censure, since failing to do so would make it seem inconsistent."
"Madam President, I never, in the first instance, believed we needed a committee of inquiry."
"Unfortunately, what I have listened to today has proved that to be correct."
"I have listened to the debate and my worst fears have unfortunately been confirmed."
"No one can claim any glory from the present problem, not the United Kingdom Government and most certainly not Mr Hogg - I would not defend them for one moment - nor the Commission or the Council."
"Yes, mistakes were certainly made."
"We must learn from them and make sure they never occur again."
"We help no one - certainly not the consumer or the farmer - by further hyping the situation and making outlandish statements that are unprovable and are simply designed to get into the newspaper headlines."
"The benefit of hindsight is the most wonderful thing of all."
"We all can sit here today and be total experts and make no mistakes."
"I agree with the chairman of the committee when he said that we must bring BSE to an end once and for all."
"BSE must be wiped out but that will take time."
"We have seen other outbreaks in other countries recently."
"I would, like to address one point to Mr Santer, because he stated here today - and I think it is important that he made that statement - that he wants a better environment and higher standards of control in food."
"I agree with all that but will he ensure that the food imported to the European Union will be of the same high standards?"
"Will he also ensure that the farmers of the European Union do not have their hands tied behind their backs while others in the world are allowed to produce what we are not allowed to produce in the same way?"
"If you want high standards then make sure it is universal and right across the board."
"It is also unfortunate today that Mrs Green decided to turn this very important debate into party politics."
"I welcome her recognition of the high standards in Northern Ireland."
"I welcome the fact that she said that our farmers have been unfairly treated because they never should have had the ban placed on them in the first place."
"I have no doubt that Commissioner Fischler will take that very much to heart."
"I am not going to be parochial today but I am sure Mrs Green would not deny any small political party anywhere the right to achieve the best for all their people, would you Mrs Green?"
"Could I suggest further to Mrs Green that she takes another look at the figures because the figures I saw this morning showed that Mr Blair lost by 13 votes."
"Now there are nine Ulster Unionists in the House of Commons and maybe Mr Blair should have got all his as Labour members out if he wanted to win."
"Could I also say to Mrs Green, as a final point, that some of her former party leaders were also very generous to my party when they came along to have discussions with them."
"And I have no doubt that some day in the future they will be back again if the occasion arises."
"I thank you, Madam President, very much for your patience and I want to make it very clear that I will not, in any way, be supporting any motion of censure against the Commission."
"Madam President, after the death of more than 167 000 cattle - a veritable massacre, the infection of a further 800 000 cattle and their entry into the food chain, the suicide of more than 20 farmers, the death - their brains destroyed - of some 20 young people, after a six-month inquiry and two hours of debate, what stands out is the hypocrisy prevailing everywhere."
"And the explanation for this - perhaps the only one - is the belief in a Messiah which lies behind this whole affair."
"What do we see?"
"Hypocrisy across the board!"
"Hypocrisy, in the first place, with regard to the civil liability: after all, someone manufactured this meal!"
"It did not fall from the sky, as the representative of the British Government would have us believe."
"And that someone is the de Mulder brothers in the United Kingdom."
"No one talks about that - except perhaps Mr Medina Ortega, who says somewhere in his report that he has his doubts."
"And someone, or some people, imported this meal into France!"
"Again, they could have been traced from customs documents."
"We know their names - Caillot, Glon - but we do not talk about that."
"The British Government just stood by, it let things go, it allowed exports - it let people be poisoned!"
"And now compensation will be provided on the basis of solidarity, rather than responsibility."
"The British, pure as snow, will not have to pay - not even for their international responsibilities."
"But their hands are not clean."
"And there is hypocrisy with regard to the political responsibilities."
"You are not alone, Mr Santer, I will grant you that."
"Fortunately for you, you have accomplices - because if you did nothing, the Council did nothing either!"
"And the European Parliament: what did it do?"
"Mr Happart alerted it to the problem in a number of oral questions in the House."
"I myself said to Mr MacSharry in this House, on 11 September 1990, that there was a risk of a zoonosis, that the source of the infection would spread from the United Kingdom to the rest of Europe, and that there was a need to take preventive measures!"
"Parliament was aware of the problem."
"Mr Vasco Garcia drew up a report on the subject, and Parliament said and did nothing!"
"At the same time, the media remained silent for six years."
"The Castille note, which 'Libération' published in 1996, had appeared in the consumer magazine 'Que choisir?' as early as 1990."
"But what had they all got to hide?"
"What were they covering up?"
"Why, Mrs Bonino, as they say in Italy, the 'omerta' ?"
"The explanation is the belief in a Messiah!"
"The obscurantist Euro-federalist sect is like the Jehovah's Witnesses."
"Young people die of new variant CJD, and there is silence."
"There was silence between 1990 and 1994 because the Messiah - the single market, the Maastricht Treaty - was coming."
"But if in 1992, the people of France had known that cattle were being fed the remains of sheep that had eaten the remains of infected cattle, the French President could have bleated all he liked about his prostate: the Maastricht Treaty would never have been ratified in the referendum of 20 September 1992!"
"That is what they were protecting."
"And what are they protecting today?"
"I listened to your speech, Mr Martens. You have a prodigious talent, but what do you use it for?"
"You suggested that we should remain silent once again, because this time it is the single currency which is at stake!"
"So poisoning was allowed in the name of the single market and the Maastricht Treaty, and now it is continuing to be allowed in the name of the single currency!"
"Mr Santer donned a penitent's robe with a cord of British leather."
"He came shuffling his feet."
"He humbly begged our forgiveness, it is true - but then there is the question of genetically modified maize."
"He forgot to wear his penitent's robe then."
"Nothing has been learnt from the BSE tragedy."
"The same mistakes are still being made."
"Adopting the motion of censure is the least that we can do."
"What is now at stake, ladies and gentlemen, is the credibility, the legitimacy, of the European Parliament."
"If you refuse to understand that, you will, like all members of religious sects, create a rod for your own backs."
"I have received eight motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 40(5)."
"Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, on 16 July 1996, in response to a request from Parliament, Mr Santer made a statement on behalf of the Commission on the BSE affair."
"He attempted to calm things down, although we were confronted with evidence that certain Commission departments had pursued a deliberate policy of disinformation and concealment, during the time of both the previous and present Agriculture Commissioners."
"It is true that Mr Santer declared unequivocally in his statement that the protection of human health was the Commission's paramount concern."
"In fact, however, it took Parliament's painstaking inquiry to force the Commission to take action."
"Mr Santer said in his statement, as he is saying now, that he wished to involve himself personally in this matter."
"I sincerely hope that he is successful, but we should not attempt to conceal the profound lack of confidence that has taken root in this Parliament, as well as amongst the general public, in the Commission's ability to turn things round."
"The Committee of Inquiry's report reveals maladministration on a breathtaking scale by the main players in this affair - the British Government, the Commission, and also the Council."
"Reading it should be widely recommended, as a kind of civic instruction manual for the future citizens of Europe."
"It strikingly illustrates the fact that the single market - whose praises we sing - can produce the worst excesses if the market is allowed to regulate itself and the rules on health and consumer protection are not applied."
"I should like to draw four conclusions from this inquiry and report."
"Firstly, the very existence of this document is an inescapable fact for the Commission, as well as for the Council and the British Government."
"It should be made very clear to the general public that the European Parliament's right of inquiry, and the way in which it has exercised that right, represent a step forward for democracy in Europe."
"It demonstrates that impenetrable European and national bureaucracies can be forced to become more transparent."
"It demonstrates that the elected representatives of the European people can make the truth prevail in the face of compartmentalized and arrogant administrations."
"Secondly, we should not try to conceal the terrifying truth that emerges from this report."
"The pursuit of profit and the logic of economics have prevailed, to the detriment of consumer health, because the main political actors - the British Government, the Commission and the Council - wished it to be that way."
"Overcoming this philosophy will be extremely difficult."
"You will need a great deal of energy and willpower to do this, Mr Santer."
"Above all, you will need the support of those European political forces which do not talk solely in terms of profit, deregulation and liberalization, but which wish to see a prosperous Europe in which human and natural values are respected."
"Thirdly, a number of Members are seizing on the BSE crisis in an attempt to discredit the Europe of the Maastricht Treaty."
"From the far left to the far right, there are many people who wish to take advantage of this affair to push Europe into a crisis that will permanently weaken it and give rise to the widespread re-emergence of nationalism, the ending of the process of economic and political integration and, ultimately, new confrontations between the countries of Europe, weakening it for good."
"The Socialist Group will not join in this game."
"It will not support the motion of censure, because it embodies the very opposite of a desire for reform."
"We wish to give Mr Santer and the Commission, and the Council too, an opportunity to put their house in order."
"In a few months, we shall be able to assess the changes which they will have set in motion."
"Fourthly, the general public is clearly entitled to ask how Parliament intends to follow up the report of the Committee of Inquiry."
"In other words, what means does Parliament have available of bringing pressure to bear on those principally responsible?"
"As regards the Member States' governments, it is of course up to the national parliaments to assume their responsibilities."
"But the Member States must also stop protecting senior European officials who were appointed from their national administrations."
"If the head of the Commission is unable to take the action he thinks fit in respect of these officials, in the interest of the Community, then it will never be possible to establish a different culture."
"Mr President of the Commission, I personally am confident of your success."
"I am not sure whether it is enough that are you are personally bringing all your weight to bear on this issue."
"You must also have strong allies within the Commission."
"We can only hope that the President of the Commission is successful. If he is not, he will emerge discredited and weakened, with his powers diminished."
"No one wishes to see that."
"So go ahead, Mr Santer!"
"Do not hesitate to be ruthless this time!"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, what we are discussing today is not just another of those political and technical problems, some important and some less so, that normally occupy us, but a matter which has almost certainly cost the lives of 16 people to date and has plunged the single market into the deepest crisis it has faced since the day it was first set up."
"In the light of that, what matters is not political tactics or defending one's own party: what matters is the need to do everything possible to ascertain the truth and prevent any possible repetition of these events, and here we must be guided first and foremost by our own consciences."
"That was the principle which motivated the work of the Committee of Inquiry, and the results presented to Parliament today bear witness to that."
"The basic conclusion which I am sorry to have to draw from those results is that both the United Kingdom and the Commission and Council of the European Union, which bear the main responsibility for what has happened, have in essence attached more importance to commercial interests than to the protection of animal health and, above all, human health."
"What we have learned makes it absolutely obvious that a radical change is needed in the way such crises are handled."
"As far as the United Kingdom is concerned, it is only recently that there have been positive signs of this change occurring; now it is the turn of the European Union."
"We need to see a structural change in the internal organization of the competent Directorates-General: we therefore welcome the plan to create a single unit for the protection of public health which will undertake the functions previously entrusted to various administrative personnel, between whom there was absolutely no coordination."
"In addition, the powers of the veterinary inspectorate must be increased, guaranteeing it what it has certainly lacked previously, which is a stable function and adequate independence."
"Similarly, scientific research must be stepped up into BSE and into the variant of Creutzfeld-Jacob disease, something on which the European Union has hitherto spent very little."
"I also hope that an immediate start will be made on a complete review of the comitology, involving the Intergovernmental Conference where necessary."
"This will allow matters to be handled less secretively and more efficiently in future, which is essential if the citizens of Europe are to regain confidence in their institutions."
"Finally, to relieve some of the pressure on the beef and veal market and do something tangible to set consumers' minds at rest, everything necessary should be done immediately to introduce compulsory labelling enabling everyone to identify the origin and quality of the beef or veal he is buying."
"All the initiatives I have called for here are included in the reforms promised today by the President of the Commission, and that gives us cause for optimism."
"However, I now come to consider more specifically what emerges from the report regarding the responsibility of the European Commission, and it is clear that the Commission was unable, or worse still unwilling, to act sufficiently quickly to deal with this crisis."
"Although it is true that we cannot censure the Commission that is now in office, because it bears only part of the responsibility, most of which lies with the previous Commission, it is equally true that we can nevertheless require the Commissioners, subject to a very precise time limit, to adopt a policy of reform and rectification, unless it wishes to share the responsibility of its predecessors and of those others, headed by the United Kingdom, responsible for the general mismanagement of this crisis."
"In calling upon the European Commission to follow the lines recommended by the Committee of Inquiry, with the threat of censure if it fails to conform to those recommendations, our intention is not to discredit the Community system but, rather, to strengthen it."
"After all, a Commission and Council that are more transparent, more attentive to the needs and protection of the public, and freer of the pressures exerted by lobbyists and national governments, together with a European Parliament exercising democratic vigilance over the actions of the other institutions, cannot fail to provide the sound basis that we want Europe to have."
"Madam President, anyone rising to speak after two hours of debate obviously has a problem in finding anything new to say."
"I shall try to find something new, by expressing a regret felt, I believe, not only by myself but also by many other members of the Committee of Inquiry - a regret that we did not hear the person who might perhaps have been the best witness to, and was a participant in, the events of the recent and more distant past."
"I refer to the former President of the Commission, Jacques Delors, whom some of us would have liked to question."
"The proposal to call him was put to the vote, and those of us, myself included, who were in favour lost by the narrow margin of seven votes to six."
"I believe that many clarifications that we would like to have today, for which we are asking the present Commission, could have been obtained from that dominant figure, and that the decision not to involve him was probably prompted by an excess of respect."
"Speaking at this late stage, now that the questions of responsibility have been clarified and the history of this affair outlined, I have the opportunity to look directly to the future and put forward a number of concrete proposals."
"So I shall begin by asking the President of the Commission to apply Article 169 of the Treaty, whereby the Commission over which he presides may call upon the United Kingdom to make some form of reparation - not merely moral reparation, I hope - to Europe's citizens as an appropriate penalty for the harm caused to the other Member States."
"And I also call upon him to draw the attention of Europe's citizens to the content of Article 215 of the Treaty, which tells them how to take action against the European Commission and the other institutions to obtain compensation for damage they believe they have suffered because of the malfunctioning of the European institutions."
"I believe that if the Commission were to take this action it might make it clear to the public that there is a desire to make good the damage caused."
"I believe, ultimately, that although there are some who want to see heads roll immediately, there are many who would be more interested in seeing proposals in place that might remedy the damage."
"The result of this would be a more appropriate and controlled application of Article 175, by the terms of which the European Parliament can bring an action against the Commission for its failure to act and indeed may do so precisely because the Commission has not invoked Article 169."
"None of this, clearly, rules out - I have specifically clarified this with the Legal Service - the possibility of applying Article 144."
"We in the UPE Group are in favour of the deferred censure, partly because of practical considerations."
"As has already been pointed out several times in this House today, dismissing the Commission would, among other things, prevent it from taking immediate and concrete action to implement the conclusions of Mr Medina Ortega's report."
"We would like to see immediate action, and we cannot help wondering how that could be achieved in the absence of an operational Commission."
"At this point I turn to look the Commissioner, Mrs Bonino, straight in the eye."
"Public health: the burden will be yours, and I do not envy you your task!"
"I call upon the European institutions to have the courage to approach the crucial subject of safeguarding the health of the public, with resolution and with all the available scientific data."
"Their first task will be to try to answer a fundamental question: what causal relationship is there today between BSE and the old and new forms of Creutzfeld-Jacob disease?"
"At the outset of the inquiry, some six months ago, the answer offered by the scientists seemed to be a macabre echo of Pontius Pilate: ' There is no reliable scientific proof of the existence of transmissibility to man, but nor is there any proof to the contrary.'"
"Good, or rather bad!"
"After six months of effort, the testimony given by a handle of courageous scientists enables us to rewrite that verdict, more or less as follows: ' There is no reliable evidence that the old form of Creutzfeld-Jacob disease derives from the BSE epidemic, but suspicion is growing, in the light of evidence of vertical and horizontal transmission between animal species.'"
"That suspicion is growing, especially, with regard to the new form of the disease, which has taken fifteen human lives within a few months - fourteen in the United Kingdom and one in France."
"Just a statistical freak?"
"I can't believe that!"
"Similarly, our doubts increase if we look at the older statistics."
"In the last five years, in the European Union, there have been 302 cases of death caused by the 'old form' of this disease in the United Kingdom alone, as against a Community average of 30-50 cases."
"Another coincidence?"
"Once again, I do not think it is just a case of misleading statistics."
"So this research is needed urgently, and that consideration will be in our minds as we vote tomorrow."
"We will vote for a 'soft' censure, or else the day after tomorrow, on Thursday, we will vote for a censure involving immediate resignations."
"Let me remind you that, whatever our decision may be, we must be aware that the choices of the European public will depend upon it for at least 15 years."
"Because, Mr President, that is the grim length of time which the scientists have said will be necessary to verify the effects of the possible spread of BSE, through Creutzfeld-Jacob disease, to thousands and thousands of European citizens - not just the British!"
"Madam President, I am absolutely sure that an immediate vote of no confidence against the existing Commission would be absolutely wrong."
"It would be futile in that the culprits are elsewhere and go further back in time."
"Having said that, and having heard the President of the Commission's speech today, if that is ruled out and the things that have been demanded in this report are performed upon, then that judgement on this Commission should be left to another time."
"If this Parliament decides to go for the soft option we have to follow through if those targets that we set are not actually met."
"One of the things that has struck me particularly during this hearing is the situation between 1990 and 1994 when the BSE crisis was at its height."
"The UK Government passed the correct legislation in good faith but then failed to make sure that it was implemented properly."
"In addition the Commission failed to check that those particular regulations were being implemented."
"It is indeed ironical that while inspections were taking place throughout countries outside the European Union to make sure that the imported products were in order we had a major problem and a major health risk in our own animals here in the European Union."
"One of the other things that has particularly suffered is the credibility of government."
"In the United Kingdom we had assurances from scientists for many many years who said there was no risk to human health and then that was overturned very suddenly."
"There was also supposed to be no risk of maternal transmission and yet that was changed and what we have now is a lack of confidence among consumers and the population generally about what the government is telling us and the scientific evidence we are being given publicly."
"I am particularly concerned that Douglas Hogg did not come to the Committee to give his opinions."
"That was a sign which was interpreted by my own constituents as being cowardly."
"He was seen as not representing the views of the British Government sufficiently and as saying 'I am guilty' by implication."
"I am concerned that there is still under-reporting elsewhere in the European Union and we have to make sure that this is seen as a European problem and not just a British one."
"Madam President, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Medina, the committee chairman, Mr Böge, and all those colleagues with whom I had the pleasure of sharing many hours of hard work in the Committee of Inquiry into BSE."
"Mr Santer, the seriousness of the Commission's failings in its handling of the BSE affair, and the risks to public health which they produced, are clearly demonstrated by the Committee of Inquiry's report."
"The Commission neglected its legislative and monitoring duties during much of the period in which the disease was developing, placing political and economic interests before the protection of public health and giving rise to serious human, social and economic consequences."
"Moreover, in their appearances before the Committee of Inquiry, the Commission's representatives sometimes acted in bad faith, concealing information and often preventing the committee from carrying out its work effectively."
"The fact that the Commission even attempted to shift its responsibilities to Parliament is extremely serious."
"Mr Santer will recall his appearance before the committee and the series of exchanges that we had with him concerning Parliament's supposed denial of funds for research."
"The Commission is a collective body, and the principle of continuity within the institutions makes it responsible for all its actions, regardless of the particular composition of the College of Commissioners."
"It is argued that not all Commissioners bear the same degree of responsibility, but the collegiate nature of the Commission makes its responsibility a collective one."
"As part of the institutional framework, the European Parliament must call for responsibilities to be assumed, and if Members read the Committee of Inquiry's report carefully, they will have no doubts about calling on the Commission to assume its political responsibilities in full."
"The fact is that the extent of the committee's recommendations was made necessary by the scale of the responsibilities incurred by the Commission, the Council and, of course, the British Government."
"Only part of Mr Santer's speech referred to the committee's recommendations."
"However, I should like to ask Mr Santer a question before the House: why now, at the last moment, these measures, these administrative changes, this desire for transparency and improvements?"
"Why now, Mr Santer, given the seriousness of the BSE affair?"
"I have absolutely no doubt that the conclusions of the Committee of Inquiry, as well as the threat of a vote of censure, have forced the Commission into presenting these proposals now."
"I have no wish to call into question the good intentions of the majority in the House, which wishes to introduce the new procedure of a suspended and conditional vote of censure."
"But while my group offers to cooperate fully in ensuring that the committee's recommendations are implemented, I should like to draw attention to certain factors that are inherent in a motion of censure."
"A motion of censure can be tabled to call for responsibilities to be assumed that were incurred in the past."
"The effects of the mishandling of the BSE crisis are irreversible, and the seriousness of the Commission's failings in its handling of the affair, and the risks to public health to which they gave rise, are clearly demonstrated by the Committee of Inquiry's report."
"I believe that this is the fundamental question, therefore."
"In my view, any other course of action by Parliament will side-step the issue of calling for responsibilities to be assumed for what happened in the past in relation to BSE."
"The Commission must fulfil its role, but not under the threat of a vote of censure or any other means of coercion."
"Moreover, I do not believe that it is Parliament's role to exert this kind of pressure."
"With regard to this matter, Parliament must not engage in considerations of political expediency."
"If we fall into that trap, we shall be guilty of the same sort of behaviour for which the Commission is being criticized."
"In the face of such serious responsibilities, I believe that the only instrument of control available to Parliament is a vote of censure."
"That is why my group supported the tabling of a censure motion."
"Mr Santer, you made a slip, at the end of your speech, when you said that the time had come to create a Europe of health."
"This highlights, to my mind, in the clearest and most basic terms, the issue that we are debating today: the fact that the protection of public health and of consumers is a fundamental principle of European integration should never have been called into question."
"Consequently, Mr Santer, I consider that the Commission should now perform an act of dignifying European political life by submitting its resignation."
"If it submits its resignation and, tomorrow, the Council..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Madam President, on a point of order."
"I thought this House should know that just a few minutes ago in the House of Commons the British Prime Minister John Major, in answer to a question about the report from the Committee of Inquiry which we are discussing this afternoon, referred to it as 'a load of tosh' ."
"For those of you who do not know that word it means complete and utter rubbish."
"So the British Prime Minister considers the report we are discussing this afternoon to be a load of rubbish."
"When Mr Nicholson accuses me of making this partypolitical, perhaps everybody can now understand why."
"Let me avoid using an agricultural expression, since this word rubbish refers to our specific findings. One of the expectations of the European public is indeed that we should make progress with the major goals of European integration, but another is that, where necessary, we should take our pitchfork and clear out the stable."
"That is what is involved here, not least as regards the detail."
"Madam President, in view of the comments which have just been quoted, one can only hope that the Prime Minister's political career will one day be buried underneath this rubbish."
"You have asked here today, Mr Santer, where we would be if common sense had prevailed in the past."
"Certainly, we would be living in a more democratic, more social and more ecological Europe, instead of in an uncontrolled market and under the rule of technocrats."
"However, it is not the task of the European Parliament to bid a sad farewell to common sense, but to demand it and to exact retribution when it is ignored."
"Did it really take you 16 deaths and 23 suicides among ruined farmers in the UK, Mr Santer?"
"Did it really take you the necessary, but nonetheless barbaric destruction of more than a million cattle?"
"Did it really take you the amount of ECU 10 billion in compensation to realize that there was a lack of common sense in the EU's policy, to discover the need to control economic interests through that policy and to safeguard human dignity?"
"But common sense has not simply ceased to prevail in Europe - people in positions of responsibility have stopped behaving sensibly."
"The Commission too has given economic interests and political considerations priority over common sense."
"Who forced the Commission, Mr Santer, against all common sense - and here I quote from the report - to play down the problem of BSE from the outset; to give the beef market priority over human health; to pursue a policy of disinformation which ultimately interfered with the Community's ability to legislate; to ignore the warning voices of scientists; to have blind faith in industry lobbyists?"
"Who forced the Commission into inefficiency, political weakness, and a policy of concealment and obstruction towards Parliament?"
"Perhaps it is the fact that, in its heart of hearts, the Commission also believes in and has committed itself to an aggressive neo-liberal ideology."
"Is it not true to say that this dominance of economic interests over common sense and human dignity extends across the whole agricultural sector?"
"Do we not see the same attitude in the brutal imposition of the convergence criteria for entry into monetary union, with its acceptance of escalating unemployment figures, growing poverty and social crises?"
"Do we not see the same attitude in the Commission's decision to authorize genetically engineered maize, with the same disregard for warning voices and the same subservience to industry?"
"Do we not see the same attitude in the role played by the Commission at the Intergovernmental Conference, where it has not put forward dynamic proposals on the comprehensive democratization of the EU, the development of a social area in Europe and an ecological alliance?"
"Make no mistake about it, Mr Santer. If the Greens are proposing a qualified motion of censure today, it is not because the Commission does not deserve to be censured, but because there was no prospect of us securing the necessary majority, because the failure of such a motion would have been portrayed by you as an acquittal, and because through a qualified motion of censure, we see a slight chance of opening the door for the return of common sense, after its period of exile from the European Union."
"Madam President, as well as being highly damning of the UK authorities and the Council, this report also proves that, through its failure to act and its negligence, the Commission played along with the ultra-liberal system which is at the root of this crisis, without regard for animal or human health."
"People have died in this affair, but we do not have the courage to make legitimate use of our powers with an immediate vote of censure!"
"How many more cattle will have to be slaughtered, how many more deaths will there have to be, for some of our colleagues to stop regarding - with unacceptable contempt - the immediate tabling of a motion of censure as mere posturing?"
"Let us not confuse the past and the future."
"There is no point in shilly-shallying with a delayed-action motion."
"What is done is done."
"Let us come to the House on Thursday to censure the Commission unequivocally, by virtue of its continuity as an institution, and in spite of the pressure that is being brought to bear on some Members."
"Let us not disappoint the European citizens in our countries, regions and constituencies, whom we represent."
"They are expecting us to defend them with courage and determination."
"Let us not give them further cause to doubt the political establishment."
"They must be able to believe in us, so that they continue to believe in Europe."
"Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, a few hours before the vote on the motion of censure, my personal opinion today - harking back to Mr Castille's personal opinion, to which you referred last July - will be a positive one."
"Cast your mind back, Mr President."
"On 16 July 1996, in view of the information that he had in his possession, Mr de Villiers threatened to table a motion of censure if a committee of inquiry was not set up."
"That same day, despite numerous reservations on the part of some colleagues, the decision to establish a temporary committee of inquiry into the handling of the BSE crisis was taken."
"Today, now that its work has been completed, what conclusions can be drawn?"
"Undoubtedly, Mr President, the Commission made some serious mistakes in its handling of the BSE affair."
"It consistently favoured the internal market."
"It consistently neglected consumer health."
"It also discredited the breeders, who were justifiably proud of their stock, and condemned European taxpayers to spending considerable sums of money which could have been better used in other, job-creating, sectors."
"And when I say that the Commission made some serious mistakes, I am of course thinking of both Commissions: the one headed by Jacques Delors, and your own."
"Mr Medina Ortega's report is undoubtedly damning for the Delors Commission, but I would also point out that, at the beginning of June 1996, you yourself authorized the lifting of the embargo on gelatine."
"When I questioned you at your hearing, Mr President, you stated, and I quote: ' The decision of 10 June to lift the embargo on gelatine was taken subject to certain conditions' ."
"In that case, Mr President, why was the fact concealed from the Committee of Inquiry that the lifting of the gelatine embargo made it possible to authorize the export of British food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical products containing gelatine?"
"Why did I have to wait for press reports to inform me of the results of the Commission's meeting of 8 May?"
"Why did the representatives of the Commission's services deliberately attempt to conceal the facts from the Committee of Inquiry by passing the buck back and forth as the hearings progressed?"
"One might think that the man in charge was not bold enough to dismiss those who were not fulfilling their duties."
"For the future, Mr President, are you able to assure us that the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products in London has carried out an assessment of the risk of transmission of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease through pharmaceutical products such as vaccines, and that the results of its research will be published?"
"Can you tell us if the Commission intends to implement measures involving the destruction of high-risk or contaminated products?"
"As regards the Committee of Inquiry's conclusions, I should like to put Members on their guard against the attempts of some people to take advantage of this institutional crisis to do harm to the common agricultural policy."
"Some people are already calling on the Commission to support their bid to obtain codecision powers in agriculture at the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Finally, Mr President, you will have noticed that the very large majority of our group had the courage to sign the motion of censure."
"It goes without saying that we shall be voting in favour of it - an act which, until proved otherwise, amounts to a major show of political responsibility."
"I hope that our responsibility will be matched by yours."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Alleanza Nazionale delegation fully endorses the conclusions reached by our Committee of Inquiry."
"There is no doubt, after all, that the Commission underestimated the seriousness of the epidemic, gave precedence to commercial interests over the protection of public health, failed to ensure that the interests of Europe as a whole took priority over the specific interests of Britain, and mishandled the conclusions of the expert reports and scientific opinions, failing to translate them into the appropriate and obvious political decisions."
"We should remember that the Commission, despite various alarm signals and questions - I recall one by Mr Muscardini from 1994 - was unwilling or unable to provide detailed information on the market in bone-meals, at the very time when those meals were being identified as the pathogenic agent of BSE; it was unwilling or unable to relate the information and warnings coming from the European press, among other sources, to the possible connections between the disease affecting cattle and the transmissibility of that disease to man; its handling of relations with the British political and health authorities was suspect to say the least, perhaps even; it proved excessively vulnerable to pressure exerted by the manufacturers of bone-meals and companies operating in the beef and veal industry."
"But this relates to the past acts of the Commission, and only the learned authors of the Maastricht treaty could do worse than this Commission."
"The worrying thing is that these negligent attitudes, in spite of the verbal assurances from the new Commissioners of their complete availability have been repeated at least in the behaviour of some of the Commission's officials and services, who have supplied only some of the documents requested and have given testimony designed more to defend the personal positions of their colleagues than to help uncover the truth."
"Ladies and gentlemen, in this predicament what is at stake is our credibility - the credibility of a European Parliament whose prerogatives, powers and representative status are unknown to the European public, or at least not seen by the public in their true light."
"If the present Commission - which clearly has no political responsibility for the acts charged against the previous Commissioners - were to fail to censure, in decisive terms, those of its officials who have not only committed culpable and criminal errors in the past but are still, even today, persisting in a conspiratorial and perverted attitude, then this House would suffer grievously in the eyes of European public opinion."
"The Alleanza Nazionale delegation, then, condemns the performance of the previous Commission, considers that a motion of censure against the present Commission would be inappropriate and excessive, but proposes that the European Parliament should - if the Commission disregards the content of the Medina Ortega report - set in motion a whole series of measures, including obstructive measures, designed to block and scale down the prerogatives of the Commission in the field of Community legislation."
"Mr President, the media have often referred to the subject of today's debate as the 'mad cow business' ."
"If it is a business, I must say it has been a very ugly business."
"I believe it will be very much your responsibility, President Santer, to explain to us today whether this ugly business can become a good opportunity for the future of the Commission."
"More than many other debates, which are often comprehensible only to the initiated, dealing with pillars and harmonizations, today's debate is an acid test of our willingness to voice the concerns of the European public."
"I believe it depends on you, President Santer."
"I am well aware that the greater responsibility lies with the former Commissioners, but the fact remains that you represent an institution whose essence is its continuity, and its duty today, first and foremost, with all due solemnity, is to undertake a serious and self-critical analysis of its conduct in the BSE affair."
"I take due note of the fact that today, for the first time, you have referred to 'errors' including errors in the Commission's conduct."
"That, however, is the necessary condition to give credibility to proposals for the future and the new undertakings which you have given, and for sending that clear message that European public opinion is waiting for."
"I am one of those who value some of your decisions regarding the future."
"They may be seen as steps in the right direction. But I do have two serious doubts."
"The first is that transferring the controls and committees to DG XXIV does not solve all the problems because it leaves the examination of legislation with DG VI and DG III."
"It is therefore likely to prove to be merely a partial adjustment, not the radical change that it should be - a change which, incidentally, should in terms of strict logic have taken place some years ago, on the basis of normal principles of proper administration."
"The point is, in essence, that we must know not only who processes the opinions but who commissions them and what use they make of them after they have been obtained."
"My second doubt is that the idea of groups of Commissioners for human health or the creation of super-Commissioners, however much they are personally appreciated, would not make a great deal of difference."
"We need strong political direction of the Commission as a whole."
"President Santer, that is a task for you, and for you only!"
"After that, you are free to organize things as you see fit."
"The important thing is that you should take political responsibility for what is your task."
"It is the continuing impartiality of the Commission, as such, which must be guaranteed."
"The handling of BSE under both your predecessor's and now your own leadership, at least as regards the lifting of the gelatin embargo, has shown how fragile that impartiality - which is enshrined in the Treaty - really is, and the extent to which it yielded to political pressure exerted by the British Conservative Government, in the name of that Realpolitik of power relationships which, when you meet at the Breydel, should be kept strictly outside the doors."
"Those who oppose the censure motion are right to fear the danger that, by dealing a blow to the Commission, the symbol of supranationality, they will give too much free rein to the national governments, which are incapable of cooperating among themselves."
"We on the Committee of Inquiry know something about this - a British minister felt that we were not worthy to meet with him."
"But this argument does hold water if the Commission demonstrates every day that it is supranational, especially regarding those fundamental questions on which no concessions can be made."
"Otherwise, it is we who will become the Eurosceptics."
"Why keep all this apparatus in being if the Community technocracy is going to yield whenever it wants a quiet life?"
"Mr Medina Ortega's excellent report has highlighted the fact that the greatest responsibility lies with the government of the United Kingdom."
"Recently, John Major thought he could teach a lesson to this old Europe of ours by pointing out the superiority of his own country's social model."
"It was sufficient to remind him of this ugly business of BSE to show him how much his social model costs."
"This was chance happening, but the result of unbridled deregulation which has drastically impoverished the public, veterinary and health services."
"But the Commission too has failed in its duty, and that is a serious matter, Mr President."
"I cannot see that the Commission's responsibility for its acts is greatly mitigated by the stubbornness of the British."
"That is why I consider it impossible to reconcile the desire to defend the virtues of the acts of your former and present colleagues while at the same time announcing credible adjustments and changes."
"We cannot wait; BSE is not the only issue."
"There is the whole subject of transgenic plants - soya and maize."
"The fact that one of your Commissioners, President Santer, has denounced hasty decisions cannot set the European consumer's mind at rest."
"Not only that, but there is the whole business of the Common Agricultural Policy, There is the problem of Parliament's right of codecision."
"But problem number one is the problem of decision."
"Too many declarations by Commissioner Fischler, too few decisions consistent with those declarations."
"Impressive documents, from Madrid to Cork, but once again no action to follow."
"Instead, when it comes to the facts, I have a feeling that reverse gear may already have been engaged."
"So there is a need for clarity."
"Unless the whole arsenal of market politics is reduced, it will be difficult to concentrate on other priorities such as the environment and the safeguarding of consumer health."
"Subsidiarity is not valid."
"If you try to keep everything alive artificially there is a danger that you will kill off the old without creating the new."
"I should like to offer my congratulations to my friend and colleague Mr Medina Ortega for his report."
"It constitutes proof of the fact that the European Parliament has been able to combine democratic representation with efficient operation."
"Now it is up to this Parliament, as a whole, to make use of its legitimate supervisory powers to ensure that the work done by the Committee of Inquiry is something more than a handsome but futile gesture!"
"Mr President, first I should like to thank Mr Böge for the very competent way that he chaired the many meetings of the committee."
"I would also like to thank Mr Medina Ortega for reflecting in his report the many views that were put forward by members of the committee, many of which we have heard repeated ad infinitum during the course of the day."
"I have to take issue with many of the points that have been made."
"Unfortunately, because of personal reasons, I was not present at the final vote."
"The chairman understood my position."
"I would have voted against the report had I been there."
"I have submitted a minority report which sets out the chronology of the action taken in the United Kingdom since 1986."
"To do this, having been a member of the committee, would not normally be my style."
"Indeed, as many members will accept, I tried to convince by argument and amendment within the committee."
"However, at the end of the day I was confronted with a text which was so blinkered in its approach, so faulty in its assertions and, it has to be said, so unfair in its criticism of the efforts that were made in my country at all levels to combat BSE that I felt I had to put the record straight."
"I cannot summarize that report now because there is not enough time but I wish to make one or two points."
"At the outset I declare an interest."
"I speak as a farmer whose cattle herd has suffered from BSE."
"I have, therefore, witnessed personally the action programme and the dedication of the scientists and veterinarians in trying to get this problem and the measures taken to try to control it fully understood."
"One recognizes of course the overriding factor of human health."
"From 1989 to 1990 the measures that were taken in my country were designed to protect human health."
"It should be emphasized again and again that no scientist has yet been able to establish a conclusive link between BSE and the new variant of CJD."
"The report recognizes the amount of money spent on research."
"Mr Medina referred to this."
"There is also the related research and the amount of money put in for the Meat Hygiene Service."
"More has to be done, as Mr Santer himself accepted, in this whole field of research."
"However, the assertion that obstacles were put in the path of scientists is certainly not supported by the evidence that I heard and to suggest that nothing or too little was being done to eliminate the problem from our farms, is an insult to our farmers."
"It is a slur on the professional integrity of all those involved in the eradication programme."
"So the idea that there has been sort of British conspiracy within the Commission is utterly fanciful and unworthy of a report of this House."
"Never in the history of agriculture - and I have been there for quite a long time - have so many healthy animals been destroyed and in such a short period of time."
"A further cull, as we know, is on the way and this clears the way for the five points that were agreed at Florence."
"From this committee's work, the public was entitled to expect establishment of the facts and acknowledgement of the efficacy of the measures taken."
"Criticism of past mistakes is certainly important."
"We can all benefit from that in the sense that we recognize its importance."
"But I regret that not more members of the committee felt able to visit Britain to witness the level of progress and the achievements which have been made over the last ten months."
"Those who came were positively influenced by the measures they saw in operation."
"Today I welcome the proposal that has been made by the President of the Commission to hold an inter-disciplinary conference so that consumers can look forward with confidence to the quality standards we all want to achieve and to a Europe devoted to health."
"Mr President, concern for public health must the overriding consideration for everybody associated with the food industry."
"In this regard the role of farmers and processors is crucial."
"The role of legislators and their enactment and enforcement of food and public health regulations are also central to a safe food industry."
"The BSE crisis is a disaster for both consumers and producers alike."
"Consumer confidence in beef is at an all-time low, and consumers expect and deserve better from us."
"The Committee of Inquiry has made an important contribution to the debate and in this regard we must congratulate the rapporteur, the chairman and the members of the committee."
"My colleagues, in my group from Ireland, will not be voting in support of the censure on the Commission."
"However, while I agree with the general thrust of the compromise resolution, I would like to express my reservations regarding paragraphs 4 and 5."
"I would certainly prefer if the references to manipulation and culpability were amended."
"The link between meat and bonemeal and BSE is clearly established."
"The enforcement of the ban is central to the elimination of BSE."
"More importantly, the implementation of an effective traceability programme from producer to consumer is crucial to the overall success of our campaign to restore consumer confidence."
"This raises the question of the safe disposal of offal from the meat-processing sector."
"It has huge environmental and cost considerations."
"At the outset of this debate I advocated an urgent research programme into the safe use of this material."
"I now reiterate that call."
"I was pleased to hear President Santer acknowledge that mistakes were made by the Commission."
"Of course mistakes were made."
"And mistakes were made by this Parliament."
"We are all human and we belong to human institutions."
"It is my view that no Commissioner, from MacSharry to the present Commissioner Fischler - and I include as well Commission officials - would deliberately embark on a campaign to endanger public health."
"Nothing I have heard in this debate would cause me to change my mind."
"Judgement on the action of the Commission must be based on the circumstances at any given time."
"It is easy to be the hurler in the ditch."
"It is easy to evaluate past events with the wisdom of hindsight."
"I believe that all of us who are committed to resolving this issue now have a profound responsibility to work together in a cohesive manner, with the interests of the consumer and producers in mind."
"We have correctly spent time examining the origins of this crisis."
"Now is the time to set out a comprehensive strategy to address the situation in relation to the future."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate not only the Committee of Inquiry but also all the national parliaments, including the House of Commons in the UK, for ratifying the Maastricht Treaty which made this committee of inquiry possible."
"I think we can say that no national committee of inquiry could have achieved what this one has, and I think it has clearly extended the vital powers which this House enjoys."
"I naturally also share the view that public health must always take precedence over market interests."
"As every speaker has already said, many mistakes were made, but I do not think it right to table a motion of censure at this stage."
"We can do so later in the year, if necessary."
"I agree with what the Commission said, that there must always be a division of responsibilities between the policymakers and the policy monitors."
"I welcome the plans outlined by President Santer, and we look forward to seeing them implemented."
"I also think that we need more research at European level."
"In the past - and with BSE this was too much the case - it has only tended to be carried out in the United Kingdom, which might make people suspect that the results were given a one-sided interpretation."
"I too am in favour of having a quality assurance policy for agricultural products, but I only hope that farmers will also benefit from this, which has by no means always been the case."
"Finally, we have seen that the non-public decision-making procedures in the Commission, on the CouncilCommission circuit, in the management committees and so on were not enough to prevent the most major crisis imaginable in the beef sector in Europe from occurring."
"The only solution is to have more openness, which means greater codecision powers for the European Parliament."
"Mr President, the Committee of Inquiry's damning conclusions make the responsibilities clear: the primary responsibilities of the British Government - whether Lord Plumb likes it or not - which cynically allowed the export of contaminated meat-and-bone meal that was banned on its own territory; the responsibilities of the manufacturers; and those of the Member States' governments - and there are no representatives of the Council here today."
"Moreover, the report is a complete indictment of the Commission: negligence, administrative failures, a policy of disinformation and, above all, deliberately cynical decisions."
"During your hearing, Mr Santer, you took cover behind scientific opinions in an attempt to justify your decisions."
"But scientists as such do not take the decisions, and I would quote Guy Debord: ' However much they participate in the decision-making process, they can only influence it by associating themselves with one of the clans, or by gaining the confidence of one of the politico-bureaucratic cliques which vie for power and take up important scientific and technical issues for show, or which, far more often, need experts to dress up in scientific clothing decisions that have already been taken and have other motives' ."
"You have confessed the motive for these decisions - and I mean 'confessed' , because this was indeed a crime, and may prove to be a crime against humanity if an epidemic has to be declared in a few years' time."
"That motive was the establishment of the single market."
"That has been the Commission's priority since 1989."
"The dogma of the free movement of goods was transformed into the freedom to contaminate cattle and humans."
"And what of public health?"
"It was, as Mr Santer told us during his hearing, a matter of concern to the Commission."
"No, Mr Santer!"
"Public health is a duty, a responsibility, and as the philosopher Emmanuel Levinas put it, responsibility does not sleep and leaves you with a furrowed brow."
"That is why our group has used the procedural means available and joined with Members from other groups in tabling a motion of censure."
"We need to set about reforming the CAP in such a way as to free it from an economic rationale which is leading to an over-intensification of farming, resulting in damage to the environment and product quality."
"We need to curb the measures to liberalize and deregulate public services in the areas of human and animal health, we need to provide for funding to compensate the victims and, above all, we need to ensure the continuation of research."
"Because the only way to compensate those suffering from the disease, Mr President, is to ensure that they can be treated in the future."
"Mr President, I have a minute's speaking time left, which I should now like to devote to you, Mr Fischler."
"The main thing is for a different agricultural policy to be introduced which serves to strengthen a rurally based economy."
"That is what is said in the report, and it was confirmed by Mr Santer."
"I should like to point out here that we have adopted a number of decisions in Parliament, for example the one on clover in relation to set-aside."
"You will know that baby food is now only meant to be produced from organically farmed products."
"You know that Parliament does not wish to see the use of genetic techniques in the area of organic food."
"You are aware of the House's views on genetically engineered maize."
"You know that some points are still in dispute as regards the legislation on trade in seeds."
"On the whole, you support the socio-ecological approach to the countryside. I therefore think we must take Parliament's decisions seriously and engage in cooperation, not least with regard to milk."
"If we can manage to get the cows back in the fields through a reform, then the bull will carry off Europa once again, of that I am quite sure!"
"(Laughter and applause)"
"Mr President, with mad cow disease we have seen ten years of total unconcern and criminal slackness, for the sake of ever greater profits."
"The main blame lies of course with the United Kingdom, which allowed meat-and-bone meal to be produced under extremely dubious conditions."
"Decisions were taken on the basis of biased recommendations, and studies were commissioned and paid for by the beef industry itself."
"This seems incredible in itself, yet the Council of Ministers just stood by and watched."
"For years, the Commission allowed a situation to continue where no veterinary checks on BSE were carried out, and the present Commission too must share responsibility for this."
"Senior officials said that they were forced to give in to political pressure."
"There were even attempts to sabotage the Committee of Inquiry, and the truth about gelatine was simply brushed under the carpet."
"In any normal democracy, those responsible for blunders like this would be dismissed."
"That is why we support the motion of censure, but the text which goes furthest is not even being put to the vote, on the orders of the biggest groups, which is an example of Parliament too evading its responsibilities."
"President Santer has now made a public confession, and I only hope that he puts his statement into practice."
"Mr President, the report by the Committee of Inquiry blames the UK Government and the Commission for a number of serious errors."
"The Commission is accused of taking too much account of the market and too little of public health, of not having obtained independent scientific recommendations, of having made light of the problem for too long, and so on."
"Although the previous Commission was to blame for most of this, the present Commission does not escape the criticisms."
"While scientists advised caution, the Commission lifted the ban on exports of gelatine, tallow and semen from British bulls."
"However, as far as we are concerned, there is no question of a motion of censure: it is easy to condemn with hindsight."
"What matters now is how far the Commission assumes its responsibilities with regard to the failures mentioned in the report."
"Its announcement that it is to set up a new directorate to coordinate consumer policy and public health is a step in the right direction, but it still needs to make its policy much more transparent, and to improve research and monitoring in cooperation with the national authorities."
"The recommendations in the Medina report will be an excellent test here."
"However, not everything it contains has our backing."
"Its calls for the codecision procedure to apply to the CAP would certainly increase Parliament's powers, but have nothing to do with the BSE problem."
"And the recommendation to restructure the CAP by promoting extensive agriculture is not relevant to the beef sector."
"Discussions on this must take account of broader issues such as food supply, farmers' incomes and environmental protection."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the BSE affair has cost many human lives and jeopardized or indeed destroyed the livelihood of many cattle farmers."
"It has created uncertainty among consumers throughout Europe and has cost the European taxpayer billions of ECU."
"In its report, the Committee of Inquiry into BSE - for whose excellent work I would express my great appreciation - has drawn attention to the failings on the part of the United Kingdom, the Council and the Commission."
"The report makes these clear through numerous examples."
"However, I do not wish to become absorbed in the detail of the report, which shows above all the great shortcomings of the present concept of Europe."
"My concern is to demonstrate that the shortcomings which have been identified are symptoms of a sickness that is inherent in the system."
"The report of the BSE inquiry shows that the institutional structure cannot function as it exists at present."
"The control mechanisms cannot work, where they exist at all."
"My concern is the fact that the Commission has assumed de facto responsibility for legislation, without ever securing democratic legitimacy from the citizens of Europe."
"My concern is that the Commissioners and the officials of the EU are acting without transparency, that they arbitrarily pass on or withhold information."
"My concern is the way in which responsibility dissolves into a labyrinth, so that ultimately no one is responsible."
"Finally, my concern is whether, even though all these defects have been revealed by the committee's report, there is any realistic chance of holding the Commission and all the other players to political account."
"I very much regret that, on the basis of the present legal situation, the motion of censure on the Commission also affects Commissioners who have no responsibility in this matter."
"However, the findings of the Committee of Inquiry into BSE do require measures to be taken."
"Only in this way can the European Parliament live up to the image it seeks to have."
"For this reason, we shall support the motion of censure tabled by Mr Happart."
"Mr President, Mr Santer, you have been praised here by one of my colleagues, whom I respect, for making a courageous speech."
"Admittedly, the thought did occur to me that he had received the text of a speech from you which you had not given me."
"I also listened to you carefully."
"Considering that from tomorrow, as is to be hoped, the sword of Damocles will be hanging over you and your Commission in the form of a vote of censure, I found what you said to be no more than a speech of advance notices."
"And at no point did you say anything specific, as I should like to illustrate from a number of examples."
"For instance, you said that the Commission's services are being reorganized, staff are being reallocated, and there will be changes in posts."
"You said for example that there will also be redeployments in positions of responsibility within the Directorate-General for Agriculture, involving individuals who have held responsibilities in the past and who are still working."
"Is that what you announced?"
"You said that the budgetary resources would be examined so that Mrs Bonino can actually do the work which she will no doubt perform extremely well."
"What do you mean by examined?"
"How is she to do the work if you do not give an assurance that the budgetary resources will be made available?"
"You said at another point - I am sorry, now I have intruded on the territory of the chairman of the Committee on Budgets, and so with great regret I take that sentence back, but you and Mr Samland know what I mean - but we do not need lip-service, what we need apart from a transfer of responsibilities is a transfer of money - cash, to put it quite bluntly."
"You said elsewhere that Mrs Bonino was to be involved in the legislation."
"That would be excellent - nothing would have more support from me."
"But did you say, for example, how you intend to deal with something as simple as the dispute over the paper on future food policy, which the Commission announced over a year ago and which we are still waiting to see?"
"And why are we still waiting for it?"
"Because the Commission cannot decide between Mr Bangemann, Mr Fischler and Mrs Bonino."
"I shall tell you how you should decide, and you can announce this here today, Mr Santer!"
"This belongs to Mrs Bonino!"
"She handles consumer policy, she represents the interests of consumers, more so than Mr Fischler has so far - with apologies to him - and in any event more than Mr Bangemann does."
"So say something specific to us on that, Mr Santer!"
"You said that a food agency is under consideration, a kind of FDA."
"You have often said this."
"You have already said it on other occasions in a similar way: it will be considered!"
"I do listen to you with some degree of attention, Mr Santer."
"It may not always be an undiluted pleasure to do so, but I do it all the same."
"You have already said this before."
"So do something about it!"
"Do something and say to us: we shall set up an FDA, a Food and Drug Agency or a Food Agency."
"Do it!"
"We have been calling for this for a long time here in Parliament."
"As you will be aware, Parliament is generally light years ahead of the Commission, and that applies here as well."
"You said at another point that at the Intergovernmental Conference, you would support a change in the legal basis for the agriculture sector from Article 43 to Article 100a, and that you would support a separate legal basis for health policy."
"I know that you will only be able to persuade the Heads of Government to accept this with the backing of your own institution, and with our support."
"So please first try to persuade your own colleagues!"
"Persuade Mr Fischler that Article 43 is not the right legal basis, and also Mr Bangemann."
"Above all, please persuade Mr Flynn that we need a separate legal basis for health policy."
"During the investiture of the Commission, he denied that there was any such need when answering a question from me on the subject in the relevant committee."
"Please do that, Mr Santer, and also tell us exactly what you have in mind on these issues."
"Tell us also, Mr Santer, how you intend to change the common agricultural policy."
"Tell us here and now that you will support, in principle, the idea of subsidies now only being granted for quality, and no longer for quantity; that from 1998, the budget will be framed differently, in conjunction with ourselves and the Council."
"Say that to us!"
"These are all specific things which you could have said."
"If you had said just two things from this whole list, I would have been satisfied and grateful."
"But you did not do so."
"Do a favour for us, Mr Santer: you have brought a gentle breath of air into the Chamber and sent a light breeze through it; try to raise a proper storm for once, one which really blows through the minds of your fellow Commissioners and those of the Council of Ministers."
"That is really what we need!"
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating the chairman of our committee, Mr Böge, on his work, and the rapporteur, Mr Medina, on steering his excellent report to a successful conclusion."
"We are currently engaged in a long and momentous political debate, in which I shall endeavour not to repeat what has already been said."
"Momentous, because of the importance of the subject under discussion: BSE, about which hardly anything is known - neither what the pathogenic agent is, nor how it is transmitted."
"Momentous, in terms of its unusualness in this House - since this debate is being followed throughout the European Union, as it concerns human health, and that is an extremely serious matter."
"Momentous, in terms of its development - from the establishment of a committee of inquiry to the tabling of the first ever motion of censure on the Commission, because of the seriousness of the facts revealed by the inquiry."
"The first ever motion of censure tabled in this Parliament, ladies and gentlemen: that is no laughing matter."
"This affair has a past, a present and a future."
"It has a past, in which the facts and the responsibilities of all the main players are clear: the British Government, as the main protagonist; the Council, with its silent support in meetings of ministers; and the Commission, as the institution which not only gave others a free rein, but did not do what it should have."
"It has a present, and here I should like to be more specific."
"We are dealing with an issue which we now know affects human health, and in respect of which neither silent support, nor giving a free rein - or turning a blind eye - nor political alliances are acceptable."
"The obligation to safeguard public health is paramount."
"And we would give a bad impression - and even worse, abuse the democratic mandate bestowed on us by our electors - if we failed to condemn these events."
"In this affair, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, there is a great deal for which the Commission must be called to account."
"With regard to the gelatine issue, for example - a phoney debate, as Mr Böge calls it - it is once again clear that political decisions are being taken over the heads of the scientific committees and against their advice, for reasons which at best are purely economic. However, what is more serious, especially serious in my view, is the lack of openness and cooperation on the part of certain Members of the Commission, who have still not provided all the documentation requested by Mr Böge, even though we shall be voting on the matter tomorrow."
"Mr Santer, this is not a responsibility of the previous Commission."
"It is a responsibility of the present Commission: it is your responsibility."
"We all know how the College of Commissioners works, and if it has failed to abide by the interinstitutional agreement - as it has done - which requires it to make such documents available, it may be by accident or for some other reason."
"But even if it is by accident, it is still unacceptable."
"If this is the way it has behaved in this affair, what are we, or the Union's citizens, to think of the lack of coordination, information, control and transparency that prevails in DG VI, or the demotivation of its officials, who see responsibilities moved up and down and back and forth?"
"The Commission should have made a gesture of magnanimity and self-sacrifice by assuming the individual political responsibilities which exist and by subordinating these individual interests to the interest of the institution as a whole."
"Because sometimes, Mr Santer, you have to lose a battle in order to win the war."
"And the war, in this case, is a war for the credibility of the European institutions - and more particularly the Commission, which as a result of this sorry affair is losing its accumulated stock of credibility and giving ammunition to the critics of European integration, whose numbers have understandably increased as a result of the Commission's lack of sensitivity in some of the policies that it presents."
"I would urge you to bring forward a practical, viable and forward-looking plan: not cosmetic changes, but genuine reorganization."
"Changing the Directorate-General is not enough."
"Do not increase the amount of bureaucracy."
"Discuss the plan with everyone involved, and do not expect miracles or individual saviours."
"Stand by it, and require everyone else to stand by it in equal measure."
"That is your challenge, Mr Santer, and your duty."
"In any event, Parliament will know how to make good use of its powers and fulfil its duties, the first of which is to demand that the protection of consumers' health should be guaranteed."
"And that is what all the citizens of the European Union are calling for and insisting on today."
"Commissioner, if I had not signed the order paper for a motion of censure, I would almost be on your side and apologise to you for the tons of words which come out of this Parliament. In fact we are a 'word factory' !"
"And you, at the Commission, very often are not an 'action factory' ."
"In this respect I should say that, at this moment of truth, which reminds me slightly of a certain type of Spanish or Portuguese spectacle, there is a whiff of adrenalin, as some people seem to be afraid of others."
"Of course, I think that the Commission should be punished because, as it is the body chosen by governments, it is also a sort of joint government commission."
"And, of course, it is not an elected body."
"It is meant to be the guardian of the treaties and to do its work."
"But there have already been too many censures."
"Censures could also be made against the European Parliament because, instead of cruelly passing an immediate censure motion it has opted for an even crueller system, that of delaying the killing."
"People have been afraid in the past."
"They have raised all kinds of arguments - that there was a government vacuum in Europe, that the market has been given preference over people's health, as we all know that the Commission could have defended both the market and public health, in the same way and at the same time."
"One thing does not prevent the other!"
"The fact that is that impunity was used and it still exists throughout the European Community because, for example, I am against making the United Kingdom the only 'scapegoat' ."
"The truth is that other countries also could have reacted!"
"The truth is that the Commission could have reacted!"
"The truth is that when Commissioner MacSharry - who is also in the dock now - prevented countries from blocking the sale of meat, the countries could have done it themselves."
"Political cowardice does exist, and there is nothing to be done about it."
"That is why there is now that whiff of adrenalin I spoke of!"
"And of course, it seems that we are in a minotaur situation."
"I must confess that I cannot see any labyrinth at my door, I do not see any need for Ariane's thread to get me away from the minotaur and, of course, for that reason I voted against the censure motion."
"I think it was high time for the European Parliament to shoulder its responsibilities, shake off its fear and get rid of this smell of adrenalin."
"I know that it is very difficult to do so."
"But personally I find that it is not so hard for me to do so and also I rather like many of the present Commissioners."
"Mr President, a vote of censure on the Commission at the present time is inappropriate."
"This motion of censure is not only regrettable, but will be counterproductive for our image, since it forces Parliament to adopt a confrontational stance towards the Commission, although we know that it will ultimately back down."
"Furthermore, Parliament is aiming at the wrong main target."
"The villain of the piece is not the Commission, and certainly not the present College of Commissioners."
"The Temporary Committee of Inquiry's report is quite clear on that, moreover."
"I have no wish to play down the serious operational failures on the part of the Commission's services during the period when it was headed by Jacques Delors."
"However, as everyone knows, the villain of the piece is first and foremost a national government over which we have no say."
"That government, which is currently approaching an electoral campaign, should celebrate the fact that it is the Commission that is in the dock, whilst its own clearly documented crimes are quietly forgotten."
"In these circumstances, a vote of censure is inappropriate, disproportionate and excessive."
"Furthermore, the Commission is making amends for its past mismanagement and implementing a series of internal reforms designed to prevent a repetition of the mistakes that were made in its assessment of the seriousness of the crisis and in its handling of it."
"This is the price of maintaining an institution's credibility, and I believe that Parliament has successfully performed its monitoring role by stirring things up and forcing a reorganization."
"I am confident, Mr President, that in similar circumstances in the future, the imperatives of human health will take precedence over any other considerations."
"This call to order as regards the priorities which must always be observed is a fine victory for Parliament, which has essentially won its case."
"Mr President, there is a rather grim joke going around the Palace of Westminster that the British Government's interpretation of BSE is 'blame someone else' ."
"How can anyone place any trust whatsoever in the present UK government?"
"First of all, we have Mr Hogg who has boycotted the Committee of Inquiry set up by this Parliament."
"He is matched by Michael Forsyth, the Minister responsible for Scotland, who has been boycotting Brussels for many months."
"His only contribution was to try to ban the flying of the European flag in Scotland on 'Peace in Europe' day."
"These are the people that are asking us to blame the Commission and not them."
"Yesterday, Mr Hogg said, and I quote: ' There is a strong case for Northern Ireland."
"The case is very powerful and I will urge the Commission accordingly' ."
"On the same day, Lord Lindsay, his junior Minister was saying in Brussels: ' I categorically deny that there has been any special deal for Northern Ireland' ."
"We hear today, on the grapevine, that £9.4 million is being spent in Northern Ireland."
"I would like some confirmation, if the Commission has it, of these details."
"Five months ago, the same Lord Lindsay had the effrontery to tell the Scottish farmers that Scotland can lead the UK out of the beef export ban."
"Such irresponsibility and contradiction has to be recorded in the annals and in the record of this House."
"What concerns me most is who pays the price for this incompetence?"
"It is, of course, the beef exporting farmer that I represent in Aberdeenshire and Angus and also the Northern Ireland farmers."
"They are being made the scapegoats and it is time we pinned that blame where it belongs."
"Mr President, in the absence of Mr Paisley which is duly noted, may I say that this is an important day for Parliament and for the institutions we are building."
"Both the chairman of the committee and the rapporteur rose to the level of events."
"This report has been described today in the British House of Commons as 'tosh' by our Prime Minister."
"I would translate tosh as a term of infantile abuse that has no place whatsoever in our deliberations on this report."
"It is up to us to make the Commission put its own house in order and to say to the Council of Ministers that a catastrophe like BSE has to be tackled by common measures, not by recourse to national pressures, however powerful they may be, or nationalist prejudices, however extreme."
"Nor do we want witch-hunts or soundbite sensationalism when we are assigning blame."
"BSE has devastated my country and when I assign blame in this I do not shirk the United Kingdom's responsibility."
"I am the only British member of the committee who is prepared to say, not with perfect hindsight but with sober judgment, what we should have done after the Southwood report in 1989: in the matter of tackling infected feed, in removing it from the animal food chain, in not preventing the continued export of this material, in the arrogance with which we looked at scientific advice if it came from independent sources and - most of all - in the failure to examine the possible links between BSE and CJD, something which was described as inconceivable by a British Minister only six months before he had to get up and admit to its likelihood, there is a measure of blame for the United Kingdom."
"We cannot bluster about the previous ten years."
"Things have changed since April 1996 and rightly so."
"However, the refusal of the Minister to come before the committee, like the so-called beef war that was waged against the European Union, has wasted precious goodwill to no purpose."
"Having said that, we found no evidence whatsoever of a sinister conspiracy between British officials and their compatriots in the Commission."
"What we did find in the Commission was a dreadful inertia - all those notes about no more meetings on BSE and so on. The President of the Commission has to take that into account now in what he does."
"We should hold the Commission to a programme of institutional reform which separates producer interests from consumer concerns."
"I shall vote against an immediate vote of censure, but President Santer knows that the jury is out on the reform programme he has outlined today."
"We want to see throughout Europe that our food concerns and our health concerns are placed in the hands of those who are not themselves too beholden to the great producer lobbies, however legitimate those may be in their own right."
"It is because of this that I want to dissociate myself from those who say either that the Commission should be immediately censured or that reparations should be sought from the United Kingdom, without the slightest heed for the legality or practicality of such a measure."
"What we are trying to do is find European solution for what is - like it or not - a European problem."
"It needs a strong consumer directorate and Mrs Bonino's personal involvement in the monitoring of human and animal health backed by changes in the common agricultural policy to bring about a food sector that is humanely and effectively run."
"I want to echo my colleague Mrs Roth-Behrendt in saying that the real test is how much strength the President of the Commission is prepared to put behind the consumer directorate."
"When we see the dreadful shilly-shallying over a Green Paper on food policy over the past year, we have to say not just: ' What are his words?' but 'What are his actions' ."
"I say to him today that green rhetoric is not enough, red-blooded action is needed as well."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, the main part of my speech will take the form of a letter - I hesitate to say a satirical address - to Mr Santer and his team, but firstly I should like to say something to the President of Parliament."
"I do not believe that Parliament has increased its stature by its choice of date and time for the vote on the motion of censure."
"Indeed, scheduling the vote for Thursday afternoon seems to me to be particularly provocative, when we know that the majority of Members leave Strasbourg after voting time at 12 noon on Thursdays."
"I fear that, once again, we shall have the air of opportunists, if not political schemers."
"You are a convinced European and an optimist, Mr Santer, and I also know that you are fond of Bordeaux wines."
"That is why I like you, and why I wish to do you a favour."
"I shall therefore be calling on my parliamentary colleagues to vote in favour of the motion of censure against you and the Commission."
"And why?"
"Because, while the responsibilities that can be laid at the door of the British Government are enormous, while those borne by the Delors Commission are clear, your Commission also bears a share of the blame."
"The Commissioner with responsibility for agriculture, Mr Fischler, is sitting next to you."
"He deliberately put the BSE dossier under wraps for at least two years."
"Six months ago, he started to relax; then he clamped down, and he sometimes concealed important information, as you well know."
"Mr Fischler, you are of the same political persuasion as me."
"You are a man of honour."
"If, as I think you do, you believe in Europe, you will resign."
"You will do us a service, and you will do a service to the Europe in which you believe."
"Mr Santer, this is a damning report."
"I believe that the European Union has failed in its duty to protect public health and its citizens."
"All of Europe knows it."
"The Union's citizens will therefore fail to understand why such a serious misdemeanour is not punished."
"That is why I shall be voting in favour of the motion of censure."
"The moment that you and your Commissioners leave, the Union's citizens will begin to have faith in a Europe that is courageous and transparent enough to dismiss you. And by going, you will enable the Europe in which you believe to move forward."
"And then - rest assured - very quickly, in a few months, because the Member States' governments will wish to see you return - you are a good administrator and a good politician - you will come back with most of your Commissioners: Mrs Bonino, for example, who performs her duties extremely well, and even Mr de Silguy and Sir Leon Brittan."
"Of course, you will have to let some of them go - especially Mr Fischler, and perhaps certain others - because their time is up and there is a need for change."
"At that moment, the European Union will make a fresh start with a better image - thanks to you."
"And that is why, Mr Santer, I shall do you a favour and support the motion of censure."
"Mr President, perhaps this is a dream."
"In any event, please ensure that it does not turn into a nightmare."
"Thank you, Mr Bébéar."
"Let me give you a provisional answer to the part of your speech addressed to the President of Parliament, and remind you that Rule 34(5) provides that the vote on a motion of censure shall not be taken until at least 48 hours after the beginning of the corresponding debate."
"I think the timetable is tight enough."
"Secondly - and I regret to have to say this, Mr Bébéar - it should not be forgotten that Thursday and Friday are also working days during the part-session, and as valuable as any others."
"Mr Brinkhorst now has the floor for one and a half minutes."
"Mr President, this debate may be of historic significance if it means that, as Mr Santer said, the iron ring that has surrounded the CAP for 40 years is finally broken."
"This may happen, but I have seen no conclusive evidence of it so far in this debate."
"The Commission has finally realized that power and monitoring power are two different things."
"Consumers have been ignored for far too long, and this is why so many people here in the House are keen to see action instead of words."
"Do we really have to wait until November?"
"It is not in the interests of either the Commission or Parliament to wait nine months for practical steps to be taken."
"The Commission will not have Parliament's confidence until these measures have been implemented, as Mrs RothBehrendt said."
"How many people will be involved?"
"What will the budget be?"
"Whom will it really be monitoring?"
"People's suspicions will not be allayed until these measures are in place, so I hope we can agree on September rather than November."
"I see that the Dutch presidency has sent a representative, and I have to say that as a Dutch Member I am extremely sorry that the presidency is not here in person, since it gives the impression that it is covering up for the stonewalling attitude of the UK Government The fact that the Council is not here simply shows the arrogance of power."
"I would have expected my presidency to behave rather differently."
"Mr President, the responsibility for the BSE crisis is shared by many, but real responsibility lies with the Common Agricultural Policy and all EU institutions are responsible for that, including Parliament."
"It has created production conditions of an extreme, stressful and artificial nature."
"It has crossed national boundaries and facilitated the spread of disease via animals and foodstuffs."
"It has encouraged an imbalance in the location of slaughter houses leading, as a result, to animals being transported over unreasonably long distances."
"It has, to put it bluntly, been developed on the belief that plants, animals and the soil can be treated as dead material."
"BSE is the first great warning to those who have conducted this policy for decades."
"The free agricultural market is an outdated idea, it must be replaced, root and branch, before an even greater crisis befalls us."
"Mr President, everyone is joining forces today to condemn a serious operational failure on the part of the Community institutions. In an attempt to be objective, however, I would point out that the Commission proposed a ban on the export of British meat-and-bone meal to the markets of the other Member States as long ago as 1989."
"That proposal was rejected by the Council."
"There was therefore a known risk."
"The Commission should have adopted a different, more cautious approach, it is true; but this is a very long step from saying that we wish to lay the principal blame in this affair at the door of the Commission - a step which I believe it would be absurd, if not dishonest, to take."
"The main culprit in this affair is undoubtedly the British Government."
"It is clear that if, from 1988 onwards, it had adopted the necessary slaughter measures and banned the marketing of meat-and-bone meal, the outbreak of the disease could have been halted."
"The BSE crisis was caused firstly by the criminal negligence of the British Government, which only acknowledges the existence of Europe when it wishes to promote its own interests."
"It was also caused by the conspiracy of silence on the part of certain Member States, which instructed their experts in the Standing Veterinary Committee not to divulge information regarding the affair."
"In these circumstances, an immediate vote of censure on the Commission does not make sense."
"A conditional vote of censure is appropriate, however."
"But who should be punished, and how?"
"Sanctions must be imposed on the British Government, which is guilty of seriously violating the rules of the internal market and organizing a large-scale economic crime, and which should be brought before the European Court of Justice."
"Sanctions must also be imposed on those Member States which connived in the trafficking of British meat-and-bone meal, especially Belgium, which was at the hub of this trade, as revealed by the Mattei report to the French National Assembly."
"I believe that it is important to get to the bottom of things, and to identify the real culprits and punish them."
"The prestige of Parliament and the Union in the eyes of the citizens who will ultimately be our judge depends on this."
"Mr President, as we all know last night in the House of Commons the British Agriculture Minister, Douglas Hogg, survived a vote of censure by the skin of his teeth."
"All the more reason, therefore, for us to explain here today, from a European perspective, the crass incompetence of the British Government's handling of the BSE crisis."
"There can be no question but that the Medina report is a trenchant condemnation of the British Government and a powerful exposé of the mistakes of the Commission."
"Like Mr Whitehead, I have reservations about some of the recommendations in the report, but in a most graphic way I recognize that it shows that the British Government was slow to respond to the unfolding crisis."
"The reports demonstrates how measures were enforced half-heartedly and it highlights the sheer incompetence of Douglas Hogg's vacillating administration."
"Last week the British Government made a highly emotive attack on the Medina report."
"But what was significant was that no attempt was made to contradict one of the central messages of the report: that it was the British Government which was principally responsible for BSE because of the deregulation of the meat-rendering industry in the early 1980s."
"Similarly, I have to say that I have yet to hear a reasonable explanation of why Douglas Hogg was unable to attend the committee of inquiry's meeting."
"Given that the Permanent Secretary, Mr Packer, who attended in place of Mr Hogg, informed us that BSE was an act of God, we perhaps should be grateful that Douglas Hogg did not attend."
"If Mr Packer blamed God for what happened, goodness knows whom Mr Hogg would have blamed!"
"This report shows that the buck stops with the British Government."
"As was stated in yesterday's Financial Times, for 11 long years the government continued saying that British beef was completely safe, despite the contrary evidence which was emerging."
"The result has been that 15 people have sadly died of Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease; farmers and farm workers alike have suffered unprecedented hardship; the British taxpayer has had to fork out £3.3bn, and over one million cattle have been culled."
"The British Government's policy of non-cooperation was, as we all know, a farce."
"Douglas Hogg's charm offensive throughout Europe was a disaster and the British Government declaring that the Florence agreement was good, then bad, then good again served only to cause confusion and dismay."
"Despite all of this, the ban on British beef remains to this day."
"Surely the lesson for the British people is that for the ban to be lifted the Conservative Government has to be removed."
"Let us hope that this will happen in the very near future."
"Mr President, one of the most important roles of the European Parliament is the monitoring of the actions of the Commission."
"The monitoring by the European Parliament's Committee of Inquiry of the various aspects of the bovine spongiform encephalopathy affair, involving the United Kingdom, the Council and the Commission, has been assiduous, despite the shortage of time and the fact that certain circles in the Commission were not always helpful, principally with regard to the furnishing of important documents, some of which have still not been made available."
"The Committee of Inquiry has carried out its monitoring without bias, and the results are clearly stated in its report, which presents the facts, attributes responsibility as appropriate and makes recommendations to prevent the same sort of thing and the irregularities in the workings of the Commission happening again."
"Allow me to recall that one of the labours of Hercules was to clean the Augean stables."
"I believe that the chairman of the committee and its members and the rapporteur have performed a similar, herculean, task."
"Ladies and gentlemen, at this crucial juncture, as the work of the intergovernmental conference nears completion, we must examine the European Union's priorities and ask ourselves how best we can serve the interests of the citizens of Europe to whom we are responsible."
"We must be scrupulous and satisfy the citizens' sense of justice. The Commission has to be put on a new course, and that can be achieved only through a restructuring of its services and, above all, through the adoption of new basic principles."
"To that end, the fairest way forward - one which combines sanctions with the requirement for a new approach - is a conditional expression of censure."
"Acceptance by the European Parliament of the report of the Committee of Inquiry into BSE will entail, of itself, the attribution of responsibilities as between the United Kingdom, the Commission and the Council and, also, to senior officials. In my view, Parliament should adopt a rigorous and condemnatory approach."
"That approach will also be constructive because of the things that are being demanded from the Commission. Firstly, that it should put its house in order and initiate the requisite disciplinary action against the persons responsible for the mismanagement, regardless of their seniority."
"Secondly, that it should forward a proposal, in the context of the intergovernmental conference, concerning the application of the co-decision procedure to the CAP."
"Thirdly, that it should move quickly towards full reorganization of the scientific committees and to ensure that their operations are based on purely scientific criteria."
"Fourthly, that it should reorganize the directorates-general, in cooperation with the European Parliament, in order to establish a suitable structure for effective protection of human health and the environment."
"Espousal of the precept that the health of human beings is the fundamental priority, and that it must, of course, take precedence over the financial expedience of the common market, is imperative."
"We believe this to be the only way of ensuring that the citizens of Europe can regain full confidence in the actions of the Commission and be convinced that it is the true guardian not only of the treaties but also of their health and the environment."
"If the Commission fails to act quickly, and in accordance with the Committee of Inquiry's recommendations, you can be sure, Mr President of the Commission, that December will be the final month of your Commission."
"Do not think that you can fool us with half-measures."
"We want full compliance with the committee's recommendations and immediate withdrawal of your authorization, which is still applicable, of the lifting of the ban on gelatin."
"We ask you to rescind that decision immediately."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to concentrate on three points."
"Firstly, of course, the relationship of trust between many Members of the House and the Commission has been shattered."
"However, the most important thing has to be that political conclusions are actually drawn from this whole scandal, that reforms are introduced."
"Here I would like to address Mr Fischler personally as the Agriculture Commissioner."
"I sometimes have the impression that you are in a rather protected position, because there is no vote of censure on individual Members of the Commission."
"But you will be judged on whether you do two things now."
"And these are my second and third points."
"It will not do for a country or a government to cause enormous damage and then not to have to pay for it."
"A great deal of money has been spent on repairing the damage."
"This must be retrieved - if necessary through an action before the European Court of Justice."
"That is very important."
"And there is another point on which you should be focusing, as Mr Santer also said in his speech: the principal mistake in this series of events was a misguided agricultural policy."
"And you are responsible, Mr Fischler, for seeing that a change takes place here, a move away from an industrial agricultural policy and towards an ecological policy."
"You will be judged on that basis, and we shall link the question of censure to that point."
"Mr President, despite the lack of clarity in your announcements, Mr Santer, most Members will no doubt attach your speech to the decision which I hope we shall adopt by a large majority tomorrow, because then in a few months' time we can check what has become of them."
"I have the impression that there is a large measure of agreement with the Commission here in the House that there can be no cost-cutting when it comes to protecting the health of our citizens."
"That has always been the case, but the principle has not been observed."
"The policy has not been adapted to it."
"The British Government stands at the head of the chain of cause and effect in this failure, and the Commission has failed as well."
"The Council of Ministers has not covered itself with glory, and we should also exercise some degree of self-criticism: despite early warnings from the committees, for example, we did not produce a majority for any radical change in agriculture policy."
"So, was BSE a matter of chance?"
"Was it an accident?"
"It was not."
"One of its causes was the British Government's complete misunderstanding of deregulation, and also to some extent the mistaken idea of deregulation put forward by the Commission and some sections of Parliament."
"Another cause was the misguided agriculture policy."
"I am not speaking out here in favour of some wonderfully cosy form of small-scale agriculture."
"We have large units; if we have large herds, then large areas go with them."
"These too can make ecological sense, but we certainly do not have both things at the moment!"
"I am quite sure you need a new Director-General, Mr Fischler."
"If someone is responsible for fire prevention and does not do his job properly, you cannot then employ him as a fire-fighter!"
"That is not on, believe me!"
"I would say quite clearly once again: we in Parliament cannot simply make demands."
"We need to play our own part in the forthcoming reforms, and I will certainly be appealing to many colleagues on these lines."
"When we come to tackle a reform of the agriculture policy - and not just here in Europe - I shall be reminding them of what has been said here in connection with BSE."
"BSE was not a matter of chance!"
"And the Union must play its part."
"We first have to change what is no longer acceptable in our European Union, for example the way in which we produce meat."
"We do eat meat!"
"We are omnivores, after all."
"But then we must consider certain things with regard to animals, and also with regard to human health."
"And we need to do this throughout the world."
"Unless the EU, with its strong market and from its general position of strength, also uses international agreements to try to change this way of producing agricultural goods, then not only will BSE have been a painful and unpleasant warning, but there will be worse to come, since if we go on behaving as we have done up to now, worse things are guaranteed!"
"Mr President, as a member of the Committee of Inquiry I voted for and I fully support the Committee of Inquiry's findings and recommendations."
"The British Government was found to be responsible for starting the disease, for taking inadequate steps to prevent its rapid spread and, up to very recently, to eradicate it."
"I hope that has now changed."
"In particular it was found that the British decision to alter the manufacturing process which lowered sterilization standards for meat and bonemeal used in compound feeding stuffs for cattle allowed the emergence of the disease."
"Whatever savings in fuel were achieved, this reckless change in standards has now cost consumers, taxpayers and especially farmers several million times more than any possible savings."
"Having eventually banned the use of meat and bonemeal the British Government then completely failed to implement its ban."
"Worse still, it allowed contaminated meat and bonemeal to be exported without restriction, thus contaminating herds in neighbouring EU countries."
"I welcome President Santer's statement today, but since 1989 the European Commission has been slow to recognize the seriousness of this disease and it failed to supervise the British response."
"It allowed contaminated meat and bonemeal to be traded freely throughout Europe."
"Furthermore, the Commission carried out practically no veterinary inspections in the UK at a time when tens of thousands of animals were being infected annually in that country."
"The Commission's lack of activity since 1989 in respect of BSE must rank as one of the greatest failures of public administration in recent history."
"Most, but not all, of the fault lies with previous Commissions, as the report clearly establishes."
"The report from the Committee of Inquiry incorporates a number of amendments which I tabled because I believe that BSE spread outside Britain mainly through exports of contaminated meat and bonemeal."
"I have therefore included in the report a call for legislation to ensure meat and bonemeal is never again used in ruminant feeds and that ruminant feeds cannot be produced on any premises where meat and bonemeal is present."
"The committee also accepted my proposal that meat and bonemeal be sold only under special licence and that, in addition, a full list of ingredients be displayed on all compound feeds."
"Obviously these rules must be implemented in all Member States and backed by strong legislation."
"Moving to the future, for the future we must double our efforts to eradicate the last remnants of this disease and restore public confidence in the high quality of our food products."
"We must work incessantly to convince our own consumers and customers in exports markets that our beef is safe and wholesome."
"The Commission must implement all the recommendations in our report and this must be done efficiently and immediately."
"I will support the conditional motion of censure if the Commission does not satisfy our demands."
"Our position is very clear."
"We require strengthened monitoring and a reinforcement of current eradication measures."
"We require a reorganization of the Commission's personnel and a refocusing of policy."
"We require immediate progress in setting up the veterinary agency in Ireland to accurately supervise this work."
"Mr President, the report by the Committee of Inquiry gives a clear picture of the major problems underlying the BSE crisis, the events which led to the problem and its causes."
"I should like to thank the Committee for this."
"The BSE crisis has understandably shaken consumer confidence in beef."
"To restore that confidence will be the Commission's principal task in dealing with the crisis from now on."
"According to the report, the previous Commission underestimated the BSE problem and concealed its seriousness."
"The Commission neglected its duty to monitor compliance with veterinary rules in the internal market."
"Under the Treaty, the Commission is responsible for monitoring compliance with Community legislation in the Member States."
"The Commission is responsible for instituting legal proceedings against any Member State which violates Community legislation."
"I should like to know how the Commission intends to shoulder this responsibility."
"At the various stages of food production in the Union, the BSE crisis has already cost more than ECU 2 billion."
"Those who have been forced to foot the bill are innocent farmers, whose support has been cut and is continuing to be cut."
"What damages should be paid by those who made mistakes?"
"I support the conditional vote of no confidence to compel the Commission to take those unavoidable decisions to enable it to monitor Member States' compliance with Community legislation."
"The effectiveness of the common market is at stake here."
"This is particularly important because food safety and human health are affected."
"If necessary, the Commission should introduce heavy, conditionally suspended fines for breaches of Community legislation wherever there is a danger to human health."
"Mr President, BSE is an extremely serious and unprecedented issue, which has incalculable implications for human health."
"This epidemic was only able to reach the proportions that it did because the necessary measures were not taken in full."
"Can you imagine there being an outbreak of swine fever without the health authorities taking determined action to eradicate it?"
"Similar action to eradicate mad cow disease should have been taken from the outset."
"The Committee of Inquiry's excellent report, drawn up by Mr Medina, has a twofold merit: firstly, it lays bare the responsibilities of all the main actors in this affair; and, secondly, it proposes a set of measures designed to prevent such a crisis from ever happening again."
"Responsibility must first be laid overwhelmingly at the door of the Conservative British Governments of Mrs Thatcher and Mr Major."
"Those governments promoted deregulation, with disregard for any considerations of public health."
"The disease first developed because the British authorities relaxed the rules governing the manufacture of meat-and-bone meal, in order to reduce costs."
"The appearance of the disease did not perturb either the authorities or the agri-foodstuff industry, which regularly dismissed any thought of a crisis and, in particular, any risk to human health."
"Subsequently, the British authorities failed to carry out the inspections necessary for the introduction of eradication measures."
"Then, once meat-and-bone meal had been banned, the UK Government made no attempt to prevent its export to other EU countries."
"Lastly, the UK Government brought unacceptable pressure to bear on the Commission not to carry out any inspections, and even when, in spring 1996, the BSE crisis turned into a public health catastrophe, the Conservative British Government displayed an incredible lack of good will in its implementation of the measures to eradicate the disease."
"The European Commission also bears responsibility, though to a lesser extent."
"The Committee of Inquiry revealed the serious mistakes made by Commissioners MacSharry and Steichen, and certain members of their departments; but the present Commission is not exempt from blame either - especially Mr Fischler."
"The Commission at first opposed the imposition of an embargo on British beef and meat-and-bone meal."
"Subsequently, it slowed down the adoption of simple precautionary procedures designed to inactivate the infective agent in meat-and-bone meal."
"Then it lifted the embargo on gelatine."
"I was listening to what you said earlier, Mr Santer."
"That decision was taken, and it was only suspended because the industry decided that the embargo should be maintained."
"In any event, I think that this raises questions concerning the Commission's political responsibility."
"Finally, let us not forget that the Council of Ministers also bears a share of the responsibility."
"In the light of such a damning report by Parliament's Committee of Inquiry, sanctions must be imposed."
"We cannot stop now."
"They must be imposed on the Conservative Government of the United Kingdom, in the form of an order to pay damages, but also on those who were guilty of errors within the Commission."
"But it is not only a question of punishing past mistakes; it also a question of preventing such a crisis from ever happening again."
"In your speech earlier this afternoon, Mr President of the Commission, you announced your reforms."
"Placing health safety matters under the authority of Mrs Bonino: excellent!"
"Tabling reforms at the Intergovernmental Conference, along the lines of what I proposed three weeks ago: excellent!"
"But that is not enough."
"There is also a need to punish the failures which have been identified and, first and foremost, to make an issue of the UK Government's financial responsibility, as called for in the Committee of Inquiry's report."
"Mr President, given that Parliament, through Maastricht, has acquired the right to use a collective vote of censure as a parliamentary weapon, every Member of this supreme representative body within Europe should handle it responsibly."
"In the vote on the Medina report, 16 members of the Committee of Inquiry voted against the limpest of motions from the Socialist Group, so that the report which is now before the House was adopted without the planned recommendation for a qualified vote of censure."
"The press was full of this, as we know."
"Now we are retrieving the situation with some appropriate resolutions, which we shall be voting on tomorrow."
"This opposition - on my part too, I would point out - was not ducking the issue and did not reflect a lack of courage, quite the opposite."
"The motion in question amounted to an even more toned-down vote of censure, no time for it being set and the date of December 1997 being deleted."
"Those who threaten to use a vote of censure - of whatever kind - from the very beginning of an inquiry, and then in the end produce only the limpest forms of words, are damaging not only themselves, but Parliament as a whole, since everyone can see the reason for the lack of enthusiasm which has been mentioned: most of the Commissioners who would have to go would be from the ranks of the social democratic group!"
"Furthermore, the main point at issue here is surely not to demonstrate the guilt or innocence of the Commission which is now in office."
"For us as elected representatives, the point must rather be our duty to restore to European consumers the confidence which they demand and deserve."
"In other words, we MEPs would be well advised to join with the Commission in forming a counterbalance to the Council, rather than acting against it, above all in the light of the negotiations currently taking place at the Intergovernmental Conference."
"That does not prevent us from expressing our views to one another plainly and frankly, and that is the point at issue today here in the House."
"What is to be done?"
"On the basis of the recommendations in the Medina report and Parliament's resolution, the Commission should now rectify its omissions as quickly as possible and correct the flaws which have been highlighted by the Committee of Inquiry."
"The statements by President Santer indicate that the Commission is ready to do so."
"However, should this not be carried through within a reasonable period of time, contrary to expectations, in other words by the end of this year, then we should not just raise a warning finger, as was the case with the vote in the Committee of Inquiry, but would really be obliged to hold a vote of censure pursuant to Article 144 of the Treaty."
"Many positive things can be said about mad cow disease."
"Without mad cow disease it would have been more difficult to incorporate animal welfare as a key principle in the new EU treaty."
"Regard for animal welfare could have hindered the EU's and Great Britain's acceptance of an epidemic with hundreds of thousands of sick animals."
"Without mad cow disease it would have been more difficult to stipulate that cows should only be fed with food their digestive systems can tolerate, i.e. one should not try to turn herbivores into carnivores, which is what happened when lorry-loads of meat and bonemeal were sent out from factories to cattle breeders."
"Without mad cow disease attention would not have been focused on the fact that Great Britain has failed in its monitoring of meat and bonemeal companies and has not ensured that export bans were complied with, preventing EU inspectors from checking for mad cow disease on their visits to Great Britain."
"Without mad cow disease not so much attention would have been focused on the special committee system which is decisive for much of the agricultural policy, or on the fact that scientific experts are actually regarded as merely an extension of the authorities themselves."
"Without mad cow disease not so much attention would have been focused on the fact that the EU decides on agricultural policy in a more restrictive manner than for other areas of policy, even though the agricultural policy is one of the longest-standing areas of cooperation and this remains the area which accounts for half of the EU budget."
"The general directorate for agriculture is certainly in need of a good airing."
"Article 43 is now out of date, and the European Parliament does not have any influence over this."
"Witnesses from the Commission have constantly spoken about taking account of the internal market, but they have made recommendations against the background of article 43."
"This is not consistent."
"Without mad cow disease we would not have had this golden opportunity which can now be used to the advantage of openness and democracy."
"We do not want a Committee of Inquiry which is able to provide us with masses of documents which we should have received automatically."
"The EU must have transparency in its administration, and mad cow disease helps to illustrate this need."
"Without mad cow disease there would not have been the same drive in favour of a real consumer policy."
"Our appreciation that the regulations governing marking must be in order has increased."
"What we most need now is a reform in which those responsible for agriculture take account of health, consumers' rights and animal welfare, and in which they are not allowed to shirk their responsibility."
"Those responsible for agriculture must also be made jointly responsible for a policy on foodstuffs."
"The production of foodstuffs is, after all, the main point of an agricultural policy; one should not therefore be able to shirk responsibility for ensuring that food products are healthy."
"When health and consumers' rights are the main issue, any reasonable person will understand that we must have the necessary time for the Commission and the Council to alter their routines and for the government conference to change the legal basis."
"A vote of no confidence now will divert attention from the necessary reform of the EU in favour of a superficial debate on scapegoats, and this would be senseless."
"Mr President, as members of the Committee of Inquiry we have carried out our work honourably, we have gathered facts, exposed abuses, identified those responsible and made recommendations."
"Now the House must decide on the political follow-up to all this, and I hope that common sense will prevail."
"An immediate motion of censure condemning the Commission's policy naturally appeals to some people's imagination, simply because they hope it will look good in the media, but it would be a destructive step to take at a time when we are trying to give people constructive reasons to have confidence in us."
"What is more, the mistakes which caused the problem to escalate are not the fault of today's Commission, but of the United Kingdom, previous Commissions and the Council, whose presidency is conspicuous by its absence here."
"And an immediate motion of censure would mean postponing other measures which cannot be delayed."
"What we must do, ladies and gentlemen, is not provide bread and circuses for the public, but prove that we are capable of using the instruments of power available to us as they were intended, so as to ensure that we have a policy which guarantees the highest possible food quality."
"We have already heard a great deal of talk about how to achieve this."
"If everyone comes to realize that the long-term interests of farmers and consumers go hand in hand and acts accordingly, then we shall be back on the right track."
"It is also time to put the spotlight back on ethics again."
"Ethical considerations make life easier because they rule out certain choices from the start."
"This is not one of my own ideas, it was an idea that was put forward by the President of the present Commission at a bioethics conference at the end of the 1980s."
"I leave it to you to judge whether actions speak louder than words."
"Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, for the time being we are happy to accept your statement of intent, but we also expect you to act on it."
"How far you succeed will determine whether concern for the public interest is restored to its rightful place, which is why we shall have to monitor your actions very closely."
"But there is another reason why we must hope that you succeed in implementing your planned reforms and Parliament's recommendations: our vote of confidence at the end of the year will depend on it."
"Mr President, reading the excellent report by Mr Manuel Medina was a shocking experience."
"It revealed the tangled web in which all concerned are involved in one way or another."
"Behind everything else, however, one senses the urgent desire of the government of one Member State to play down the BSE problem, even to the extent of blackmailing the other institutions."
"It is unfortunate that at least the previous Commission's officials and the Council, partly for this reason, on a number of occasions actually covered up the suspicions which had arisen, thereby preventing prompt measures to resolve the problem."
"The investigating bodies set up by the Commission with an advisory and monitoring remit later turned out to be very one-sided, and their scientific competence has also been called into question by Parliament's Committee of Inquiry."
"The main responsibility for the BSE crisis rests with the British Government. The previous Commission also bears a large measure of responsibility for the cover-up and for its indifferent management of the affair."
"Now it is necessary to carry out quickly the measures which Parliament's Committee of Inquiry has recommended."
"The present Commission should be judged above all in the light of the seriousness with which it bears the responsibility now conferred on it and how quickly and effectively it acts upon the Committee of Inquiry's proposals for improving administration and monitoring."
"The most important thing is the health of the European public."
"Mad cow disease must be eliminated and at the same time measures must be taken to ensure that nothing similar can happen in the future."
"A vote of no confidence in the Commission would not now promote the attainment of these objectives."
"In future it must be possible for Community decisions on human and animal health and the required Community legislation to be based on scientific knowledge which is as sound and impartial as objectively possible."
"Decisions which have been taken must be adhered to, and it must be possible to check effectively enough that they are watertight."
"The subsidiarity principle must not mean that one Member State has the right to deceive the others and to ignore Community legislation concerning human health while at the same time expecting the others to display budget solidarity, so that it is the others that end up having to pay."
"This is also a serious reminder to the Intergovernmental Conference of the areas where flexibility must not under any circumstances be permitted."
"It has already been said repeatedly here what is basically at stake: an agricultural policy in which it is imagined that nature can even be altered so as to turn ruminants into carnivores."
"Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by quoting from Karl Valentin: ' Everything may already have been said, but not yet by everyone!'"
"An unqualified motion of censure on the present Commission is not an appropriate political means of doing justice to the findings of the Committee of Inquiry."
"The committee has indeed identified some serious breaches of consumer protection, but at the same time it has become clear that too little effort was made to prevent the spread of the disease, with its disastrous consequences."
"Many farmers in Europe have therefore had their livelihoods seriously damaged, and some have been completely ruined."
"That point has not yet been made today."
"Meat processing businesses have gone bankrupt, because at times the trade in beef came to a complete standstill."
"Furthermore, an unprecedented degree of uncertainty has been created among consumers."
"This is a question of general responsibility."
"In the forefront there is one Member State which bears a large proportion of the blame for today's debacle."
"However, both the Commission and the Council of Ministers, together with the scientific committees, have also seriously neglected their duty of care."
"The Committee of Inquiry has clearly demonstrated the inability of the authorities in question to take effective measures to combat the disease."
"With our motion for a resolution, we wish to usher in a new beginning, so as to avoid such catastrophes in future."
"Although Parliament, through Mr Böge, myself and many other colleagues, sent specific proposals to the Commission and the Council as long ago as 1989 and 1990, these have never been taken into consideration."
"The European Parliament is therefore calling for a full right of codecision in all areas of agriculture policy, since effective combating of disease must involve animal marking, clear guidelines and certification in the production of feed, and also strict controls."
"The internal market can only function with appropriate legal bases."
"Through our resolution, the Commission is being given an opportunity to introduce an improved strategy for combating disease and for protecting human and animal health."
"You now have the chance, Mr President of the Commission, of doing precisely this in conjunction with Parliament."
"Finally, I should like to thank Mr Medina Ortega and Mr Böge."
"Your work has been excellent and exemplary, and we have gladly played our part in it."
"Now it is your turn to do something sensible with us!"
"Mr President, I should like to join previous speakers in congratulating both the committee chairman, Mr Böge, and the rapporteur, Mr Medina, on their work in the committee."
"I believe that the objective of investigating alleged contraventions or maladministration in the implementation of Community law in relation to BSE has been met in full, and that reading part A of this report will answer any questions in that respect."
"We are also bound to mention a factor which is noted in the report itself, and that is the obstructive attitude adopted by the Commission and the British Ministry of Agriculture, which could surely have cooperated more fully in clarifying certain points."
"I should like to underline the three sets of responsibilities highlighted in Mr Medina's report."
"Firstly, there are the responsibilities of the British authorities, in terms of their failure to implement stringent animal or human health measures, their total lack of control over the manufacturing of meat-and-bone meal, their indifference to the fate of British meal exports, and the pressure they brought to bear on the Commission and the governments of other Member States - including my own - to relax or lift the embargo on beef and, subsequently, on gelatine, tallow and semen."
"As the rapporteur makes clear, it was not so much a question of a lack of standards or legislative provisions, as of a refusal to abide by the rules of fair and open cooperation which must govern relations between the Member States of the Union."
"Secondly, there are the responsibilities of the Council."
"And, thirdly, there are the responsibilities of the Commission, mainly its mishandling of the BSE crisis, which is closely linked to Commissioner MacSharry, and in which the stability of the beef market was given priority over the protection of human health, and a clear policy of disinformation and minimization was conducted."
"There was a widespread lack of coordination between the relevant Commission departments, and a failure to attach sufficient importance to the protection of public health in the Union."
"Lastly, there were no veterinary inspections."
"All in all, the Commission left a great deal to be desired in its handling of the BSE crisis, and committed serious errors and omissions."
"I therefore support all the rapporteur's recommendations for the future - although at least two of them, in my view, deserve to be highlighted."
"The first concerns the need for the Commission and Parliament to set up a joint body to monitor and review the measures to be adopted, including those that President Santer has set out in Parliament's debate today."
"And the second concerns the need to ensure the transparency of the debates of the advisory scientific committees and, in general, to reform the rules governing their work in such a way as to safeguard their independence and advisory function."
"Only if we draw the necessary conclusions from the mishandling of this crisis will we be able to prevent a repetition of the errors that were made."
"I shall conclude by saying, Mr President, that as the rapporteur points out in his report, since the creation of the European Community, no single issue has affected people's daily lives as much as this."
"We are obliged to repair the damage which the BSE crisis has caused to the idea of Europe throughout European public opinion."
"Mr President, mass livestock farming, mass consumption, mass culling - this road to disaster needs to be avoided."
"There is no doubt that there have been serious failures of crisis management with regard to BSE: firstly by the British Government, as our group chairman Mr Martens said, and by the Commission in the period from 1990 to 1994."
"It is therefore essential for the Commission as an institution to be called to account, on the basis of the joint motion for a resolution tabled by the PPE and PSE Groups."
"This does not mention blame, but specifically invokes the Commission's responsibility for implementing the recommendations of the Committee of Inquiry."
"Moreover, individual and disciplinary measures must be taken in respect of the officials concerned."
"The fact that the President of the Commission himself, Mr Santer, has admitted to mistakes reinforces our belief that this Commission is able and willing to do all it can to avoid a repetition of the errors of the past, and to justify the confidence which our chairman Mr Martens expressed in the Commission on behalf of the 15 delegations in the PPE Group."
"The declaration that priority will be given to consumer protection and health policy in the EU is an important signal, not least for the citizens of Austria."
"I would particularly highlight the Commission's intention only to have recourse in future to scientists whose independence is guaranteed."
"Another welcome reform is the checks introduced between this stage and legislation."
"We are pleased to see that the European Parliament, as the representative of our citizens, is gaining increased codecision in matters of health, consumer protection and agriculture, and also that at the Intergovernmental Conference, Article 129 will be amended so that our citizens' health will take priority over all other interests."
"It may be that today we have seen a turning-point in the relations between the European Parliament and the Commission."
"Perhaps these can now be placed on a new footing, after the salutary shock provided by the BSE crisis."
"Like the chairman of the PSE Group, Mrs Green, we too are ready to put our trust in the Commission for the time being, but we shall remain vigilant in the interest of our citizens."
"Mr President, the development of the European Union will depend on whether its citizens espouse the idea of European integration because they feel that their interests are being represented."
"A policy which gives priority to business over people and which puts the functioning of the market above public health is letting down the citizens of Europe and thereby ultimately calling into question what it professed to support."
"Mr Santer, you have spoken of a health union today and announced many changes."
"But surely these changes, or at least some of them, would have been possible at the start of your Commission's term of office?"
"Was a crisis such as BSE really necessary to prompt you to act and introduce reforms?"
"The report of the Committee of Inquiry, for which I am extremely grateful to Mr Medina, has identified omissions, errors and shortcomings and - just as importantly - made proposals for the future: reforms which are necessary to protect public health, to restore the confidence of our citizens and to allow for democratic controls."
"However, that means giving responsibility for food issues to the Commissioner who deals with consumer protection, together with all the necessary resources!"
"It means using Article 100a as the legal basis for all the legislation on food!"
"It means having public access to the reasons behind decisions, with transparency in the scientific committees and advisory bodies, and in the allocation of studies and the organization of seminars."
"It means creating a European equivalent of the US Food and Drug Agency, with all the independence that is required."
"I therefore expect that the green paper on the future of food - which was announced a year ago, and to which several of my colleagues have referred - will contain these necessary reforms, since otherwise there is no point in discussing it."
"I now expect that action will be taken quickly, and that the Intergovernmental Conference will be used to discuss with the Member States the necessary reforms of the institutions."
"For this reason, I am opposed to a censure motion at the present time."
"If heads are made to roll, it does not mean that reforms can actually take place, but without these reforms - which have been announced, and which I hope will not remain simply announcements, and Parliament will be monitoring this very closely - there can be no further development of the European Union."
"But surely that is what we all ultimately wish to see!"
"Mr President, as we near the end of the debate, I should like to say that, on the whole, we have had a discussion which has taken due account of the seriousness of the crisis, and of the results of the Committee of Inquiry."
"If the cow is sick in the head, Mr Santer, you will not persuade anyone that the meat may be good to eat, even if that were to be the case."
"The fact has simply been underestimated that in matters of food - and they deal with it every day - the citizens of Europe are extremely sensitive in their reactions, sometimes even hypersensitive, and react much more strongly than in many other areas where the risks to health could well be greater."
"Firstly, Mr Santer - and I very much welcome the fact - you have already adopted a number of absolutely essential reforms and, secondly, you have made some important announcements."
"I see that as extremely positive."
"I would also point out that, after a great deal of toing and froing, there has been some movement on the part of the Commission both as regards the question of the ban on avopacin and the assessment of limit values for baby food."
"These are what one might call side-effects of the inquiry into BSE, and we take a positive view of them."
"But I am also bound to say, Mr Santer, that there is of course a certain discrepancy in terms of the acknowledgement of mistakes which we have identified and the multitude of announcements."
"I would make it very clear: we could have saved ourselves two months of work in the Committee of Inquiry if we had been given the whole truth in September in the initial answers on gelatine, in that phoney debate."
"Likewise, we could have reached better conclusions in our work if we had not been given a cover-up answer on the absence of checks in the period 1990 to 1994."
"We could have saved a very great deal of time."
"And this continues to justify the criticism of the way in which some findings were dealt with which we uncovered."
"However, that is why it is so important - and I am finishing, Mr President - firstly that we in Parliament do not release ourselves from the obligation, having achieved this common ground, to now also take things forward together; and, secondly, that we do not release the Commission from its special duty of care, on the basis of paragraph 7 of the joint motion for a resolution."
"Mr President, as I listened carefully to Mr Santer the following scene came into my mind: a ship, caught up in a great storm, is in danger of drifting on to rocks and breaking up, and the captain, instead of sending out an SOS to try to save the situation, sits in his cabin writing in the ship's log the provisions that he intends to buy in the port, assuming that he arrives there..."
"The arguments put to us here today by Mr Santer concerning the political responsibilities of the present Commission as regards the gelatin issue are the ones that he put to us at his previous appearance here before Christmas, when he failed to convince any of the members of the Committee of Inquiry which has since unanimously pointed the finger of blame at the Commission."
"I cannot understand why he did not propose today one of the measures that the committee recommends, namely the rescinding of the decision on gelatin."
"It is not because of the Commission that the decision has not been given practical effect, but because the United Kingdom government has not requested an export licence - and I point that out in order to acquaint this House with the true facts."
"The Commission has referred to changes in its working practices, but there has been no mention of the counterarguments of the commissioners who disagree with the changes, and nothing has been said about which changes are to be made at Directorate-General V1. We agree that appropriations and money are required for the investigation not just of BSE but also of new diseases."
"We understand the situation. Having violated nature in the name of economic growth, we are being faced every day with new problems and new, unknown, diseases, and those diseases have to be investigated as well, of course."
"In the course of our own investigations something else quite deplorable took me by surprise: the 15 Member States are equal under the Treaty, but we noted that some are more equal than others."
"One such is the United Kingdom: effectively it rejected Community controls, and the Commission acquiesced in that situation."
"Yet at a time when BSE was wiping out the herds of the United Kingdom, 34 of the 40 inspectors - and be reminded of the Commission's claim that it is short of inspectors - spent a long time in Greece."
"Why were they there? They were investigating swine fever."
"And quite rightly so, but it did not need so many of them because the presence of the disease in Greece and Germany had already been notified and a general ban had been imposed on meat from all of the regions from the very outset."
"A month ago, Mr President, in Strasbourg, I met the mother of a young British man, aged 19, who had died from Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease."
"With great dignity, she said to us: ' I cannot get justice from the government of the United Kingdom, and I just want your Parliament to tell me who is to blame.'"
"I believe that Mr Medina Ortega's report, this splendid report, gives the answer."
"The material that we gathered with such difficulty under the guidance of the committee chairman, Mr Böge, is, I think, material that can be used by any interested party for the attribution of criminal and civil responsibility, since we ourselves do not have that competence."
"Mr President I want to put on record one part of the United Kingdom that has been seriously wronged in all of this awful mess that we are in, and that is Northern Ireland."
"No part of this Community has a traceable system like the system in Northern Ireland."
"No part of this Community has a better health record and no part of this Community has done everything in its power to conform to what this Commission has said."
"Yet we find that part of the United Kingdom is sinned against not only by the British Government, but also by this Community."
"I hope that this Community will take note of what I have said."
"I have said it to the Commissioner - and the Commissioner agreed with Mr John Hume and myself and Mr Nicholson - that we were streets ahead of other parts of the Community as far as animal health is concerned."
"I hope that this great wrong which has been done to Northern Ireland will be put right."
"Thank you, Mr Paisley."
"Ladies and gentlemen, with Mr Paisley's speech, we have come to the end of the list of speakers, and I am informed that the Commission now wishes to speak."
"Mr Fischler will speak first, then Mrs Bonino, and lastly President Santer."
"I therefore give the floor to Mr Fischler."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of this debate, which for me has had four distinguishing features: it has been a very clear debate, a very constructive one for long periods - I would even say the most intellectual debate I have experienced since I began attending Parliament - and an extremely exciting debate."
"President Santer has set out the Commission's policy very clearly, and there is no need for me to repeat all of that here."
"At the same time, this policy provides the answer to most of the questions which have been raised."
"I too will try to state my views clearly and concisely on a number of points."
"Mr Martens put two questions to me. Firstly, there was the decision on gelatine."
"Mr Böge himself said in his speech that there had been a phoney debate on this issue."
"I can only agree with him there, because not an ounce of British gelatine has left or will leave the United Kingdom without every possible guarantee of safety."
"As I have already explained to the House, the decision on gelatine has been put on ice."
"The Commission based its decision on the opinion of the Scientific Veterinary Committee, which enlarged on the scientific knowledge available at the time."
"In the meantime, however, the state of knowledge has changed."
"Therefore, until all the new questions which have arisen have been clarified, the de facto export ban remains in place."
"The second question was the provision of information to the Committee of Inquiry."
"Mr Santer has referred to the instructions which I gave."
"I do not think any further comment is needed on my part."
"However, Mr Böge also drew attention to the key point here today, which is that we should learn lessons for the future from this debate - all of us!"
"I entirely agree with that in substance, and I would even stress that much more is at issue here than just the question of BSE."
"For some years now - not least in my previous activities - I have been pursuing a new concept, a new approach to agriculture policy which I have to say has not always met with unqualified approval."
"Let me mention some of the principles which I regard as crucial for the future."
"Firstly, in my policy I am building on the alliance between the consumer and the farmer."
"Secondly, I think we must all recognize that quality is more important than quantity!"
"Thirdly, protecting health and the environment must be our constant concern."
"What do I mean by that?"
"Today, the consumer has a right to expect that, from the barn or the field to the table, continuous checks and quality assurance are guaranteed."
"It is also a question of farmers embracing the principle of sustainability, which includes animal protection and keeping livestock in an appropriate way."
"These are not merely statements and announcements, ladies and gentlemen."
"I have also launched a series of practical measures."
"I would remind you of the hormone conference, of the conference in Cork, of the extension of the organic farming regulation to animal products, of my initiative to simplify all the veterinary legislation, and of the ban on veal crates."
"I am pleased to say that several of these proposals were also received favourably by Parliament, and I am counting on further cooperation in the future, as has indeed been called for."
"I have a further comment in this context on BSE."
"I should like to point out that some important initiatives have also been taken here by the Commission."
"I would remind the House that before the crisis was discussed in March last year, the so-called Weissmann Group was set up by me to devise a new research programme for this entire sector."
"And I would remind you that it was the Commission which introduced the export ban in March."
"It was the Commission too which proposed the packages of measures which the United Kingdom has to implement, and a proposal is also now before Parliament for improved animal marking and better labelling of meat products."
"I do agree with one thing, however: we need much more transparency."
"I believe that here too our model, for example the way in which we organized the hormone conference, has been a pointer for how to deal with such questions publicly in the future."
"A reform of the advisory committees for agriculture is now imminent, and controls in the health sector have also been proposed, as Mr Santer mentioned."
"I believe that the Commission and Parliament need to chart this new course in agriculture policy together."
"One thing must be clear: to do this, we first need the expression of confidence which you have given us today and, for my part at least, I shall do all in my power to do that justice."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall be quite brief at the end of this debate, since today I mainly wish to let you know my feelings, which are that there are no miracle solutions, and we must all be aware of that."
"However, on the part of the Commission there is a firm political commitment, a wish for transparency and good will."
"The challenge which the Commission and Parliament must take up is enormous: we have to invent a European model of public health monitoring and protection."
"It is indeed a challenge, because no such model currently exists."
"We must all display a spirit of inventiveness and responsibility."
"According to my initial understanding of this dossier, we have no more than an embryonic capacity for inspection and control."
"I wonder, for example, if there is not a need to revise the inspections mandate."
"I am also wondering about the legislative process, since it must result in overall coherence: it is not enough just to transfer the departments of DG VI to DG XXIV."
"There are enormous problems to resolve, therefore."
"We must get the mix right: we have the ingredients, let us first see if we have enough of them, and then let us turn them into policy - and that will be no easy matter."
"Nevertheless, an initial set of measures have been adopted at administrative level."
"And, as President Santer rightly said, this is only a first step."
"For the rest, we have sketched the broad outlines. We still have to flesh out our proposals and give ourselves the means to implement them - and that is also a challenge."
"We have launched an internal audit to determine the scale of the resources needed."
"I wish to say that I am entirely prepared to have an initial meeting with you towards the middle of March, as soon as the audit has been completed, that is."
"I have no illusions: three weeks from now, my ideas will not be perfectly clear - quite the opposite."
"That is why I wish to seek your views on the health monitoring policy that we must put in place."
"Then I intend to come back to Parliament in April - before presenting the official communication which Mr Santer referred to - so that we can define together a model that will enable us to rise to the challenges."
"Furthermore, it is not only the BSE affair that is at issue: there are a number of other dossiers - to which you have referred - which are receiving our full attention, not to say giving us cause for concern."
"There is a legislative problem, ranging from the green paper proposals to the question of product liability - but I shall not list everything."
"You are well aware of the dossier's complexity."
"We must summon up all our energy, capacity for invention and sense of responsibility."
"Many of you have experience in this field."
"I consider it my duty to drawn on everyone's experience, whether at the level of consumer associations or ministries - as you will already have observed."
"Moreover, in my hearing before Parliament two years ago, I was questioned on my responsibilities, but I did not have these responsibilities at the time."
"It would therefore be wise for us to agree on an appropriate model of health monitoring and protection for our fellow citizens."
"As I said at the beginning of my speech, there are no miracle or overnight solutions, and we must all be aware of that."
"We need resources: if we wish to implement policies, we must provide ourselves with the necessary means."
"And I am counting on your support in this, because as Mr Böge rightly said, we have a natural alliance."
"We still have to make that alliance bear fruit."
"Thank you, and, if I understand things correctly, we shall be seeing each other again before long."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened very carefully to the numerous speakers in this important debate."
"Commissioners Fischler and Bonino have responded to a number of observations and let you know their feelings at this stage."
"I do not wish to reopen this debate, which has been extremely dense, but constructive."
"I should like to say firstly that you, the Members of the European Parliament, have done your job by presenting and debating the report of the Committee of Inquiry."
"And I am able to say with confidence that the Commission will continue to do its job, in the interest of Europe's citizens."
"Like you, I would have wished the Council - which, as an institution, is equally involved in this affair - to take part in this debate."
"Over and above its political differences, Parliament as a whole is concerned to ensure that, from now on, considerations of human health are taken more into account in the framing of Community policies."
"I share that concern."
"I said so earlier, and I indicated the practical measures to be taken in my speech."
"As for the Commission, in the light of the committee's conclusions, it will do everything it considers necessary, in accordance with its institutional prerogatives and its sense of the general European interest."
"And I hope that others - for example the European Parliament - will have the courage to break certain taboos when we come to discuss food policy and the future of the CAP."
"Mr President, I said in my speech that I wished to assume the responsibility of the College of Commissioners - and I take that word seriously."
"I must say to you, in all honesty, that that is what I have been doing at the head of the Commission for the last two years."
"All the measures we have taken since the British Government's announcement of new scientific data last March have been guided by that principle."
"There was the decision to introduce a total embargo immediately, despite the vigorous protests of the British Government. And that embargo is still in force."
"There was the decision in principle to lift conditionally the embargo on certain derived products, which was taken on the basis of the scientific data available to the Commission at the time."
"I would stress, moreover, that that decision was not implemented in practice, for the reasons that Mr Fischler has just given."
"And, lastly, there was the proposal for a framework agreement, which was adopted by consensus at the Florence summit. That agreement lays down extremely strict rules for examining any request for the lifting of the embargo, partial or otherwise."
"In conclusion, I wish to reiterate - as Mrs Bonino has just done - the Commission's commitment to cooperating with Parliament, with due regard for our respective competences."
"Similarly, I welcome the offer of cooperation that Parliament has made."
"That is how I interpret the report presented and debated this afternoon."
"As Mrs Bonino just said, the Commission is prepared to keep Parliament regularly informed of the progress of its work."
"May some good come from this disaster, and may Europe become a better place to live for its citizens: that, ladies and gentlemen, is my most fervent wish."
"Thank you, Mr Santer."
"Ladies and gentlemen, with Mr Santer's speech, the joint debate on the BSE crisis is closed."
"The vote on the Medina Ortega report and the eight motions for resolutions will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The vote on the motion of censure will take place on Thursday at 3 p.m."
"(The sitting was suspended at 7.40 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)"
"Question Time (Commission)"
"The next item is Question Time to the Commission (B4-0001/97)."
"Question No 44 by Gary Titley (H-0014/97)"
"Subject: Failure of Member States to recognize each others' academic and professional qualifications"
"A constituent of mine, a highly qualified Modern Languages teacher married to a Frenchman, has found that her qualifications are not recognized by the French authorities."
"She has consequently not been able to find appropriate work teaching languages in French schools."
"What action is the Commission taking to ensure mutual recognition of language teaching qualifications?"
"What comments does the Commissioner have on the French authorities' approach?"
"The Commission is aware of the matter raised by the honourable member."
"The Commission's services have received numerous complaints about the problems encountered in France by teachers coming from other Member States."
"As far as teachers are concerned, in fact, the applicable directive is 89/48/EEC, which relates to a general system for the recognition of higher education diplomas gained as a result of professional training courses lasting a minimum of three years."
"The basic principle of that directive is that the host Member State must permit a Community citizen to carry on a profession within its territory even if he is not in possession of the national diploma required for that purpose, provided that he is in possession of the diploma required in a different Member State in order to embark upon or carry on the same profession."
"This recognition confers upon the migrant worker the right to embark upon or carry on the profession in question on the same conditions as a holder of the national diploma."
"When the appointment of teachers takes place by means of a competitive examination - as is the case in France where public education is concerned - recognition authorizes migrants to participate in the competition, though without offering any guarantee that they will be successful."
"The French authorities can, furthermore, require migrant teachers to undergo a probationary period on the same conditions as French citizens."
"They may not, however, require Community citizens who are already teaching in another Member State to take the French training course in order to earn the diploma required in France."
"That is the background, and the conclusion drawn from that background, given the circumstances, is that the Commission has instituted proceedings for infringement against France, pursuant to Article 169 of the Treaty, with regard to its failure to apply to teachers the Community rules on the reciprocal recognition of diplomas."
"I am delighted to hear that the Commission is taking action on this matter because the constituent of mine who I referred to has a first-class degree at an English university in French and German, is a fully qualified teacher in the United Kingdom and has a Master of Arts in German."
"Her mistake was to marry a Frenchman and go and live in France where she has been refused employment as a teacher despite having considerable experience of teaching."
"In fact, the only employment she can get is with French private schools as an animatrice , which is a very low grade of occupation."
"So dire has the situation become that this lady is now proposing to return with her baby to the United Kingdom to find work, leaving her husband in France, and intends only joining him during the school holidays."
"Forty years of integration have ended up with a divided family despite all the fine words about mutual recognition of qualifications."
"I can therefore only urge the Commission to take the most effective and rapid action."
"Forty years after the Treaty of Rome it is not good enough that we are dividing families in this way."
"I should just like to stress again, after the remarks by the Member of Parliament, that the Commission is making use of the measures provided for by the Treaty."
"There are currently two infringement procedures under Article 169 of the Treaty and, if necessary, the Commission would not hesitate to bring the matter before the Court of Justice."
"Mr President, I too was very pleased with the Commissioner's answer."
"On a slightly broader point, I wonder if he could say what progress, if any, has been made in bringing professional bodies in other areas together to persuade them to recognize qualifications in each of the Member States."
"In particular, there seems to be a problem with university degrees."
"Professional bodies, say in the United Kingdom, recognize that a degree in law from a British university goes some way to meeting the professional qualifications for a lawyer but not necessarily a degree in law from a French university."
"Perhaps law is not the best example because of the different legal systems."
"But it might be the same in architecture or any other profession."
"Clearly if the same rights of accreditation are not universal throughout the European Union, this does amount to a restriction on the mobility of labour and harms the single market."
"Yes, this is a very general and important question."
"I will provide a general answer by saying that this is indeed a key aspect of free movement of people and of effective citizenship in the Union."
"We are addressing this sort of problem by combining three facets of action: information, enforcement and finding out whether further legislative action is needed."
"Regarding information, you all know the Citizens First programme through which we convey to our citizens effective information on how to work in another Member State of the European Union."
"This is useful because it provides citizens with this information, and provides useful feedback about the obstacles they actually encounter."
"Regarding infringements, I just mentioned one case vis-à-vis one Member State."
"Finally, the third aspect of our action is finding out whether any further legislative action is needed."
"May I remind Members of Parliament that the free movement of people falls within the remit of the high-level group shared by Mrs Simone Veil."
"Through her help and the help of her colleagues we are finding out whether any further legislative action may be required in this field."
"Question No 45 by Per Stenmarck (H-0044/97)"
"Subject: Tax-free sales in the EU"
"In Written Question E-3061/96, I argued that an impact assessment should be carried out before tax-free sales are abolished on ferries operating between EU Member States."
"I asked the Commission whether it was prepared to carry out an analysis of various aspects."
"The answer given by Commissioner Monti (20 January 1997) indicates that tax-free sales will be abolished on 30 June 1999."
"No study of the impact this will have on employment, export industries, the price of goods and tourism would be carried out."
"Those responsible for taking decisions must spend as much time as possible seeking answers to questions concerning the possible impact of their decisions before actually taking those decisions."
"What impact will the abolition of tax-free sales with effect from 30 June 1999 have in the areas referred to above?"
"This is a recurring theme, and an important one. The Commission can only confirm its answer to the honourable Member's written question E-3061/96."
"The Commission has to comply with the Council decision abolishing - from 30 June 1999 - duty-free sales within the Union."
"The Commission does not consider it appropriate to undertake a study of this matter."
"In any case, the Commission regrets that, hitherto, the sector of activity concerned has not taken advantage of the lengthy period available to it to prepare a strategy for adjusting to the abolition of the tax advantage deriving from these sales, even though five years have passed since this decision was adopted."
"I may add that the Commission is convinced that, since a study is not necessary, the mere fact of announcing it would send a distorted and inappropriate signal to the industry concerned, which could further delay the adjustments required for that industry to adapt to the decision adopted so many years ago and due to take effect on 30 June 1999."
"Commissioner, I have asked this question and a number of other questions on the same subject in order to ascertain whether we are living up to what we say, and whether we are prepared to accept the logical conclusions of those things we continuously maintain are so important."
"When tax free shopping is abolished, there will be consequences, there is no point in closing our eyes to this."
"Despite this, we have not undertaken any form of analysis worthy of such a name before taking a decision on the matter."
"This is why I am asking that we do this now before the decision comes into force and I think that we should postpone bringing the legislation into force pending this analysis."
"We must surely be aware of what we are doing before we do it."
"A number of EU Member States have carried out their own analysis of what is likely to happen."
"If we weigh it all up together, we are talking about a reduction in income of perhaps 4 million ECUs and approximately 100 000 jobs throughout the EU will disappear."
"Even if this figure is an exaggeration, half that figure would still be disastrous, particularly as we are striving to reduce unemployment not increase it."
"The question is: Are we prepared to accept these consequences while continuing to maintain elsewhere that we are doing all we can to reduce unemployment?"
"I must make it clear to the honourable Member that the decision under discussion is a binding decision, that all the facts relevant for the purposes of taking an informed decision were taken into account at the time, that the existence of intra-community duty-free goods was considered incompatible in principle with a single market, and that, as often happens in economic affairs, while the existence of the duty-free system offers advantages for some there are very serious disadvantages for others: for example, the general retail trade is certainly damaged by the existence of duty-free sales in certain locations."
"The duty-free system, for example, distorts competition between modes of transport, and so on."
"All these are considerations which were duly taken into account at the time the decisions were taken."
"What must be borne in mind is that an unusually long period of adjustment was in fact allowed, which can best be put to use not by conducting and repeating studies of a familiar situation but by the operators concerned working out the necessary adaptations and adjustments which will be required by the new situation, a situation that was announced some while ago."
"Mr President, I have a further question concerning the same subject so I am attaching it to Mr Stenmark's question."
"I agree with the Commissioner that this is a matter of principle for the free internal market."
"If we follow principles, then tax free shopping must be abolished and not continue to be part of the internal market."
"But sometimes reality is in conflict with principles."
"Then the question is whether we should stick to our principles or adapt to reality as it stands."
"As it happens the Swedish Maritime Authorities have carried out a study which I have here in my hand."
"It shows that a large number of jobs will disappear in Sweden in those areas dependent on shipping."
"What am I to say, as someone who comes from a port area and who is continuously fighting for employment in Europe and telling my people that the European Union is also active in this area, what am I to say to those who work in the ports if we abolish tax free shopping?"
"They will not believe a word I say about tackling unemployment."
"In this case I think that we should put aside our principles in favour of reality, in other words, we must accept that employment is the key issue at present for the European Union."
"As you know, the great undertaking of constructing the single market has one primary aim: making the European economy more competitive and so benefiting employment."
"The reality to which my attention is drawn is a reality in which, today, certain jobs in specific sectors are certainly assisted by the existence of duty-free."
"But we have to remember that those jobs have to be set off against the non-existent jobs in other sectors, in other modes of transport, in commerce at large, by which I mean the retail sector, outside the duty-free industry."
"So it is precisely the need to have a workable single European market that obliges us to eliminate these distortions that make it less efficient, among which I must certainly include the distortion represented by duty-free sales."
"I would also like to point out that, in the case of airports for example, duty-free sales would certainly not be abolished on extra-community flights, and I must emphasize that one of the advantages of the shops and stores that exist at airports, quite apart from the tax advantage, is that they are able to appeal to a public which has time to spare while waiting for a flight and would undoubtedly make purchases even irrespective of the abolition of the tax advantage."
"Firstly, I would like to say that I am not a particularly strong supporter of tax free shopping per se, but I am quite concerned about the consequences of abolishing it."
"To cite a concrete example: many ferry lines cross the Baltic Sea."
"All the shipping companies have problems with profitability and tax free shopping represents a relatively large proportion of the income for these companies."
"North of Stockholm, there is only line operating all year round between Sweden and Finland, the line between Umeå and Vasa."
"It is very doubtful if this line will even survive if tax free shopping is abolished."
"This would break up the close cooperation between these regions which are in otherwise receiving support from the EU via Interreg, support which is particularly allocated to cooperation on lines of communication."
"It also means that trucks will have to travel hundreds or perhaps thousands of kilometres further."
"Will the Commission be introducing special measures to ensure that important lines of communication, which are already supported by the EU, will survive the abolition of tax free shopping if there are particular reasons to do so?"
"This argument is often put forward, namely that tax-free sales constitute a source of funding for transport infrastructures, or for certain forms of transport, in particular through the fees - often quite high - which the operators of sales outlets have to pay in order to pursue their activities within these infrastructures - airports especially, but also others."
"As regards tax-free sales on board ferries, for example, there is no doubt that these represent a not inconsiderable part of shipping companies' revenue, enabling them to offset their running costs and even to maintain unprofitable routes."
"Tax-free sales could therefore be regarded as operating subsidies in the transport sector."
"The Commission takes the view that if a subsidy is to be provided by the Community in this area, then specific solutions should be sought which are separate from indirect taxation mechanisms."
"We are all, I think, in favour of transparency."
"If state aid is deemed necessary, it should be requested, evaluated and, if appropriate, authorized as state aid - and not take place in a disguised way, through taxation, in contravention of the principles of the single market."
"I will allow Mr Watt to speak, despite the stipulation in the Rules of Procedure that only two persons may put supplementary questions."
"Mr Watt, you should know that the Rules of Procedure state that only one or two other Members are entitled to put supplementaries in addition to the author of the question."
"The Commissioner referred to the disadvantages of duty-free and he cited a number of areas where be believed there was a negative impact on, for example, the retail sector and the transport sector."
"Would the Commissioner make available to this Parliament the studies that back up these assertions?"
"I made a number of assertions which are based on a number of elements from several sources accumulated over time."
"I confirm that the Commission has no intention of making any further study."
"This was, on the other hand, also the position which emerged from recent consideration of this matter at the ECOFIN Council."
"Question No 47, by Mrs Kirsten Jensen, is not called, as the subject is on the agenda for the partsession and will be debated on Friday."
"As the authors are not present, Questions Nos 46, 47 and 48 lapse."
"Mr President, I should like to consult you on a point of order."
"Is it possible to take over another Member's question."
"No?"
"Very well."
"Question No 49 by Mark Watts (H-1041/96)"
"Subject: Channel Tunnel safety"
"The Commission will be aware of the serious fire in the Channel Tunnel on 19 November 1996."
"What action, under Article 75(1)(c) of the Treaty, 'measures to improve transport safety', has the Commission taken with regard to the Channel Tunnel?"
"What representations has the Commission made to the UK and French governments concerning safety in the Channel Tunnel, and has any reference been made to the design of the freight wagons?"
"Is the Commission concerned that the UK Government refuses to release safety reports on the Channel Tunnel, and will the Council make representations to release this evidence?"
"Will the Commission make a statement on the fire in the Channel Tunnel?"
"As the honourable Member may recall, I said during the Committee on Transport and Tourism meeting on 18 December that the Commission attaches the greatest importance to maintaining the very highest level of safety that is usual in rail transport."
"Clearly safety is a major objective of the common transport policy and it is essential that all forms of rail transport, including the channel tunnel, are at least as safe as conventional rail."
"At present the Commission is not aware that there is any evidence to show that relevant Community legislation has been called into question by the accident in the tunnel."
"When the results of various investigations become available the issue of Community action might then need to be considered."
"Inquiries into accidents which occur during railway operation are, as I think the honourable Member may know, strictly within the legal competence of Member States."
"I can, however, inform the House that the recently approved directive on the carriage of dangerous goods by rail specifically allows for higher than normal safety standards in the channel tunnel."
"The design of freight wagons is however not a matter for the Commission."
"Finally, the Commission is not aware that the United Kingdom has refused to supply information as suggested by the honourable Member."
"I am familiar with the honourable Member's very close and very active interest in all matters relating to the channel tunnel and I will certainly keep him informed of any developments which will be relevant to him."
"I would like to thank the Commissioner for his comprehensive reply."
"I understand that he has done his utmost within his competence as Commissioner to thoroughly oversee this matter where it falls under his responsibility."
"But I am sure he would understand my concern when he says he will comment when reports become available."
"We are seriously concerned that, for example, the French inquiry report will not be published or made available to the public and indeed, the deliberations of the channel tunnel safety authority will, not necessarily be made fully available, in particular all the background papers that related to the approval of the semiopen wagons which played a key role in causing and spreading the fire."
"Could the Commissioner not join with me in pleading with the British Government to open the books in this case and allow the public to judge for themselves whether or not the channel tunnel is safe?"
"That means publishing all the documents relating to the channel tunnel safety authority."
"Without those, I would submit that we are not able to judge whether or not the tunnel is safe."
"Mr President, I am grateful to the honourable gentleman."
"I think that the history of inquiry reports into major incidents of the kind that took place in the channel tunnel demonstrates that all authorities, as well as the general public and operators, have the greatest possible vested interest in the maximum openness."
"It is the one means that guarantees not only that lessons are learned but that lessons are seen to be learned."
"As the author is not present, Question No 50 lapses."
"Question No 51 by Nuala Ahern (H-0023/97)"
"Subject: Safety of coastal communities from radioactive shipments"
"At the time of the first shipment of highly radioactive vitrified nuclear waste from France to Japan in 1995, shipment took place without disclosure of information concerning the route."
"On arrival it was discovered that one of the canisters had corroded and was leaking radiation."
"With regard to the present shipment of highly radioactive vitrified nuclear waste that left France in January 97, what responsibility does a Member State (e.g. France) have to inform the Commission of the route that is being taken and has France so informed the Commission, and what measures has the Commission taken to inform and safeguard the coastal communities en route in the event of an emergency on board the ship, the Pacific Teal?"
"Within the European Union information to Member States and the Commission on the shipment of radioactive waste is ensured through the following two provisions: first, Council Directive 92/3 relates to the supervision and control of shipments of radioactive between Member States and into and out of the Community."
"It lays down a procedure for ensuring that shipments of radioactive waste take place only after all the states involved have given prior informed consent."
"Standard forms and documents for the application of this directive were established by a Commission decision in October 1993."
"Information to the Commission is ensured through reports on the implementation of the directive, which have to be submitted every two years by the Member States."
"Second, the information on transport by sea of radioactive materials, including radioactive waste, is also covered by Directive 93/75."
"This directive obliges the operators and masters of vessels carrying dangerous or polluting goods to provide the competent authorities of the Member State of destination or of departure with detailed information about the ship's intended route and cargo."
"The Commission does not receive direct information about individual shipments of radioactive material, nor does the Commission have the task of informing coastal states in case of an emergency on board."
"The provision of such information is, however, an obligation for the Member State concerned under the directive."
"Thank you for your reply, Commissioner, which was quite explicit."
"I understand that the Australian Government has been informed of this particular shipment."
"Could you confirm or deny that specifically?"
"If that is so - and your reply appears to indicate that Member States of the European Union would have prior information and give consent to shipments along their coastal highways and byways - then can you confirm that in the case of shipments along the Channel, the Bay of Biscay, the Irish Sea, the North Sea and the Atlantic coast of the European Union, all the Member States would have been informed of such shipments and would have consented to them?"
"Could you confirm that specifically?"
"I am grateful to the honourable Member."
"If she has particular information relating to Australia, I would be very happy if she were to write to me explicitly about it."
"Whilst clearly we do not have competence in this area, we certainly maintain interest."
"That would be supplemented by any information she can provide."
"On the whole question of transit shipping, a proposal for a Council directive setting up a European ship reporting system - so-called Eurorep - was adopted by the Commission in December 1993."
"It aims at extending the notification requirements of Directive 93/75 to all vessels carrying dangerous and polluting goods which are in transit off the European coast and bound for a country outside the European Union."
"However, in the absence of a political agreement in Council on the Commission's text, Eurorep is still on the table before the Council."
"The imminent ratification by the Community of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea gives a stronger legal basis to our proposal with regard to international law and hopefully that will allow a re-opening of the discussions within the Community on the proposal."
"I look forward to hearing further from the honourable Member."
"I should just like to say to Commissioner Kinnock that I will certainly write to him specifically about the Australian information."
"But can he tell me whether the Member States along the route have actually given permission for this transit?"
"It sounds from his answer that they should have."
"Have they actually done so?"
"Can he tell us that?"
"I will investigate that precise question and provide the honourable Member with the precise answer."
"Question No 52 by Florus Wijsenbeek (H-0030/97)"
"Subject: Aid to a Walloon transport undertaking"
"Does the Commission consider it consistent with the objectives pursued as regards both combined transport and equal conditions of competition for the Walloon government to grant aid amounting to Bfrs 200 million to the TTS (Bierset) road transport undertaking for the purchase of oversized rolling stock for the transport of motor-vehicle parts from Germany?"
"The Commission services first request the Member States concerned to supply full details of the aid within fifteen working days."
"If there is no answer or if the answer is incomplete, the Member State is again asked to give detailed information within another fifteen working days and is warned at that point by the Commission that the Commission has the power to issue an injunction."
"On the basis of the full information provided in the answer the Commission may decide to raise no objection to the aid or it may decide to raise no objection to the aid or it may decide to open proceedings under Article 93(2) because of doubts or because of lack of information."
"If the Member State has ignored the request for information, the Commission may issue an injunction to obtain the information."
"The injunction may also order the Member State to suspend payment of the aid pending the outcome of the investigation or the injunction can require the Member State to supply the information needed by the Commission to take a decision on the case."
"That was the best non-answer I have ever received from the Commission."
"The procedures are well known to me."
"I brought this matter to the Commission's attention especially and gave the information needed on what has happened because I would like the Commission to take a position and to tell us, as Members of Parliament, if it agrees with this kind of state subsidy or not."
"If it does not it should take immediate measures."
"So I would like to have the Commissioner's view on whether or not he deems this kind of support to be valid."
"The Commission was not aware of the existence of such financing but it sent a request for information to the Belgian authorities in order to establish whether there could be an unnotified state aid."
"It is difficult to accept that in providing a full and factual answer on the whole procedure of state aids, the Commission should be accused of providing non-answers."
"Accurate, truthful information is accurate truthful information."
"Question No 53 by Sören Wibe (H-0043/97)"
"Subject: Construction of the Bothnia line in northern Sweden"
"The Swedish government recently decided to build a new railway, the first stage of which is to run from Sundsvall to Umeå."
"The railway will improve access to northern Sweden and in future provide a link between northern Sweden and northern Finland."
"In the long term, a link is also planned into the Murmansk region."
"Might Sweden be eligible for EU support for the construction of this railway and, if so, from which part of the EU budget could such support be sought?"
"The Bothnia line is not presently included in the trans-European transport network and its inclusion was not requested by Parliament or by the Council during the procedure for the adoption of the trans-European network guidelines."
"As it is not considered as a project of common interest within the terms of the legislation it cannot benefit from financial support under the trans-European networks budget."
"Furthermore, as regional funds covering this area do not include transport infrastructure and the funds available bear no relation to the likely cost of the project, they cannot be used to co-finance the project either."
"I would like to thank the Commissioner for his answer even if it was rather negative."
"This concerns a railway line which lies a long way from here, perhaps 2 000 kilometres or more."
"It is however an extremely important line for the region involved, particularly for the transport of goods."
"I do not understand the Commissioner when he says that this has nothing to do with our common interest."
"This is a line which will quite obviously be used to link Northern Sweden and Northern Finland, and also North Western Russia at a later date, with the other European railway networks."
"The fact that it is not included in current plans is simply because the decision to build it was only taken quite recently."
"My next obvious question to Mr. Kinnock is whether it is totally out of the question to include this extremely important line ex post facto in the Transeuropean Railway Network."
"I am grateful to the honourable Member."
"Firstly, the idea of including the Bothnia line in the transEuropean networks is not - to use Mr Wibe's phrase - ruled out, simply because there has to be a revision of the guidelines in 1999."
"I would also point out to him that in order for any project to be considered for inclusion in the trans-European network, and therefore liable to be supported from the budget, it has to have the support or nomination of a Member State government."
"If the Bothnia line is not in the trans-European network proposal, it is firstly because it has not been nominated by a Member State, secondly because it was not included at the point of its parliamentary consideration and thirdly because on further consideration the Council did not include it. If there is a proposition from the Swedish Government and if the proper procedures are followed it is possible that the line could be included."
"But that is entirely up to the initiative of the Member State."
"Question No 54 by Hans Lindqvist (H-0047/97)"
"Subject: Scandinavian Express Loop"
"The prospects for improving links between a number of Swedish and Norwegian towns and cities by rail are currently being discussed in Sweden and Norway."
"The project, provisionally named the Scandinavian Express Loop, will establish a Stockholm-Östersund-Trondheim-Oslo-Stockholm rail loop."
"It also incorporates the Atlantbanan line, which was the subject of earlier discussions."
"The lines already exist but require upgrading to take express trains."
"What prospects does the Commission see for EU financial support being made available for this project?"
"The Atlantbanan line is included in Annex I of the Decision on Community guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network as a project of common interest."
"The southern section of the line is also included, as the honourable Member will know, in the Nordic Triangle, which is one of the fourteen priority projects endorsed at the Essen European Council and in the legal decision that has been presented to and accepted by this Parliament."
"The line is one of the components of the ambitious project called the Scandinavian Express Loop."
"As a project of common interest, the Swedish part of the line could benefit from Community financial support under the TEN budget line but as yet the national authorities concerned have not requested any Community contribution."
"On the basis of the information available, it does not appear that other Community funds could be used for funding this project."
"It seems indeed that the Swedish part of the line is going to be totally financed by the national railway infrastructure authority, the Banverket ."
"Thank you for your response, it was not as bad as I thought."
"It means that the planning process which is already underway between Sweden and Norway can continue, which perhaps would not otherwise have been the case."
"Irrespective of this, it is important that the line is included in that part of the planning process which allocates funds."
"It is a line which will go in a circle from Stockholm, to Östersund, then towards Norway across Trondheim and then to Oslo and back to Stockholm."
"My next question to the Commissioner is: What else does the Swedish government have to do to further its request for sufficient funds for this line?"
"Is it possible to approach Norway for funds, over and above the Interreg cooperation which exists between the countries and which already includes this line, to push this project forward?"
"I regret to say that as a result of the decision of the Norwegian people, that country is not in the European Union."
"Consequently there is no call we can make upon Norway so far as complementary development of infrastructure is concerned, even though I know that the good relationships between Norway and other countries does mean that there are joint attitudes in policy insofar as infrastructure is concerned."
"But unfortunately, as a result of the outcome of the referendum, giving positive messages to that country is not part of the Commission's function."
"So far as support from the TENs funds is concerned, the step that would have to be taken, as I pointed out in an earlier answer, is for the Swedish Government to make an application."
"This would have to receive due consideration."
"But because this particular project is recognized as being one of common interest, depending upon its maturity, the chances of its getting financial support from the Community would be at least as favourable as for comparable projects."
"Is there any possibility of including projects of transnational importance of this kind in the trans-European networks?"
"If so, how should the two governments concerned act upon that?"
"Presumably, as I am certain Mr Wijsenbeek knows, they should act positively and collectively, because of the terms of the provisions that exist under the current legislation, because of the need for a revision in 1999, because of the fact that these projects by definition have long planning and development periods."
"I hope that we can embrace projects of real trans-European value more widely in a future period than we can at the present time."
"Consequently I hope that Member State governments will bear in mind their responsibility for making initial proposals and do so in the context of the existing legislation and the nature of the trans-European network priority projects and, indeed, the whole philosophy of the network scheme."

"Question No 58 by Birgitta Ahlqvist (H-0032/97)"
"Subject: 'Learning in the information society: action plan for a European education initiative'"
"This action plan (COM(96)0471) is a welcome initiative on the Commission's part, but it should nonetheless be stressed that certain important considerations are simply ignored."
"There is no provision for handicapped people, although the latter surely count as major beneficiaries of the information society, given that new data processing technology allows the limitations imposed by certain handicaps to be reduced or even eliminated completely."
"With the end of the HELIOS programme, the Commission undertook to integrate the programme's objectives into all its policies."
"Would it not therefore be possible find a place (with appropriate budgetary funding) for the handicapped within the action plan in question?"
"The action plan for a European education initiative relates to primary and secondary education."
"Therefore, it includes as a target group all pupils attending schools at these levels, including handicapped children."
"It is clear that the new information and communications technologies, adapted for educational purposes, can make an effective contribution to the learning process for handicapped pupils, in particular those who have physical difficulties in attending school, but also those with cognitive difficulties."
"The implementation of the action plan is based on the use of existing programmes, such as Esprit, Telematics, Leonardo da Vinci and, above all, Socrates, within the framework of the corresponding decisions, procedures and budgets."
"As regards Socrates, the European Parliament and Council decision adopting this programme provides for the special needs of the handicapped to be taken into account within its various sections."
"In keeping with the new Community strategy on handicaps, adopted by the Commission in its communication of 30 July 1996, and in particular its concept of mainstreaming, and in view of the Council resolution of 20 December 1996 on equality of opportunity for handicapped persons, the implementation of the action plan for a European education initiative will certainly incorporate the needs of the handicapped."
"This aspect will also be taken into account in the follow-up to the Green Paper on the social aspects of the information society."
"I am very grateful that I am here and able to receive this answer."
"Mrs Ahlqvist is lying in bed with a temperature some 2 000 kilometres from here."
"She is very sorry that she cannot be present."
"What she wanted to say on this matter is that she cannot find any measures for the handicapped in what is otherwise a good action plan for a European initiative on education."
"I am grateful for the response to this question."
"I think that Commissioner Cresson has really demonstrated a willingness to embrace the opportunities for the handicapped created by new technology."
"The physically handicapped will be able to improve their prospects for increased mobility on the labour market and the mentally handicapped can have a totally different form of contact with the world around them."
"I hope now that, during the tendering process for this plan, we will make good use of the fact that by including these aspects early on in the purchase negotiations we can adapt this technology at reasonable cost for use by the handicapped."
"Yes indeed, and what is more we encourage any progress that can be made in this field."
"There are computer systems for blind people, for example, which enable them to write in braille."
"Likewise, there are various systems for people who are unable to move; these aids to communication are becoming more and more powerful."
"I am therefore absolutely convinced, as you say, that in the context of the Commission's procedures and the overall objectives of the texts to which I referred a moment ago, we shall be able to make significant and satisfactory progress towards increasing the involvement of the handicapped in information networks and knowledge systems."
"Of course, there is always room for more progress, and research projects must be mounted as well."
"In the field of educational software, for instance, where we have a small unit which has begun work, very specific solutions can indeed be found for these different categories of people, because there is not just one form of handicap."
"Question No 59 by Joan Vallvé (H-0034/97)"
"Subject: Implementation of the Socrates Programme"
"In February 1996 I asked the Commission whether Recital 11 of the Decision on the Socrates programme - on the possibility of including certain languages which, without being official EU languages, are recognized at national level and are used to a significant extent as teaching languages in universities, as is the case of Catalan - could be mentioned in the 1996 handbook for applicants to the programme. The Commission replied that the recital could be expressly mentioned in the 1997 handbook for applicants."
"Has the Commission taken the necessary steps to this end, bearing in mind that this would enable the provisions of the Decision on the Socrates programme and the Reding report adopted by the EP in December 1990 on languages in the Community and the situation of Catalan to be better applied?"
"As regards the implementation of the Socrates programme, the Commission wishes handbooks for applicants to Community programmes to be explicit and straightforward."
"The present text of the 1997 Socrates handbook refers to teaching languages in the participating countries, without specifying these languages."
"The Commission's services are currently taking the necessary steps to ensure that - in addition to the 11 official languages of the European Union - the 1998 handbook will expressly mention other languages such as Catalan, Galician and Basque, with a view to promoting cooperation between universities."
"In any event, the absence of this explicit reference up to now has not prevented the Catalonian universities from taking a very active part in the various schemes under the Socrates programme. For example, they have sent 3000 students on placements abroad, and have received the same number of students from universities in other Member States."
"I am very satisfied with that reply."
"I am speaking French in order to make myself understood more directly."
"I certainly hope that your promise, namely that the 1998 handbook will make reference to what was established in recital 11 of the Socrates programme, will have a better chance of being kept than the reply which you gave me approximately a year ago, in February 1996, when you made a similar promise to me that the 1997 handbook would include that reference, whereas it does not."
"I hope that the matter will be taken seriously this time, and that in 1998 the handbook for applicants will expressly mention the Catalan language. This will be in keeping with Mrs Reding's resolution, which we adopted in 1990."
"Yes, Mr Vallvé, I can definitely promise that the next handbook will indeed refer to the various languages I have just mentioned - Catalan in particular, but others too."
"Mr President, I have two brief supplementaries to put to the Commissioner."
"Firstly, would it be possible for there to be a survey across all the programmes within your remit which take account of Parliament's concerns about minority languages?"
"After all, this issue affects a very large number of people in the European Union."
"Catalan can hardly be called a minority language; it is one of the more widely used languages."
"Secondly, we have approved the supplementary protocols to the association agreements which allow Socrates and other similar programmes to be extended to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe."
"I was the rapporteur on this, and I should like to ask the Commissioner to what extent the protocols have now been implemented, and with what degree of success."
"What I can say is that it is difficult for me, here and now, to give you a list of the places or circumstances in which minority languages are taken into consideration."
"However, if you wish, I could send you such a list in writing."
"As regards the extension of Socrates to the CCEE, this initiative is still in its infancy; it is being developed and satisfactory progress is being made, naturally at an appropriate pace."
"Many students from the CCEE are coming to our universities."
"Conversely, a number of students from the European Union are going to universities in the CCEE."
"However, we are still in the very early stages of these initiatives, which will be able to benefit to some extent from various programmes, most notably Phare."
"Question No 60 by Hubert Pirker (H-0036/97)"
"Subject: Leonardo Programme"
"What measures will the Commission take to dismantle the barriers that hinder EU-wide exchanges of trainees and instructors (teachers and instructors in undertakings) within the framework of the Leonardo training and mobility programme?"
"As far as the Leonardo programme is concerned, there are a number of barriers - since this is your question - affecting the transnational mobility of young people and their instructors."
"That is why the Commission published in 1996 a Green Paper on obstacles to transnational mobility in education, training and research, with a view to provoking a wide-ranging public debate and devising courses of action to remove these barriers."
"Broadly speaking, we can identify two types of barrier which are hindering placements and exchanges under the Leonardo programme."
"Firstly, there is the legal status of trainees and the question of the transparency and recognition of vocational diplomas."
"The fact that the right of residence for EU citizens in another country, without a residence permit, is currently limited to three months represents a barrier to mobility, in the sense that priority should be given to longer placements, which are of course more worthwhile and of greater value to the young people concerned."
"For this reason, the Commission is to make proposals with a view to improving the conditions relating to the right of residence, social security and taxation."
"As for promoting the recognition of vocational diplomas throughout the Community - by implementing the 1985 Council decision on the equivalence of vocational diplomas - the lack of any real progress in this field is, to my mind, extremely worrying, and I entirely share your concerns."
"The Leonardo programme is helping to improve the conditions for greater transparency and the recognition of diplomas, in that transnational placements and exchanges organized under this programme must be validated and certified."
"Leonardo is thus fully playing its role as an innovative experiment, which will enable us to announce a specific proposal on the form of the European status of trainee."
"I must confess that this problem is an extremely complex one, however: it is much more difficult for young people to move around the European Union than for goods and capital, even though Europe came into being for the sake of its citizens."
"Many problems are being encountered in connection with Leonardo and trainees, but also with students and, for example, unemployed youngsters who no longer receive their benefits if they go abroad; there is the barrier of low wages being paid, the problems of young people who go to another country on placement, and those of young researchers - all these are very widespread problems."
"I think that Parliament should indeed lend its full support to the fact that the mobility of our citizens, and in particular of young people, is absolutely crucial for developing an awareness of European citizenship."
"Many obstacles are also being encountered because these problems are horizontal ones which involve several ministries within a government: employment, social affairs, sometimes home affairs, and in certain cases education."
"It is therefore very difficult to persuade the Member States to accept satisfactory measures."
"If we wish to make the status of trainee something worthwhile, if we wish split-site training courses to become a kind of Erasmus for trainees, which is our aim, it is clear that we shall all have to pull our weight, and I am relying heavily on Parliament in this matter, which really is a crucial one in terms of an education policy for the people of Europe."
"Thank you for your comments, Mrs Cresson."
"I see in practice the extent of the problems involved in implementing the excellent Leonardo programme."
"However, I think it is extremely important that every possible resource should be harnessed to allow the transfer of innovation, to facilitate mobility, further training and education for trainees, because this measure also has the potential to prevent unemployment - and that is such a serious problem for us. I am glad, therefore, that there is a commitment to act, and that you too realize where the problems are."
"I am also aware of some additional problems, because in practice it is difficult even to set up an exchange of information between companies which are prepared to participate in the mobility programme, to organize exchanges of trainees and instructors between one country and another."
"In practice, I also encounter major problems on the question of whether to count the exchange period as holiday time or as part of a period of training."
"Can you see any possible means of removing these additional barriers too?"
"I think that the problem you are raising - if I have understood correctly - is that of recognition by companies of the period of time spent, and the work done, by a trainee in another Member State of the Union."
"It is clear that the problem of accrediting skills is a very topical one, and that it does not relate only to traineeships."
"The question is how to assess the equivalence between vocational levels within one occupation in different countries."
"We are currently working on this issue."
"If you have had an opportunity to read the White Paper on education, on the learning society, you will have seen that we are seeking to establish skill accreditation schemes with different occupational groups."
"For example, we are working with the European Banking Union, and a number of other professional associations, to obtain recognition of knowledge acquired not only by trainees during their initial training, but also throughout the lifetime of a worker or employee who wishes to work in another Member State, to enable that person's level of skills to be assessed correctly, even if he completed his education many years earlier."
"So we are starting to explore this whole issue, which affects traineeships but also lifelong learning for workers."
"Question No 61 by Marie-Paule Kestelijn-Sierens (H-0037/97)"
"Subject: Importance of clinical research at European level with a view to determining a therapeutic strategy for treatment"
"Independent clinical research at European level with a view to determining a strategy for treatment is an important contribution towards optimizing the treatment of cancer and other diseases which require a multidisciplinary approach."
"Does the Commission have any plans to include such research in the Fifth Framework Programme on Research and Development?"
"Is the Commission prepared to encourage Member States to simplify national statutory obligations - which often differ quite remarkably - in respect of this clinical research and to bring them more into line in the interests of progress in treatment?"
"As far as clinical trials at European level are concerned, since research on cancer - as well as several other diseases - requires a multidisciplinary approach, it stands to benefit in particular from research carried out through multi-centre clinical trials in Europe."
"Such trials have, therefore, always played a major role in the Union's medical research programmes."
"Multi-centre clinical trials should continue to represent an important aspect of medical research activity under the fifth framework programme."
"They should be included both in the key action on viral and infectious diseases and in the research work on the treatment of degenerative illnesses, provided for in the programme on discovering the resources of living beings and the ecosystem, one of the six major programmes set to constitute the fifth framework programme, as outlined in the communication adopted by the Commission on 12 February."
"The problem of harmonizing the rules on clinical research in the Member States is different in the case of drug trials from that of trials involving other treatments, such as surgery, radiation therapy or the various combinations of these methods which are widely used in treating cancer."
"The provisions in the field of drug trials are harmonized at Community level as part of the rules on the marketing of drugs, for which the Community is formally competent."
"That is not the case for other types of clinical trials, which the Member States are responsible for regulating."
"Since the Commission cannot intervene directly here, all it can do in this case is encourage the Member States to align their respective rules in the context of cooperative research work on cancer and other serious diseases; the Commission provides a good deal of support for such work through the framework programme."
"Thank you, Mr President, and thank you, Commissioner, for your reply."
"I asked this question on behalf of the European organization for cancer research and treatment, a European body based in Brussels which organizes clinical research into cancer."
"Clinical research is essential for determining the most efficient and up-to-date treatment for cancer, and not only benefits patients but also offers the prospect of making cancer treatment cost-effective."
"It is thus an important and valuable method both from the medical point of view and also in public health terms, which is why I think - and I am grateful to the Commissioner for acknowledging this - that it should have a place in the Framework Programme on Research and Development."
"As far as the differences in legislation in the Member States are concerned, I agree that all the Commission can do is to encourage the Member States to bring their legislation into line, and I look to the Commission to put this into practice."
"Yes, indeed."
"In fact, I am familiar with the organization to which you refer, whose work is extremely intensive and worthwhile."
"Ethical assessment of clinical trials is governed by different laws or regulations in each country, and it is true that this area falls within national competence."
"What I would point out, in an attempt to move our thinking forward in this area, is that an international conference on clinical trials and ethics is to be held in Brussels on 9 and 10 September 1997."
"It will deal in particular with problems linked to the ethical assessment of research protocols for clinical trials."
"Moreover, under the research programme on biomedicine and health, and with specific regard to the ethical, social and legal aspects of medical research, researchers have been invited to submit projects on this topic."
"I think that an international conference of this kind, which will undoubtedly attract a large audience, will - if successful - enable organizations like the very active one you have mentioned to persuade the Member States' governments that harmonization is absolutely vital, if adequate exchanges of information are to take place."
"Questions Nos 62, 63 and 64 will receive written answers."
"Question No 65 by Ioannis Theonas (H-0909/96)"
"Subject: Steady decline in the iron and steel sector in Greece, and notably Chalivourgiki Ltd"
"The economic crisis has had a particularly damaging effect on the iron and steel sector in Greece where production and the workforce have been steadily declining."
"Following the accession of Greece to the ECSC the only two blast furnaces in Greece which belonged to Chalivourgiki Ltd have closed, followed by the company's electric furnaces, the iron production section has been put on shiftwork and now the reinforced concrete sector is also closing, resulting in the loss of more than 2500 jobs."
"Will the Commission say whether it intends to take special measures to maintain and develop the iron and steel sector in Greece and particularly the steel industry which faces extinction and to maintain employment, and to examine whether the employers who are reported to maintain similar industries in Wales and Switzerland are guilty of illegal practices?"
"Mr President, the restructuring of the steel industry is a process that requires the industry to adapt continually to technologies and markets, and the Commission has been monitoring that process for many years already."
"Of course, the task is one for the industry itself in the first instance, but obviously a range of accompanying measures is needed, including in particular social measures, measures in relation to external trade policy and also, where necessary, programmes to generate new employment."
"We agreed with the industry two years ago that we had an overcapacity of some 19 million tonnes of hot-rolled steel."
"Since then, capacity has been reduced by around 11 million tonnes, and a further 5 million tonnes are still to be shed."
"This means that although we have not achieved the capacity that we and the industry judged to be appropriate, the removal of the overcapacity has had a positive effect on the remaining operators in the industry."
"There have been no more job cuts, and today the industry is operating, by and large, at a satisfactory level in terms of prices and volumes."
"This may not be true of each individual company, and in the particular case of the Greek steel industry, it may well be that certain companies face more serious problems than those experienced by companies in other Member States."
"We will naturally help in such cases, and we are already looking at conversion to other possible forms of production through the RESIDER II programme."
"At the request of the Greek Government, and by the unanimous decision of the Industry Council, we have created the possibility, under the new rules for steel subsidies, of extending regional aid to help the Greek steel industry with ECU 50 million up to the year 2000, subject of course to the condition that this will not entail any increase in production capacity."
"As regards the illegal practices that were referred to in the question, it would be helpful if the accusation could be rather more specific."
"The fact is that in many of these cases of illegal practice, we are simply talking about a more competitive industry in another Member State or - from my own experience - in a third country such as Switzerland."
"Illegal practices are not always involved: often it is simply a case of a competitor performing better than the local industry in the home country, and it is difficult for the Commission to offer help in such a case."
"I would like to thank the Commissioner for his reply."
"I think that it simply confirms what stands out clearly from the question, namely that the very serious difficulties that the Chalivourgiki undertaking in Greece has been faced with stem from the policy of the European Union - formerly of the EEC, but now of the European Union - to cut production in the Union."
"This policy has had a particularly damaging effect in my country, and the problems that it has caused for the country's only undertaking in the sector are leading to a gradual shutdown of the industry and the loss of thousands of jobs."
"Now, however, this undertaking is swiftly being converted from a production company to a trading company, at the very time when huge projects are under way in Greece for which iron, at least, is needed; iron that is now being imported from Turkey."
"I would therefore like the Commission to take note of the consequences of that policy and also of the fact that the undertaking in question, while claiming that it faces problems of competitiveness, is moving to other countries - to Switzerland and Wales, and even to the United States - and starting up operations there."
"The supplementary question introduces nothing new."
"I have already explained that we began by agreeing with the industry, including the Greek industry, that we had 19 million tonnes of overcapacity."
"Overcapacity causes problems."
"It puts pressure on prices."
"Even extremely competitive companies were recording losses."
"Four years ago, virtually no one was still earning enough to cover their costs."
"Therefore, our main problem was how to eliminate the excess capacity."
"We did not decide where capacity reductions were to take place."
"The Commission did not take it upon itself to say that this or that amount of capacity had to be cut in Greece or France or Germany."
"The industry itself made those decisions, on the basis of competitiveness."
"I am sorry if the Greek steel industry in particular was not sufficiently competitive in this respect to withstand the competition from other countries, but if it is the task of the Commission to see that the same conditions apply throughout the Union, then obviously it cannot make exceptions."
"We cannot allow state subsidies in Greece just because the steel industry there wishes to maintain jobs."
"If we did so, jobs in the UK, France or Germany would have to be lost."
"We have an overall responsibility."
"We take that responsibility seriously, and it is up to each company to see that it remains competitive."
"I cannot make any special allowances for a Greek company."
"Question No 66 by Caroline Jackson (H-1039/96)"
"Subject: Food additives and public information"
"Article 8 of Directive 94/36/EC states that the Commission will undertake a programme of public information so that the significance of the most frequently used E-numbers, indicating the presence of particular additives, will be better known."
"Mr Bangemann stated in July 1996 that a study on this subject had been completed."
"What has happened to it, and what does the Commission plan to do next on this subject?"
"I know that Mrs Jackson is right - indeed she is always right."
"And she is quite right to ask why we have not yet begun this programme of consumer information."
"According to the terms of the directive that we adopted, we should have started it last year."
"The problem is - and I really would ask Mrs Jackson to bear with me here - that implementing this type of consumer information campaign in this particular area is an extraordinarily complex task."
"Because we did not want to get it wrong, we commissioned an agency to tell us, on the basis of a study, how to set about the task and where to begin."
"The study - which Mrs Jackson may already have, and I should be glad to give her a copy of it if she does not - comes to the very conclusion that we ourselves had feared: it is not clear how to put this information across to consumers."
"There are a variety of additives."
"Consumers understand why some of them are there, but in the case of others they do not understand at all."
"Let us take the question of colourings, for example."
"Colourings, which are permitted - not least by decisions of Parliament, I would add - are generally seen by consumers as completely unnecessary."
"They want to know why foodstuffs need to be coloured."
"Or let us take the question of perishability."
"It may be possible to explain perishability to consumers, but their response will be: ' Very well, if a product is perishable, then that must be indicated."
"I do not want any additives to make it keep longer.'"
"In other words, we face the problem that it is impossible in practical terms to explain to consumers the decisions that we have jointly taken and consider to be sensible."
"That is the situation, and we cannot change it."
"Of course, we do have the option of cutting everything out, allowing no more colourings, no more preservatives or similar substances."
"That would push prices up substantially, for example in relation to perishability."
"Consumers would have to pay significantly more, and I am sure they would not like that any better."
"To put it another way: the study that we commissioned gave us no useful indication of how to proceed, or of what strategy we need for implementing this."
"That is the problem in a nutshell, Mrs Jackson."
"I hope you can advise me."
"I do not know what to do."
"It sounds as if I could get two salaries here - one as a Commissioner and one as a Member of the European Parliament."
"Technically speaking, would the Commissioner not agree that the Commission is in breach of the law."
"Under Article 8 of Directive 94/36, it is stated quite clearly that the Commission will undertake a programme of public information."
"The Commissioner's answer says this is all too difficult."
"I would like to ask him if he will bring forward a plan by the end of 1997 on this?"
"Will he give us an undertaking that he will bring forward a proposal for a campaign of public information by the end of 1997 and whether in doing so he will undertake to consult with consumer organizations as to the inclusion in such a campaign of better information to consumers regarding the most frequently used food additives?"
"The Commissioner seems at a complete loss having received the report of the agency which the Commission itself commissioned."
"It is really no good for the Commissioner simply to hand this question back to me and say he does not know what to do, that it is all too difficult."
"There is a legal requirement on the Commission to do something."
"I do not deny that there is a legal requirement."
"By the way, Article 8 says that the Commission has to launch a campaign in conjunction with consumer bodies, the European Parliament, the Member States and the food and retail industries in order to inform consumers about the evaluation and authorization process of food additives."
"We are trying to do that."
"Because we did not know how to approach the problem we looked for advice from professional people and they cited things that Member States had done and which had been a complete mess."
"I do not want to start a programme - even if I am obliged to do so and I do not deny the obligation - in a way which wastes taxpayers' money."
"That is the reason why we looked for advice."
"Of course I can launch the thing tomorrow."
"That is possible but I am not sure whether it would be a success."
"Therefore the Commission has offered all the parties mentioned here - Member States, food and retail industries and especially consumer organizations - to discuss the outcome of that study and to seek a way to solve the problem."
"I can promise you that we are ready to start at any time but I want to start with something which is reasonable."
"It is easy to be an activist."
"It is not so easy to be rational and to try to achieve something."
"At the beginning of my political career I was an activist because that paid off but at the end of a political career you feel you should do things in a more reasoned way."
"Question No 67 by Alan Donnelly (H-1043/96)"
"Subject: Organizations representing Internet service providers"
"Following the Commission's progress in releasing draft legislation on various issues concerning the Internet, does the Commission not feel it essential to support the industry itself by assisting in bringing together organizations representing Internet service providers in the Member States of the EU and throughout the rest of Europe?"
"Mr President, what Mr Donnelly says is quite right: not only in the case of the Internet but also with regard to other infrastructures, we shall only succeed when providers of content, and particularly service providers, assume their proper role."
"The problem of making contact with this industry arises from the fact that it does not yet present a uniform front in the way that the hardware producers or operators do, for example."
"These sectors have been organized for some time."
"They know what they want, and they have established relationships with the Commission."
"This is not yet the case with the service providers."
"However, they are in the process of becoming organized."
"Only last week, I held a two-day conference with the major service providers to establish just what sort of conditions will have to be created to facilitate the provision of this type of service."
"However, this was merely a first informal contact, and we need further formal contacts."
"We have set up a working party consisting of representatives of the Member States, net operators and suppliers of equipment and software, as well as Internet service providers and other providers of content."
"The report of the working party was mentioned positively in the Council decision of 28 November."
"This will enable us to establish an initial framework, and we shall then reconvene the working party."
"I cannot tell you anything more at present."
"However, Mr Donnelly was quite right in saying that we need additional formal contacts in this area, and in particular contacts with the European Parliament."
"I hope that when we are in a position to submit the report that we are preparing on illegal and harmful content, the House will have an opportunity of saying more on these issues, in particular self-monitoring, liability, filter technology, evaluation systems, etc. The German Government has also offered to hold a conference on these questions in the summer."
"The Commission is cooperating with the German Government, so that we can use this conference to evaluate ideas on how to solve this problem."
"I am grateful to the Commissioner for his answer and the fact that progress has been made in recent weeks in informally contacting service providers."
"But I would draw three things to his attention."
"First of all, we have always identified the area for creating jobs in the information society as being through the service providers."
"Secondly, we accept that when we try to deal with small- and medium-sized enterprises in the traditional sector we always say it is very difficult to contact them."
"That leads me to the third point."
"Since this is an emerging market, surely we should try now to find national networks of service providers so that we can actually have a dialogue with them."
"The United Kingdom has a very efficient network of service providers."
"It has offered to act as a focal point."
"I would like to ask the Commissioner whether, with the help of the European Parliament, we could try, perhaps before the summer recess, to organize a further meeting with these people, using the UK as a focal point for it?"
"I have no hesitation about organizing such a working conference together with the European Parliament in order to look at the experience in Great Britain."
"I know also from my own experience, thanks to invitations from active Members of Parliament - I did not say Labour Members of Parliament, I said active Members of Parliament - that in Great Britain there is very positive activity in this field."
"So I am more than ready to do that, even before the British elections."
"Aid to rail, road and inland waterway transport"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-0011/97) from the Committee on Transport and Tourism, concerning the common position of the Council (C4-0584/96-95/0204(SYN)) with a view to adopting a Council Regulation amending Regulation (EEC) No 1107/70 on the granting of aid to rail, road and inland waterway transport (rapporteur: Mr Tamino)."
"Mr President, I should like to remind the House, briefly, that this is a document which the Commission drew up back in July 1995 and whose purpose was to extend Regulation 1107 of 1970, on the granting of aids for combined transport by rail, road and inland waterway, to the years 1996 and 1997."
"That document highlighted the urgent need to grant this extension at short notice and explained the reason for which the aid in question was still needed."
"I would also recall that it was stated in that document that transport prices reflect social costs, which in fact was detrimental to combined transport by comparison with road transport, thus resulting in the urgent need to extend the mechanism for providing support to the intermodal services."
"The document, then, highlighted the necessity for these aids."
"Parliament, first in the Committee on Transport and Tourism and then in plenary session, in fact agreed that it was a matter of urgency to try to reach approval on this proposal for a regulation: in fact, at the end of 1995 the Transport Committee approved a proposal, with various amendments, which were accepted in February 1996 by a plenary sitting of the European Parliament."
"The amendments that were made on that occasion related especially to certain aspects: the need to encourage more environmentally compatible transport systems and to highlight the fact that a financial equilibrium between the various modes of transport had not yet been achieved."
"These two amendments were incorporated into the joint proposal, but other amendments which I as the rapporteur had tabled and which I believed to be of significant importance, were not incorporated, in particular one which endeavoured to highlight on the unique aspects of transport through mountainous areas, as in the case of the Alps, though these problems are well known."
"This amendment was not incorporated into the joint proposal; nor, more significantly, were those amendments which related to the problem of whether to delete or retain Article 4 of Regulation 1107 of 1970."
"Before coming to the subject of that Article 4, there is one preliminary comment I should like to make."
"In view of the genuine urgency, and in view of the very quick decision taken by the European Parliament, we found ourselves discussing that provision again a year later - at the beginning of 1997, in other words, when the objective was to extend the period to include 1996 and 1997."
"That, I must admit, is somewhat perplexing, and I wonder today what purpose is served by an extension until 1997 only."
"Are we sure that we should not, in fact, extend it beyond 1997?"
"Now, it is in this context that the problem of whether or not to retain Article 4 arises."
"Although it is true, as has been stated, that Directive 91/440 caused Article 4 to lapse de facto, it is also true that Article 4 relates to aspects which do make these aids to the combined transport system possible."
"Eliminating Article 4 of Regulation 1107 of 1970 - without having replaced it with a different provision - in fact makes it difficult if not impossible to continue with those aids in the near future."
"On the other hand, it was the Commission itself which pointed out that financial equilibrium had not yet been achieved, though without it it would not be possible to encourage more environmentally compatible systems."
"The question I ask myself, therefore, is whether it may not be necessary for the Commission to identify a line of action which would enable us to achieve that objective."
"In this situation, the Committee on Transport did not find it appropriate to accept the amendments which I had tabled: as a result, we come to this House with a provision like that proposed by the Commission."
"I favour this provision, but I felt it appropriate, specifically in order to prompt an answer from the Commission, to reintroduce certain amendments, in particular in order to understand what procedure is envisaged in the near future regarding aids to the combined system."
"Mr President, my group is happy to comply with the Commission's urgent request to approve the common position."
"The scheme in question must be extended as soon as possible, otherwise the 1996-97 period which it is intended to cover will have elapsed altogether."
"We shall not on this occasion be supporting the amendments which the rapporteur is insisting on putting forward, for reasons he has just explained, though we agree with them in principle and voted for them at first reading."
"Combined transport must move forward, quite literally, for reasons which everyone knows and which have been repeated on various occasions."
"We and the rapporteur can be happy in the knowledge that the Commission and the Council seem to be agreed on this."
"Anyone who has read the Commission communication on an action programme for combined goods transport - Pact 2 - and anyone who recalls what the White Paper on railways had to say, cannot but give their wholehearted support to an active policy in this field."
"Then there is also the fact that we always tend to think of road-rail when we talk about combined transport, and overlook inland waterway transport."
"We cannot emphasize too strongly that a high-quality and efficient fleet of inland waterway vessels could provide much more environmentally-friendly transport than at present, without excessive cost or investment."
"In conclusion, following on from some of the comments made by the rapporteur, I should like to ask the Commissioner when we are likely to see a complete revision of Regulation No 1107/70."
"Extending existing arrangements with retroactive effect is a sloppy way to go about things, and should be avoided as much as possible in future."
"And in view of the Commission communication on Pact 2, we might also ask if it would not be more convenient to bring all forms of aid for combined transport under one system, and whether the revision of Regulation 1107/70 could not mark the start of this."
"It might actually be a good deal easier than we think to make the situation more transparent."
"On behalf of the European People's Party I would like to welcome the Commission proposal and, indeed, the Commissioner here this evening, and congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Tamino, on his treatment of this proposal."
"The Regulation 1107/70, as amended in 1992, sets out the mechanism for aid for combined transport for last year and this year so it is indeed timely that, in the month of February, we are nonetheless looking at this extension of the regulation."
"It is important to recognize that non-road modes of transport experience disadvantages, not least through the inequality of distribution by mode and by type of use of infrastructure charges."
"Combined transport suffers particularly in this way and we, in the European People's Party, accept that."
"It is important to review the existing mechanism of support for inter-modal services."
"Account must be taken of the diverse national situations."
"The Commission proposal will continue to permit Member States, under the principle of subsidiarity, to select the form of aid most suitable and conforming to their national priorities."
"The proposals therefore allow the possibility of national aid for combined transport infrastructure for transfer facilities between modes and for specialized equipment for inter-modal transport."
"While the granting of aids for combined transport would be exempt from the strict authorization procedure under Article 93(3) of the Treaty, Member States would be required to inform the Commission of aids granted in the form of an annual estimate at the beginning of each year and subsequently report at the end of the financial year."
"The attraction of the new regulation is that the bureaucracy required by both the Member States and the Commission will be reduced."
"This is a welcome change."
"Under the proposal it will be for each Member State to decide what, if any, form the support will take."
"While the European Union emphasizes combined transport, I hope that both combined transport and conventional freight operations will be supported by this measure."
"My group endorses the Commission proposal setting out the categories of aid which are legitimate with the aim of overcoming the particular handicaps experienced in the development of inter-modal or combined transport."
"It is understood that the aids will apply in the short term and will have a positive and beneficial effect on the development of combined transport."
"The proposal to extend Regulation 117/70 deserves Parliament's support since it is just this type of aid to combined transport which we believe is in line with the European Union's future transport policy."
"It is also a means of strengthening the position of railways and inland waterways in the European transport market."
"At the very least, until such time as the level of competition between the different modes of transport is reflected in the reality of grants and proposed harmonization conditions, these aids are a modest means of providing compensation in the interests of a sustainable transport policy."
"In conclusion, we congratulate the rapporteur on his report."
"I am delighted that the Council, in adopting a common position, has incorporated two key amendments from the European Parliament and on that basis we should now approve the common position and I have therefore great pleasure in commending it to the House."
"Like everyone else, my group too supports the proposals before us and congratulates the rapporteur on them."
"We do not oppose his amendments in principle, but as Mr Castricum said a moment ago, this is not the right time to be pursuing them, particularly when the Commissioner - and perhaps he would like to give us details of this - has just been instructed by the Council to have further talks with Switzerland on transalpine transport."
"My group is also rather pleased to see from the common position that the idea of stopping further aid altogether after 1997 is under consideration."
"Why is this?"
"First of all, because we have seen that simply carrying on providing aid for combined transport is tantamount to flogging a dead horse."
"Combined transport seems to be taking a smaller and smaller share of the transport market, rather than increasing, and it would therefore seem that freedom of choice for shippers is gaining the upper hand."
"Our group welcomes this as a very positive development that should be extended further, which is not to say, of course, that we should not be glad to see environmentally-friendly forms of transport taking a greater share of the market."
"Decisive factors here seem to be the lack of further liberalization of the railways, the high costs of transferring goods from one form of transport to another, and finally, Commissioner - and I should like to hear what you have to say on this - the fact that it is impossible for transporters to take responsibility themselves for transferring and unloading from rail transport at the place of destination."
"This is an area where we would join Mr Castricum in calling for more detailed legislation in future."
"Mr President, combined modes of transport, or to be more accurate a system in which each mode of transport is considered individually, is not only a European transport project with respect to capacity and prices offered to those buying transport."
"It is also an environmental project."
"It is a project which takes account of bottlenecks and which can be made economically justifiable."
"Like my colleague, Mr Castricum, I also support the Commission's initiatives and hope that the Council will follow these up, but I would also advocate the expansion of these initiatives."
"Member States must involve themselves more fully in these activities, and must be made to see that this is a joint European project, not local projects."
"The strategy until now has been that Member States themselves be involved in the selection of areas of investment, not at a European level, but at a local level."
"This must change in the future."
"There seems to be a continued failure to realize that points at which sea, rail and road systems meet are often good junctions."
"What we are missing is the category referred to by the term short sea shipping."
"This is an important aspect of the development of combined transport modes in Europe, and I hope we can agree to an extension of the programme so that it can continue after this year and next year."
"Because what tends to happen is that we wait until traffic develops, then attempt to regulate it."
"It would be good if, at a joint European level, we could attempt to regulate traffic before it has developed, and make new provision for it."
"Market forces will not take care of this problem by themselves."
"We can propose as many toasts as we like at the prospect of a combined transport project."
"But nothing will happen until we can agree at a European level."
"It is therefore not just a question of deregulation, privatization, or any other scheme we can dream up."
"It is a question of how determined we are to regulate in order to create the modes of transport we wish to see."
"I wish the Commissioners good luck on the Council as they seek to convince the various ministers that these projects are worth investing in."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this issue is certainly important enough in itself to merit serious discussion."
"I agree with most of what my colleagues have said."
"We on the Christian Democrat side of the House support the common position and hope that the Commissioner will table a proposal for a followup regulation without delay, so that we do not find ourselves in 1999 discussing the follow-up regulation for 1998."
"I should like to highlight two points in particular."
"I believe it is extremely important to extend the aid regulation to include support for combined transport, because we all share the objective of moving long-distance freight transport increasingly onto railways and inland waterways and also - as the previous speaker mentioned - short sea shipping, in order to make our roads in the Community safer and to conserve the environment."
"We also agree with the second concept in the common position and the Commission proposal, that of simplifying the way that aid is monitored in this sector."
"However, we still have certain reservations."
"These concern the need to ensure two things - and I would ask the Commissioner if he could give a guarantee in this respect when he addresses the two new concepts in his reply."
"My first question is this: if individual authorizations are not to be compulsory in these aid procedures, how do you intend to ensure that the Commission will continue to monitor the aid with the same degree of care?"
"Exemption from individual authorization cannot mean exemption from aid monitoring, and I should like to have your assurance that you will make your staff fully aware of this."
"Secondly, if individual authorizations are no longer required, how shall we ensure that when aid is granted to one company, another company, city or region does not find itself disadvantaged without having any say in the matter?"
"This is what happens in practice: competitor companies say that they had no idea what subsidies had been applied for, because the details were not published anywhere, and they ask how they are expected to register their misgivings when they only receive the news a year after the event."
"That is why I believe, Commissioner, that even with the simplified procedure, some thought must be given to ways of informing competitors and allowing them to raise objections - in the interests of promoting competition, as opposed to distorting it."
"Mr President, I would like to start by thanking Mr Tamino for his well written report."
"It is my fundamental political conviction that providing conditions for free trade and free competition is also the best way of resolving Europe's various transport problems."
"This is why I am essentially sceptical about economic support and subsidies."
"Now that we have reached the second round of discussions on this matter and have a common position from the Council of Ministers, I believe that we can say that this has all the makings of a good decision."
"The Tamino report is about improving combined transport."
"Undisputably, this is of great importance; there is every reason therefore to encourage it."
"How this is done, is also of importance."
"Investment in combined transport cannot be made by continuously raising taxes and an even higher and more unfair distribution of freight costs."
"These are already widely divergent in the various EU Member States and all too often this is a great disadvantage to countries which already have long transport distances and high freight costs."
"This large and continuously increasing disparity must not be allowed to grow larger."
"This means that the most important way of encouraging combined transport does not lie in direct economic support."
"Instead, we should be working more towards the proposals in the White Paper which has been presented to Parliament and which covers the revitalisation of Europe's railways."
"The fact that Europe's railways are continuously losing their market share of goods transport is a big problem."
"But the way to counteract this lies more in stimulating the railways in other ways rather than by the direct provision of economic support."
"The most important boost would be to simplify goods transport across EU national boundaries and to introduce more open competition than we currently have."
"For this reason, the most important decisions that we can take for this sector, to encourage both the railways and combined transport, are not the decisions which we are taking today but those which are still to come."
"Mr President, could I first thank the House and the rapporteur Mr Tamino for his very useful work on the amendment to Regulation 1107/70 on state aids to inland transport."
"The result of these efforts is to underline again Parliament's strong commitment to promoting combined transport and that, as ever, is welcome."
"By approving this common position, the House ensures that the rules in Regulation 1107/70 concerning aid to combined transport will remain in force this year."
"Since those rules will, however, expire by 31 December we must obviously prepare the structure of a new regime that meets the needs of the future."
"With that specific purpose in mind, my services are currently working on a report on the current state aid practices of Member States based on the answers they have given to a Commission questionnaire."
"The result of this work will obviously provide an informed basis for the revision of Regulation 1107/70 in exactly the way Mr Castricum was seeking."
"Naturally in due course I would be pleased to have a detailed exchange of views with the House on ways of establishing a legal framework which will allow the continued and appropriate promotion of combined transport."
"It would be relevant to discuss Mr Castricum's idea relating to the project action for combined transport at that juncture."
"The PACT programme is going to be extended to relate to short sea shipping and I hope that Mr Sindal will see that as evidence of our sustained commitment in the Commission to the development of that very important aspect of combined transport."
"Meanwhile, I should say to Mr Jarzembowski that I agree with his emphasis on effective monitoring and on fair conditions and he can be absolutely sure that the Commission not only will sustain its current efforts but constantly look for even more effective and incisive ways of producing exactly the results that he seeks."
"On the specific matter of the report before the House, I note that Mr Tamino, as he said, has re-submitted two amendments which both the Commission and the Council rejected at the first reading stage."
"I must inform the honourable Member that in the view of the Commission, both amendments continue to be inappropriate."
"I hope therefore that he will not persist with them and will concur with the recommendation of the Committee on Transport and Tourism to approve the common position without amendment in the fashion argued for by Mr Wijsenbeek."
"I express my gratitude for the continuing constructive attitude of honourable Members in supporting development in combined transport and I look forward greatly to the next stage of provision for the future."
"Mr President, I put two specific questions to the Commissioner concerning the stage of unloading and the matter of Switzerland."
"I hope I will receive a more detailed answer later on."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Investor compensation schemes"
"The next item is the report (A4-0047/97) by Mr Janssen van Raay, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee on the joint text (C4-0058/97-00/0471(COD)), approved by the Conciliation Committee, for a European Parliament and Council Directive on investor compensation schemes."
"Mr President, I am pleased to see that Commissioner Monti has now arrived alongside Commissioner Kinnock. The Chamber may seem empty, but I can assure you, Mr Monti, that I have just walked through the building and there are 300 Members currently sitting glued to their television screens watching this debate in their offices."
"So we have the House's undivided attention."
"Secondly, the most important point I should like to make is to stress how successful the conciliation procedure introduced under the Maastricht Treaty has been."
"I very much appreciate the fact that under the Irish presidency, when the last such procedure occurred, we were able to reach a successful compromise through the intervention of Commissioner Monti and the Irish Minister."
"With swine fever currently sweeping through the Netherlands, I was particularly interested to hear this afternoon's debate on mad cow disease, and I thought to myself that if Amsterdam I or Maastricht II extended the conciliation procedure to all areas of cooperation, it would be a major step forward."
"What Minister van Aartsen said was not logical, of course: he cannot first welcome measures against the United Kingdom and then grumble about the measures which the Commission has, in my opinion as a Dutchman, quite rightly taken against the Netherlands to protect public health and consumer interests."
"The only thing which the Minister should have done was to ensure that no pig-farmers suffered loss."
"This Commission deserves a pat on the back from President Santer, which is more than could be said for the last one."
"The point I wish to make is this: if we had had the conciliation procedure then, so that we could have worked directly with the Commission and the Council, it might have been much easier to find a solution."
"I have to say that we are extremely pleased."
"We negotiated up until the last minute, as you know, to try to get Parliament's ideas adopted."
"Thanks to you, the Council adopted many of Parliament's amendments at second reading."
"I always think of ourselves as a kind of House of Representatives and the Council as the Senate, with the Commission playing the absolutely vital role of intermediary."
"It is up to us to ensure that European legislation is introduced which is acceptable to everyone."
"The various sections of the Delors package do not seem so important individually, and even the investor compensation scheme does not seem all that important at first sight."
"However, it forms the cornerstone of a major package of legislation, and as such it is extremely important for consumers and investors."
"We naturally find it unfortunate, I have to say, that the export ban has not been lifted."
"We would have preferred to allow the countries offering the highest levels of protection for investors to compete with countries which do not offer any."
"As you know, Mr Monti, we urged you to include this amendment right up to the last minute."
"But when the AdvocateGeneral in the proceedings between Germany and the Commission and the Council told us that it was out of the question, we gave in."
"We are now relying on the Commission, and this is my main point, to ensure that the highest possible level of protection for investors is introduced in all countries of the European Union, and particularly Greece. This was one of the amendments agreed in the compromise with the Irish presidency, and we really are counting on your cooperation."
"I should in any event like to thank Commissioner Monti for the role which he personally played in achieving the compromise with the Irish presidency."
"I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for ably piloting this legislation through the three readings in this House and through the conciliation procedure."
"Despite the small number of MEPs who are present tonight, this is a very important piece of legislation."
"It protects small savers and small savers' savings."
"Small savers are the backbone of the banking industry."
"Small savers scrimp and save."
"There is a great deal of fear in the European economy at present, fear of job losses, fear of what will happen in old age, fear of what will happen if people have periods of sickness, fear of what will happen to children."
"Savings are used to save for old age, periods of sickness, helping children through studies and helping grandchildren."
"Loss of savings can be a personal tragedy for the families concerned."
"This piece of legislation protects those small savers."
"Without saving we have no investment."
"So this piece of legislation is absolutely essential both for the prosperity of Europe as a whole and for the prosperity of the individual families concerned."
"I thank the rapporteur and the Commission for putting this protective directive before the saving consumers of Europe."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we all know the problems that are currently confronting social security systems throughout Europe."
"The simple question of whether our pensions are secure now exercises not only the Germans, but an ever increasing number of the Union's citizens."
"The call from the Member States for more private pension provision cannot be ignored."
"It is not surprising that many people are attracted to invest in securities - a sector of the financial market that is as sensitive as it is risky."
"Against this backdrop, the directive on investor compensation schemes takes on further topical significance."
"The most important concern is to protect small savers."
"We should therefore welcome the fact that, after a tough battle between the Council and Parliament, a compromise has been reached, opening the way for the directive to come into force."
"Once again the codecision procedure involving the Conciliation Committee has proved its worth."
"Small investors must be able to deal with branch offices of companies selling securities in the Community, or receive securities services in the context of the international trade in services, with as much confidence as when dealing with domestic companies."
"That is why investor compensation schemes must be in place in all the Member States, to ensure that small savers at least have a uniform minimum level of protection in the event of a securities firm being unable to meet its obligations to its investors."
"We introduced legislation some time ago to provide for this type of protection - albeit through very different systems - in the case of credit institutions."
"Here, the uniform minimum compensation of ECU 20 000 per investor has been set at a level that is designed to protect the interests of small investors."
"It is also designed to allow the Member States to stipulate that investors must bear a proportion of any losses."
"However, competition is part and parcel of the internal market, and this brings me to my main criticism of the directive."
"The rapporteur has already discussed this point in detail."
"The Council takes the view that the level and extent of cover offered by the various compensation systems should not become an instrument of competition."
"The Council fears that the market will be disrupted if the branch offices of securities firms can offer better cover than a securities firm licensed in the country where the securities are bought."
"To put it plainly, the European Parliament sees the arrangement which the Council is proposing as a ban on the export of services by securities firms based in countries where the system offers a higher level of cover than that of the country in which the branch office is located."
"Only the fact that this arrangement, or export ban, will not apply after December 1999 has prompted the House to give way here in the interests of reaching a compromise."
"It should be noted that in the course of the Conciliation Committee procedure, Parliament succeeded in ensuring that compensation will be calculated on the basis of the current market value of the securities, and will be paid out without delay."
"The compromise that was reached thus takes account both of investor protection and of the need to maintain confidence in the financial system."
"It represents a significant contribution to the completion of the single market, and that is why my group recommends that the compromise should be adopted."
"In the few seconds available to me, I naturally cannot examine the excellent compromise worked out by the rapporteur in any detail, but I should like to congratulate him on it."
"J.K. Galbraith once announced at a hearing of the American Senate that the stock market boom which was happening at the time would not last, and from that moment the markets started to plummet."
"I hope I shall not have the same effect, but I think we can assume that the market boom we are experiencing will not last, and that one of these days it will start to dip."
"Now that investors have found out about the stock markets, the way in is often through investment firms."
"It is therefore a very good idea, and I am grateful here to the rapporteur and the Commissioner, to spread the asset formation and the risk in this way, also among those not previously involved."
"As a Liberal, I wholeheartedly welcome the fact that small investors are now to be given a certain guarantee."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to begin by thanking the parliamentary delegation, and in particular the rapporteur."
"The proposals which have been presented to us as the outcome of the conciliation procedure represent a sensible compromise."
"This was obviously necessary."
"The adoption of a directive was urgently required to facilitate the free movement of capital under Article 7a(2) of the EC Treaty, and it was necessary to make the legislation compatible with the directive on bank deposit guarantees."
"The main problems were the objections to the need for a directive, given the principle of subsidiarity, and the question of the export ban."
"The very fact that the latter has been a bone of contention is, in my opinion, the best argument in favour of the directive."
"Potential distortions of the market needed to be countered."
"The proposal that the export ban should apply only until 1999 allowed an acceptable compromise to be reached on this point too."
"The only appropriate response to this balanced proposal is for the House to adopt it."
"Mr President, it may be the case, as Mr Janssen van Raay said, that this Chamber is not particularly crowded this evening, but it seems to me that the speeches we have heard have really cast light on every aspect of this very important problem, which has been so well solved."
"In this context, I should like to express, on behalf of the Commission, both institutional and personal congratulations: institutional congratulations because we have seen a fine example of the workings of a conciliation procedure; and personal congratulations to the rapporteur, Mr Janssen van Raay, and to all the members of his delegation for their efforts to achieve an agreement with the Council last December on legislation of such major importance."
"The importance of this directive lies in the fact that, together with the directive on investment services and the directive on the financial soundness of banks and investment enterprises - directives which are already in effect - it will constitute one of the fundamental pillars of the single market as far as the securities sector is concerned."
"It seems to me that the speeches made by Mr Oddy, Mrs Mosiek-Urbahn, Mr Wijsenbeek and Mr Ullmann have really highlighted the various aspects of this single market that we are constructing for the citizen - a market which can therefore, thanks to a directive like this one, widen the spectrum of citizens, whether small or large savers, who can invest in securities."
"At the same time this provides a boost to the savings/investment cycle and so stimulates the growth of the European economy for the benefit of future generations and creates a mechanism of confidence."
"So although it may seem to be a technical provision, perhaps a rather dull provision, I see it as one of great economic and social importance."
"I therefore congratulate Parliament again on the key part it has played in achieving this result."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"(The sitting closed at 11.20 p.m.)"
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of the last sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Madam President, I refer to page 1 of yesterday's Minutes."
"Both Mr Smith and I raised the question of the list for Question Time and the fact that the questions we had tabled to Commissioner Kinnock on transport were not included in the transport section."
"We wondered whether there had been a simple administrative blunder or whether there had been some political manoeuvre to prevent embarrassment for the United Kingdom Government."
"The President in the chair, Mr Imbeni, said he would report the matter to the Commission."
"Has the presidency had any news from the Commission about what happened to these questions?"
"Mr McMahon, the matter is being dealt with, and the Commission will decide which Commissioner is to answer your question."
"That will certainly be discussed, and the Commission is free to decide which of the Commissioners will answer it."
"Madam President, I was well aware who the Commissioner would be: I tabled the question on transport to Commissioner Kinnock, who is the Transport Commissioner."
"Now someone in this institution - or in one of the two institutions - decided not to refer it to Commissioner Kinnock."
"I want to know whether the failure is in Parliament's or the Commission's services, and I want to know whether it is a simple administrative blunder or a political manoeuvre!"
"Only the President can find that out!"
"No, Mr McMahon, it is neither of those things."
"I can only repeat what I have just said."
"The questions are submitted to the Commission as a collegial body, and the Commission itself then decides who will answer a particular question."
"In other words, neither we nor you can decide in this case that Mr Kinnock will answer your question."
"We shall pass the matter on, and then the question will be answered."
"Madam President, if I may, I would like to make two small comments on the Minutes."
"I refer to page 22 of the Spanish version, and I have been able to check that the same applies to the Italian and French versions."
"During the debate on BSE I had the honour to take Mrs Pery's place in the chair, and when Mrs van Dijk was speaking I gave Lord Plumb the floor."
"The substitution does not appear in the Minutes."
"I am flattered to be mistaken for Mrs Pery, but I do think the accuracy of the minutes demands a correction."
"The other point, Madam President, refers to page 23 and as far as I know only affects the Spanish version."
"I have checked the Italian and the French and they are correct, but in the Spanish version, at the start of questions to the Council and the Commission, Mr Avgerinos' name does not appear, and as I understand it, he was chairing the sitting."
"These are small points, Madam President, but to be meticulous in our work, I think they need to be pointed out."
"Thank you very much. That will be corrected."
"As far as the confusion is concerned, there ought to be no problem in changing that too."
"I have just heard that in the other versions which you did not mention these omissions or errors were not made."
"But they will be corrected in the versions to which you referred."
"Madam President, a number of foreign lorries have been marooned for two weeks now in northern Spain."
"Despite efforts by the Spanish Government to find a solution the situation in some places is particularly grim."
"Tyres are being slashed, windows broken and two lorries have been set on fire."
"I urge our President, Mr Gil-Robles, to use his good offices with the Spanish authorities in order to convey Parliament's alarm and our deprecation of this situation and to point out to the Spanish authorities that they have a duty to safeguard the free movement of individuals and goods."
"Mr Cornelissen, that was not a point of order."
"We are now dealing with comments on the Minutes."
"We shall certainly pass that on, but for the moment I would ask you to confine yourselves to comments on the Minutes."
"Madam President, I thought Mr McMahon was doing very well and did not need my assistance but I am really astonished at the reply you gave him."
"If it is the case that the Commission will decide for itself which questions to answer, then why are we asked to address questions to specific Commissioners?"
"Why is part of Question Time designated to specific Commissioners?"
"We addressed our questions to Mr Kinnock."
"Someone took a decision to take them away from Mr Kinnock and place them so far down the agenda that they would not be reached."
"Who took that decision?"
"We believe there were political forces behind that, and could you tell us what happened?"
"Dirty work at the crossroads, you know: the nuclear industry is very much aware of these things."
"I believe there has been a misunderstanding on your part."
"I said before that the Commission decides which Commissioner will answer the question."
"I did not say that the Commission decides which question will be answered."
"That must have been misunderstood."
"Incidentally, the Commission is, of course, listening to what is being said here, and I have no doubt that there is a possibility that Mr McMahon's question will indeed be answered by Mr Kinnock, but that is not something we can dictate."
"I can only pass it on with an explicit request that Mr Kinnock reply to the question, which I shall do."
"(Parliament approved the Minutes.)"
"Topical and urgent debate (objections)"
"The next item is the vote on objections relating to the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance (Rule 47)."
"Item I - Human Rights:"
"Madam President, on the subject of human rights. I have two points to raise."
"Firstly, a request has been received to replace our human rights resolution on Vannunu with one on the war criminal Brunner."
"We would ask the honourable members who made that request to agree to Brunner being an addition rather than a replacement."
"That is my first point and my second one is an urgent plea to the Greens to withdraw the new item they want to add under the human rights heading, namely the matter of the detainee Roisín McAliskey."
"Why? Because negotiations are currently ongoing which might be frustrated if this question is put on the urgency list at this time."
"It is the result which counts and I thus ask the Greens not to press for this to be added to the agenda today but to withdraw their request."
"Mrs D'Ancona, the objection I have received was tabled by the PPE Group, and the deadline for motions has actually passed."
"This means that I cannot simply grant your request - and I do understand what you want to achieve - unless the PPE Group expresses its agreement."
"Madam President, the proposal made that we should withdraw this resolution is completely out of order because the Parliament has to debate human rights abuses within the Union and it is quite clear that this Parliament has an opportunity to do so today."
"It will be too late to do it later."
"Negotiations have been going on; letters have been going backwards and forwards but nothing has actually happened."
"The Parliament has to address human rights abuses within the Union."
"We are debating human rights issues right across the world and we cannot ignore what happens in our own Member States."
"Thank you very much, Mrs McKenna."
"Beef labelling - veterinary controls - cattle registration"
"The next item on the agenda is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"A4-0037/97 by Mr Papayannakis, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a Council Regulation (COM(96)0460 - C4-0546/96-96/0229(CNS)) regarding the labelling of beef and beef products; -A4-0033/97 by Mr Olsson, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the proposals for: I.a Council Directive (COM(96)0170 - C4-0334/96-96/0109(CNS)) laying down the principles governing the organization of veterinary checks on products entering the Community from third countriesII.a Council Directive (COM(96)0170 - C4-0335/96-96/0110(CNS)) amending Directives 71/118/EEC, 72/462/EEC, 85/73/EEC, 91/67/EEC, 91/492/EEC, 91/493/EEC, 92/45/EEC and 92/118/EEC as regards the organization of veterinary checks on products entering the Community from third countries; -A4-0022/97 by Mr Mayer, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council Regulation (COM(96)0460 - C4-0545/96-96/0228(CNS)) establishing a system for the identification and registration of bovine animals."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday we debated at some length the arguments of our Investigative Committee concerning BSE and the responsibilities of the United Kingdom, the Council of Ministers and the Commission."
"Nobody underestimates the magnitude of the crisis, especially the crisis of citizens' confidence in the workings of the European Union, and of consumers in the beef industry and its products."
"That crisis is enormous."
"We see it in the market, in falling consumption and prices, and in the threats against employment and the viability of companies."
"Today we are debating one of the European Union's first attempts to respond to that crisis of confidence, a draft regulation on the labelling of beef and beefbased products."
"The size of the intervention and the organization of the infrastructures presupposed by this regulation and the one related to it concerning the recognition and registration of the animals, indicate the severity of the crisis brought about by BSE."
"Yet, other interventions and measures will be needed to restore the confidence of consumers."
"It will be very difficult to do this, because that confidence is constantly being shaken by technological development and by the pursuit of profit."
"The one makes it possible, and the other makes it necessary to produce new products or modify traditional ones, while consumers are less and less able to know what it is that they are eating or drinking."
"The real restoration of confidence will come when there is a convincing policy to eradicate BSE at the level of production."
"The regulation we are debating here merely intervenes at the level of trade and attempts to give consumers more and useful information about the origin and production conditions of meat and meat products, hoping in that way to help the market settle down."
"However, the regulation was drawn up under conditions of urgent need, and for that reason it has gaps and omissions which we are trying to correct with the amendments we have tabled."
"The regulation provides that in future beef and beef-based products can be placed on the market if accompanied by a label recording information about their origin."
"For that to be possible, there must first be a regulation on the recognition and registration of animals, involving an information system, and then labelling can follow."
"The regulation's problems are as follows: firstly, the labelling system proposed is in principle optional."
"If we were to accept that provision, we would be led towards the creation of two markets: one with labelled products, which would inspire greater confidence and would have higher prices, and one with unlabelled and somewhat suspect products, demand for which would be less and whose prices would therefore be lower."
"That solution appears easy and could be implemented straight away, but it would achieve nothing."
"It reassures consumers artificially, but without guaranteeing that there will not in due course be people who, being less well informed and poorer, have been desensitized by publicity and will choose products which are considered riskier but are cheaper."
"I think a better though still temporary solution is the compulsory labelling of all beef products, including industrially processed ones."
"Of course, that solution has negative aspects, it requires huge administrative intervention, measures and controls, and it would be very costly."
"However, it responds better to the scale of the crisis of confidence we are facing."
"A second problem is that labelling is envisaged for meat and meat-based products."
"Your rapporteur, however, insists that all beef industry products should be labelled, including industrially processed ones."
"A third problem: the information that the draft regulation envisages should be given on the labels is inadequate."
"Specific amendments propose to include information on the fattening and reproduction conditions of the cattle from which the products in question come, and other useful information as well."
"Finally, your rapporteur proposes to strengthen the orders relating to monitoring the implementation of the system and to sanctions against those who infringe them."
"It is an issue to which the European Union generally tends to pay too little attention. The recent BSE crisis should have persuaded it to change its attitude."
"At any rate, the value of all this is relative and, I repeat, concerns the last stage of the cycle that begins with production and ends with final consumption."
"Let us all hope that the forthcoming Commission and Council proposals will include intervention at the root of the problem, the production system itself and the need to modify it with new criteria governed by sustainable development and the need to protect consumers and public health."
"Madam President, let me just say that yesterday, Mr Santer stated that he is in favour of compulsory labelling."
"I assume this means that the Commission accepts all the related amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment."
"Depending on the Commission's answer to us, we will see how best to take further our support for the Environment Committee's proposals."
"Thank you very much."
"Madam President, first let me congratulate Mr Papayannakis for his excellent work."
"It is important in today's market that we try to rebuild consumer confidence in food."
"In the past, food was produced and consumed locally."
"People knew where food had been produced, how it had been prepared and what the consequences of eating it were."
"It was often the case that if infection or other problems were present that people in the local area were more resistant to these problems."
"Today we no longer have a local market for food."
"Nor do we have a national market for food."
"Today we have a European and also a partially global market for food."
"It is good that there is a free flow of goods and services in the European Union and I also positively support the aim to increase world trade."
"But it is not good if this free flow leads to the further spread of infection and diseases, diseases which can affect livestock and people."
"This is why it is so important to keep track of what we are eating and to inform consumers where food has come from and how it has been produced."
"As for the report by Mr Papayannakis, there are two main issues which we must consider: the first is whether the labelling system should be voluntary or obligatory, and the second is whether it should only apply to whole pieces of beef or to beef products as well."
"I am well aware that obligatory labelling has its difficulties."
"But I think Parliament would be sending out the wrong message if it accepts a voluntary system."
"My party group is in favour of an obligatory system."
"I am also well aware that it can be difficult to label manufactured products; often we end up with a long list of products in ever smaller quantities."
"In such cases, there can be obstacles to labelling manufactured products."
"But, I still think that we must find practical ways, and the Commission must help in this, to set limits so that obligatory labelling can, in principle, also be applied to manufactured meat products."
"With that, Madam President, I would like to turn to my own report which is essentially about the same thing, food safety, but which concentrates on food imported from third countries."
"In this respect I would first like to thank Mr Kindermann and the Agriculture Committee for their very valuable views concerning a number of details which we on the Environment Committee did not have access to."
"I would also like to thank the Committee on Budgets which sent a letter with their comments on the report."
"The proposal concerns harmonisation of veterinary control regulations on all products of animal origin imported into The European Union and the introduction of veterinary checks for each shipment at an approved veterinary control station."
"A database called ANIMO is to be used in connection with this for communication between the different stations."
"I view this proposal positively and support its main points."
"It will simplify a number of areas which will be helpful."
"But introducing a common system also means that we must increase our efforts to restrict import fraud."
"There is also one point of view which I have a particular interest in laying before you; it is perhaps particularly of Swedish or Scandinavian interest, but that does not make it any less important."
"Article 2 of the Directive also affects certain plant products."
"In this instance, this means hay and straw, which will be examined because they can also be infected with foot and mouth disease."
"Today, we have other problems as well."
"This includes the import of soya meal, for example, which can contain salmonella."
"This is a matter of great concern, particularly to those of us who have made great progress in eliminating salmonella, Sweden and Finland for example."
"There is also a passage which says that respect must be paid to the special requirements of individual countries."
"This has a role here as well and it would be useful to include something of this nature."
"I have one amendment proposal concerning penalties."
"This is really only a detail."
"In accordance with Swedish Law, we would like to see the final decision on penalties made via the courts and not administratively."
"In addition, we are also proposing, and this may seem a little strange, that we postpone introduction of this until 1st January 1998, because the computer system required is not yet in place."
"For this reason, it cannot be introduced in accordance with the Commission's proposal on 1st January 1997, which is a date which has already passed."
"Madam President, I think that covers the points that I wanted to add to the discussion."
"The Environment Committee has recommended both the amendment from the Agriculture Committee and their rapporteur Mr Kindermann, and that from the Committee on Budgets and I believe that we will be able to reach broad agreement on this report."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, action needs to be taken in response to the developments on BSE; that surely emerged especially clearly yesterday."
"Tangible and foresighted improvements must be made in the identification of cattle and in beef labelling."
"Consumer confidence in beef has been severely shaken."
"The causes are manifold."
"One significant factor is that meat is mainly sold as an anonymous mass-produced commodity, and the consumer really learns very little, or indeed next to nothing, about its origin."
"This situation must be remedied."
"Before any improvements can be made in this domain, of course, we not only need a transparent production process but also a transparent marketing system."
"The Commission - and I must stress this - has responded, and in the autumn it tabled a proposal for a regulation on the identification and registration of cattle."
"However, the required level of consumer safety cannot be ensured unless such identification and labelling is carried out on the same scale and with the same priority for beef too."
"Only these two components of quality assurance can ultimately restore consumer confidence."
"There is little point in lamenting the inadequate implementation of the existing Directive - yes, there is one!"
"We must speed up the pursuit of our goal through the Regulation with the ultimate goal of transposing it to provide a legal basis in all Member States."
"The system for the identification and registration of cattle is based on four elements - ear tags, which would be on both ears, databases (a key element), animal passports and registers of animals on each holding."
"These elements will be compulsory, and it is absolutely essential that they should be compulsory."
"The Council will now decide on the basis of the report - and I should like to emphasize this too - whether an electronic identification system can be introduced after a test phase, known as the IDEA programme, involving around a million animals."
"There is no doubt at all that the present mechanisms for proving an animal's origin are inadequate."
"Two principles have to be respected. On the one hand, the proposals must be practicable."
"We must not thoughtlessly jeopardize the measures taken in the three areas."
"The system has to work."
"This applies above all to the link between the producer and the database."
"On the other hand, while consumer confidence needs to be regained, it is essential not to lose sight of the aim of keeping the bureaucratic burden on producers as light as possible, as the European Parliament has expressly demanded time and again."
"This restoration of consumer confidence requires the setting of standards."
"And the farming community is prepared to meet these standards."
"Nevertheless, I do believe that we have to incorporate an even greater share of responsibility for Member States into the system governing the transposition of the Regulation and that we should therefore allow them a certain amount of latitude, particularly with regard to the introduction of the database and the animal passports."
"Conditions for the introduction of the database vary widely."
"In some countries a system is already up and running; however, there are also some countries where it will probably take a long time to introduce the database."
"The underlying aim of our deliberations, ladies and gentlemen, should now be the creation of an absolutely reliable system of data collection."
"But where this is already guaranteed, we should not demand any more than is necessary, in other words we must also avoid any duplicated collection requirements."
"One quite vital point in relation to the credibility of the measures - and this is surely the crux of the matter, Commissioner - concerns imports from third countries."
"Mr Olsson, as you know, stressed this point."
"If imported cattle, animals that have entered the Community from third countries, are to be properly identifiable, these imported animals will have to be subject to official identification procedures as soon as they reach the border."
"The data must then be entered in the database without delay, and the animal passport must also be issued immediately."
"I do not believe that the Commission's ideas on this point go far enough."
"This is where the credibility of the system is challenged."
"We cannot afford to be any less stringent with imports from third countries than with animals born here in the Community."
"To my mind, ladies and gentlemen, that is quite fundamental."
"Likewise, the current 30-day limit for identification is reasonable and we should maintain it."
"Now, ladies and gentlemen, it will also be said that Article 100a should be envisaged as the legal basis for labelling."
"And if 100a is to be the legal basis for labelling, it should surely cover animal identification too."
"According to the Commission's statements in yesterday's BSE debate, codecision is to be extended in these areas too, and if goodwill on all sides can prevent almost any delay or reduce it to an insignificant level, then 100a should also serve as the legal basis for the identification of cattle."
"I move that we vote on this and remind you that, even if delays are kept to a minimum, it still boils down to a formal referral back to committee."
"But I believe that, if we show goodwill, action can be taken quickly with little loss of time."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, a proposal from the Commission is on the table today, aimed at establishing common rules for the control of animal products from third countries."
"The completion of the internal market and the associated abolition of border controls make it essential to harmonize import conditions as a prerequisite for the termination of the bilateral agreements."
"The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on whose behalf I drafted the opinion, welcomes the Commission's proposal, which simplifies the existing provisions and adapts them to the new situation."
"It seeks to introduce strict rules in particular areas in order to ensure the protection of public health."
"The cessation of the existing independently conducted identity checks is acceptable, because such checks are to be part of the future inspection system."
"Quite apart from the poor and occasionally misleading translation into German, the proposal contains some unclear formulations, which we are trying to eliminate through our amendments."
"We hope that the Commission will accept these amendments we have proposed."
"We continue to appeal to the Commission to rethink its position on the selected legal basis."
"It states in its own proposal that the common system of veterinary checks is governed by the aims of completing the internal market and harmonizing health protection."
"Especially in the light of the present discussion in this House and among citizens outside on the subject of BSE and of the Commission's correct decision to relieve the Directorate-General for Agriculture of its responsibility for veterinary checks, the Commission should really have come to realize that the monitoring of animal products has far less to do with the organization of the agricultural market than with public health and consumer protection."
"As far as Parliament is concerned, the knowledge and experience we have amassed in the last few weeks and months show that the only appropriate legal basis is Article 100a in conjunction with Article 129a. I am also thinking particularly of Mr Mayer's comments here, which I fully endorse, when he said that we should extend the scope of this legal basis to take in the other two reports being presented to us today."
"Madam President, yesterday we were expressing the concerns of European consumers and consumers outside the Union on the whole question of beef."
"Today we are taking appropriate measures to meet some of those concerns."
"I welcome the new urgency and activity of the European Commission in this area."
"I reject the criticism that this proposal imposes unnecessary administrative costs on farmers."
"It is absolutely necessary to do this to consolidate the markets which European farmers have for their meat products."
"It is necessary also to reassure people in third countries who buy our products."
"We produce a million tonnes of beef in the European Union that have to be sold in third countries."
"It is common knowledge that consumers outside of the European Union are increasingly aware of health and safety aspects of the products which they buy from us."
"So, this measure is important for all these reasons."
"I have to express the concerns of the Committee on Budgetary Control in the area of cost."
"We have maybe 70 million bovines in the European Union."
"We spend ECU 60b annually."
"Something like 70 % of that is paid in individual premia."
"So it is extremely important from a bookkeeping point of view that we know exactly where these animals are and how to calculate correctly the amount of money that should be and has been spent."
"The Budget Control Committee also has a concern that this regulation did not include sheep and goats."
"We spend nearly another ECU 2b in this particular area."
"We thought that since sheep and goats were included in the original Directive 102, that they should have been included in this one as well."
"On behalf of the Budget Control Committee I would urge the Commission to bring forward legislation to give us further assurances in relation to the spending of this money."
"Madam President, in principle I agree in general with what Mr Mayer told us."
"Besides, everything provided for by the regulation and the amendments that improve it needs to be done, if meat is to be labelled."
"Unless we have a system for the recognition and registration of cattle, it will not be possible to label beef and other beef industry products."
"However, Madam President, I want to stress the magnitude of the effort that will be needed to register the 95 million head of cattle in the European Union in data-bases and monitor their movement."
"That is something which would have been unthinkable only a few years ago, but which is necessary today and will cost a huge amount, the cost of the Community bodies' folly to say the least."
"It is the price we will be paying for the profit enjoyed by others thanks to their stance throughout the BSE crisis."
"There is, however, a problem Madam President."
"Some countries are nearly ready to go ahead with that system, while other Member States are very poorly prepared or even entirely unprepared."
"If we want to avoid creating loopholes for illegal economic methods, smuggling and other suchlike, which would ultimately go against the interests of public health, I think it will be necessary to adopt the amendment we voted for on the Environmental Committee and which essentially calls on the Commission to prepare and finance a special programme to harmonize the laws in all Member States and to supply the necessary electronic and other infrastructure, so that the recognition and registration system can be implemented as soon as possible throughout the European Union."
"Madam President, the proposals we are today discussing are, in my view, very important."
"I see a strong connection between the subject of today's debate - Mr Mayer's report - and what we were yesterday discussing in relation to the BSE crisis."
"I believe that it is very important that we introduce a system for the identification and registration of cattle that is effective, sound and secure."
"At the same time, I very much appreciate the argument concerning the labelling of beef and beef products which, as has been stated in the European Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, has to be made compulsory and not just voluntary."
"In my view, these are important signals that we need to give to consumers who have currently lost all confidence in beef and beef products and all other products of animal origin. That loss of confidence has been triggered by the methods of husbandry, the problems - from time to time condemned - involved in the transport of animals and the difficulty in identifying the origin of the product that turns up in processed form on our tables."
"On top of all those difficulties, in themselves chronic, structural and indicative of the problematic state of the beef and beef products' market in Europe, we then had the BSE crisis which made the situation considerably more complicated."
"I therefore believe that the system of passports for the animals, the data bases, the ear-tagging and the registers kept at each holding which my group believes should be absolutely compulsory - with no exemptions even for transitional periods which would in fact make them optional - are all extremely important factors both in terms of health and veterinary controls and to prevent fraud in the administration of the premiums provided for by the common agricultural policy in the beef and beef products sector."
"I believe, Commissioner, that we need soon to identify guidelines for reform of the common organization of the market in beef and beef products; this is an issue on which announcements have been made on several occasions, and I believe that all of our countries and, more particularly, the producers of the European Union, are right to demand that we should move on rapidly from words to deeds."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in the wake of the BSE issue and the crisis of confidence it has engendered among consumers, the three proposals on the registration of cattle and the labelling of beef, as well as the Olsson report, are of great importance."
"It is quite simply vital that we succeed in restoring consumer confidence."
"The possibility of proving the origin of cattle and beef will be a decisive step in that direction."
"The Commission's strategy of providing for the registration of cattle and for the compulsory introduction of both a database and animal passports is the correct approach."
"We should not let ourselves be put off by supposed technical difficulties."
"The experience of some Member States with databases has shown that they have considerable potential."
"It is undeniable that the 1992 Directive has not been satisfactorily transposed. Perhaps it was never properly transposable."
"Speculation about the origins of individual animals remains rife."
"We should be in no doubt that the real work to implement the new Regulation still lies ahead of us."
"For example, steps must be taken to ensure that exchanges between the databases of Member States actually work in practice."
"What use is it to a French farmer if he is offered an animal from Spain but has no knowledge of its precise origin because its data are only available in the Spanish database, to which he has no access, or vice versa ?"
"I simply cannot understand why the Commission wants to allow fourteen days after importation for compulsory identification of animals from third countries."
"This provides scope for fraud to take place during that very period."
"I emphatically support the amendment tabled by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development whereby imported animals would be identified immediately, as the Mayer report states."
"The entire system, however, will only serve its purpose if the evidence of origin can also be communicated to the consumer."
"For that reason we need beef to be labelled all the way through to the shop counter."
"We in the House are agreed that a voluntary labelling system as proposed by the Commission is the wrong way to restore consumer confidence."
"In my opinion it is futile to rely on market forces to create a system of labelling."
"As long as there is no blanket provision for the labelling of such products throughout Europe, distrust will continue to prevail among consumers."
"Only a compulsory labelling system can remedy the situation."
"The message given by the Commission to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection was this: if labelling is voluntary, meat products and other by-products, such as those containing gelatine, can be included in this Directive."
"But the result of that will be a lot of labelling, a lengthy process and a great deal of concealment."
"What you are presenting to us here is a conjuring trick."
"According to these proposals, eight details about the animal from which the gelatine is derived must appear on packaging such as a cream carton: the date of slaughter, the sex of the animal, the method used to cut up the carcass, to name but a few."
"That is unrealistic, and we should steer well clear of it."
"I naturally understand the motives of those who advocate a far-reaching compulsory system here too."
"It is a fact that we need to give a clear signal after the BSE crisis, to prove our determination to make a fresh start."
"The question, however, is whether this is possible with a set of requirements that can scarcely work in practice."
"I can only warn against pursuing that approach."
"While we may understand the motives, we must ask ourselves whether public confidence would be far more seriously dented if such labelling were to prove impossible and if, in trying to meet our obligation to deal with this matter, we were seen to be doing something that was perhaps incomprehensible and perhaps even mistaken - for that situation is on the cards."
"What will happen when that sort of thing occurs?"
"How do we then hope to restore consumer confidence?"
"I believe we should only put verifiable information on labels."
"Of course, no Member State should be prevented from adopting rules of its own, but at a European level we should not go through with this."
"What should not, however, be rejected, Commissioner - and this is my earnest plea - are our demands that the reports be dealt with under Article 108. After yesterday's speech from Mr Santer, I believe you will find it easy to agree to these demands."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has unanimously endorsed them."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights has agreed that negotiation on the matter is legitimate."
"So we are well on our way."
"Madam President, I in turn wish to point out how sensible it was to schedule this debate for the day after the BSE debate and also to link these three reports, which in fact complement one another, like three links in the same chain, producing an important outcome: new guarantees for consumers and also new obligations for producers."
"However, there is still perhaps too little involvement of third parties who are also important here: by this I mean the wholesalers and retailers who are in fact, at the point of marketing, important links and have also to be made to take responsibility, particularly as regards labelling."
"I wish to dwell for a moment on the agricultural world and the problems that this new development could cause."
"Hitherto, with the ear-tagging and inventory, more or less all farmers - even the smallest of them - were able to manage fairly easily."
"But it cannot be denied that this new legislation brings on to the farm elements previously quite unfamiliar in this context: computers, in the first place, which require a different kind of professional training and maybe even a new kind of worker."
"It is plain that all of this may involve - and I am certain of this - new costs and a different professional commitment, even though improved qualifications will result."
"Therefore, I am in favour of this new development, but before we give someone a car, I think it worth checking whether they have a driving licence, otherwise it would end up off the road."
"This then is what I propose: a staged reform, particularly as regards the introduction of the data bases which, if they are to be reliable, have continually to have data fed into them by a substantial percentage of producers."
"The proposal that we create a 'buffer year' after the 31 December 1997 deadline seems to me to be reasonable."
"And here I am thinking above all of the small producers, the hill farms in which - given the small number of people working them - all of these innovations could cause consternation and confusion."
"Once the data base is complete, we can think in terms of a passport, an undoubtedly fascinating and ambitious proposal, that would accompany cattle movements, the rearing and the whole of the life of the animals, to the point of the final certificate which we shall be able to identify in the label, the final stage in a system of documentation that has always to be based on clear and comprehensive data to guarantee the quality and thus the characteristics of the product - a clear indication of origin, methods of processing and any veterinary controls."
"That applies particularly to the by-products of meat processing."
"I am thinking here with some concern of the famous hamburgers, so much loved by the young people listening to us here and in relation to which these labels are more important than in other areas of meat processing. The hamburger whose origin, content and, above all, quality are frequently still a matter of hoping for the best."
"Mr President, I represent Somerset in North Devon, which is the cattle heartland of the UK, and what we do not know about beef and beef products is hardly worth knowing."
"We have been gravely hit by the recent crisis in confidence in this sector."
"That is why I welcome these Commission regulations and indeed Mr Papayannakis' suggested amendments, because I feel they are essential to restore public confidence in the whole of the beef industry."
"My group favours an obligatory system of labelling."
"We believe that while geographical origin is important, it is certainly not the conclusive or definitive factor."
"What we want to see is the kind of things asked for in Mr Papayannakis' Amendment No 4 on minimum standards."
"We want to see labelling that would cover also genetic engineering techniques and the use of stimulants in beef production, although here we prefer Mr Tamino's Amendment No 29 to those put down by the rapporteur."
"I believe that it even is more important to label processed goods containing beef and beef products than to label the meat itself, even if this is difficult."
"This is the area where public confidence is really at its lowest."
"It is important that the public be aware - and this is something Liberals have striven for in the European Parliament - of exactly what goes into the foodstuffs that they are buying."
"I believe, too, that stricter labelling requirements would help farmers."
"Farmers have lost control of their industry."
"They have lost control of the industry upstream, where the feedstuffs manufacturers are concerned, and they have lost control of the industry downstream to the large food chains."
"Requirements that would help boost public confidence would also help farmers to regain control over this important industry."
"Therefore, Liberals in this House support the idea of an animal passport."
"I would like to conclude by suggesting to the Commission that we will need, very shortly, a much wider review of food labelling requirements in the European Union."
"We have a whole mass of regulations; these need to be brought together in one document."
"Madam President, I believe that, as the debate has made clear, the whole House understands that the time has come to introduce these three provisions and hold a joint debate on them, as they are interlinked. They are interlinked first and foremost because there would be no point in having labelling - which we want to be compulsory - if we are unable positively to identify cattle, hence the need for the ear-tagging, the data bases, the passports for animals, the farm registers and, in future, the possibility of electronic tagging also."
"All of these are vital measures that have to be brought into effect as rapidly as possible, so as to be able to offer a guarantee of results."
"The aim is to be able to guarantee citizens and consumers positive controls and, therefore, labelling which we believe has to be compulsory for beef and beef products and, in future, for other kinds of meat also."
"In addition to being compulsory, the label has also to be absolutely clear, also according to the guidelines already accepted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the basis of the amendments tabled also by the Greens."
"Of course, we believe that this could have been done earlier and it was not necessary to wait for the BSE crisis before getting this far."
"But now that we have reached this stage, we must demand that what was said yesterday in the Chamber by President Santer should be done very quickly."
"We are therefore expecting the Commission to state clearly to us today that the label will be compulsory and that it will not therefore be opposing the amendments tabled to that effect."
"We are also expecting a label that is very clear - one reason why I am hoping there will not, for example, be objections to the reference to genetically modified organisms."
"That is also why there has compulsorily to be included on food product labels information on products derived from genetically modified organisms."
"The legal base, as pointed out in the Papayannakis and Olsson reports, should be Article 100a, and we expect Commissioner Fischler to say as much directly; nothing else is needed, it is sufficient that the Commission accepts it."
"DG XXIV needs to be reorganized in such a way as genuinely to protect consumer health but it has also to be given adequate staffing and resources."
"Finally, we are expecting a real reform of the CAP in which the problems of the environment and consumer health take precedence over questions of quantitative production."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, cattle breeding is having a hard time of it, not only because of mad cow disease but a lot of other factors too."
"On 20 February it will be exactly two years since a veterinary inspector was cold-bloodedly murdered in Flanders and this killing is thought to be he work of the widely established hormone mafia."
"The illegal use of growth promoters in the beef industry remains a very serious problem."
"So the identification and labelling of beef are significant initiatives."
"And they complement each other."
"The first move is identification and registration, and labelling is the logical next step."
"I have a few reservations, however."
"The Mayer report includes the Agriculture Committee's Amendment 19, which wants producers to be given extra ear tags and passports so that they can themselves replace any lost ear tags and complete them legibly."
"To my mind that is extremely dangerous because it may lead to all manner of dubious goings-on."
"In my country, for example, we have a very good identification system."
"But there are dishonest cattle producers who often use forged ear tags and this practice is commonplace amongst the hormone mafia."
"The availability of extra blank or uncompleted ear tags or passports would really be an open invitation to fraud."
"My second worry: the plan is for a voluntary labelling scheme."
"I share Mr Papayannakis's concern that a scheme of this kind will create a dual market which is socially unfair."
"One will end up with an expensive market of labelled products and a cheap market with unlabelled products, and that is not on."
"Thus labelling must be universally compulsory, that alone will do."
"And my last point is this: some farms have introduced an electronic system of identifying their cattle."
"This works by the electronic recognition of chips implanted into the animals."
"It automatically registers any movements of the animals and is useful not only to the farmer but also to abattoir recording systems and even to the central databases."
"My question to the Commission is this: has Mr Schleicher already studied this system?"
"Is it practicable, what does it cost? I should be glad to know."
"Madam President, Commissioner, the report by Mr Papayannakis on the labelling of beef and beef products is to be welcomed, particularly where it confirms that labelling should be compulsory to provide accurate information to consumers of beef or beef products."
"Had this happened in the past, we should certainly have been better protected from the risk of a BSE epidemic."
"Currently labelling is voluntary and that is why, by approving the report, the House would be rejecting the Commission proposal seeking to make labelling optional."
"Good sense and courage are needed here: either we try to win back the consumer confidence or we try to work in the interests of some breeders who are seeking to make matters worse by refusing to make public what should appear on the labels: provenance, processing, shelf-life and additives used in the product marketed."
"I agree with the view that operators who import meat or meat products from third countries ought also to label them."
"Alleanza Nazionale is in favour of the labelling of beef and beef products, although it is aware that some animal control measures may involve substantial operational difficulties and require a considerable organizational and financial input."
"In an earlier speech on BSE, I said dura lex sed lex ."
"Today, I have to say that we cannot have our cake and eat it, therefore we need to talk not only in terms of preventive measures - for instance, the identification and registration of cattle and computerized data bases - but also in terms of maximum clarity where the product is being released on to the market."
"Yes then to the labelling of beef and beef products: we need at least to agree that information on the origin and processing of meat has to be compulsory."
"We shall be voting for the amendments designed to secure this."
"Madam President, I should like first to pay tribute to the excellent work done by all the rapporteurs and in particular Mr Papayannakis, both in his own report on the labelling of beef and also in writing the opinion for the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection on Mr Mayer's report on the identification of cattle."
"We all know the background to these two reports, and also that by Mr Olsson, which were linked by the Commission."
"One of the key issues that emerged yesterday in our very long debate on the report of the special committee on BSE was the need to be able to identify and monitor cattle if BSE is to be eliminated."
"One of the great problems in identifying the right cattle to be slaughtered in the UK was the lack of accurate records."
"Sometimes both farmers and the public at large see that BSE-free herds have been slaughtered first whilst herds that had had cases of BSE were left in limbo, their owners knowing that the cattle would be culled at some time but not knowing whether to buy in extra winter feed or not."
"The proposals for the proper registering of herds by means of ear tags, individual cattle passports and computer bases are to be warmly welcomed."
"It is important that information about parentage, herd, date of birth and farms where held should be easily checkable."
"Given the particular situation in Europe at present, the Environment Committee is proposing amendments to add information on feeding, hormones and medicines."
"There is increasing consumer anxiety about the effects on human health of excessive exposure to antibiotics."
"Indeed, if animals are reared more extensively, as was discussed yesterday, there will not be the same fear of infection which has led to antibiotics being routinely added to animal feed."
"Consumers want to know that they are not ingesting excessive residues of antibiotics when they eat meat."
"This is why the labelling scheme fits in with the registration scheme which has to be put in place to provide the information required for the accurate labelling of beef."
"Mr Papayannakis rightly proposes that the labelling should be compulsory and that beef products, not just beef, should be included in its provisions."
"This is very important since it is more often prepared beef products, rather than beef itself, which present a risk of infection."
"This is because they are often made from mechanically recovered meat and meat from parts of the carcass not normally on sale in supermarkets and butchers."
"This is not just about BSE."
"More people have died recently from E coli in the UK than from the new strain of CJD as a result of eating contaminated beef products."
"The very elderly and the young are particularly vulnerable to such infections."
"Of course hygienic preparation and thorough cooking can reduce the risk, but knowing that these products will have to be labelled as to the exact origin of the meat, including what the animal was fed on, will be a great incentive to manufacturers to ensure that these meat products are made only from wholesome raw materials."
"With the emergence of BSE and the new CJD in humans, we in Europe and especially in the UK have had a dreadful warning that we must not take risks with either human or animal health in pursuit of maximum profit."
"We must examine agricultural practice, monitor what goes into our food more exactly and give our consumers the information they require to give them confidence in the wholesomeness of what they are buying and eating."
"The Environment Committee - certainly its Socialist members - are making tough demands upon the Commission in terms of the information required, the need for the labelling scheme to be compulsory and cover beef products as well as beef and the need for rapid progress to be made in implementing the measures."
"The Socialist Group feels that we have a duty to promote public health and consumer protection in Europe."
"Our farmers and the beef industry can only benefit in the long term by the re-establishment of well-grounded consumer confidence."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the BSE issue, it is true, has permeated the recent work of the European Parliament."
"The report by the Committee of Inquiry tried to reconstruct and interpret the past, and I am sure that it will have repercussions."
"But now, I believe, we must set about charting our course for the future."
"We must see the present crisis as an opportunity to make improvements."
"Foremost among these improvements will be the restoration of consumer confidence, which has plummeted so alarmingly in the last few years."
"I need not reiterate to this House that the BSE crisis has brought countless farms to the brink of ruin."
"It is imperative that we succeed in taking swift measures to help these farmers throughout Europe whose plight is no fault of their own and to regenerate meat consumption."
"The identification of cattle and the labelling of meat and its derivatives have surely become imperative."
"The aim must be to remove the anonymity of meat."
"The consumer in the supermarket should not only have a quality guarantee but should also be able to identify exactly where the meat has come from."
"Accordingly, I consider it essential that both the identification of cattle and the labelling of beef be introduced as quickly as possible on a compulsory basis."
"I am well aware that this involves a great deal of organizational and financial input, but too much damage has already been done in the cattle industry for anyone to be content with half measures now."
"I believe that the proposed system of identifying individual animals with ear tags and maintaining computerized databases, animal passports and farm cattle registers can work well if people want it to."
"Besides the Member States, the Commission will also bear special responsibility for providing the necessary technical infrastructure; this must not entail disproportionately high costs, particularly for small producers."
"I believe we can also learn from the BSE crisis that in future we must look beyond the market and profits and give due consideration to the protection of the health and interests of consumers too."
"It seems vital to me that imports from third countries should also be subject to equally strict criteria and to compulsory identification and labelling."
"By a foreseeable date it must be possible to identify reliably the exact origin of every single cut of meat on sale in the European Union."
"There are ethical and moral boundaries."
"Politicians are required to recognize these and to act accordingly."
"They must take the interests and needs of the citizens of Europe very seriously."
"Madam President, on the 20th March last, the declaration on the possible transmission of BSE to man by the consumption of beef has caused a widespread crisis in consumer confidence, and consequently an unprecedented economic loss for beef farmers."
"Our institutions have tried to act."
"Eleven months have already passed and we are talking seriously about regulations, cattle registration, labelling and monitoring."
"It is never too late to do good."
"Consumers still have every reason to be distrustful, if they know the conditions under which some farms rearing livestock for meat are run, the food products and drugs used and the possible consequences on health."
"The time has come to reassure them, on behalf of the majority of farmers who do their job well and yet are also penalized."
"A significant deficiency of the European texts and their implementation has now become striking: inadequacy of the Directive 92 establishing the framework of the cattle identification system, but also lamentable implementation."
"In fact, it was not until 1996 that some countries began to apply it."
"The Mayer report confirms the draft regulations for identifying and registering animals, but also encouraging effective health monitoring of herds and also the management of farming subsidies."
"The immediate creation of data banks is imperative."
"The directive on the monitoring of products originating from non-member countries also needs to be simplified."
"The immediate and compulsory labelling for beef and its derivatives is essential."
"This is of course the most important measure that will be able to restore credibility."
"And we support it, as we support the institution of sanctions."
"Confidence is not decreed; it is earned."
"In this case, it is re-earned."
"This is why we will support the content of these three reports and congratulate the rapporteurs."
"Madam President, Mr Commissioner, I should like to begin by thanking the rapporteurs for these important reports."
"Consumers demand animal products which are safe and unproblematic from the point of view of health, and they also insist on an assurance that the conditions in which animals are reared and transported ensure a satisfactory standard of animal welfare."
"The Community particularly needs to make progress with regard to animal transport in the EU, so much negative publicity has there been on this subject."
"In the ELDR Group we regard a compulsory marking and registration system for cattle and marking of beef and beef products as essential measures and as means of restoring consumer confidence in beef and beef products."
"A compulsory marking system will be more effective than a voluntary one."
"Parliament's opinion calls for an animal passport system covering the whole of Community territory and computerized databases to enable animals' origins, movements, whereabouts, slaughter etc. to be monitored openly."
"The report's explanatory statement quite rightly observes that the system must not become too complicated, bureaucratic, expensive or partially overlapping, as will happen if, for example, four different systems are set up."
"I would therefore ask whether it would not be sensible to introduce animal passports only for animals which move from one country to another."
"In implementing the system, it ought to be possible to use common sense in the Member States to ensure that the measures taken and their cost are in the right proportion to the benefits they yield."
"If a centralized animal register which exists in a Member State is operating effectively, so that all the necessary information can be obtained from it, that should be enough."
"After all, the production structure differs from country to country, and it ought to be possible to take this into account."
"It is very important to restore consumer confidence, and I would therefore urge the Member States and the Commission to act quickly with the aim of introducing the system at the end of this year."
"The Olsson report on the principles governing the organization of veterinary checks on products entering the Community from third countries is also very important from the point of view of safeguarding consumer health."
"The basic principle absolutely must always be that agreements entered into must not endanger the health of consumers or animals."
"A third country's legislation should be considered equivalent only if the level of safety for which it provides is at least as high as that conferred by the EU's own legislation."
"As a representative of Finland, I would warn the EU authorities against any departure from this principle, since I know that, particularly with regard to the agreement with the United States, the EU would be willing to compromise even the present level of safety if the EU could thereby correspondingly increase its exports."
"I hope that the BSE crisis has at least taught the Commission that, even in the business world, a high standard of ethics and morality, which is above bribery, should be adhered to."
"Animal welfare provisions must be incorporated in these agreements."
"Madam President, there are at least two lessons we must learn from the BSE crisis: the first is that with regard to livestock production, two checks are better than no checks at all, and secondly we can no longer rely on only the actions and decisions of the Member States to give a Community guarantee to any food product."
"The Commission bases itself on the illusion that stating the geographical origin is sufficient to protect the consumer, and it is therefore proposing optional labelling."
"With just reason, Mr Papayannakis would like to improve this system which is more than just incomplete with the introduction of additional information: place of birth of the animal, breed, sex, and also the breeding and fattening regions and method of reproduction."
"These amendments of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development link up with those of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection - it may never happen again - and aim to render it compulsory to label meat and derived products."
"We naturally strongly support this step."
"After the BSE affair, which the Commission was hardly able to keep abreast of, the remaining uncertainties require more than ever that we observe the principle of caution."
"Moreover, compulsory labelling must be linked to the system upstream, of birth registration and continued identification proposed by Mr Mayer."
"The current situation now imposes the tracing of domestic animals as a basic guarantee for both farmers and consumers."
"Nevertheless, there must be a system which is effective without being too restrictive for the farmer."
"The new regulations must recommend a single identification at European level, without which the lessons of the BSE crisis will not have served much."
"So that the regulations can be applied by farmers in their daily practice, they must be simple and combine in a single procedure the current administrative obligations, registration and information to the appropriate authority (passport criteria and information)."
"This requirement could be reduced to one registration, of which one copy is reserved for the appropriate authority and another for the passport."
"Finally, as one must draw information from the current situation, it appears wrong and dangerous not to require that an inspector go into the farms to check ear tags and staff."
"In this respect, we naturally support Mr Olsson's report."
"Colleagues, I submit for your reflection the fact that we have under our eyes three reports on a delicate subject, three pieces of evidence that the Commission is continuing only to half deal with the matter in order not to displease certain systems which would like to be as liberal as possible, and which are therefore the most propitious to fraud."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have come to deal with an important aspect of the BSE issue, namely the identification of animals, but also the labelling of beef."
"We in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development agreed that compulsory identification should also apply to beef products."
"I hope that the Commission will endorse our view, because we believe that farmers are not the only ones on whom responsibilities can be imposed - and it is right that they should be imposed, and we do support that - but the processing industry should also be brought into line."
"The tendency of the processing industry to buy as cheaply and anonymously as possible must be stopped, partly for the sake of consumers but also partly for the sake of producers, since processing companies would then have less freedom to keep changing suppliers."
"Compulsory labelling would enable producers to set realistic prices but would also help consumers by enabling them to trace the origin of meat."
"To put it rather tritely, if I bought beef produced by Meier and Company, and if, as a consumer, I was very satisfied with it, I should assume that Meier produced good beef; if, however, on my next visit to the same retailer the label showed that the meat was not from Meier's, I should want to know why that supplier was no longer being used."
"If the answer was that the meat could be bought more cheaply from another company - which, of course, is normally the motive for changing suppliers - that rationale would have nothing to do with quality but would be based purely on business considerations, which might not be understood by consumers."
"They would prefer to stay with the supplier they knew and trusted, and that reinforces our position."
"Allow me to end with one more thought. When we speak of all this registration, Mr Fischler, we must not, of course, confuse registration with the fight against BSE."
"When we feed registered cows with infected meat-andbone meal, they will still become mad cows - or registered insane cows; let us be clear about that."
"Registration is an aid and an indicator for consumers, but it is not a remedy for BSE, if I may reiterate that quite plainly."
"Madam President, at the end of the '80s, the European Parliament adopted the Borgho report on the labelling of food products of controlled quality of origin."
"To date, provisions have not really been made for this report to be followed by effects."
"I believe, Commissioner, that what we are asking through these three reports is titanic work, but necessary for ensuring the confidence of the European citizen and consumer in its institutions."
"Labelling, quality, fraud, traceability: all these points go together and one still wonders how it was possible to take so lightly this contract between the authorities and consumers."
"In a manner of speaking, one cannot now say, when consuming products imported from Great Britain, whether or not they contain gelatin."
"These products are in circulation."
"I have been informed that problems also arise with registration, when animals change State and the receiving State wishes to re-register them under their own registration."
"All this causes delays which naturally lead to fraud."
"No one is safe, no one can guarantee that he will play the game right up to the end."
"It is our role, it is your role, to demand that a system be introduced which will ensure traceability."
"Commissioner, transparency and cooperation between institutions urge me to ask you to apply Article 101 of the joint decision to identification and traceability, as one cannot guarantee the cohesion of a system without demanding that all points be governed by the same procedure, that of transparency and cooperation."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if what the press says is true, the Ministers of Agriculture held exploratory talks on this subject in Brussels on Monday."
"Exploratory talks!"
"This battle over an electronic button in the ears of cattle is, in my view, a surefire means of breeding Euro-exasperation."
"Why, I wonder, do we need so much time for the whole introduction process?"
"Besides the labelling of meat, it is planned to introduce computer-based identification of cattle in the EU."
"The points at issue are when the measures should be introduced and whether they should be compulsory."
"In my opinion, identification and labelling ought to be binding obligations for all Member States by the end of the millennium at the latest."
"In Germany this is scheduled to take effect on 1 January 1998."
"In many regions there are already successful programmes under which labels of origin are prescribed for meat products."
"The use of a memory chip will make it possible to store all the necessary information on origin, breed and ownership."
"The data may be retrieved at any time by means of a scanner."
"Needless to say, Commissioner, I should not wish the electronic component to be found by the customer when he carves his Sunday joint at the lunch table, so the question of a sensible niche for the microchip, based on practical experience, will certainly have to be discussed somewhat sooner."
"Sadly, however, I have to note that the secondary industries related to agriculture are not always equally interested in the transparency of markets."
"The supply of beef of guaranteed origin still leaves much to be desired."
"For that reason I have to ask what the cost of this proposed Regulation will be."
"Its implementation will surely entail a considerable amount of expenditure in the Member States."
"I believe that care must be taken to ensure that the hard-pressed agricultural sector in Europe is not burdened with excessively high costs."
"The entire measure will be considerably cheaper than the bill we have run up over this whole BSE issue to date."
"The funding of the new system from EU or national resources must, in my view, be legally guaranteed."
"The planned official identification of animals imported from third countries should also take place immediately upon entry into the Community."
"Madam President, we spent a full day yesterday discussing the impact of BSE on public health and the serious consequences for our farmers, the food industry and employment, and we are, of course, also conscious of the consequences for our competitive position in world trade."
"It is right and proper that we put in place the most stringent controls in the entire area of food production, right through from producer to consumer."
"In my contribution to yesterday's debate I highlighted the urgency of implementing a full traceability programme from producer to consumer."
"With modern technology and proper animal coding, this procedure, as we now know, is possible and is already considerably advanced in my own country, Ireland, where we have pioneered a traceability programme in the lamb trade - the first within the European Community."
"We are also considerably advanced in relation to the most modern technology in identifying all our other animals."
"I also come from a country where meat production, and in particular beef production, is an important economic sector, because we export 85 % of our entire production."
"So it goes without saying that BSE has been a disaster for Ireland."
"The quality of Irish beef is renowned."
"It must also be put on the record that from the moment of the first suspected case of BSE in my country we implemented a full-herd slaughter programme."
"Our farmers are now the innocent victims of circumstances beyond their control, and the Commission must give practical recognition to their economic plight."
"I must say that I am somewhat concerned that a statement from President Santer yesterday would seem to imply that the BSE crisis will lead to a more radical reform of the common agricultural policy than was originally anticipated."
"This to me indicates a panic reaction, and we must not allow our understandable concern with public health - and it is proper that we should be concerned - to unnecessarily undermine the importance of the common agricultural policy as an essential management support measure for sustainable European agriculture and, in particular, its importance in keeping the maximum number of farm families on the land of Europe and, as well, in the broader context of rural development, to which I know our present Commissioner Fischler is totally committed."
"In conclusion, I wish to put on the record again my appreciation of the Commissioner's commitment to agriculture and to rural development."
"I will defend his position anywhere, on any platform or forum in Europe."
"Madam President, BSE is a serious European problem."
"Everything possible must accordingly be done to overcome it and repair the damage it has caused."
"From the measures in hand and those of which we know it appears that the Commission's resources are being reinforced and the scope for supervision improved."
"An animal and plant disease unit is being set up in Dublin, individual marking of cattle is being improved, and databases are being established."
"Marking of the origin of beef is being rendered more precise, and meat imports are to be monitored more effectively."
"The question is, does the European Union repose too much confidence in monitoring and administration?"
"For example, the cattle marking system amounts to an enormous population book-keeping exercise; it relates to millions of individuals, which, moreover, are replaced rapidly."
"It is intended to enter in centralized files, inter alia, particulars of a cow's mother, sex, all pastures where it has spent any time, and date of slaughter."
"Is it realistic to assume that Europe's cattle can be individually monitored by means of centralized databases, or are we just creating an enormous bureaucracy?"
"On the other hand, is the focus of the monitoring right?"
"BSE was able to spread because farmers trusted their own countries' veterinary authorities and their morals, and because they trusted feed producers, while using legal and approved feed."
"Is it not here that more resources are needed?"
"Making it possible to trace beef is purely a retrospective monitoring measure, and will not remedy serious damage after the event."
"Madam President, there is a silver lining to every cloud."
"It took the epizotic disease of BSE and its dramatic consequences on human health and farmers' incomes for the European Union to decide to reinforce and harmonize cattle identification and registration measures."
"In this respect, we feel that the Mayer report, which goes further than the European Commission proposals, is in the right direction, although one should avoid increasing the obligations imposed on the States."
"For example, to impose on each farm ear marking, a computerized data base, a register and passport for the animals, risks not only increasing bureaucratic provisions, but could also lead to fraud, because of lack of sufficient financial means or the complexity of the legislation."
"One has the impression that with these proposals, the Commission and the Council are trying to clear themselves of ten years of laxism concerning animal imports and identification, and that they are now going over the top to try to regain a somewhat waning credibility."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we quite rightly wish to restore consumer confidence in beef."
"And at the same time, the European Commission is authorizing the import of genetically-modified corn; perhaps tomorrow hormoneproduced beef, under pressure from the Americans."
"Is it not a great hypocrisy to take measures, certainly necessary, even if some have a dual purpose, and at the same time eliminate frontier controls and write off the liability of the British government, which is primarily responsible for the mad cow crisis?"
"Let us remember that the BSE crisis has already cost European tax-payers over 23 thousand million francs for 1996 alone."
"The beef interprofession wonders whether, if the animal is born and has been raised and slaughtered in the same country, stating the country of origin is indicated."
"Similarly, if it comes from different countries, the statement must indicate one of the origins, and in all cases the place of birth and the place of rearing."
"To the traceability of the animal, it would be appropriate, Madam President, to add the guarantee that the animal has always been fed on grass or cereals."
"It is under only this condition that the link of confidence between producer and consumer will be re-established, and that the beef market will regain its pre-crisis level."
"Technical measures have never replaced a political desire which has cruelly failed our politicians in this major BSE crisis, as in many other fields."
"Madam President, yesterday this house debated the report of the temporary Committee of Enquiry into BSE."
"The report clearly illustrated the importance of an effective system of animal identification in the European Union."
"European rules on the identification of animals have been in place since 1992, although not implemented satisfactorily in all Member States."
"I am in no doubt that the BSE crisis would have been far more severe had it not been possible to trace those animals which potentially carried the infection."
"Inability to trace the 1989 and 1990 British cohort in the UK was one of the major factors which delayed the agreement of the UK's BSE eradication plan."
"Whilst this week marks the end of the temporary Committee's enquiry it does not mark the end of the crisis."
"Normality will only be restored when European citizens are confident that such a crisis will never be repeated."
"This can only be achieved when effective legislation and controls are put in place to allow swift action to be taken should a risk to public health ever appear."
"Part of that control system requires a rapid identification of animals which potentially pose a risk."
"This is not only to protect consumers, but also to protect farmers and tax-payers against the unnecessary slaughter of healthy animals."
"Such a system must be European-wide as such crises are seldom confined to one Member State as the BSE crisis and the current problem of swine fever have shown."
"For these reasons I welcome the Commission's proposals and I am disappointed by the attempts of the rapporteur Mr Mayer to weaken the system proposed by the Commission."
"In a week when some members of the European Parliament are calling for the resignation of the European Commission for not taking sufficient action to prevent the BSE crisis it would be rather contradictory to vote against the kind of preventive measures which could have changed the course of agricultural history over the last ten years if they had been in place."
"Madam President, an old proverb tells us that every cloud has a silver lining, and today's silver lining comes in the shape of these three reports."
"I should like to congratulate everyone who has worked on them."
"We must ensure that we identify young animals which come from third countries."
"This point has been addressed."
"It is absolutely essential that we insist on this compulsory identification."
"Everything required of the enterprises based in our single market must also apply to imports, otherwise we are talking about half measures."
"The electronic identification system should be introduced, and I recently read, on a very prominent page of a prestigious daily newspaper in Germany, an essay on three identification procedures."
"I must say that each of the three procedures undoubtedly represents a prudent solution, but the challenge at the moment lies in finding out which of them is best."
"But without such identification we shall make no headway at all."
"I might also add, of course, that such electronic processes can usually work out cheaper in practice."
"Identification naturally costs money, but what about the enormous amount of money that non-traceability has cost?"
"So this is hardly the direction in which the argument should be pursued."
"The matter is urgent."
"We are, of course, in an awkward situation if we are saying this while Mr Mayer, on the other hand, is moving an oral amendment to have everything dealt with under Article 100a."
"Commissioner, I am fully aware that, in purely theoretical terms, this will result in a delay."
"It can last for up to a year, but here is my appeal to you: perhaps in this Parliament we might demonstrate how quickly codecision procedure under Article 100a can be implemented."
"Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, I have no doubt you would agree with me on that."
"We should set a good example here by applying Article 100a in record time, thereby also sending a message, perhaps, in the spirit of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"The gentlemen who head our national governments get themselves terribly bogged down; everything takes such a very long time."
"We agree on the substance; there are no disputed points as far as that is concerned."
"I therefore call upon you to deal with these reports as tabled here together with us in a summary procedure under Article 100a."
"Madam President, I agree very much with Mr Goepel when he says that the Commission should grin and bear it in relation to Article 100a. I support that."
"It is certainly grinning, but is it bearing it?"
"What we want here, in considering these three reports, is an acknowledgement that the world has changed utterly in the wake of the BSE crisis."
"Things are not as they were."
"The old comfortable attitude to the regulation of agriculture has gone - gone for good and quite rightly."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, as some of my colleagues have said, accepts, welcomes and supports the Olsson and Papayannakis reports, but it has problems of the kind that have been referred to earlier with the Mayer report."
"The reason for that, simply, is that we do not believe that the proposal should be watered down in the way that the rapporteur has proposed."
"We are certainly not in favour of amendments which constantly refer to keeping costs down."
"What is cost here?"
"It is not just the cost to the farmer of taking the necessary precautions."
"It is the cost to the Community if those precautions are not followed through."
"We have a saying in my country that if you think education is expensive, try ignorance."
"The same is true of information."
"We need to have the information in place and we need the legal base which will allow us in future to have a proper concern for consumer matters."
"That is what shifting the legal base of these reports from Article 43 to Article 100a would do."
"It would give Parliament codecision; it would be appropriate to proposals which are essential for the smooth functioning of a single market in which consumer priorities have their proper place."
"Only if we get that shall we be doing our job as a Parliament and acting in the spirit of what President Santer said yesterday in his speech of repentance and contrition."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the reports by Mr Olsson and Mr Mayer are very much interlinked as both of them are aimed at ensuring consumer safety, in terms of consumer products from European Union countries and other countries."
"As far as the Olsson report is concerned, I would like to know why the Commission is presenting directives and not regulations?"
"If every Member State should implement the same controls, why not make it compulsory through a Council regulation?"
"As far as the Mayer report is concerned, I would like to make a few remarks."
"The first is that I agree totally with the rapporteur when he says that it is not logical to make the register for identifying animals compulsory and the beef labelling system voluntary."
"Both of them should be compulsory, otherwise the whole effort to identify animals will make no sense."
"The second remark is that labelling should compulsorily specify the origin of the meat and also the fattening method used."
"We should also specify which controls the animals have been subjected to."
"The third remark is to emphasise the fact that the European Union cannot think up a whole set of measures of this type without accepting that it has to co-fund the expenditure inherent in these operations to be carried out by the Member States."
"Many of the problems which currently affect the field of animal and public health are related to the fact that these activities have never really been recognised as genuine Community policy."
"My fourth and final remark is that although I fully agree with the aims of these measures I think that their progressive extension to all types of animals - and even vegetable products - will, in the end, entail very difficult red tape to manage."
"Therefore, I think that it is time to think very seriously about setting up an institution of the 'Food and Drugs Administration' type - this was already referred to by the President of the Commission yesterday - which would mean that no products could be sold without its authorisation."
"After all, what we have gone through with BSE and other animal diseases, without prejudicing critical analysis of the action taken by the Council, the Commission and the Member States, could be put down, at the end of the day, to the non-existence of a genuine common policy in this area."
"From this point of view, we are suffering the effects of the 'non-existence of Europe' ."
"Now that the revision of the Treaty is being debated, I hope that our political leaders will not lose this opportunity to analyse the profound causes of these problems."
"Madam President, I think back to this time last year and I wonder, if we had had this debate in February 1996, whether there would have been quite such a consensus in favour of the Commission proposals and in favour of the Mayer report."
"The BSE crisis changed everything."
"It changed the way many people thought."
"When I spoke to farmers in my constituency they wished that they had a unique selling proposition which could prove that their herds were BSE free, that they were free of antibiotics or whatever."
"Had this had been the case, they could have then gone out and sold their products much more forcibly."
"They tried as hard as they could but the fact is that there was no agreed recognition by the national authorities, by local authorities or by consumers that would prove that their meat was alright, that it was good to eat - a good quality product."
"We need to ensure, in the global market, with global media, that we can protect those parts of our industry which come under attack so often and frivolously on occasion."
"We cannot afford to have these massive collapses in confidence in our food."
"I believe in this meat labelling scheme."
"I must concur with the last speaker, I am concerned about the voluntary nature proposed by the Commission for the end-product, but I believe that these meat registration and labelling schemes will ensure that if we have another disaster in our industry, we can ensure those parts which are not affected, will not be affected."
"This has my full support and I hope that we can implement this scheme as quickly as possible."
"One final point, the farmers will need finance to make sure they can implement the schemes and I hope that some thought is being given to that."
"Madam President, Commissioner, we all know that, even in a federal state, not all states obey the rules of public morality."
"Therefore, I am not completely in agreement with my friend, Arlindo Cunha, when he says that only a Union policy could put an end to the immorality that we see around us."
"We know that Arkansas is not as honest as New York."
"At least, that is what the newspapers tell us!"
"Now I think that meat and meat products should compulsorily be controlled, and they should compulsorily be labelled."
"I also lend huge importance to the Olssen report, because I think that at this moment - and my country is one where this happens - meat imported from the East is not being controlled."
"Only a while ago Portuguese veterinary surgeons were protesting against the lack of controls on meat entering the country."
"I think that, in this case, the Commission, instead of ducking this accusation, has sufficient moral authority because it is appointed by the Government and the States, to say openly and transparently that they are not proceeding properly."
"It makes no sense to continue covering up frauds for a small amount of money and it is not logical that we should put public morals on the line."
"From this point of view, the Commission is guilty because, as it is the guardian of the Treaties, it should not hide behind public morality, it should not hide behind controls and it should discuss the possibility of funding activities in the various countries where it should be carried out."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the provisions governing the identification and registration of animals, as very recent examples show, are partly inadequate, partly incomplete and are especially prone to cause problems in the domain of cross-border transactions."
"On the other hand, the quality-conscious consumer nowadays expects an up-to-date system of meat labelling which indicates at least the conditions under which the meat was produced and which makes it possible to trace the origin of the meat back to the farm of origin."
"At the present time there are two draft Regulations on the table. The first is for an identification and registration system for cattle, and the second is for the labelling of beef and beef products."
"The purpose of these Regulations is to provide guarantees of origin for live cattle and meat from the farm to the consumer, thereby creating a sound basis for the presentation of beef and beef products in a manner that merits the confidence of consumers."
"It is now a matter of proceeding quickly and rigorously; that, indeed, has been stressed by several speakers here."
"Secondly, the Commission also takes the view that a compulsory system of identification and labelling has to be established."
"However, I have to say that, for reasons of feasibility, an appropriate transition phase will certainly have to be allowed."
"During that phase, however, those countries that already fulfil all the conditions can go ahead with this type of labelling system."
"As far as the legal basis is concerned, the Commission is prepared to accept Article 100a as the basis for both of these drafts as well as for the report on veterinary checks, which would mean that today's debate would amount to a first reading."
"Nevertheless, I ask you to consider the fact that it will lose us time and that we shall be unable to act with the requisite degree of urgency."
"That applies especially to the identification and registration of animals, one of the main functions of which is to pave the way for compulsory labelling."
"Now, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, for the report on identification and registration."
"First of all I should like to thank the rapporteurs, Mr Mayer for the Committee on Agriculture and Mr Papayannakis for the Committee on the Environment, as well as Mr McCartin of the Committee on Budgetary Control, for examining our proposals."
"On the amendments let me say the following: I can accept Amendments 2, 5 and 6."
"I regret, however, that the Commission feels unable to accept the other amendments today, and I should like to explain its reasoning to the House."
"The Commission cannot accept Amendment 3 because animal breeding is not a Community objective, nor can it accept Amendment 4, because for reasons of subsidiarity it is not necessary for technical infrastructures to be identical in all Member States."
"Amendments 7, 9, 12 and 24 are unacceptable because it is crucial that our system should cover the whole Community and be coherent, so that the origin of cattle and beef can be effectively identified."
"Such a system would otherwise be counterproductive and would undermine the joint efforts of the European Parliament and the Commission to restore consumer confidence in the cattle and beef markets."
"Amendments 8 and 13 cannot be accepted either, because our proposal already states that, in particular, nationally recognized consumer organizations to which such information is of special importance are to have access to the database."
"So our proposal goes further than the amendments in this respect."
"The Commission cannot endorse Amendments 10 and 18, because we are already proposing the use of an alphanumerical code, comprising two letters for the Member State of birth with the remainder made up of numbers."
"We believe that the adoption of Amendment 11 would create a grey area, since extending the definition of the word 'keeper' to cover trading in animals would mean, for example, the inclusion of telephone transactions."
"Our objection to Amendments 14 and 18 is that details of the type proposed there are surely better covered by the Commission Regulation."
"Amendment 15 is not necessary because farmers can attach the ear tags themselves."
"In our opinion it is more practical to identify the animals with a new ear tag at their destination rather than at the point of entry."
"If the animals are imported for slaughter, the attachment of an ear tag is surely unnecessary, provided that the animals are slaughtered within a short time."
"This therefore means that Amendments 16, 17 and 26 cannot be accepted in their present form."
"Amendment 19 is unacceptable, because the stipulation that holdings may receive a particular number of ear tags would be regarded as a rejection of the subsidiarity principle."
"Likewise, the Commission cannot consent to Amendments 20, 23, 30 and 34, dealing with the dates of entry into force of various provisions."
"As you know, I take the view that we should reach a decision as soon as possible."
"That was the basis of the dates we laid down in the proposal."
"Nor can the Commission accept Amendments 21 and 22, because it is not necessary for the identification number of a holding in the database to comprise 14 characters."
"Twelve characters are more than ample."
"Moreover, the Commission proposal already provides for the registration of all holdings."
"Amendments 25 and 29 are a problem for us, because 30 days is too long a period for notifying data to a database."
"We take the view that such data should be made available quickly."
"The Commission is also unable to endorse Amendment 27, because I believe that the animal passport should not be issued until the keeper has notified the data."
"Amendment 31 is superfluous, because current legislation already contains provisions to this effect."
"The same applies to Amendment 32."
"As for the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, I should like to point out that these are already contained to some extent in the Mayer report."
"Besides, the position adopted by the Commission on these amendments will be clear from the opinion I have just delivered."
"Turning to the report by Mr Papayannakis, which deals with our proposal on the labelling of beef and beef products, may I also express my thanks to everyone involved in the reporting and in the work of the committees."
"I believe we all agree that this framework Regulation for a labelling system covering all of Europe should be adopted as quickly as possible."
"Our aim, as I have already said, is a compulsory system."
"For that reason the Commission cannot accept the wording of Amendments 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 22, 24 and 25, which basically relate to the introduction of a compulsory labelling system, for if we accept the compulsory system these amendments will have to be revised."
"But we must be realistic."
"I believe, and I have indicated, that it is not possible at the present time to introduce a compulsory system in all 15 Member States."
"We believe that it will probably take up to three years before we have established the necessary rules governing identification and the facilities required under this Regulation, such as databases and so on, in all Member States."
"A compulsory system, however, can only function in its entirety if its prerequisite, namely a fully operable labelling structure, exists in all Member States."
"But as I have said, so as not to hold back the others we should bridge this time lag with an optional system."
"The Commission cannot consent to Amendment 34 either."
"Details concerning the link between a piece of meat and the individual animal are set out clearly in Article 3(2) of the draft Regulation."
"Amendments 12, 16, 31 and 32 relate to the details that must be included on the label within a compulsory system."
"The logic outlined above must therefore be applied here too."
"On the other hand, the Commission is able to accept Amendments 23, 27, 30 and 33, which relate to processed goods, but not Amendments 2, 8 or 26."
"Let me assure you, however, that after a transition phase we shall also be able to include processed goods in the system."
"With regard to Amendment 21, the Commission shares the basic concern of the European Parliament that this Regulation, in view of its importance, should enter into force as soon as possible."
"For that reason, I shall plead this case in the Council too."
"The Commission is able to accept Amendment 18 in principle, but the provisions governing sanctions will be laid down in the implementing regulations."
"As for Amendment 19, the Commission takes the view that, rather than having annual reports submitted on the implementation of the Regulation, it would be more appropriate if such a report were submitted at the end of the transition phase."
"Amendment 4 states that Member States must be free to prescribe requirements that exceed the provisions of the Regulation."
"The Commission regards this as a step towards renationalization of the Common Market."
"Amendment 20 cannot be approved, because it is still too early to set a deadline for adoption by the Commission of the rules governing the application of the Regulation."
"The Commission can, however, accept Amendment 9, which relates to the independent controlling bodies."
"These bodies must fulfil the criteria listed in Euro norm 45011 and would be licensed by the relevant public authority, as is proposed in the Amendment."
"I have already spoken about the legal basis, so I can now turn to the last of the reports, for which I wish to express my gratitude to Mr Olsson and Mr Kindermann."
"When the single market took effect in 1993, an efficient system of veterinary checks on products imported from third countries became indispensable."
"Parliament and the Commission are in agreement on that point."
"It is time to improve the current provisions on veterinary checks on the basis of the experience which has now been amassed."
"On the amendments that have been tabled, let me say the following: the Commission is prepared to accept Amendments 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 17 and 18."
"They make the wording more transparent and offer better guarantees in certain areas such as the transmission of information and access to free zones."
"However, the Commission regards Amendments 4, 8, 9 and 10 as technically unwarranted."
"The rules proposed by Parliament for ship suppliers offer fewer guarantees than the original proposal."
"I therefore prefer the Commission text in this case."
"On the other hand, the Commission can accept Amendment 11, which allows the Member States a greater degree of flexibility."
"Amendment 16 does not meet with the approval of the Commission, which is not convinced in this case of the need for a transition period."
"A great deal of progress has been made in the harmonization of veterinary provisions for imports from third countries, and this ought to open the door to uniform checking procedure throughout the Community."
"As far as Amendments 12, 13, 14 and 15 are concerned, Parliament is no doubt aware of the Commission's general position."
"I regret that these amendments, which relate to institutional matters, cannot be accepted."
"Madam President, I assume that the Commissioner is well aware of the political importance of his intervention today, which is separate from that of the President of the Commission of a few hours ago."
"He has just told us, and this is very positive, that he wanted to change legal basis and adopt Article 100, but in the same breath, after giving us the carrot, he comes with the stick saying that he will not be able to accept the amendments demanding compulsory labelling."
"I find that that is an extraordinary contradiction, and would like to have confirmation of my interpretation."
"Perhaps I have misunderstood, but on the one hand we have the 100 A, and on the other hand the Commission does not support Parliament's amendments."
"So what is the advantage?"
"In the end, nothing."
"We already knew that the Commissioner would naturally want to make very liberal use of his red pen in his response to our amendments."
"However, Commissioner, I believe that the supreme principle is the restoration of consumer confidence."
"And for that reason we must push through practicable rules."
"Compulsory specifications for cattle identification and beef labelling can be rapidly implemented."
"I believe that, even with Article 100a as the legal basis, a message could be sent, as Mr Goepel said, that it need not take eleven months but that it is possible to adopt the relevant regulations more quickly, even on this legal basis."
"That is all."
"Madam President, I once asked Commissioner Fischler in a debate if he was willing to study the introduction of an electronic system, chips, whereby the animal could be monitored throughout its life."
"My question is whether he is prepared to look into the practicability and cost of that?"
"Madam President, first, I would like to say how valuable it is that the Commissioner has changed the legal basis to Article 100a. This is in line with Mr. Santer's words yesterday which pleases me."
"Otherwise there are no further problems, or at least not many, as far as my report is concerned."
"The Commissioner has accepted the bulk of the amendments, although not the proposal concerning the committee system, i.e. that more power is transferred to the Commission and that preparation work is carried out more openly."
"It would certainly have been helpful if this could have been accepted."
"One comment I must make about Mr Papayannakis report is that it would have been useful if it had taken a more robust attitude, i.e. the Parliamentary view of obligatory labelling of meat."
"I am practical so I realise that this is difficult."
"But I still believe that we must send out a tough message otherwise nothing will change."
"If the Commission now introduces a long transition period, there is a risk that a long time will elapse before there is any action."
"This is why I think it is so important for Parliament to give a clear signal during the day's session."
"Madam President, Commissioner, the simultaneous interpreting was a bit too fast and I did not quite catch all that, so I will ask you to answer three very simple questions, after first thanking you for accepting the change of the legal basis."
"The first question concerns the list of information that must feature on the label."
"You said we ought not to debate that, since for the time being it will not be compulsory, it will be optional for a while."
"I believe - and I would like your opinion about this - that even if labelling remains optional for a time, the labels should show certain specific data."
"The fact that the labelling is optional does not mean that everyone can declare whatever he likes. That would be unacceptable, and would render the measure pointless."
"The second question, Commissioner, concerns products."
"There is talk of labelling meat."
"The Environment Committee and the rapporteur, myself, insist that labelling should be applicable to beef-based products and processed products - i.e. by-products."
"I did not grasp your own position: do you accept that, or not?"
"The third question concerns the single system, the harmonization of the system for recognition and registration of cattle."
"Some countries have no such system and must acquire one very soon, so that the single system will work."
"I asked you whether you are considering setting up a special programme for that, a funded Community programme."
"I did not hear, or did not understand your answer."
"Ladies and gentlemen, perhaps this really has been somewhat rushed, but where there is a need to respond to so many points without taking up an undue amount of time, that is simply bound to happen."
"So first of all, let me spell out quite clearly once again that the Commission accepts Article 100a; I merely pointed out that it will have certain consequences."
"Secondly, the Commission accepts compulsory systems."
"There was no question of our making the animal identification system voluntary - it absolutely must be compulsory. The only question was whether labelling should be voluntary or not."
"Here, too, we accept compulsory labelling."
"However, I do ask you to appreciate the situation we face. If we say 'Compulsory - full stop' , this means that we must allow the Member States the necessary period of grace."
"We should then effectively have a legal vacuum in that interim period."
"That is why we saw fit to propose the introduction of a voluntary system for the transition phase, but that does not mean - and let me reemphasize this clearly too - that during the transition phase anyone can do as he wishes; on the contrary, regulations must still be observed, for instance in relation to the information the label must contain."
"Once more there are two separate questions here. Whether or not I produce labels is a matter of choice."
"The content of the label itself, however, has to be subject to clear rules."
"Only thus can it work properly."
"In connection with various amendments which I rejected, I stated very clearly that, in our view, they would not exactly improve the system."
"In fact, certain of them could create grey areas; moreover, in some respects our proposals go further than those of Parliament."
"I do believe that the Commission is entitled to highlight that sort of problem and in the first reading here - assuming now that Article 100a is our legal basis - to reject such proposals."
"I thank the Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"Voting will take place at noon."
"Welcome"
"I am pleased to welcome to the House a delegation from the Republic of Yemen, led by His Excellency, Mr Mohammed Abdo Said, the chairman of the Finance Committee in the Chamber of Deputies."
"Your delegation is honouring us with your visit at the second inter-Parliamentary meeting with the appropriate delegation of the European Parliament."
"I note with pleasure that relations between the European Union and Yemen are excellent and that our contacts at Parliamentary level have shown our mutual desire for cooperation."
"May I wish the Yemeni delegation profitable meetings and an excellent stay in Strasbourg."
"Veterinary medicine residues in food"
"The next item is the report (A4-0035/97) by Mr Kenneth Collins, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a Council Regulation (EC) amending Council Regulation EEC No. 2377/90 laying down a Community procedure for the establishment of maximum residue limits of veterinary medicinal products in foodstuffs of animal origin (COM(96)0584 - C4-0683/96-96/0279/(CNS))."
"Madam President, I should say at the outset that the view that I express this morning is the unanimous view of Parliament's Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, and I wish to make it clear that it is unanimous."
"Maximum residue limits - so-called MRLs - are the permitted levels of chemicals in animal products used for human food."
"They are covered by a Council regulation that was established in 1990 and was due to expire in December 1996."
"The concept is a very important one: what is the safe level of each chemical for humans to eat?"
"It is as simple as that, and so it is a matter not just of industrial policy or veterinary policy, it is a matter of public health."
"The market was split in two in 1990."
"There were old substances - so-called - more than 180 of them already on the market, which were to be progressively tested in order to have MRLs established, and there were new substances which were yet to come onto the market and which would have to have MRLs set before they were allowed to be sold."
"All the old substances were to be assessed and given MRLs by the end of 1996."
"This did not happen, meaning that all the substances currently without MRLs would, in fact, have to be banned from the Community unless legal action was taken."
"The Commission was very slow to produce the proposal."
"The old regulation expired in December 1996, the new one was not transmitted to Parliament until 10 January 1997."
"The current situation therefore is that there is a legal vacuum."
"The present Commission proposal tries to do two things: it tries to extend the time limit for the evaluation of chemicals, and we can accept that as it is clearly necessary; but it also tries to classify the substances used in animal clinical trials."
"A laudable aim, but I am afraid that two or three weeks is not sufficient time for Parliament to examine this properly and deal with a very important aspect of public health."
"We need an assurance that all the remaining MRLs will be carried out within a given timescale, if we agree to an extension."
"The committee is in no doubt that an extension is necessary, and we are prepared to go along with that."
"But, frankly, the rest is not good enough and, in our view, we must make public health our top priority."
"Moreover, the Commission proposal does not reflect concerns about clinical trials."
"Companies, we are told, have not always supplied the right information, sometimes even because the Commission has not always made it clear what it wanted and there are far too many substances whose trials have not even begun, never mind been completed."
"In this context, we cannot allow the risk to public health that untested chemicals might pose."
"So we accept the logic of extending the deadline, but we cannot accept the rest of the proposal."
"We have not been given time and we do not think it provides sufficiently for consumer safety: it is not complete and it leaves consumers, as well as drugs companies, in the dark."
"The European Parliament has only one reading on this - it is an Article 43 proposal - and we understand that the Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products may well report to the Commission in two weeks suggesting changes to the testing system."
"And yet here we are today being asked to allow this through on the nod."
"That is not satisfactory."
"The proposal, the timescale and substantive policy measures are all quite different."
"There are no rules in the Treaty to allow us to split this."
"Moreover, in spite of the fact that the Commission has been asked to demonstrate what the legal argument is, so far, at 11.40 a.m, it has not done so."
"I have not heard from the Commission what its legal argument is on the basis of the Treaty, and it is not for want of asking."
"I was promised it an hour and a half ago this morning and I still have not received it."
"It would have been preferable to fill the legal vacuum, but I am afraid that unless the Commission is able give a clear commitment that it will withdraw that part of the proposal that refers to the substances and agrees to proceed only with a timetable extension, then I am mandated by my committee to say quite clearly that we will take this back to committee for further amendment."
"That is the unanimous view of the committee."
"Mr Bangemann is indicating that he is surprised."
"I do not know why he is - if, indeed, he is - because it was made clear at the committee stage that this was the unanimous view and it was made clear to him in a letter only yesterday."
"I hope that the Commission can see its way to withdrawing the proposal which refers to the substances."
"I hope the Commission can agree to proceed only with the timetable."
"If it will do that, then I am quite happy to recommend to Parliament that we agree to the timetable change, but my committee is quite adamant that it will not agree to the rest."
"Mr Bangemann has asked to speak."
"I do not know whether it is for a motion of procedure or for a personal reason, but I noticed that he reacted very strongly."
"So I will call upon him to speak straight away, with the permission of Mr Collins and the other persons intervening, whom I shall call upon subsequently."
"Madam President, let me say first of all why I asked leave to speak just now - not because I am annoyed, but because we must begin by identifying the nature of the problem together."
"I gathered from Mr Collins' comments that there are still some uncertainties."
"For that reason I should like to tell you at this point what we think about the matter and how we believe the problems can be solved."
"Firstly, we certainly do not require Parliament to voice its opinion on the substance of the proposals within two weeks."
"Parliament can have the time it needs to examine these proposals carefully."
"The more recent developments can also be taken into consideration, and the Council - as Mr Collins knows - has confirmed in a letter to me that it will not decide on the substance before Parliament has formed and formulated its opinion."
"The letter was also sent to Mr Collins, as I have just heard."
"This means that nobody, either in the Council or the Commission, expects Parliament to deliver its opinion on the substance in a few days or hours, let alone here and now."
"That is not our wish, nor is it the wish of the Council."
"The Council has given a commitment."
"I believe that, in the interinstitutional dialogue, we should not assume that it will break a commitment which is recorded in writing."
"But, in order to relieve Parliament of this concern too, I can tell you now that, should the Council intend to decide without any parliamentary input, a scenario to which I attach no credibility whatsoever, we would withdraw the proposal."
"We can do that at any time."
"We would prevent the Council from taking a decision without Parliament having spoken."
"All we ask - and Mr Collins has even said he would support this - is that Article 14, in other words the extension of this time limit, be dealt with now, otherwise we shall get ourselves into an impossible tangle with regard to medicines that have been on the market for years and are perfectly harmless."
"That is the problem."
"It has taken a long time; that is true."
"This, however, is not the fault of the Commission. The Agency in London, for example, does not have enough staff, and the industry, as Mr Collins also said, has not always made the necessary documentation available."
"So the technical legitimacy of a two-year extension of the time limit is not, to my knowledge, being questioned."
"Madam President, I believe you will appreciate that it was necessary for me to say these things again here."
"The substance, the proposal as a whole, is not at issue."
"The Council will not decide before Parliament has delivered its opinion."
"Parliament has all the time in the world, however much it needs, and the Commission hereby promises that if the Council did not honour the commitments it gave in its letter - and this is a purely abstract hypothesis - we should withdraw the proposal, which would then no longer exist."
"The only thing we ask for as a matter of urgency is the application of Article 14, and that is legally possible."
"Madam President, the protection of animal breeding and human health are today priorities among the activities of the European Union, especially after recent events related to BSE."
"At the same time, the operation of the single market must be adapted effectively, so that products in circulation or to be circulated will ensure the protection of health and conform with the rules embodied in international agreements."
"The Commission proposal we are debating concerns the adaptation of the Regulation establishing maximum residue limits for veterinary medicines in foodstuffs of animal origin."
"With this proposal, the Commission is trying to adapt the Regulation by entrusting the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products with the task of examining applications for the establishment, amendment and extension of MRLs, and to streamline the decision-making process by means of this centralized procedure."
"At the same time, adaptation is considered essential because the Community must respect the obligations that stem from the agreement to implement sanitary and phytosanitary measures, reached during the multipartite negotiations of the Uruguay Round."
"The objective aimed for should not just be to adapt the Regulation, but to make a real contribution to the protection of public health, so that the establishment of uniform MRLs will permit the free movement of foodstuffs and veterinary medicines and effectively safeguard the protection of consumers in the single market."
"The first issue relating to the adaptation of the Regulation involves extending the timescale for the evaluation procedure."
"The difficulties that have emerged in connection with evaluation at Member State level, and in connection with the newly constituted European Agency, which only began operating in 1995, compel us to extend the timescale by two years, within which the Agency must complete its evaluation."
"Here, it must be stressed that to ensure public health and consumer protection entails placing restrictions on hazardous substances, which must be assessed by December 1997."
"Madam President, the aim of this proposal is to ensure that the taking of medicines by animals destined for consumption does not present any danger to the consumer."
"Veterinary medicines leave residues which persist for some time in animals, and are therefore likely to pass into the products destined for human consumption: meat, offal, milk and eggs."
"The harmfulness of these residues depends mainly on their degree of concentration in the foodstuffs in question, that which is called 'maximum residue limit of veterinary medicines in foods of animal origin' ."
"This is a technical definition, but it clearly states what it means."
"This limit was fixed by the regulation of January 1992."
"Since this date, no drug authorization has been issued without this maximum limit being fixed."
"Four hundred pharmaceutical products were awaiting this authorization, which should have been issued before the 1st January 1997."
"Unfortunately only 200 have been examined."
"The remaining two hundred are threatened by immediate withdrawal from the animal treatment market, which would have catastrophic effects on the agro-food industry, without public health benefiting either."
"We therefore ask for the date to be carried forward to the 1st January 1999."
"However, it would be dangerous and contrary to the protection of public health for foods originating from animals subjected to clinical trials to be consumed before a maximum limit - final and not provisional - has been established."
"It is therefore essential for animals subjected to clinical trials not to be destined for consumption before this final limit is established."
"Madam President, once again what we must bear in mind here is the safety of the consumer, and in this case his safety in relation to veterinary medicine residues in animal products."
"First essential point, deadlines."
"For the potentially most dangerous substances, it is of fundamental importance for these to be evaluated between now and the 31st December of this year, and if not prohibited from the 1st January 1998."
"Having said that, in view of the delay by the Commission, it is normal to accept an extension of three years for the other products which have yet to be evaluated by the European Agency."
"This deadline is necessary, otherwise over 200 old products would be withdrawn from the market immediately without distinction between the good ones and the bad ones, which would not be fair."
"Second essential point, clinical trials."
"The Commission's text is vague and imprecise on this point."
"It concerns the consumption of food coming from animals which have undergone clinical trials and contain in the organism residues of substances, some of which could present risks to the consumer."
"In the light of the crisis we are experiencing in the sector - and on this point I fully agree with Mr Lannoye - the entry of these drugs into the food chain is unacceptable."
"Madam President, I think we have to be clear about this."
"In intention I do not differ at all from Mr Bangemann."
"I want to make that quite clear."
"There the similarity between me and Mr Bangemann probably ends."
"I do not know that too many people have noticed many similarities in the past anyway."
"We accept entirely - everybody in the Chamber; everybody who has spoken and those who have not - that the time limit has to change."
"It can go to the end of the century, roughly speaking."
"We need about another three years in order to achieve the testing requirements."
"Where we are at variance, however, with Mr Bangemann is what you do legally with the rest."
"While I respect Mr Bangemann's intention to say to the Council: ' You cannot make a decision because you have not received Parliament's opinion' , the fact is that there is only one proposal on the table."
"There is only one reading on that proposal on the table because it is proposed under Article 43."
"Parliament has no mechanism at all for splitting it and neither, so far as I can see, does the Commission or the Council."
"What we have is a declared intention that they will not proceed."
"I am afraid these letters that I have received are not of official status."
"They do not reflect anything at all in the Treaty."
"There is nothing in the Treaty so far as I know - I hope Mr Bangemann can change my mind on this - which says that such a letter of intent constitutes a legal obligation."
"If there were such a thing then I might be persuaded to change my mind and the committee might be able to change its mind as well."
"But at the moment we do not have the guarantee that Parliament would be allowed to give an opinion on something which it has already given its opinion on because there is only one reading and one regulation."
"That is the nub of the problem."
"If we can solve that, if Mr Bangemann can show to us what the legal base for all of this is, then we might be able to change our minds."
"At the moment I can see no way forward at all, even though I agree with his sentiments and, I guess, he agrees with mine."
"We are of one intent but I am afraid that our view in Parliament is that we cannot have sufficient trust in the procedure that is being suggested to make it happen."
"I do not think that Mr Bangemann would be in a sufficiently powerful position vis-à-vis the Council to force it either because he would have no legal base for so doing."
"Madam President, in order to avoid any difficulties in understanding my unclear German, I want to switch into my excellent English first and then to French, so that everybody who has participated in the debate does not have to rely on our inefficient interpreting service."
"(Protests ) For me the service is excellent, I refer to the speeches made during that discussion."
"Things have become clearer because, as I said in the beginning, we are dealing today only with Article 14, we are not dealing with any other article."
"Article 14 foresees the extension of two years of these substances which are already available on the market."
"Ken Collins and the Parliament are ready to accept that."
"Your concern is: ' what shall we do with the substance of the proposal?'"
"The two positions are abundantly clear in terms of their legal interpretation: this is not the reading; the urgency has only been asked for Article 14 - for nothing else."
"Today we do not have to debate the substance."
"Nobody is asking for that."
"It can be done after the Parliament has taken its position."
"The only question at stake today is whether the Parliament can accept urgent procedure under Article 14 and this is what we are asking for."
"As to the guarantee, our Legal Service says it is alright."
"The Council has only asked for the urgency of Article 14 and, formally, urgency was not asked for anything else."
"In addition, if there were a difficulty, the Commission would be ready to withdraw the whole proposal in order to make it abundantly clear that Parliament has to state its view on the substance."
"I will say a few words in French as comments have been made in French on substances."
"If these comments reflect a position of Parliament - which remains to be seen - we are, as always, willing to consider what Parliament decides and you have time to decide."
"Clinical trials and all the other things which concern you can be examined and decided subsequently."
"The situation is quite clear, and this is why, if you agree with the change in Article 14, I do not see any reason for not having it."
"That is all you are asked for, nothing else."
"Madam President, I am grateful to you for giving me the time and I am also grateful to Mr Bangemann for his explanation."
"I know that we are supposed to vote on this in the next half hour or so."
"I wonder if it might be possible for us to vote tomorrow instead."
"Then I will have an opportunity to explore this personally with Mr Bangemann and his services and we might clarify the situation to our mutual satisfaction."
"If you would agree to that, I think that would be the best solution."
"I think it is an entirely reasonable proposal."
"I turn to the House as we would normally have had to vote on this report this morning, at noon."
"Are there any objections to us accepting this slight amendment to the agenda, namely postponing the vote on this report to tomorrow noon's voting time?"
"(The House indicated its agreement with the proposal) The debate is closed."
"The vote will be held tomorrow, at noon."
"My dear colleagues, Mr Whitehead has put forward a request which I would like to grant."
"Mr Whitehead is present, but he categorically cannot be here this afternoon, and he would like to deliver his report."
"It is 12.01 p.m."
"I will ask him to speak now for this purpose, asking him to observe the speech time so that we can then pass on to the vote."
"Consumer policy priorities (1996-1998)"
"The next item is the report (A4-0317/96) by Mr Whitehead, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the communication of the Commission (COM(95)0519 - C4-0501/95) on priorities for consumer policy (1996-1998)"
"Thank you, Mr Whitehead."
"In view of the circumstances, it was not possible for your intervention to have the desired hearing as everyone was waiting for the vote."
"The debate on Mr Whitehead's report will be continued this afternoon at 15.00 hours."
"Welcome"
"It is a pleasure to welcome a delegation from the International Centre for peace in the Middle East, now in the Distinguished Visitors' Gallery."
"The delegation, made up of representatives of the Knesset and the Palestinian Legislative Council, is here to meet the relevant delegations of the European Parliament."
"This initiative is the first of its kind, and a unique opportunity to debate issues relating to the peace process in the Middle East, which affects us all very closely."
"I also want to take this opportunity to welcome the European Union's Special Envoy for the Middle East peace process, His Excellency Ambassador Moratinos."
"Our relations with the Knesset and the Palestinian Legislative Council are excellent, and the contacts we already have at parliamentary level have demonstrated the common will to cooperate in a large number of sectors."
"I hope this meeting will mark a new stage in the necessary rapprochement between the countries and towns we represent."
"I wish the delegation from the International Centre for peace in the Middle East fruitful discussions and an excellent stay in Strasbourg."
"Mr President, I am rising simply to seek clarification: there is a clear contradiction between what President Santer said yesterday in his report, on page 8, which refers to systematic and compulsory labelling as the Commission preference and the statement we have today had from Commissioner Fischler who rejected all the amendments calling for the labelling of beef and beef products to be compulsory."
"Before we take a vote on this issue, we want to be sure what the true position of the Commission is."
"Is labelling compulsory or not?"
"Is it systematic or not?"
"The statements we have listened to did not imply that."
"To say generally, as did Commissioner Fischler, that the Commission 'generally' agrees that this should be compulsory but that there is to be no obligation or deadline for the immediate future is tantamount to not accepting that principle stated yesterday by President Santer."
"Before we move to the vote, we want to be clear about the Commission position!"
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very grateful for this intervention, because it does enable me to put something straight."
"The honourable Member was evidently not listening this morning."
"(Loud protests) I explained this morning that the Commission accepts the possibility of basing all three proposals under discussion here on Article 100a."
"The Commission also explained this morning that it clearly endorses a compulsory system."
"Nevertheless, I did venture to point out that a certain transition phase will be necessary until we can actually have this compulsory system operating throughout all the Member States, since it requires an appropriate form of animal identification and of animal registration, which have to be carried out with the aid of computer technology."
"So that those Member States which already fulfil all the conditions are not prevented from introducing a system of labelling during the transition phase, we believe it makes sense to allow voluntary labelling during that first phase, a view which, incidentally, met with the approval - or so it seemed to me at least - of most of those who attended the debate."
"Now is not the time to debate this subject."
"Questions can be asked when we get to the report."
"I should just like to ask Commissioner Fischler one question: how long is the transition phase?"
"I have just said that such questions must be put at the appropriate time."
"Thank you very much for making that point, Mr Evans, because as you could tell, it was not just Mr Whitehead who was hardly listened to, but the Presidency itself, when calling for silence for this vote we would like to get on with."
"I should just like to ask Commissioner Fischler one question: how long is the transition phase?"
"I have already told you those questions must be put at the proper time."
"Mrs Fontaine was referred to personally and is asking for the floor."
"Mr President, I believe I usually ensure that this House is well respected."
"But Mr Whitehead knew this perfectly."
"He has enjoyed the benefit of a very large favour."
"Normally, my dear colleagues, we should not have started his report."
"It was past noon and we should have started the votes."
"If, in addition to that, I had imposed silence on the House, we would have prolonged Mr Whitehead's intervention even further, and I think he understood perfectly."
"We were in very particular circumstances."
"That, Mr President, is all I wanted to say."
"Votes"
"Mr President, my reference to the regulations is based on Articles 127, 122 and 43."
"Even if the radical Alliance group tried, by its amendments, to improve the compromise, we remain critical of a procedure which we feel is a renouncement of the European Parliament in an exceptionally grave affair."
"We therefore have a basic disagreement, but my reference concerns the question of procedure which has led to the vote which will be held."
"On Monday, Mrs Barthet-Mayer and Mr Puerta stressed the very strong reasons for postponing this vote to after that on the motion of censure."
"Parliament decided otherwise and did not follow this demonstration, which was nevertheless very strong and based on considerable Parliamentary evidence."
"I will therefore not return to the matter."
"Mr Hory, this issue was settled on Monday in accordance with the established procedure."
"I therefore naturally cannot allow it to be raised again in a manner which is rather an explanation of vote, since you invoke the article on explanations of vote."
"I am sorry."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Mr President, I would like to mention three points:"
"Firstly, may I remind our colleagues that Mr Fischler told us that the Commission accepts the change of the legal basis and the adoption of Article 100A, in other words, what we are doing today is the first reading.-Secondly, Mr President, from the vote list it appears that I proposed to Parliament that it should reject all the amendments which imply that the labelling system should not be compulsory. In my opinion all those amendments ought to be rejected, because the system must be compulsory, and the same applies to all the amendments that restrict labelling to meat alone, whereas your rapporteur's proposal..."
"... and the proposal by the Environment Commission is that the labelling system should apply to all beef products, preparations, processed products and by-products."
"Thirdly, Mr President, Mr Fischler said that the Commission was in favour of compulsory labelling but is asking for a transitional period, and he stated that this is the reason why the Commission did not accept the amendments on compulsory labelling."
"That caused indignation among many Members."
"I would therefore like to ask Mr Fischler this question: Could we reverse our thinking on this, in other words, could the Commission accept all the amendments imposing compulsory labelling, but in parallel and not in conflict with them, add an article stipulating the transitional period required for the Member States to adapt, and asking that the said period should be as short as possible?"
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, as the rapporteur rightly stated, because of the change in the legal basis this is now a first reading."
"I therefore believe that we can come back in the context of the second reading to the wish expressed by the rapporteur."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Mr President, may I just remind you that I moved an oral amendment this morning for the legal basis to be changed from Article 43 to Article 100a and that the Commission has accepted it."
"As you know, oral amendments cannot be put during voting."
"But we will take note of it and it will appear in the Minutes so that the Commission can accept it, if it sees fit."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs should also be informed."
"That way we can respect the Rules of Procedure and go to the vote without this oral amendment."
"I must inform Members that there is a corrigendum to the German version of this report and that Amendments Nos 1 and 28 do not relate to all the language versions, but an appropriate linguistic solution will be found with those involved in due course."
"I must also inform you that the text of Amendment No 17 of the report by the Committee on Agriculture appears in the text of Amendment No 16 presented for vote in the part-session and Amendment No 35 has been withdrawn."
"We are examining the motion for a regulation."
"Mr President, before we proceed to the vote, I should like to hear Commissioner Fischler's acceptance of what Mr Mayer just said."
"Mr President, it is very interesting that those Members who speak my language are the very ones who apparently misunderstand what I say."
"So let me declare for the third time that the Commission approves."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, may I welcome Mr Wole Soyinka, winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature, who came to see me this morning to tell me about the situation in Nigeria, on which Parliament is now fully informed."
"Mr President, it is hardly surprising that a British Conservative would like to state a case as to why we voted against the Medina report this morning."
"If I had been a fly on the wall yesterday I could well have heard some people trying to make us believe that the British Government was trying to promote BSE in our country."
"I have to say that I regret very much the attitude that has been adopted by this House, because it missed the main point."
"We cannot rewrite history and that is what the report tries to do."
"It tries, in fact, to produce its own prejudices which are not backed by facts."
"The committee really needed some scientific instruments to help it to come to the right conclusions - perhaps a retrospectoscope, because that is what it has used by trying to look back and not recognize that this was a new disease and a new situation that had arisen."
"Let us all be very clear."
"I am sure this Parliament and we, as British Conservatives, want to promote health and confidence."
"There is no doubt about that."
"Therefore we should look and see the situation in the United Kingdom itself: consumption is practically back to normal; the beef industry is practically back to normal, and the measures that the government has taken in the United Kingdom have worked."
"One cannot say that about the rest of Europe, and it is the lack of confidence that has created the problems."
"The report does not identify the causes of the disease."
"It only serves, as I say, to promote prejudices which are not backed by facts."
"It is very easy to knock, it is very easy to be a narker and always to complain, but to do something positive to cure the problems is entirely different."
"The production of animal protein seems to be the basis of the problem."
"We have followed the practice in the United States and they do not seem to have a BSE problem there."
"There are many issues I would like to address, but let me say this: Parliament seems to be ambivalent about what it is trying to do with Mr Hogg, the Minister."
"It says, on the one hand, that he had a legal requirement to come and yet the resolution just adopted states that the institutional agreement needs to be strengthened so that we can demand him to come."
"I would submit that there is not currently a legal base for that demand to happen."
"Mr President, we voted against the joint resolution, as a conditional censure cannot be defended on a legal basis, and moreover the departments of Parliament had observed it."
"A conditional censure cannot be defended on a political basis either."
"In reality, a conditional censure is a phoney censure."
"We have therefore voted against this joint resolution."
"However, tomorrow we will vote for the motion of censure, as the mad cow problem is not, as some people try to make us believe, the fault of bad luck."
"Nor is it the fault of the system."
"To be precise, it is the fault of the people in charge of the system."
"And the people in charge of the system, with all due respect to the preceding speaker, are the British government on the one hand and the Commission in Brussels on the other."
"Consequently, we will vote for the censure. And this will have a certain effect, at least with regard to the French representation, as with the voices of eleven deputies of the French National Front, there will probably be a majority of French representatives in this Parliament who will vote on the motion of censure tomorrow."
"One of the lessons to be drawn from the 'mad cow' affair concerns the state of chaos of health controls in Europe, which has allowed the spreading of contaminated meal and meat, and thus of the disease itself."
"This aspect of the dossier remains misunderstood, but it teaches us a great deal on the manner in which European institutions currently operate."
"From the point of view of the single market, which was to eliminate all import controls on internal frontiers - hence also health controls - a directive 89/662/CEE reorganized the system: the principal health supervision was no longer incumbent on the importing country, at its frontiers, but on the country of origin - in this case the United Kingdom for its meat exports."
"However, this formula has cumulative inconveniences: it lays the burden of control on the partner who has the least interest in exercising it vigilantly."
"To correct this bias, ' federal' controls would have to be established for the supervision of exporting countries; but this complicated structure would prove oppressive for national sovereignties, and also costly, as an army of officials would have to be recruited in Brussels."
"That summarizes in a few sentences if not the causes of mad cow disease (which originates from an agricultural policy contrary to nature), but at least the causes of its spreading; the European Union has abolished its national controls, without introducing, or even first devising, other properly operational systems to take the relay."
"What is the current situation?"
"With fixed customs on internal frontiers having been abolished and documents which accompany goods having been eliminated too, controls are becoming very difficult."
"They are exercised here or there, on the spot, with no serious documentary base and when goods are already circulating on the internal market of each country."
"Under these conditions, fraud of every kind multiplies."
"The chaos is complete."
"A frightening indication has just been given by the report of the Committee of Inquiry of the French National Assembly on mad cow disease, with regard to customs control: none of the persons in authority interviewed - minister, central administration directors, presidents of professional syndicates - has been able to provide reliable figures on imports into France, during recent years, of animal meal of British origin."
"Thus the European Union is now in a state of health disarmament, not by accident, but because of a policy which I do not hesitate to qualify as conscious disorganization destined, in the minds of the apprentice sorcerers who conceived it, to cause chaos in the European state."
"One cannot fail to compare this very similar situation with the disorder which reigns with regard to collecting intra-Community VAT since the abolition of internal frontiers."
"How can we get out of this?"
"The naive immediately seize on ready-made solutions which the Commission hands out to them: more Community regulations!"
"More Community agencies!"
"More Community controllers!"
"But no one has tried to find out how much the installation of such a system, standardized and centralized on a European scale, could cost, or even whether it really can be achieved within a short time."
"There is nothing stopping us from obtaining experience in this respect, but we must not rely on federal control of health regulations for an immediate escape from the crisis and chaos."
"Rather, we believe that the single market has been vitiated by the dogma of the Commission, according to which it was absolutely necessary to abolish all frontier controls and all goods accompanying documents."
"Free circulation has thus become free contamination."
"To emerge from it, we must question this policy."
"I welcome the serious challenge to the European Commission by the European Parliament to clean up its act on BSE."
"In response to the EP's inquiry into the BSE crisis, the President of the European Commission, Mr Jacques Santer, in the presence of 11 other Commissioners, implicitly conceded that there was much wrong with the system which should be reformed."
"The report by the European Parliament which attacks the UK Government's role throughout the BSE scandal is also severely critical of the Commission and of former Commissioner Ray MacSharry, who if not involved directly in a process of disinformation and down-playing the scandal, has been accused by the committee of inquiry of at least 'turning a blind eye' ."
"Wilful short-sightedness by the Commission has done no favours for Europe's consumers, nor even in the end for the EU's and Ireland's beef producers."
"I strongly welcome the fact that responsibility for food policy is now to be removed from the auspices of the Agricultural Commissioner."
"I also support the idea of a European equivalent of the FDA (Food and Drugs Administration)."
"Through the Liberal Group, I agree not to censure the Commission now but to give it a few months to right the wrongs of the past through major food policy reforms."
"If the BSE crisis has done nothing else it has thrown into sharp focus the overriding need to concentrate on consumer protection and to address consumers' legitimate fears."
"The institutions of the European Union and Member State governments must now work together to protect consumer interests at all times."
"As such, the approach taken by the British authorities throughout this has been deeply regrettable."
"Britain has taken an arrogant approach, insensitive to the implications of its behaviour for its partners in Europe."
"While I welcome the concern of the Committee of Inquiry to fully investigate the BSE crisis I am puzzled by the approach they have taken in certain regards."
"They called EU Commissioners and officials but did not call the man who had ultimate political responsibility at the time: the then President of the EU Commission, Jacques Delors."
"The failure to call Mr Delors before the committee is a startling omission and only serves to question the fact as to whether the committee was even-handed in its approach."
"Why was Mr Delors not called?"
"Has it anything to do with the fact that the committee had an in-built socialist majority?"
"Why did Mr Delors not come forward to protect and defend the Commission?"
"The best way to address the BSE crisis now is not to look backwards with the perfect wisdom of hindsight but to establish a comprehensive strategy that will protect and reassure the European consumer."
"Of necessity this means the British authorities will have to take a more cooperative and responsible approach."
"The spread of BSE among the cattle population has now decimated affected herds and ruined the cattle industry throughout Europe, consequences in themselves extremely serious, but nevertheless out of proportion with the threat on human health if contamination of man from the meat of sick animals is confirmed."
"Faced with this crisis, it was essential to isolate the faults, errors or malfunctions which contributed to the spread of the epizootic disease and an undermining of consumer protection, not only to determine everyone's responsibilities, but mainly to take Draconian measures to prevent the recurrence of such a catastrophe."
"The Medina report attributes the most serious fault to the British government which, in deregulating meat and bone meal production, has permitted the contamination of meal by the pathogenic agent which developed into BSE in cattle and which, downstream in the food chain, could develop into Jakob-Creutzfeld disease in man."
"The incompetence of the British government is also blamed for having taken away the efficacy of measures intended to combat epizootic disease and the threat of an epidemic, in a vain attempt to protect its beef industry."
"For its part, the Council has resigned from its institutional responsibilities."
"The Commission has obviously striven to protect the interests of the market and its relations with the British government, before looking to the health of consumers."
"In addition, the Committee of Inquiry has brought to light serious structural deficiencies in a decision-making process which concentrates on particular interests and is impermeable to general interest."
"In the light of this situation, the tabling of a motion of censure against the Commission should be envisaged."
"However, the bad management of this crisis was mainly due to the deeds of the previous Commission; the President of the current Commission has undertaken to correct the malfunctions and proposes to amend the system of scientific consultation, the decision-making mechanisms, the means of control and the Community legal bases with a view to increasing the Community's competence with regard to health."
"Rather than precipitate an institutional crisis which risks lasting, it appears wiser to give the necessary reforms a chance to see the light of day as quickly as possible, implemented by a Commission threatened with censure if it does not put them into effect within a reasonable period."
"This is why the vote on a motion which obliges the Commission to conform to the recommendations of the European Parliament, on pain of a further motion of censure, is the best solution."
"Above all, it is important for the Commission to place consumer protection at the forefront of its preoccupations."
"I abstained from the vote which has just been held in conclusion of the works of the Committee of Inquiry on BSE."
"It is not because of I disagree with the remarkable report of Mr Medina, quite the contrary."
"I consider that the report identifies precisely the overwhelming responsibilities primarily of the British government, but also of the old Commission and the current Commission in the mad cow affair."
"This disaster, the extent of which no one can foresee, has been aggravated by mistakes made at all levels of responsibility: negligence, complaisance towards the British government, concealment of facts to Parliament, unacceptable pressure on the latter."
"President Santer yesterday persisted in this attitude by denying, against the evidence, the unfortunate decision of the Commission to lift the embargo on gelatine."
"This behaviour deserves immediate political sanction: the censure, which I will vote for tomorrow."
"While Article 144 of the Treaty exists, public opinion will not understand if the Commission is not censured, bearing in mind the gravity of the established facts."
"If Parliament does not adopt the motion I signed with Mr Happart, I think it should be proposed to the Inter-governmental Conference to repeal Article 144, which 50 years ago established a regime of political irresponsibility to the benefit of the Commission."
"It would be better to take note and introduce effective control of the executive power of the kind exercised by the American Congress."
"However, I find placing the Commission under supervision, as adopted by the resolution we have just voted on, to be pernicious."
"It seriously weakens a Commission whose authority has already been severely shaken by the current crisis."
"It undermines its independence from Parliament, but also from the Council and Member States."
"It prepares a reduction of its powers and responsibilities during the current revision of the Treaty."
"I do not know whether that is the intention of my colleagues who have just voted on this resolution, but I fear that it will be the result."
"A candid political sanction would be better, which would make it possible to distribute on a sound basis and preserve the prospects of democratization of our institutions."
"I voted for the compromise with misgivings."
"Our Parliament should not be threatening to censure the Commission when the real culprits remain in office in the UK Government."
"They created the BSE problem and allowed it to spread and become endemic in many Southern areas."
"They failed to contain BSE and have behaved atrociously with their 'Policy of Non Cooperation' and arrogant rejection of Europe's offers to finance a sensible eradication programme."
"No wonder Europeans are now calling for compensation for the damage wreaked by the UK's incompetence."
"Alas, we Scots cannot seek compensation for the destruction of our beef export markets and we are not as well protected against England's BSE as our fellow Europeans."
"My Euro-seat accounts stupidity has unduly penalised my farmers."
"In the absence of reason in Westminster, and at their own costs, Scottish beef producers created their own 'BSE free' quality assurance scheme which the Scottish Secretary denigrated and undermined 'in the interests of UK unity' !"
"My Party sought to cite the Scottish Secretary's name in the Censure Motion against Mr Hogg in Westminster this week."
"Michael Forsyth banned the flying of the European Flag in Scotland."
"May the Union Jack flying over his Scottish Office remind Scots of the UK's betrayals, and may the European Parliament condemn the cynicism of the UK's 'BSE' policy of 'Blame Someone Else!'"
"Concern for public health must be the overriding consideration for all involved in the food industry."
"In this regard the role of farmers and producers is crucial."
"The role of legislators, at national and European level, is also central to a safe food industry."
"Consumer confidence is now at an all-time low."
"The primary responsibility of the institutions of the EU and all Member State governments is to protect consumer interests at all times and in doing so to restore the level of confidence in beef as a quality food product."
"The European Parliament's Committee of Inquiry into BSE is but one examination of the entire BSE crisis."
"While I support all endeavours to resolve this crisis, I am not satisfied that the committee was entirely even-handed in its approach."
"Its criticisms of former EU Commissioner MacSharry are unjustified."
"Ray MacSharry has already very effectively refuted criticisms made of him by the committee."
"However, I would like to add that it is easy to evaluate past events with the wisdom of hindsight."
"It would be more accurate to evaluate these circumstances in the context of the particular time."
"Ray MacSharry was one of the great reforming Commissioners of recent times and Irish farmers owe him a great debt of gratitude."
"The committee of inquiry will not dim this reputation in any way."
"It is important to bear in mind that the real culprits of the entire BSE saga are the British authorities, who have displayed great arrogance and total insensitivity to the implications of their behaviour for their fellow EU Member States, not least Ireland."
"Any future strategy to resolve the BSE crisis must include a responsible and cooperative response from the British authorities."
"As it concerns the resolution common to several groups, the European Radical Alliance remains critical with regard to the pusillanimity of the European Parliament, which has refused, in an affair of exceptional gravity - gravity emphasized by all the speakers during the discussions on the 18th February - to use the political means made available to it by the Treaty."
"We therefore have a basic disagreement on the compromise which is submitted to us and on which we do not intend to vote."
"However, our position with regard to this vote is mainly dictated by the choice of procedure made by our House at the session on the 17th February."
"During this session, Mrs Barthet-Mayer and Mr Puerta emphasized the imperative reasons why we had to postpone this vote until after that on the motion of censure."
"Parliament did not follow this demonstration, even though it was argued and based on several pieces of Parliamentary evidence."
"It is therefore not appropriate to return to it, except to say that the vote on the motion submitted to us by the five associated groups has the indirect result of taking away from the motion of censure part of its political meaning, and marginalizing the members of Parliament who support it in the exercise of their prerogatives."
"This is why the European Radical Alliance group has decided, by a majority, not to take part in the vote."
"The Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left has not signed the motion for a joint resolution and has abstained on the vote."
"There are two reasons for this position."
"As we will be voting tomorrow on a motion of censure on the Commission, it is an interference to include in the agenda a resolution which affects the motion of censure."
"As the United European Left has decided to support the censure motion, it considers it inconsistent to vote on a resolution which interferes with such an important matter."
"The joint resolution proposes to postpone the censure motion and make it conditional on the Commission applying certain measures, and that is another reason for our abstention."
"A censure motion can only apply to past liability and cannot dictate future actions."
"That is our basic reason for not voting on the joint resolution."
"The report of the committee of inquiry into BSE notes that the Commission has incurred irreversible liability."
"If liability exists and is irreversible, the procedure is to present an immediate motion of censure."
"The postponement of the immediate motion of censure is a complete dereliction of Parliament's duty of control and the joint resolution is an attempt to justify that dereliction."
"Parliament's efforts to uncover the facts concerning the chain of events which provoked the BSE crisis should have yielded valuable lessons for the future administration of agricultural and food safety policy."
"Instead the work undertaken by the Committee of Inquiry is being undermined by the motion of censure before this Parliament which, if successful, will result in the sacking of all the present College of Commissioners despite the fact that most of the events which ultimately resulted in the BSE crisis took place before this Commission even took office."
"This motion of censure is welcome news for the British Government which has consistently tried to divert the attention of the British public away from their own government's primary responsibility for this entire crisis by trying to blame the European Commission for the failings of their own Ministers and public servants charged with responsibility for food safety policy."
"Those responsible for this motion should reconsider their action and, in my view, concentrate their efforts on working with the Commission to ensure that any lessons learned from the investigations undertaken by the Committee of Inquiry are reflected in the future administration of agricultural and food safety policy at both European and national level."
"The final report of the Committee in Inquiry is severely weakened because of the Committee's failure to call a number of key witnesses."
"Why, for instance, did the Committee not call the former President of the Commission and well-known socialist politician, Jacques Delors?"
"In my opinion, former President Delors, who bore ultimate political responsibility for the actions of the European Commission would have confirmed the comprehensive rebuttals of his agricultural Commissioners against the allegations concerning the activities of the Commission's services during the Delors era."
"Criticism of the actions of the Commission during the Delors era reflects badly on former President Delors and he should have been given the opportunity to refute these criticisms."
"Equally puzzling was the failure to call the Presidents of the Scientific Veterinary Committee during the relevant period."
"The Committee would surely have been assisted in their investigations if they had had the benefit of evidence form the specialists who had a central role to play as this problem developed into the major crisis it ultimately became."
"A further puzzling aspect of the Committee's work was the decision to make documents containing damaging allegations available to the public before the individuals in question even had an opportunity to address the Committee."
"Former Commissioner MacSharry was the victim of this kind of questionable practice and the Committee should have the common decency to apologise for putting allegations against him into the public domain one month before he even had the opportunity to offer evidence to refute these allegations."
"It is worth recalling that when the former Commissioner addressed the Committee he refuted these allegations in a detailed, open, effective and comprehensive manner."
"Finally, the report of the Committee of Inquiry was severely damaged by the failure of the British Minister for Agriculture to attend and give evidence before the Committee."
"Clearly, one of the lessons to be learned from this whole affair is that Committees of Inquiry must have the power to legally compel witnesses to attend and give evidence."
"Otherwise, the final report of such committees will be based on incomplete investigation and, as in this case, the excellent work undertaken by colleagues sitting on these committees will be devalued by factors beyond their control."
"President Santer spoke very sympathetically yesterday of the European Parliament's criticism of the Commission."
"He admitted that the work of the Commission in past years has been highly inadequate and that none of the action which should have been taken to shield the citizens of the European Union from danger has actually been taken."
"If this is recognized, Mr Santer, it must also have consequences."
"It emerged from the meetings of the parliamentary Committee of Inquiry that some officials - even senior officials - of the Commission were obviously not prepared to cooperate with the European Parliament."
"Officials such as Mr Legras or Mr Mansito even obstructed the work of the Committee of Inquiry, although they, as the head and deputy head respectively of Directorate-General VI, bear immediate responsibility for the defects that were discovered."
"Such conduct must surely have consequences."
"Officials who demonstrate incompetence cannot simply be allowed to continue in their posts."
"In the case of Mr von Moltke of the Directorate-General for Tourism, as you know, the recent pressure exerted by the European Parliament was successful."
"We must also mount the same sort of pressure against DG VI."
"But of course we must not target officials as part of a strategy of catching the small fry and letting the big fish go free."
"The Commission, and above all its President, must take political responsibility for the shortcomings of their institution."
"The existence of BSE did not just come to light yesterday, as we all know."
"Nor has the Santer Commission only been in office since yesterday."
"To date there have been 16 deaths from BSE in Europe."
"How many deaths would have been needed before the Commission took any action on its own initiative?"
"Political responsibility for the professional misconduct of civil servants always lies with the competent ministers, or in this case with the commissioners; that is a fine European, or at least British, tradition."
"Commissioner Fischler should simply have mucked out his Augean stable sooner."
"And he should not act now as if his predecessors had made all the mistakes."
"The Green Group tabled a proposal for a 'suspended vote of no-confidence' in order to emphasize this political responsibility."
"This threat seems to have been necessary to persuade Mr Santer to admit publicly for the first time to the glaring errors made by the present Commission and the previous one."
"Other bodies, of course, have failed us."
"The conduct of the British Government can only be described as malevolent and ignorant."
"An action for damages against the United Kingdom (and that country's animal meal and meat industries) before the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg is the only appropriate response."
"Mr Borchert and the other European agriculture ministers have also failed us."
"They remained inactive far too long and placed economic interests above the lives of their citizens."
"Responsibility for the BSE scandal, of course, also lies in the structures of the EU."
"The single market has led to a reduction in the standard of consumer protection."
"We Greens have always warned against the creation of an internal market without proper ecological and social safeguards."
"But of course for the economic liberals in all parties, from Mrs Thatcher to Mr Bangemann, the deregulation of protective mechanisms has been the paramount aim."
"We are now paying the penalty for this misguided form of European integration."
"Effective control mechanisms for consumer protection have never been established; in the domain of agriculture the Commission has been its own judge and jury."
"Simply setting up a new directorate-general for consumer protection within the Commission is far from enough."
"It is high time we had an independent European food inspectorate."
"And it is high time we had greater transparency and more rights for the European Parliament."
"The meetings of all specialized committees of the Commission will have to be accessible to the public."
"No-confidence motions against specific politically responsible Commissioners must also be permissible in future."
"And the European Parliament must have a right of codetermination in future on all questions of agricultural policy."
"And of course we need a completely different European agricultural policy."
"The feeding of meat-and-bone meal to herbivores must be generally prohibited."
"Such meal may only be fed if high safety standards are applied, which is not the case in Britain's deregulated agricultural industry."
"Financial incentives must be created for welfareorientated animal husbandry and levies and conditions imposed for industrial mass production of livestock."
"We Greens have always advocated organic farming and welfare-orientated husbandry and have been severely critical of European agricultural policy."
"The BSE scandal, in this tragic manner, has now proved us right."
"Mr President, I was not a member of the Committee of Inquiry on BSE, nor have I had any speaking time during the plenary debate."
"Nevertheless, I feel I should state clearly that, if the report of this temporary Committee of Inquiry had been put to the vote here, I should have been unable, for the following reasons, to support it:"
"The statements regarding the political responsibility of the Commission - past and present - and of the previous Commissioners for Agriculture, as well as the present one, for errors and omissions are too sweeping and are devoid of any differentiation, often condemning out of hand without considering the reality of the situation over the years, with the result that an objective observer of developments from Delors to Santer and from MacSherry to Fischler simply cannot accept such indiscriminate accusations."
"This was compounded by the fact that the Committee of Inquiry did not even have the courage to summon President Delors."
"It is quite unfair to tar Mr Steichen with the same brush as Mr MacSherry, and it is quite simply grotesque to want to send the Santer Commission packing but not even to invite Mr Delors to give evidence."
"It is a pity that the Committee of Inquiry, which has done a lot of good work, has shot itself in the foot by assigning guilt in this entirely indiscriminate manner."
"On the other hand, I wish to state categorically that I welcome the recommendations made by the Committee of Inquiry for future action and, after the courageous statement made by President Santer yesterday, I am sure that the Commission will act on these recommendations with the measures that we and the people of this Community have every right to expect, in order to eradicate the cattle disease and to give due priority to the health of our citizens."
"The report of the Temporary Committee of Inquiry into the management of BSE has revealed the internal malfunctions of the Commission."
"Naturally, one must not overlook the various responsibilities of the United Kingdom, the Council and the British meal manufacturers."
"In the minority position I presented, I showed the advantage of creating an independent organization which would enable decisions to be taken free of suspicion or influence."
"This is why I stated that this Agency should be subject to EN 45004 standards."
"However, in addition to setting up an independent agency, it is also necessary for the control departments of the member States to be subject to the same international rules for ensuring conformity."
"It is with great interest that I have learned of Mr Santer's proposals on the envisaged reorganization of the Commission."
"However, even if the measures submitted are interesting, this cannot call into question the responsibilities for the past management of the dossier by the Commission."
"This is why I have signed the tabling of the motion of censure and will of course vote for it tomorrow."
"If individual censure of a member of the Commission were possible, many of us in this House would have censured Mr Fischler."
"I think the management of the Agriculture Commission has significantly damaged the Commission as a whole and his attitude at the committee of inquiry left much to be desired - and just yesterday in the debate he was not even listening to the speeches by such distinguished Members as Mrs Redondo Jiménez."
"To vote for a motion of censure on a Commission for events which occurred before it took over has no basis in logic or politics, so tomorrow I shall vote against this initiative."
"But putting conditions on the Commission, as in paragraph 7 of the joint resolution, to my mind means weakening the action of the Commission in the face of the challenges the Union has to face in the coming months, including the Intergovernmental Conference."
"I have always thought that the interests of Parliament lie in having a strong Commission and not a Commission loaded down with conditions."
"So for once I will depart from the my group's position and vote against conditional censure."
"The members of the European Parliament, elected by universal suffrage, must defend European citizens."
"Their health is the most precious possession, and they hold their elected politicians responsible for it."
"We have been able to measure it in France, in the 'contaminated blood' drama."
"This is why we have taken the initiative of a Committee of Inquiry to throw light on the so-called 'mad cow' drama."
"The conclusions of this report are crushing."
"First of all, I would like to denounce the enormous responsibility of the British government."
"By her policy of phytosanitary deregulation in the 1980s, Margaret Thatcher authorized the lowering of the temperature for the manufacture of meal."
"By thus lowering the cost of the product, the British government and some industrialists made this meal lethal!"
"The British government then prohibited it in its country, without checking the implementation of this measure, without closing its frontiers and without authorizing European health committee controls."
"The responsibility of the Brussels Commission is equally engaged."
"It appears that certain officials voluntarily slowed down the circulation of information and hindered all transparency in this terrible affair."
"Both must now acknowledge their responsibility and sanctions should be taken."
"This is why I will vote for the compromise resolution, and will ensure that all the recommendations of the Committee of Inquiry are implemented, mainly those relating to the engagement of the responsibility of the British government, who is mainly liable."
"But I cannot agree to leave unsanctioned the heavy faults committed by the current Commission in the management of the crisis."
"I will also vote for immediate censure, on Thursday."
"Of course we can accuse the Commission and the British Government of negligence over the handling of BSE."
"But for Parliament to deliver a vote of no confidence against the Commission is really going too far, especially as the mistakes which have been made were primarily made by former Commissioners."
"A vote of no confidence under these circumstances would be no more than an empty political gesture."
"The results of the temporary committee of inquiry into BSE must be interpreted in the spirit and letter of the treaties and derived legislation as well as the principle of subsidiarity."
"From this viewpoint it is very clear that all the primary responsibility lies with the United Kingdom Government, which has a duty to protect the health of persons and animals and has shown utter negligence in this area."
"Thus, the report states that the greatest weight of responsibility falls on the United Kingdom Government."
"The committee has demonstrated the negligent conduct of the United Kingdom."
"There were many negative aspects to the United Kingdom's conduct and one of them was the failure to guarantee an effective ban on feeding meat and bone meal to ruminants; not respecting the national bans preventing the import of meal from the United Kingdom; putting pressure on the European Commission not to carry out inspections."
"Similarly, the United Kingdom Government did not adequately apply the commitments it made in the Council of Ministers in 1990 and finally, the European Parliament vigorously censures the United Kingdom for its blockade of the Community institutions."
"Also responsible are the companies which exported animals carrying BSE, and beef products and derivatives."
"In due course they will be facing compensation claims in the courts for public and criminal liability."
"The European Commission's responsibility lies at another level."
"The Commission has powers of higher inspection, that is, the power to inspect national inspection services and require fulfilment of European legislation."
"That is why the parliamentary committee of inquiry stresses the responsibility of the European Commission in prioritizing the interests of managing the market and lacking foresight about the risks to human health and the spread of the disease to other countries."
"The European Parliament also censures the European Commission led by Mr Delors for failing to carry out inspections during the period 1990-1994."
"As regards the responsibility of the present Agriculture Commissioner, Mr Fischler, he must answer for various acts of negligence, in particular the Commission's decision to lift the ban on exports of gelatine, tallow and semen."
"Here the Commission must accept responsibility as a college for having acted against the opinion of the scientific committees."
"The same can be said of the group of Member States in the European Council which supported the measure."
"For the future of the European Union it is important to draw the institutional consequences."
"The European Union needs real executive powers of direct inspection as well as higher inspection and the capacity to withdraw products from the market automatically and ban their sale, both inside and outside the European Union."
"Similarly, it must be given powers to require strict fulfilment of Community legislation by the Member States."
"Recommendation for second reading Tamino (A4-0011/97)"
"The subject presented here is important as it discusses in depth transport intermodality."
"It is clear that today, throughout Europe, the distribution of infrastructure charges according to type of transport and the assumption of social costs in transport prices are marked by serious inequalities."
"These inequalities are naturally to the detriment of non-road modes, and consequently combined transport."
"In this context, I can only agree with the Commission's draft regulations, for two reasons."
"First of all, the Commission proposes to prolong the existing device of financial support to inter-modal services, while leaving the member States freedom of choice in the allocation of these aids."
"Then, the Commission's proposal goes in the direction of a reduction in procedures, mainly replacing the a priori control it currently exercises by an a posteriori control."
"I believe that the aids thus supported constitute a very interesting means of compensation in favour of development of inter-modal transport, placing the emphasis on the important position of navigable waterways."
"I also voted in favour of the common position of the Council which the Committee on Transport and Tourism recently adopted."
"But these aids are still too little in relation to the real requirements."
"In fact in the medium term, beyond these mechanisms of compensation, it will be necessary to apply a transport policy which is really centred on intermodality."
"For this, in the first place there must be true harmonization of competition conditions at European level."
"There should also be regulations which encourage the integration of all real costs in the pricing of different modes of transport."
"In this respect, the Commission has put forward, in a recent Green Paper, the stakes for the internalization of external costs generated by transport."
"It is a very important element of Parliament's reflection on inter-modality, and it is in this direction that European deputies must continue their efforts to promote an increasingly intermodal form of transport."
"Weiler report (A4-0016/97)"
"The reports just presented by the Commission show that the cost of social protection in the countries of Europe has increased very rapidly over the recent period (from 24 % of the GNP in 1980 to over 30 % today), and that this drift is, for the most part and more or less everywhere, due to unemployment allocations."
"If we wish to save our social systems, we must reduce unemployment, and to do that, we must first understand where it is coming from."
"The Commission's reports are far from this, since they see it first as the result of a general recession."
"Unfortunately, this is not the case."
"The current recession comes within an extended and gradual slowing down of the European growth trend of twenty years."
"This results from the interaction of two different but closely overlapping causes: the opening of our frontiers without precautions and the relatively high level of our wages and social charges."
"In an open economy, the charges which burden employment in Europe feed unemployment, which increases social protection costs, which in turn are a slightly heavier burden on growth, slowing it down and increasing unemployment further."
"This is the vicious circle we are shut in, which, if we do not take action, is leading straight to increased compulsory levies, even an explosion of social systems and the rise to power of a society of everyone for himself, throwing an entire proportion of the population into extreme poverty."
"The paradox of the situation is that everyone virtuously condemns this type of society, but very few venture to combat the causes, which are primarily the bureaucratization of certain social systems, the absence of Community priority for employment and the release of a simplistic world free trade policy, which is a perversion of true free trade."
"To rectify the national social systems, it is obviously necessary to reform their operating rules: to better target aids, and abandon passive support measures in favour of active measures which encourage the unemployed back to work, as proposed by the Commission."
"But we must also favour cheaper and more competitive management rules for social bodies, while remaining within the framework of rules of public solidarity."
"Finally, the problem must be raised of Community priority for employment, and the related problem of maintaining without limit the minimum social income for the long-term unemployed from non-member countries."
"But these reforms would not suffice to reabsorb unemployment if they did not attack at the same time the difficult problem of fair foreign commercial relations in a world-wide economy."
"The determining question in this respect is as follows: how, in a completely open and unprotected economy, can a country or group of countries decide tomorrow on a higher social policy than that of its neighbours, without increasing its charges and thus disqualifying itself in competition?"
"Curiously, this essential question, which the Commission identifies perfectly with respect to relations between European countries, as I mentioned during this morning's debate, is hushed up when it concerns relations with the rest of the world."
"However, in the latter case, the problem is infinitely more serious, and it is that which, through a deterioration in employment, places the heaviest handicap on the future of our social systems."
"It is understandable that after upholding the conclusions of the Uruguay Round, neither the Commission nor the European Parliament wished to hear these truths."
"However, we must take stock of them one day if we wish to rectify the situation."
"The ELDR Group welcomes the initiative on the debate on the future of social protection in Europe but has not given its support to the Weiler report."
"The main reason is that it contains a number of conservative proposals which are not consistent with the new development needed at European level."
"The Group welcomes the more progressive contribution of Dutch Minister for Social Affairs and Employment Melkert to the debate and hopes that the Commission will proceed along new and progressive lines."
"The public finance crisis, the constraints associated with mass unemployment and the development of the age pyramid are leading the European Union to enter fully into the debate on the future of social protection in Europe."
"On this subject, Mrs Weiler's report (PE 220.210) is in the right direction."
"For all that, we must draw the European Parliament's attention to section 11 of Mrs Weiler's report: ' ... takes guard against the privatization of social risks, especially with regard to health' ."
"We think that this section would have merited further development, as it constitutes one of the major challenges of this debate."
"In fact we consider that there is a large risk for the entire fabric of society not to be attentive to a drift which, under cover of economies, alleged better management and laying responsibility on the user, leads States increasingly to reduce 'health' cover and transfer risks of compulsory joint systems to supplementary systems."
"These supplementary systems, which are increasing, are subject only to market rules."
"The danger is now that we will see our health system drift towards the American model (risk selection, exclusion, individualization)."
"Health cannot be considered a lucrative market."
"We request that, right from now, the Commission takes over this point and opens the debate on 'compulsory and supplementary health systems and general interest' ."
"Mr President, my dear colleagues, the Commission regularly presents an up-todate report on social protection in all Member States, in order to give political decision-makers a good perception of the situation, which should enable them to implement the best social policy possible."
"It is necessary, but not enough!"
"Our colleague Mrs Weiler tries to clarify the very concept of social protection, and invites the European Union to play a more important and more active role."
"It was needed!"
"The history of the construction of Europe is partly based on the aim of guaranteeing and seeking a higher standard of living, which passes for a high level of social protection."
"Many of us are convinced that our societies do not suffer from too much solidarity, quite the opposite."
"And now it is the associated questioning of this aim which so much abuses the European idea itself."
"The Union thus has every interest in investing in its social protection and not considering it as a burden on the economy, but well and truly as the expression of a society model, or even a motive power of productivity and so growth."
"The Union is in the process of completing its economic union, inviting all the Member States to respect the convergence criteria defined in Maastricht."
"This is a necessary stage."
"Is it Utopic to hope that in Amsterdam, in June, the Council will establish social convergence criteria aiming to ensure, for all citizens of the Union, the highest possible level of social protection, while safeguarding and renewing our social security systems?"
"One can also fear it and so, above all, we must henceforth militate for that, as it is vital for the European ideal!"
"Our colleague's report is orientated towards a social integration of Europe, combining our acquired knowledge, developing citizenship based on the social aspect and solidarity."
"There will be no Europe without a social Europe!"
"All the inquiries show it, European citizens are anxious about the consequences of the single currency on social protection."
"Quite rightly!"
"The constraints linked to the application of Maastricht criteria serve as a pretext to governments to put pressure on wages costs and make cuts in social expenditure."
"As explained by the Commission in its communication on social protection: ' The globalization of the world economy and the imperatives of competition will probably necessitate a continued moderation of the growth of wages costs."
"It will be more difficult, under these conditions, to increase company contributions and charges' ."
"In the name of strict short-term financial profitability of companies, on the one hand it is a question of reducing their contribution to the redistribution of the wealth produced, and on the other hand of transforming the health and security requirement into a vast market open to the appetites of large financial groups."
"Health and social protection would thus be considered simply as goods, making it more difficult for the population to gain access to care."
"In all Member States, there flourish old recipes for individualization and privatization of risks, with capitalization being presented as a remedy in the face of distribution."
"In its communication, the Commission relays this offensive, wishing to place social protection in the context of European competition."
"It wishes to introduce market elements in the social protection sector, and even instigate competition between the health systems of the Fifteen."
"The report by the Committee on Social Affairs, Employment and the Working Environment corrects these orientations."
"In particular, it requests that the social security regime continue to rest on the principle of solidarity, and pleads for a transfer of the tax burdening labour to other sectors."
"Our group estimates that the taxation of capital movements and its contribution to social protection would make it possible to lighten the cost for workers."
"Our group rejects the strictly economical approach to social protection, which aims to commercialize everyone's legitimate aspiration of security, and to turn it into goods."
"We request that the principle of solidarity be maintained and made widespread to meet the need for security of the people, the need to protect yourself and to provide jointly against social risks."
"Only systems of social protection and social security based on solidarity permit a high level of social protection and services for everyone, with a good contributions/efficacy ratio."
"They allow the risks of social fracture or pauperization of a proportion of the population to be reduced."
"The maintenance of a high level of social protection is linked to the values of solidarity, respect for individuals and democracy, values which are ridiculed if one applies the rules of competition."
"We are anxious to do something about social dumping but do not consider that standardising social security systems and national labour market policies is the best method of achieving this."
"This is why we are abstaining from the final vote."
"We think it is important that each individual in the EU has the right to reasonable basic levels of social security."
"The Weiler report contains a number of sensible points covering actions to promote employment and sustainable economic development."
"Taking action against social dumping is also important."
"But it was quite clear, from the debate and the report, that this is the first stage towards harmonisation of social welfare."
"This means that we cannot support the report."
"We think that each individual country should take their own decisions on social legislation, decisions which they consider necessary and reasonable."
"This is a national matter and not something which should be dealt with at EU level."
"The Danish Social Democrats have today voted in favour of the Weiler report."
"This report expresses concurrence with the Commission that Member States should uphold the commitment to promoting a high level of social protection and assist with the gradual coordination of Member States' social protection regulations for the creation of minimum standards."
"Overall the report contains sensible considerations and provides scope for an interesting debate in the future."
"The Danish Social Democrats are interested, however, in obtaining further clarification of certain points, e.g. the situation of people who work in border areas."
"It is also our opinion that the dividing up and financing of social services should remain a national affair."
"The Weiler report clears the way for a thorough debate on how to create real freedom of movement for the people of Europe."
"The report reflects the views of all sides of this Parliament."
"From a British perspective it is interesting to note that the report reflects a Council Recommendation signed under the British presidency in July 1992."
"Norman Lamont, the then President of ECOFIN, signed the Recommendation on the convergence across Europe of social protection objectives and policies. The 'Lamont' Recommendation of 1992 underpins much of what has been said in this report and what has been agreed today in Parliament."
"It pleases me and the European Parliamentary Labour Party to find such strong support for this report."
"However, we could not agree to support the amendments which called for a new tax on carbon fuel and an extension of qualified majority voting in the area of the social protocol. We have abstained on those two issues."
"The Commission's report on social protection in Europe in 1995, commented on by our colleague Mrs Weiler, proposes a general disputable framework, but nevertheless hides some analyses which are very relevant, especially on interruptions or reductions of activity in order to provide care."
"The Commission states that family care reduces the cost of social protection, enabling handicapped people, young children and the elderly to be better taken care of, mainly thanks to the permanent presence of the spouse who performs this service."
"The Commission's report emphasizes in this respect the importance of the informal services rendered by the family, when one of its members does not have a remunerated job in order to be able to look after young children, handicapped adults or disabled elderly persons."
"The Commission emphasizes, with regard to the importance of these services, that the benefits which are now attached to them are entirely inadequate, especially if a career is interrupted."
"The specific allocations created in certain countries (child-minding allowance, handicap allowance, etc.) are very low and the spouse who has interrupted a remunerated activity to provide this type of service is in effect penalized: lower social insurance and unemployment benefits, reduced retirement pensions, ineligibility for additional pensions, etc."
"These services provided by the family, particularly important for the whole of society, are all the more so now that the population of elderly people is increasing greatly in European countries."
"As our society is also characterized by a growing number of women in remunerated work, it is more difficult now for many women to provide important informal services free of charge."
"The Commission unfortunately confines itself to these facts and analyses and does not venture forth into innovative proposals which would be of a nature such as to permit the maintenance and development of these informal services, which it acknowledges would permit a significant reduction in social protection costs."
"It might therefore be useful for the Commission to continue its reflection by examining in particular to what measure the introduction, for example, of a parental wage instead of the existing specific allocations, would encourage the development of informal family services which our society, in its current structure, needs most and from which it would draw the most benefit."
"The future of social security in Europe is purely and simply crucial to the future of Europe. Developments to date, in which the labour force in the Member States has seen 'Europe' being used in practice as a battering ram to break down the national systems of social security, must be radically reversed."
"We must change to a supranational strategy of social security and integration, creating effective forms of solidarity and cohesion within and across national boundaries."
"Mrs Weiler's report points cautiously to some objectives for the future. That should be supported, precisely because of the current preparations for a monetary union which, unfortunately, is headed in the opposite direction."
"At the same time it should once more be stated clearly that our Europe will forfeit its future if it does not really take these first cautious steps, not to mention the necessary parallel steps in other areas, ranging from the restoration of full employment to the establishment of a supranational right to strike."
"Papayannakis report (A4-0037/97)"
"Recently there has been growing and justified lack of confidence on the part of consumers about eating beef and beef products, as a logical consequence of the scandal of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, popularly known as 'mad cow disease' ."
"This disaster is at the root of consumers' indignation at meat continuing to be marketed as an 'anonymous' product, with its origin not stated."
"The whole distressing situation makes clear the need to establish better control over production, the first requirement of which is modern production of meat products, geared to consumers needs."
"As a first step a clear labelling system is required to inform and reassure consumers about the quality and true origin of these products."
"Better labelling and an effective identification and registration system for beef cattle are indispensable both in production and subsequent marketing."
"Under the circumstances I shall vote in favour."
"We have chosen to vote for the report on the proposal for a Council Regulation on the labelling of beef and beef products, although we think it would be better for this to be controlled and determined nationally."
"We would like to make it very clear how important we think it is that Member States themselves are able to introduce stricter labelling requirements if they wish."
"We are supporting the report as we consider it to be better than the Commission's proposal."
"We particularly support the view that labels on meat must include information on any potential embryo modifications or the animal's transgenetic origin and information on the use of antibiotics and stimulants during feeding."
"Mayer report (A4-0022/97)"
"We have voted against the Mayer report as we feel that the basic fault lay with the EU Agriculture Policy itself."
"The BSE crisis should be seen as the first warning, a challenge to us to reform agricultural policy."
"The proposal for this system of identification and registration of cattle is linked to policies pursued by the EU, the fact that border controls are about to be abolished."
"This is already very clear as far as salmonella is concerned."
"We think the introduction of this absurd identification and registration scheme for cattle is the wrong way to tackle BSE. We should instead be concentrating on a total ban on the use of carcasses in animal feedstuffs."
"It is deplorable that such a large organisation has to be established in order to control the health of cattle within the European Union."
"If this is considered necessary in current circumstances then we must accept it."
"But, once BSE has been eradicated, I would like to see this huge organisation trimmed, and a thorough evaluation carried out to see if there is still any justification for its existence."
"We have not been affected by BSE in Sweden and we have always been able to control disease in cattle without developing a gigantic control body such as the one currently being proposed."
"By using relatively limited border controls, we have managed to avoid BSE, salmonella and rabies."
"I would like to add the following observations here: spokesmen for the free market maintain that deregulation will bring huge gains as the costs of regulation and support systems disappear."
"But, in this case, the free market must develop new regulations and support systems."
"We are justified in asking whether anyone will benefit from a heath or economic point of view, as a result of a free market for, in this case, trade in agricultural products."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.21 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Consumer policy priorities (1996-1998) (continuation)"
"The next item is the continuation of the debate on the report by Mr Whitehead (A4-0317/96), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the communication from the Commission on priorities for consumer policy (1996-1998) (COM(95)0519 - C4-0501/95)."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, in its first paragraph, article 129a of the treaty makes reference to article 100a as the most appropriate instrument to deal with all the legislative, regulatory and administrative measures of the Member States intended for completion of the single market."
"The treaty also permits other actions complementary to those carried out by the States in the area of consumer protection."
"The authentic single market, the real single market, will only be completed when consumer protection applies in transborder disputes."
"And this requires a series of legal, economic, social and informative measures."
"From the legal point of view, which is my committee's remit, it must be stressed that the rights of consumers, as parties in cross-border disputes, will only be effectively protected by a combination of the following measures: at the international level Member States must recognize their duty to apply the 1968 Brussels Convention, the 1980 Rome Convention on the law applicable to contractual obligations and the 1965 and 1970 Hague Conventions, on unification and on the taking of evidence abroad respectively."
"We need to put impetus behind a study to identify the reasons why, despite the existence of the Brussels Convention, difficulties are still experienced in securing the enforcement in one Member State of a civil judgement handed down by a court in another Member State."
"The possibilities of widening the scope of the Rome Convention on the law applicable to the commercial field should also be analysed."
"It would be a good idea to create a Community instrument which incorporates the principles of the Vienna Convention on international purchase and sale contracts and promote an initiative, within the third pillar, aimed at establishing an enforcement order for unpaid debts."
"Turning from the international level to the Community level, we would like to propose the following measures: strengthening out-of-court dispute settlement, which is simpler, faster and cheaper, as long as the possibility of recourse to the courts is respected."
"We think the Commission's action plan to promote out-of-court procedures should be implemented as soon as possible."
"The European Parliament and Council Directive on injunctions is a very fine instrument to promote recognition of the right of organizations, businesses and consumers to act, to give judges powers under the existing conventions, so that they can take decisions based on law applicable to the grounds for the dispute even if the violation only has an impact in a market other than the national market."
"Parliament's resolution on payment periods contains interesting suggestions which are worth looking at."
"Under this resolution, interest payments for delay to creditors would be statutory and automatic, as would compensation for costs incurred in the recovery of debts, in accordance with tariffed fees to be determined by a suitable public authority."
"The legal procedures for the recovery of late payments and the costs entailed also need to be harmonized."
"Finally, Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is important to support the criticism made in the Whitehead report that the Commission does not include a detailed timetable for the priorities for consumer policy 1996-1998."
"The lack of it can turn these priorities into a mere wish-list which does nothing for the credibility of Union consumer policy."
"Finally, we should use existing international and Community instruments to continue to achieve genuine consumer protection at all levels."
"Mr President, Commissioner Bonino, I am not one of those Members who are in the habit of offering very profuse thanks to rapporteurs, firstly because it takes up speaking time and secondly because I firmly believe that all our rapporteurs produce good reports."
"Today, albeit in Mr Whitehead's absence, I should like to make an exception and thank him very sincerely on behalf of my group for his work."
"I thank him not only for analysing, criticizing and proposing improvements to the consumer policy priorities envisaged by the Commission for 1996-1998 but also for evaluating the 1993-1995 priorities, which enabled us for the first time to perceive clearly the targets that were set and whether we had achieved or missed them."
"Some of the priorities have had to be carried over into the programme for 1996-1998."
"It was not until 1996 that we debated which measures had to be taken in response to the discussion on the Green Paper on Access to Justice."
"We have adopted the draft directive on injunctions at the first reading as a preventive measure for the collective protection of consumers."
"I hope that we shall soon be receiving the common position from the Council."
"We have also discussed the Commission Action Plan to promote out-of-court settlement procedures."
"This measure will be highly beneficial if the Member States are prepared to set up impartial bodies for all products as well as for services."
"However good the legislation we create at European level may be - and good European legislation is needed - it will be of no use to consumers who want to make full use of the single market unless they can assert their rights quickly and at reasonable cost in their own language out of court, or indeed in court."
"As Mr Whitehead said this morning, the 1996-1998 priorities look like a wish-list for Europe's consumers."
"In my view they are simply unspecific."
"The important thing for us is that the Commission is finally tabling common provisions; these have not hitherto existed, which has denied consumers the full benefits of the single market."
"The Green Paper on Food was announced for 1996."
"We are still waiting for it."
"It has, if we reflect on this week's BSE discussion, become even more urgent."
"What is the Commission doing?"
"Announcing that it will bring an action against Germany and possibly two other Member States before the European Court of Justice for having excessively strict national legislation on pesticide levels in baby food!"
"Does the Commission somehow believe that parents will comprehend such a measure?"
"This Parliament has always insisted that baby food must be free of pesticides."
"We shall be going on to discuss the report on consumer credit and the report on the Green Paper on financial services."
"Both reports show where legislation is urgently required."
"Cast off your diffidence, Commissioners!"
"In matters of consumer protection, we as a Parliament are right behind the Commission!"
"Mr President, first of all I must thank Philip Whitehead for the enormous amount of work he has put in on this."
"Why do I make a point of saying that?"
"Because, and the Commissioner should take this a little bit to heart, the communication on priorities we are considering is to my mind far, far too wide-ranging."
"I think the priorities for 96-98 leave a lot to be desired."
"And I am thus grateful to the rapporteur for having achieved an appropriate result."
"I totally agree with Mr Whitehead that the communication should have been a far more detailed, more thoroughly thought-out programme and that it should have indicated how and in what way the Commission intends to attain the objectives it has set itself, and with which I have no problem as such."
"It should in my view have included a far clearer list, with priorities."
"May I pick out a number of sticking points?"
"Firstly the question of legal redress."
"A Green Paper came out more than three years ago."
"In connection with the item of legislation for which I was rapporteur we said that at all costs the right of collective action, in whatever form, had to be established and I know that some Member States had a lot of difficulty approving the directive on distance selling."
"But anyway, my question is this: how are you going to establish this and what proposals are you going to come forward with?"
"I think the Green Paper which you produced three years ago ought to have generated some action in some form or another."
"And I also urge the House to consider extrajudicial procedures."
"You may think I am riding my pet hobbyhorse here, and I am, but I think we can often help the consumer far faster, more cheaply and more efficiently if we offer a lot more incentives for settling disputes than we do at present."
"I have to declare an interest here, not a financial one but an emotional one, since I am chairman of the Dutch Foundation of consumer dispute settlement committees. This currently comprises twenty five or so committees, in which independent rulings are handed down by consumers and representatives of various industries and manufacturers, and it works extremely well."
"I think we should do rather more in this area, and perhaps because I am proud of what we have achieved in the Netherlands with consumer bodies, I think we should enable more people to benefit from our experience than we do at present."
"Then there is a question which came up yesterday too. As I recall, Mrs Behrendt said something about it."
"I refer to the Green Paper on food."
"I do not know what is happening about this."
"Will the Green Paper have to be adjusted in the light of all the new agreements and all the new policy measures we are busy shaping?"
"Can we perhaps have an answer on this?"
"Because if we are to act to calm the fears of the European consumer I think we have firstly to act fast and secondly we have to know the deadlines to which we are working and what changes are likely to come."
"We are going to be talking about financial services this afternoon, so I will not go into those now."
"In conclusion, something I would have liked to see in the proposals but which is not there: how will the European Commission, possibly in conjunction with European consumer bodies and with business and industry, go about getting rules established through self-regulation in areas where there is no legislation and where legislation is perhaps not needed?"
"Perhaps we might see a list of proposed measures here too?"
"Mr President, the Liberal Group can express nothing but great satisfaction with the Whitehead report and its attempt to introduce a system of priorities."
"One of our great concerns in the Liberal Group is that we not only create a Europe for companies, but also a Europe for citizens, a significant aspect of which is a Europe for consumers."
"There are two important aspects which we would emphasize."
"One of these is the consumer's freedom of choice, and the other is the consumer's access to the courts."
"I will not go into the latter because the last three speakers have already spoken on this at length."
"But the question of the consumer's freedom of choice is very, very important."
"We in the Liberal Group are staunch supporters of the internal market, but the counterpart to the internal market is free choice for the consumer."
"We can say, to borrow English expressions, that we are both internal market freaks and at the same time free choice freaks."
"A prerequisite for achieving free choice is that we, as consumer, are given information, which is why I would like to ask the Commissioner about the marking regulations."
"We heard yesterday that Mr Santer went all the way and promised that everything should be marked, and that all modified products would be marked."
"This is a great declaration of confidence on the part of the Commission."
"I also hope that the Commission realizes that this form of marking is not a miracle cure in itself."
"It requires clearly defined marking, and not least it requires information as to what the markings mean."
"So I very much hope that one of the priorities of implementation of the marking regulations is that the Commission will undertake to provide information on what constitutes the basis for modified food products, and information on the criteria used as a basis for marking, to ensure that we have free choice and that we are not overwhelmed with a whole host of markings which we are unable to interpret."
"Thank you. I look forward to the Commissioner's response."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, I realize patience is needed because we Members here may repeat each other, but we do have enormous interest in Mr Whitehead's report."
"And Mr Whitehead's report, which was unanimously approved, says what all of us are saying, more or less."
"But in the time I have available, I want to highlight a few important points."
"First, Mr Whitehead himself, the rapporteur himself, welcomes the Commission's ten priorities covering information to consumers, easy access to justice, food safety - very topical in Parliament this week - and other issues which directly affect consumers' rights."
"But we all endorse the criticism about failure to evaluate the previous period, up to 1995, and also perhaps of lack of detail on the period up to the year 1998."
"Mr Whitehead himself establishes a very concrete strategy for identifying the problems: identify the objectives of consumer policy, establish a strategy for achieving them and then a timetable for putting them into practice."
"I think that is the fundamental criticism."
"Because things were done in that period and the Community institutions lack credibility on food safety, for instance on mad cows, contaminated blood, growth hormone, and transgenic maize and transgenic soya, which we will be putting a question on, because there is great concern on the subject in Spain."
"A survey shows that in many countries 60 % to 80 % of the population is against consuming products developed through genetic engineering, out of anxiety about their effect on human health."
"So one of today's priorities is food safety and the establishment of an independent food safety watchdog."
"Finally, we agree with all the points."
"We are going to vote for Mr Whitehead's report - we know the Commissioner is sensitive to it."
"And, of course, it is our duty to be the voice of the disquiet felt today by the European public about food safety and their health."
"And we feel compelled to repeat that, although I appreciate that it is tiring for you, because you are hearing it so many times this afternoon."
"Mr President, may I thank Mr Whitehead for the highly constructive cooperation, particularly with regard to the labelling of packaging, in this report of his."
"I likewise wish Commissioner Bonino every success when she sets about coordinating food safety at the Commission."
"I believe that she is a good person for the task."
"I should like to draw the attention of Members and of the Commissioner to one detail in this report."
"Paragraph 19 refers to an EMU information campaign conducted by Parliament and the Commission."
"Regrettably, my Group cannot vote in favour of this paragraph or welcome such campaigns."
"It has just emerged that the Commission is requiring independent researchers and experts to give a written assurance that if the Commission sends them to discuss EMU at various events organized by citizens, the experts should undertake to speak only in accordance with the Commission's line."
"I consider this very dangerous."
"Thinking of the current BSE debate, Commissioner, how can we continue to trust the experts sent by the Commission if this kind of thing is going on?"
"I have tabled a question about this, and I should like to know in what other connections the Commission requires such promises of loyalty from independent experts."
"Mr President, I too would like to wish Mr Whitehead well with his far-reaching report, for the most positive thing one can say about the Commission's statement on consumer policy, to be realistic, is that it is far too vague and superficial."
"As consumers we need something better than this."
"Regarding DG XXIV's newly added areas of responsibility in the context of consumer protection, I fully agree with Mr Whitehead that there is an urgent need to draw up a set of priorities and to replace the Commission's general statements with concrete time frames and plans of action."
"There is also need to promote the labelling of products with environmental and energy information, and to establish consumer legislation in all Member States."
"Basically one can divide thoughts about a European consumer policy into two different approaches."
"One can either, as Mr Whitehead has done, argue for the setting up of European consumer information, with campaigns and information centres, or - and this is the argument which I myself support - one can argue that the already established national consumer organisations should work together for an appropriate re-adjustment, in concrete terms by strengthening BEUC, and then acting jointly in the political arena."
"I believe we must recognize that it is would be too difficult and too expensive to produce a completely harmonized consumer policy and consumer information system, because the needs are simply too varied."
"But despite this lack of uniformity, we will of course vote in favour of Mr Whitehead's report."
"It is only a proactive consumer policy which can give the EU's internal market its legitimacy and effectiveness."
"That is why it must begin, first and foremost, with the government conference."
"It is there that the consumer policy must be strengthened."
"It must be clear from the introduction to the treaty that the EU gives due consideration to consumer policy, in just the same way as it gives due consideration to sustainable development."
"The treaty must brace itself for a series of other areas, so that it can also become a clear goal to promote consumer policy considerations and consumer interests."
"Article 129 A is still lacking a number of points of clarification and improvements."
"Only in this way can consumer policy take the important position it deserves."
"Mr President, Commissioner, consumer policy increasingly requires a Europe-wide perspective of the problems because of the political attitudes which tend to saddle Europe with responsibility and label it incapable."
"Europe should not therefore be perceived by consumers as an ideological choice but as a way of exercising a continual check on the interests of the individual states within a European context."
"Having said that, it is well-known that in some Member States, concern for consumer rights has developed at a slower pace than in Europe as a whole."
"Italy is certainly one of them, and the development of an awareness of consumer rights there has certainly been the result of the activity and initiatives of the various associations which have had to work without any backing from central government."
"We are calling upon the Commission to act resolutely in relation to Italy which - and this is a scandal - is still without national framework legislation on the representation of consumer rights."
"For years we have seen government and parliament squabble about who has responsibility, but the opposition appears to be very strong, more especially because the consumer groups are expressing a demand that lies outside the control of the political parties."
"In congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Whitehead, on the well-structured motion for a resolution concerning the 19961998 programme, which we support in all respects - legal, economic and social - Alleanza Nazionale must ask the Commission to increase its support for the movement in the countries of southern Europe, where the presence of organized consumer groups is very much small in comparison with the four million units that exist in Europe, mainly in the countries of northern Europe."
"By guaranteeing the short and medium-term development of consumer associations we shall in fact avoid undermining the Maastricht Treaty which, while it recognizes a new consumer function in education and other important sectors, also creates new areas which are likely to remain inaccessible to associations with less clout."
"Mr President, I also want to congratulate the rapporteur on the excellent report he has produced."
"I know that his work has been greatly appreciated by consumer organizations throughout Europe, including BEUC in Brussels, and I wholeheartedly endorse his conclusions."
"This, the third consumer programme, offers an inadequate analysis of previous efforts, little continuity from past programmes and no coherent strategy for the future."
"Given the establishment of the internal market and the imminent introduction of the single currency, consumer policy must be implemented on a pan-European basis rather than by Member States acting alone."
"There also has to be full implementation of existing legislation, as well as simpler and more efficient redress facilities for ordinary citizens."
"Obviously, the most important and topical challenge facing consumer policy is indeed the BSE crisis."
"Since the Whitehead report was adopted in the Committee on Environment, a number of major events have taken place, the most important being the transfer of responsibility for food safety to DG XXIV."
"DGXXIV's new duties in this field were given further impetus yesterday when the Commission announced to the House their response to the BSE report."
"I agree with President Santer's claim that the European Veterinary Office based in County Meath in Ireland can play a vital role in restoring consumers' confidence in food safety procedures."
"I, too, would urge the Council to reconsider its attitude to this office."
"I also welcome the decisions to place all relevant scientific committees under the authority of DG XXIV and to establish a new unit on the assessment of public health risks and the inspection of foodstuffs also under DG XXIV."
"I am however concerned that the Commission might be repeating the mistakes already clearly identified in the BSE report."
"The tasks of the Veterinary Inspection Office and the new food safety units must be clearly established from the very outset."
"If not, then the European consumers will continue to remain deeply sceptical about food safety standards in Europe."
"Mr President, what I am saying in my few remarks follows on very neatly from what Mrs Malone has just said."
"I should like to reinforce her requests to the Commission."
"Like her and like other speakers, I regard this as an absolutely hopeless document which really was not worth writing."
"I do not know whether or not the author is among us but I hope not."
"I hope he or she is no longer with the Commission, certainly not in DG XXIV."
"If this is all that the Commission can come up with on consumer protection, it is not really worth putting it in the Treaty, and I imagine that Mrs Bonino has to all intents and purposes disowned it."
"There are some very important areas where consumer protection can work at a Community level, and I say that as a British Conservative."
"The three areas which I would focus on particularly are safety, information and help to consumers."
"I would say that the Commission should examine the way in which consumers need these three elements, because of the activities of the Community, in particular with regard to cross-border trade."
"On safety we have to ask ourselves what DG XXIV was doing about BSE when this was being drawn up."
"It is not referred to anywhere."
"Here is a great crisis boiling up on the margins of Europe, on the margins of our consciousness, that is being dealt with by DG VI when one presumes that DG XXIV was saying nothing about it."
"Well, that is history."
"But now I should like to invite the Commissioner to use the opportunity of this debate to tell us - and Mrs Malone raised the point - what is going to happen about food safety."
"If DG XXIV, the consumer protection directorate, which produced this document, is now going to be in charge of food safety, then who will actually be involved?"
"Will it be the same staff, or are people going to be drafted across from DG III and DG VI?"
"Or is it going to be left to the authors of this paper?"
"If so Heaven help us."
"Secondly, on the matter of information, I should like to draw the Commissioner's attention to a point which I raised with Commissioner Bangemann yesterday regarding food labelling."
"Section 6 of this document states: ' it is not clear that all the information provided on food labels is really helpful to consumers.'"
"It then goes on to say that it is not going to do anything about it."
"I have moved an amendment which I hope the Commission will accept saying that the Commission should live up to its obligation to produce more information to consumers about the E numbers on food labels."
"That is essential."
"Finally, I would reinforce what the rapporteur has to say about legal aid."
"If there is one thing my constituents want out of a consumer protection policy, it is more information and more assuredness that they know what is going to happen if they get into difficulties in another Member State, in particular with regard to buying things such as property: how much help can European law give them here?"
"At the moment, very little."
"Mr President, I do not know whether it was a coincidence, but almost all the speakers on this issue so far have been women."
"I do not know whether that tells us anything."
"Fortunately there is yourself and the rapporteur too, who has produced an excellent report."
"In my short speech I would like to stress the great gulf that exists between the general principles, between - if you will - the Commissioner's sincere and 'hyperactive' intentions, between the legislation on the one hand, and the real situation prevailing in the Member States so far as consumer protection is concerned."
"And this does not just concern BSE, but a range of other issues as well."
"I think that particularly in my own country, Greece, one only has to switch on a television channel and in no time at all one can see all the European Union's principles and guidelines being infringed."
"And here, I would like to say that I am surprised by the fact that while we see correct trends and impulses from the Commission itself, at the same time some of its services are intervening and putting the interests and protection of consumers in second place, while top priority is reserved for the interests of certain major economic units, as has characteristically happened with the arraignment of Sweden or Greece before the European Court of Justice over the issue of restrictions and bans on the advertising of toys."
"While I am on the subject of television, Mr President, I would like to say that there are clauses on consumer protection, protection of the viewer-consumer, for example relating to television without frontiers, concerning the timing of advertisements, etc., which at least in my own country are completely disregarded."
"As for the advertising of drugs, you turn on the television and see one drug after another being paraded in campaigns addressed at adults, minors, children and so on."
"Consequently, I think that in the context of implementation by the Member States of the basic regulations and guidelines on consumer protection, there is still a long, long way to go."
"Mr President, it is rare for Parliament to urge the Commission not to go too fast."
"Usually we are trying to spur the Commission on."
"Mr Whitehead, the rapporteur for the Environment Committee, urges the Commission to be more modest in its overall ambitions for consumer protection and I back him fully."
"The report exudes a spirit of realism which is most apposite, I think, in consumer policy."
"So I am largely happy with the recommendations made in Mr Whitehead's report."
"Consumer policy is a relatively young policy area which has a number of inherent limitations."
"Firstly it is an area which is largely governed by private law."
"I would venture to say that if policy is good, government involvement with the consumer is minimal."
"Secondly, an awful lot depends on the cooperation of business and industry."
"If there are powerful consumer bodies which are good at getting their message across clearly to the producers of goods and services, the battle of consumer protection is already half-won."
"Thirdly, the European policy is aware of its own limitations."
"Precisely because the area is one governed by private law the Commission often cannot do much by way of legislation, unless existing European directives can be invoked."
"So I welcome the report's recommendations for strengthening the position of the consumer by spreading information (paragraphs 20 to 26)."
"We have far more clued-up consumers than splendid laws, which will in any case be invoked by only a very small number of consumers, however aware they are."
"It is a well-known fact that consumer awareness in the southern countries of the European Community is as yet less well developed and organized."
"And this is where we need to start, not with all manner of rules and regulations."
"So I also think it is a good thing that the Commission begins by publishing most of the ideas which emerge in green papers rather than coming out straight away with incompletely thought-through draft legislation on which no agreement is then possible in the Council."
"I am thus very amenable to the rapporteur's suggestion that the proposals under the previous programme of consumer policy priorities should be consolidated and I compliment him warmly on his excellent report."
"The European Commission will benefit by it."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Whitehead, on an excellent report and his indefatigable work with the consumer intergroups."
"Perhaps if the Council and the Commission had listened to him and to the intergroup earlier, the 'mad cow' problem - and others - would not have arisen."
"Commissioner, I should like to throw down a challenge to you. The challenge is that you withdraw this document because it is no good."
"Commissioner, this document is bad. This document was drafted by a team under a former Director General who has since been replaced by Mr Papas, who went to the Committee on the Environment and said that the document was no good, and that he was not in agreement with it."
"Now Mr Papas has already gone and has been replaced by a new Director General."
"This document is not a legislative text, it is not a law with amendments, it is a text of political guidelines, setting priorities."
"Therefore I should like to ask the Commissioner if the text of political guidelines is bad and cannot be put into practice, what is its use?"
"I think it would be better to withdraw it - and I think that the rapporteur agrees with what I am saying, because I have already had an opportunity to discuss this with him - and present a document which might be more concentrated, with less priorities and which could really be transformed into a genuine action programme."
"In this case, I promise her that all of us, in all of the political groups, from every part of the spectrum, will be here to support a report which has just four or five priorities for political action to help consumers in the coming years."
"That is what is needed."
"The rapporteur, after all, sets five priorities with which I agree: access to justice, either through courts, through arbitration machinery or through other mechanisms, the protection of the financial interests of consumers, improved information, converting consumer information into consumer power, a food policy and a human and animal health policy which is different to the one pursued so far and a clear and simple definition of what a universal public service is and how it can be applied."
"Just two comments to finish up: I would like her to use Article 129A, more often, as this is a weapon which she has at her disposal and which she has not used so far."
"We think that it could be used more often. The other point is about a policy of granting subsidies to consumer defence organisations."
"A few years ago the European Parliament - I was one of its authors - tabled a motion increasing the budgetary amounts for consumer protection associations in order to give them more support especially in the countries where they are lacking, such as Ireland and the southern countries of Europe, and also giving support to smaller associations."
"On the contrary, the current policy has lent support only to the large European organisations, often forgetting that it is in the countries where consumer organisations are smaller and weaker that they are the more necessary."
"Mr President, Members of Parliament, I must say that I am rather disconcerted by this debate."
"First of all, may I remind you that this plan was presented to Parliament on the 3rd November 1995."
"You must have examined it in depth, as you presented to me a report on the priorities in February 1997!"
"So, my dear friends, let us be serious!"
"Mr. Pimenta, this plan is presented under my name and I dare hope that the Director-General has not betrayed me."
"If you think that he has done so, why did you not say so?"
"That really would be something that would call for disciplinary sanction."
"And this Parliament is apparently very fond of disciplinary sanctions."
"It would have been preferable, rather than to say it publicly today, to have the kindness to let the Commission know sooner."
"I remember very well that before this document was submitted to the Council and to Parliament, Parliament had asked me not to present a detailed action plan, but a general outline of intervention policies."
"And if you read this document, you will see that the Commission has chosen as new priorities - as had never been done before - public services, financial services and the information society, and not products any more."
"You should have thought about these priorities!"
"Because had I had to wait for your opinion before starting to do anything, since November 1995, I would have done nothing until today."
"The debate should therefore be put back into context."
"While waiting for you to reflect - since the 3rd November 1995! - the Commission, which had been asked to present a political plan, and not a plan of action which it worked out subsequently, presented a total of twelve proposals for directives concerning all the policies."
"Out of these twelve, three - i.e. one quarter - concern consumer policy, and more precisely access to justice, guarantees and consumption credit, which is being discussed this afternoon."
"After which, we presented you with the Green Paper on financial services, which will be debated shortly."
"Parliament then rejected the remote financial service, which we will present again."
"Everyone must therefore assume their responsibilities, as frankly, I hardly find it acceptable that the Commission is placed under accusation without recognition of everything it did in 1996."
"Mrs Jackson, if you think that the document is of no value because it does not mention BSE, your government and your party could have been of major help to this institution and to the Commission if it had informed us of what was going on."
"I would remind you that in 1996 the Commission formed the inter-service group."
"We came up with three memorandums and the vademecum for consumers and the document - and maybe this is a detail you did not take on board - was presented in November 1995 and the crisis erupted in March."
"(FR) Indeed, our relationship has always been loyal."
"Having said that, I do not wish to review everything we have done, for example with regard to the pursuit of legislative activities, indication of prices, comparative advertising, etc., but I find the comments I have heard here to be rather unfair, hardly generous and most inaccurate."
"Moreover, I would like to say that I obtained the powers with regard to health control exactly a week ago."
"I would like to ask the Members of Parliament to be calm, as we will have to define together what it would be best to do."
"I do not have a miracle solution, Mr Whitehead, and I have already said that I would come and listen to you in the middle of March to find out what you are proposing."
"For example I believe that, bearing in mind my new responsibilities, it would be good for me to re-examine the Green Paper on food law - which was nearly ready - in the light of the changes in policies and priorities which have just been decided."
"We have made a leap forward to the advantage of the consumer, but we should now set to work without excessive demagogy."
"That is a challenge we must take up together."
"I find it rather strange that I am asked today what are my decisions, my programmes, my ideas or - worse - those of the Commission regarding health, controls or the scientific committee."
"I received these powers only a week ago!"
"I am not thinking so much of you, but of other interventions we have heard today."
"Having said that, I will nevertheless reply to some more specific observations that have been made."
"As regards the Green Paper, it was ready in the inter-service consultations, but I feel that in the new situation that has come to light since last week, it is my duty to re-examine it and see whether it is possible to push things a little further."
"Mrs Kuhn, as regards baby food, one can always dream of revolution."
"This does not prevent current law from having limits."
"For as long as the treaty is not amended, the Commission is obliged to apply it as it is, and Mr Bangemann has started a proceeding against Germany for hindering free circulation."
"We must respect the rules, whether or not we like them, until we come to change them."
"As regards the instructions, I hope that it is an exceptional case, but I am very willing to find out more, as I did not know about it."
"I do not wish to launch into a reply on a subject that I do not know, but I would like to learn more, in order to determine whether it is habitual practice or a particular case."
"As regards subsidies to organizations - I am returning to the last remark from Mr Pimenta and others - we have been reproached for distributing money without exactly knowing why, while we introduced a procedure for encouraging consumer organizations to work together on Community projects, and we tried not to grant operating subsidies any more, but only to support specific projects."
"I think we are now ready to publish in the Official Journal the result of our work, which has not been easy."
"For southern European countries whose need is greatest, I myself sent a special adviser to the four countries, to meet all the consumer organizations, which are now in a position to make proposals."
"I would like action from the consumer associations, rather than to tell them myself what they should do."
"After a year's work, we are in a position to start projects covering the four countries of Mediterranean Europe - Italy, Portugal, Greece and Spain - in order to reinforce a consumerism culture which is little developed in southern Europe."
"As regards Article 129 A, as you know, six member countries have submitted an amendment to the CIG; we ourselves have presented an amendment to Article 129."
"We hope in this way to be able to promote the reinforcement of the consumer and health policy."
"I would now like to talk about food labelling."
"At this stage, I can only confirm what Mr President said yesterday in his speech - I quote: ' I argue for the gradual introduction of a proper food policy and, in this context, I am in favour of compulsory and systematic labelling' ."
"The DG XXIV has already launched a consultation and study involving consumer associations to try to define jointly what would be clear, important and pertinent information, so that consumers are no longer flooded with a tide of information in which they are lost."
"For the moment, opinions largely conflict, and we will have to cut short as matters have reached political level, but we wanted to know at least the ideas of the consumer associations."
"I do not know whether I have answered everyone."
"I had a comment for Mr Garosci on the subject of the Euro, which is one of our concerns and which we are trying to discuss with the appropriate Commissioner."
"I hope to have answered all the questions."
"On financial services, we will hold a debate now."
"I will therefore come back to it in detail with my colleague Monti."
"With regard to the new health controls, the meeting with Parliament is fixed for mid March."
"Mr President, as I had to speak this morning perhaps the Commissioner did not hear me and I should therefore like to address two specific questions to her."
"Firstly, does Mrs Bonino agree or disagree with what her Director General said in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection about the consultative paper?"
"Secondly, in view of what I said this morning, when will she be able to bring forward the Green Paper on food policies?"
"I wish her no harm."
"I want to see her strong and powerful."
"We know the pressure she has to fight against within the Commission."
"All we want now is a certain candour in that matter in this debate."
"Just one comment, Mrs Bonino."
"You more or less accused our committee of having taken too long."
"First of all, it takes several months before a committee receives the relevant documents."
"You mentioned that we have also received the draft directive on guarantees for consumer goods."
"I wanted to introduce it in committee in March, but when I had had the paper for four weeks, the Commission ordered a cost-benefit analysis."
"That is fine, but I should not then be blamed at some future date for not working."
"A word on baby food: I would recommend that you check whether, apart from the Baby Food Directive, there is an appendix somewhere with maximum pesticide levels."
"If I remember rightly, that has never been done."
"We have no European specifications."
"Mr President, just to be quite clear: I cannot react to a statement by my Director-General because I have not been informed."
"So, if you let me know - and possibly if you had let me know - it would be much more useful."
"In any case, if you let me have the documents, I will certainly take a position."
"On the Green Paper on food, as I told you, it was ready at service level, so it could come to the college."
"Owing to the new responsibility and weight that we have as consumers, I have to take this opportunity to review the Green Paper and I will do it in the light of an empowerment that has been given to consumers."
"So I cannot say that it will be ready tomorrow or next week, I am just saying that it was ready, but now there is scope to strengthen it."
"But, certainly, in one month or two we can present it back to you."
"On pesticides: again, you are asking me questions which I have just received, and we have to discuss this together."
"I am not criticising Parliament for the delay, I am just saying that in the meantime of one year I have acted, Mrs Jackson."
"This is not a worthless document."
"Parliament asked me for a policy document and not for a plan of action, but it also got a plan of action."
"So you have simply to decide when you ask for a document what you really want."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12.00 noon."
"Green paper on financial services"
"The next item is the debate on the report by Mrs Marinucci (A4-0048/97), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the Commission Green Paper on 'Financial services: meeting consumers' expectations' (COM(96)0209 - C4-0339/96)."
"Mr President, financial services have become increasingly important to families and consumers."
"The variety of financial services offered to consumers has increased, as has their use but, as a result of a lack of information or regulation or because of failures to act or fraud on the part of unscrupulous operators, many citizens have suffered damage and others have developed prejudices."
"In this sector also, the internal market offers consumers new opportunities but it can also add to their unease and increase the disadvantages."
"The fact is that while, on the one hand, competition and the opportunity of choosing between suppliers of these services, including from outside the national territory, add to consumer freedom of choice, the differences in legislation may be the source of new problems."
"It is no coincidence that the use of crossborder financial services remains limited."
"Consumers may refrain from using more advantageous or less expensive services because they lack the necessary information or, indeed, security."
"We therefore need Community legislative action, and this is something that has become all the more urgent as we look to the achievement of monetary union."
"In December 1995, at the same plenary session at which the exclusion of financial services from the proposal for a directive on distance selling was confirmed, the Commissioner, Mrs Bonino, undertook to the House to present a Communication which would - and these are her words - contain an action programme or even, should it prove necessary, a directive."
"The House welcomed the fact that that promise was very shortly followed by the submission of the Green Paper we are today discussing."
"But we do not agree with the Commission when it says that the aim of the single market in this area has largely been achieved through some 50 directives."
"Furthermore, the second part of the Green Paper itself analyses the problems that still exist, such as the possible discrimination against non-residents, the lack or poor quality of information, the lack of rules on intermediaries and the lack of fiscal harmonization."
"But that is not the whole story: to take just a few examples, in the area of insurance: a cooling-off period is provided for life assurance only but not, for example, for insurance against fire and theft."
"As regards intermediaries, and again in the field of insurance, there is a recommendation dating from 1991, but it is by no means binding: there is no protection against the fraudulent use of credit cards."
"Here too, recommendation 595 of 1988 did not have the effect of inciting the Member States to take positive measures to protect consumers."
"On the issue of consumer credit, directive 102 of 1987 does not cover new services that did not exist at the time of its adoption."
"The concept of the general interest has therefore to be better defined."
"The reference in the banking directives, and the second banking directive in particular, allows scope for serious legal uncertainties."
"And the list goes on."
"The problem of distance selling, finally, dealt with in the third part of the Green Paper, is not covered by the legislation in force."
"The relevant legislative committees have discussed the Green Paper in great detail and very perceptively and have overwhelmingly focused their proposals on the need for a coherent and complete Community legislative framework that takes a horizontal approach to problems recurring in more than one sector and a vertical approach to specific issues such as distance selling."
"While we await the Commission response, I recommend to honourable Members - who are not now present in the Chamber but will, we hope, be here tomorrow - the amendments approved by a more or less absolute majority of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the opinion I drafted on this Green Paper for the Economic Affairs Committee I came largely to the same conclusions regarding the continuing problems which the consumer encounters over financial services."
"The Economic Affairs Committee has identified five."
"One: the internal market is not really working."
"Using the national interest as an excuse, Member States cling to national laws which protect their market rather than their consumers."
"It is time a case was brought before the European Court against the mandatory bonus/malus scale, the mandatory no-claim discount, the outlawing of interest-bearing sight accounts and other things."
"To prevent further impediments a common definition of the general interest is also needed."
"Two: the absence of fiscal harmonization forms a serious obstacle to the free movement of financial services."
"In some Member States life assurance policies are still not tax-deductible if they are taken out in another Member State."
"That is unacceptable."
"Three: the dubious activities of non-regulated financial intermediaries, often operating by post or telephone, cast a shadow over the whole sector."
"There must be Community rules on qualifications for and the exercise of this profession so that the consumer can sort the wheat from the chaff and know he can trust financial service providers."
"Four: the provision of efficient and clear information must enable the consumer to reap the benefits of the single market in financial services."
"He must be given enough knowledge of the advantages and know what enforceable rights he has in that market."
"Financial service providers must operate voluntary codes of conduct as a way of optimizing the quality of information made available to the consumer."
"And lastly I would advocate a further extension of the role of independent ombudsmen for the banking and insurance sector."
"They must report on their activities so that those concerned can learn the necessary lessons and they must henceforth be involved in the preparation, realization and evaluation of legislation in the financial and insurance sector."
"These are the issues which the Economic Affairs Committee regards as paramount."
"I disagree with the rapporteur on one point."
"I see no justification for a separate directive on distance selling of financial services."
"For financial services the difference between transactions concluded at a distance and those not concluded at a distance is less relevant than when one buys a simple consumer good such as a book or a sweater."
"Financial services are a different kettle of fish."
"They are not visible or tangible and consequently they entail trust irrespective of whether they are sold at a distance or face to face."
"The Liberal Group thus sets great store by rules to ensure better guarantees of the integrity of those who offer financial services."
"Ladies and gentlemen, my Group is largely happy with the points made in Mrs Marinucci's report, but we do not want legislation always to be the first and preferred instrument of policy in solving these problems."
"The sector of banking, insurance and investment is already the subject of no fewer than 50 directives and still the consumer cannot fully reap the benefits of the single market."
"My Group suggests that the solution to some problems should be sought for example in voluntary codes of conduct, and that additional legislation should be proposed only where it is necessary."
"Because legislation usually means an increased cost which is invariably passed on to the consumer."
"We must indeed strive, not for more but for better and justifiable legislation."
"I should appreciate the Commission's views here."
"Madam President, the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizen's Rights has welcomed the work done by the rapporteur and has put to the committee responsible for the substance a number of points which I wish briefly to mention."
"We have, in particular, stressed that Community legislation should be designed to guarantee greater competition on the supply side, effective freedom of movement on both the supply and demand sides, provision of adequate, accurate and effective information for individual consumers - who seem to us to be the least well protected under the current legislation - and greater transparency and certainty regarding cross-border contracts."
"We have also sought to stress that Community legislation should act to limit the costs of cross-border contracts; promote the use of the language of the potential client; promote the search for and acquisition of information by one contracting party on the other on the basis of respect for rules governing personal data; promote the exercise of the rights of each contracting party in the Member State of the other contracting party; promote consumer information and education; guarantee respect for the principle of mutual recognition and ensure that due respect for the regulations of the client's Member State of stay or residence does not hinder effective freedom of movement and competition between financial products."
"Those are some of the issues we sought to highlight."
"It seems to us that there is still, at this stage, much to be done to provide genuine protection for consumers in this sector."
"We are in any event persuaded that the Commission intends moving in the right direction by filling what we consider to be a number of gaps in the Green Paper."
"Madam President, Commissioner Bonino has left us but it is worth remembering that this Green Paper is the result of a promise she made during the debate on distance-selling."
"Since she accused the Parliament today of dilatoriness, it is also worth remembering that it was not introduced to us in either the timescale or the form that was promised."
"I want to congratulate Mrs Marinucci on what she has had to say about these matters for our committee and, indeed, for the Parliament."
"She has done an admirable job."
"When one looks at the Green Paper the heading is perhaps the most impressive thing about it."
"After that we get far more on summaries of the existing provision with regard to the financial services than we do of the future challenges."
"What I want to say, is that we need to have more questions asked than this kind of tokenism."
"The rapporteur rightly says that what we need is a clearly defined framework covering issues that are common to all financial services legislation, supplemented by vertical measures covering issues such as the distance-selling of financial products and the market for credit."
"The more the single market develops and the more the proportion of cross-border trade develops, the need for consumer protection will also increase."
"If the Commission recognizes that at a very simple level, it is surprising that they will not look at the issues which are involved as financial services themselves develop with the possibilities for consumers being ripped-off in the process."
"The Marinucci report begins and ends with the recommendation that we begin to move towards a directive that will specifically protect consumers in this field."
"That is what we have called for - constantly."
"That is what we said was necessary when we debated distance-selling in this House a year ago."
"We are supporters of the single market."
"We want it to work but at each stage it must keep pace with levels of consumer protection that match the sophistication of those who might prey upon the consumer."
"Commissioner Bonino and her newest Director-General would do well to ponder on how they use their extended power."
"I hope that her colleague will report the strong feelings of the House on that matter."
"Madam President, it is worth remembering that the whole debate on financial services actually got going after the European Commission initially included financial services with distance selling in the distance selling directive. Parliament endorsed that, the Council of Ministers scrapped it and we then had a debate in the second reading."
"At the first reading - I say this for Mrs Kestelijn's benefit, she was nodding her head emphatically - at the first reading it was still firmly in there and not one of your Liberal members put down any amendments to get it removed."
"At the second reading, when the Council had removed it, you did manage to get it removed by a couple of votes."
"And then we had our debate."
"Then we had a promise from Mrs Bonino that there would be a green paper on financial services because some people in the European Commission, notably Mrs Bonino, realized that something would have to be done."
"The Green Paper appeared, and a list was compiled of the various laws governing banks, insurance companies and share dealing, and a number of problem areas were identified."
"What I find unfortunate is that no concrete proposals were put forward."
"I had hoped to see some."
"I put down a number of amendments to Mrs Marinucci's report, aimed at impressing upon the Commission the need for rules on financial intermediaries."
"My belief is that we shall also need legislation on electronic money transfers and credit and payment cards."
"For the benefit of Mr Monti I would say that we sorely need this."
"Then there is credit registration: no mention is made of this anywhere."
"We know that there is voluntary credit registration in most of the Member States, and we know that some of those voluntary credit registrations liaise with each other, and I think the European Union should give an extra boost to that."
"That is not to say that we have to do it ourselves, but we can give encouragement so that some form of greater cooperation takes shape."
"If you apply for a loan from a distance and it is not known what level of borrowing you already have, what commitments you have entered into, that can cause problems not only for those receiving the loans but also for the provider."
"So I think that some measure of support needs to be given to this voluntary cooperation which already exists in a number of countries."
"Madam President, the specific question I should like to put to Mr Monti is whether or not he really intends to come up with a separate piece of legislation on distance selling within the next year."
"I say that with a backward glance at Mrs Kestelijn; I am not happy that people should have fail-safe guarantees if they buy an insurance or savings policy or whatever from a door-to-door salesman, and that if sitting in your easy chair one fine evening you order something from the TV which has major consequences later, the supplier has no obligations towards you."
"That is not covered."
"Madam President, I hope the Commission will at last grasp that something needs to be done, that the decisions which have been taken must be reversed, and that a prompt debate is needed with a view to legislation."
"It really is very necessary."
"Madam President, I too agree that anyone reading the title of the Green Paper 'Financial services: meeting consumers' expectations' would say that this is a very useful and necessary thing, which especially in the countries in the South such as Greece, would make a serious contribution towards serving the needs of consumers, especially those who do not read the Financial Times, those who probably do not know many foreign languages, cannot read the small print, and do not have attorneys."
"In other words, they might think that such a directive would have a serious and positive social dimension."
"However, I think that when one looks more closely, it becomes evident that the directive deviates a long way from the ideals that inspired its title, it is mainly limited to remote sales and new electronic systems, as Mrs Marinucci very rightly stresses in paragraph 5 of the motion for a resolution, while a very broad sector relating to banks, insurance companies or securities is not covered by the directive at all."
"I think this means that the Green Paper contributes very little to solving the problems it is supposed to address, and it mainly draws attention to the great gulf which must be bridged, because I think that with the development of technology and the increasing numbers of small savers, the problems to be addressed are indeed very serious and very difficult for the consumer to discern on his own."
"Mr President, in welcoming this report and in congratulating Mrs Marinucci in the presentation that she had made, I should like to address specifically the points about the need to protect consumer rights within forthcoming legislation on the financial services."
"The two amendments that I put forward at the Committee on the Environment - and I thank my colleagues for supporting them - deal particularly with issues affecting vulnerable people living in our communities who have fallen prey to unscrupulous cowboys operating in the financial sector and who have lost out very badly indeed."
"The example in Britain and in my own constituency is that of home income plans."
"This is a type of remortgage scheme which promised to retired people the opportunity of remortgaging their property and obtaining an income for which they would have no loss for the rest of their lives."
"Twenty-eight people in my Essex South constituency, 700 people in the United Kingdom as a whole, fell for that false promise and have lost many thousands of pounds in the process."
"Many of those in their late seventies and early eighties are facing being evicted from their homes altogether."
"In response to that, a petition was brought to this Parliament by Mr James Fielding from my constituency and others."
"The Committee on Petitions upheld the justice of their case and asked that when forthcoming legislation on financial services was produced that the position of these vulnerable people - not just in Britain, but throughout Europe - be protected."
"That is what we call for in this debate today."
"Clearly we cannot deal in more detail with the specific case that I cite but our contribution to this debate today should signal our determination to ensure that the rights of vulnerable people in these circumstances are protected."
"These people were promised an income for life."
"They did not realize the risks associated with their investments and they have suffered at a time in their lives when they really cannot deal with it."
"We want good information, understandable and clear, so people cannot be misled."
"We want clear rights of redress where people have been misled and we want compensation for them."
"That is what this legislation should address."
"Madam President, let me begin by thanking the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection and, in particular, the rapporteur, Mrs Marinucci, for their support for the Commission initiative; that support is reflected in the report the House is today debating."
"The report is also the product of the work of the two associated committees, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy and the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, and I should like also to thank warmly the rapporteurs for those two committees, Mrs Kestelijn-Sierens and Mr Florio."
"On the occasion of the vote on the second reading of the - now adopted - distance selling directive, the Commission said that in agreeing to the exclusion of financial services, it would undertake to assess the need to protect consumers in relation to the distance selling of financial services and, more generally, the whole of the financial sector."
"And we have done just that."
"Today's report backs the effort the Commission has made to strengthen the protection of consumers as natural persons."
"At the same time, taking into account the high level of interest attaching to consumer policy in the field of financial services, I have, together with Commissioner Bonino, undertaken to present a communication as soon as possible."
"This will mark the Commission's official response to the wideranging consultation launched via the Green Paper, by establishing the priorities and time-scales for the measures we intend taking."
"That communication will, of course, take account of the opinion of this House."
"I shall discuss briefly the individual proposals that have been the subject of detailed discussion between Mrs Bonino and myself and on which we are in agreement."
"Basically, we are able to accept various of the proposals put forward and I am referring in particular here to paragraph 5."
"The report rightly points out that the absence of a clear definition of the concept of the general good may lead to its being applied in such a way as to create barriers to the free movement of services."
"In the field of banking services, the Commission has already published a draft communication on the exercise of the freedom to provide services and the concept of the general good, firmly established in the second banking directive."
"And I intend to finalize that communication as soon as possible and set under way a similar process of reflection for insurance services."
"Paragraph 13 of the report calls upon the Commission to set under way a dialogue with the professional associations and bodies to identify, where possible, agreed solutions to disputes between consumers and the industry."
"We intend encouraging dialogue between the parties at a European level, as frequently already happens at a national level, to promote codes of good conduct, in particular as regards consumer information."
"I therefore intend monitoring closely its application and, should this prove unsatisfactory, I shall provide for binding legal instruments."
"The dialogue has already been launched and needs to be extended."
"The important paragraphs 14 and 15 of the report call for a variety of proposals."
"Although we support the underlying objective, we are still considering whether or not horizontal legislation would be the most effective solution."
"As regards consumer information in particular, we are considering inviting the parties to enter into discussion in order to have professional codes of conduct drawn up by the end of 1997."
"After an appropriate period to allow for these to be applied, the Commission will monitor the results and, should that prove not to be a helpful approach, it will undertake to propose more binding measures, the feasibility of which will be considered at the same time."
"But I do think it would be difficult to apply a measure on the quality and security of financial products."
"It would also be difficult to arrive at an appropriate definition of their content and purpose."
"Turning to the competence and integrity of financial intermediaries, we are persuaded that legislative measures concerning non-regulated intermediaries in the insurance and banking services sector are useful, and these measures are to be put to the Commission shortly."
"As regards the problem of access to basic services, a detailed analysis of the situation indicates that there are many different causes and that the impact differs from one place to another."
"The Commission intends monitoring closely the experiments under way in the Member States."
"Similar considerations would apply to excessive debt, and here I would suggest giving priority above all to measures designed to educate and inform consumers."
"Let me now move on to the vertical measures, Madam President."
"We shall shortly be proposing to the Commission a proposal for a directive on the distance selling of financial services; this is based on the provisions of the general directive that has already been adopted but takes account of the particular features of the financial services sector."
"This would protect consumers by according them, for instance, the right to a cooling-off period, where appropriate, and to information, and would also allow the industry to benefit from a market without frontiers which would otherwise be hampered by differing national legislation."
"As regards credit cards, pre-paid cards and home-banking, we are looking into the appropriateness of proposing legislative measures at this stage, given that the market is developing at a great pace - we have therefore to consider whether this is appropriate just now."
"An alternative solution could be substantially to revise the 1988 recommendation, extending it to cover new methods of payment and, possibly, following this up with more binding measures at a later stage."
"As regards those technological aspects which require special handling, while we accept that the suggestion is timely, we propose dealing with them on a sectoral basis."
"On the issue of mortgage credit, we agree that there needs to be a more detailed review - in particular on the point of transparency - before further measures are taken."
"The Commission has recently set under way a study, the results of which will be available by the summer of 1997."
"We therefore propose informing the House of the results of that study along with the necessary measures, if appropriate."
"In that context, we have also to bear in mind that all of the vertical measures involve some standardization of the financial products, and this would automatically lead to greater transparency of the markets but would also make it easier for operators to reach agreements on prices, to the detriment of consumers."
"Finally, in response to the demand of the House for initiatives in the insurance sector, I have to say that the Commission will be proposing, by the summer, a directive to protect the victims of accidents that have occurred in a country other than their country of residence."
"I shall conclude with a number of rapid comments on points raised during the debate: in the area of bonus-malus , the Commission has already opened infringement proceedings; on the point of fiscal harmonization I fully endorse what was said in the Marinucci report and, as you will perhaps be aware, as Commissioner with responsibility for taxation, I have launched an effort to make the measures designed to coordinate taxation more effective, and that is something which will certainly affect the financial institutions also; it is our intention that completion of the internal market will be momentous and will be geared towards those who are its end-users, namely consumers themselves."
"The Commission has undertaken to submit an action plan for the completion of the single market in time for the Amsterdam European Council."
"Particular emphasis will be placed on the services sector, including financial services, and we believe that all this benefits consumers."
"As you will remember, the Commission does not hesitate to propose legislative measures when they seem appropriate and beneficial to consumers."
"The most recent examples of this have been the guarantee of bank deposits, the guarantee on investments - on which agreement, I am pleased to say, has just been reached - the directive that has been approved on cross-border payments and the new measures we have today announced in the House."
"Firstly, Madam President: did I understand correctly that there is shortly to be legislation on financial services and distance selling?"
"Can you confirm that?"
"How soon is shortly?"
"Secondly, concerning payment cards: I know that our fellow-parliamentarians who addressed this matter in the eighties together with business and industry made a heartfelt plea to us for legislation."
"I find the Commissioner is rather reticent about that."
"Can he tell us a little more?"
"Madam President, I should like to thank the Commissioner for his very clear statement of what the Commission is committed to doing."
"I largely share his point of view but I wonder why we should defer the question of credit cards given that they have now become common currency."
"We know that another recommendation would have more or less the same effect as the last one."
"I do not understand why further evaluation is needed here."
"While I appreciate the need in regard to other issues, where there is perhaps need for reflection, I do not understand the need for it here."
"On the matter of the general good also, is it sufficient to draw up a communication and then wait still further?"
"This too seems to me to be an issue on which the time is ripe."
"I am very grateful for the information on the forthcoming proposal for a directive on the distance selling of financial services and hope that this will in fact come into being quickly."
"I am grateful to both honourable Members for their questions which give me an opportunity to provide specific details."
"As regards the legislation on the distance selling of financial services, I have already said that we believe this to be a useful measure and can tell you that we are aiming to submit it by September 1997."
"On the issue of the new methods of payment: we intend to take action."
"We are assessing - responsibly, I think, given that these are such new developments - the best way of doing this."
"I wish simply to point out that this matter is the focus of particular attention, including by the banking supervisory authorities."
"New methods of payment may involve problems of stability and security which may conflict with the contrasting needs of competition."
"And so, from the point of view of the consumer also - and, as I believe I have made clear, we attach great priority to consumers - there are cases in which it is not clear which is the best solution because while consumers certainly have an interest in markets with a high level of competition, they also have an interest in financial instruments and methods of payment that are extremely stable and secure."
"We are assessing the best way of balancing out these - at times conflicting - interests."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Union policy towards Algeria"
"The next item is the Council statement on Union policy towards Algeria, followed by a debate."
"Madam President, I am very grateful to the European Parliament for this chance to explain the Council's position on the crisis in Algeria, because the Council fully shares the European Parliament's concern at the situation in Algeria and is watching events there carefully."
"Just the night before last 33 inhabitants of a village south of Algiers were murdered."
"According to press reports the victims included eight women and two four-year-old children."
"The sharp increase in violence alarms us greatly."
"Both sides are waging the political struggle remorselessly and it has been going on for years now."
"Since the beginning of this year more than 350 people have already been killed who had nothing to do with the political conflict."
"Many of them women and children."
"They were dispatched without any form of legal process."
"We read such things almost daily in the papers."
"The random killing of innocent civilians by way of intimidation or political reprisal has constantly shocked the Council and always will."
"Such attacks are not only amoral but senseless."
"Support for islamic fundamentalism has not noticeably increased as a result, rather the opposite."
"The Council retains its faith in the efforts of the current Algerian leadership to control the crisis and continue along the road to democracy which it has begun."
"In its contacts with the Algerian leadership the Council unceasingly and repeatedly expresses its concern at the situation."
"It also makes the point that precisely a country with which a new association agreement is being prepared can be expected to manage a crisis like this one with wisdom and restraint."
"International human rights organizations have pointed to human rights abuses in Algeria, on the part of the Government too."
"The European Parliament has also criticized the way in which Algeria deals with islamic fundamentalism."
"The Council is aware of this and will not shrink from urging the Algerian Government to adopt a controlled approach to the crisis."
"In so doing it must not, I repeat not, overstep the mark on human rights."
"The speedy conclusion of an association agreement with Algeria may be a favourable political factor in that country's efforts to restore law and order and democracy."
"The Council thus hopes that the Commission will be able to bring the negotiations which have just started to a satisfactory conclusion within the near future."
"This association agreement will after all offer the European Union the chance of a structured political dialogue with Algeria and in the context of that we can raise the question of the Algerian Government's human rights policy with it."
"The only way out of the crisis seems to be for Algeria to hold fast to its policy of a return to democracy, to legitimate government."
"The Algerian Government has already taken a number of important steps in that direction."
"For example the 1995 presidential elections and the 1996 change to the constitution."
"The Council is expressly urging Algeria to complete by the end of 1997 a next step in this vital series of measures leading to democratic legitimation, namely the holding of general elections."
"To conclude, Madam President, in the Council's view Algeria still deserves international trust and support, especially from the European Union, in its efforts to overcome this deep and serious crisis."
"It is not merely in the economic interest of both sides that this European support should still be forthcoming."
"It is also part of the spirit of political partnership which must inform our cooperation with Algeria."
"That spirit is evident in the Union's efforts towards an association agreement with Algeria."
"It reflects the desire of all of us for cooperation with the Mediterranean region as part of the so-called ʼBarcelona process'."
"This desire for dialogue does not mean unconditional support."
"Quite the contrary, we are equipping ourselves with instruments which will enable us to be both critical and constructive."
"And I am convinced that the Council will persevere wisely with its present course as long as the Algerian crisis continues."
"This course comprises two essential elements."
"One: the maintenance of European faith in and European support for Algeria and the Algerian Government in their efforts to give a stronger democratic legitimacy to the administration."
"Two: the continuance of pressure for that democratization and better respect for human rights."
"Only in this way does the Council believe that the European Union can contribute to a lasting solution of the crisis in Algeria."
"So the Council takes a long-term view."
"That view is as follows: the Algerians must resolve the crisis themselves by means of a return to democratic national government and by continuing economic structural adjustments."
"And to this end the European Union gave Algeria 125 million ECU at the end of December 1996."
"The European Commission recently appointed a new delegate to Algeria."
"Talks on the association agreement are ongoing."
"High-level political contacts are held regularly."
"The Europeans are standing by Algeria."
"Cooperation continues."
"Madam President, we are talking today about Algeria and quite rightly, in my Group's opinion, since Algeria is a frightening example of a very deep-rooted social conflict which we see elsewhere too, the secular state clashing with violent fundamentalist groupings."
"The situation is demoralizing and seems hopeless."
"Dozens more people have lost their lives in the last few days."
"The present Government has not yet managed to stamp out the violence and there seems to be no political solution to the conflict in sight."
"Algeria look set to become a kind of North African Yugoslavia."
"Moderate groups have no chance in the battle going on between the Government and the armed islamic groups."
"We naturally condemn the attacks in the strongest terms, but at the same time find it hard to give unequivocal support to the Algerian Government."
"It still has a credibility problem."
"There can be no unconditional support, as the President said just now."
"What counts is to isolate the terrorists completely."
"It is easy to agree on that, but the Algerian Government cannot do it by itself."
"National dialogue, with a place for everyone and elections in which all peaceful parties can take part, are needed to achieve that objective."
"The Government has taken a few steps along that road and must continue, with encouragement from the Union."
"The people of Algeria must again have a chance to make their views heard."
"The elections must be free and safe."
"What, for example, is the Algerian Government doing here to persuade those parties which do not want to cooperate?"
"Whether or not the elections can succeed is one of the big questions."
"The European Union can at least try to further this process of dialogue and elections and I think the Algerian Government would welcome it; we can stimulate national dialogue, insist on room for a civil society, on fair elections with maximum participation and fair terms for all, and where problems arise the Union must not hesitate to offer itself as a mediator."
"The Algerian Government does not always seem able to make bridges to large sections of the public."
"Until it can, it is impossible to isolate the terrorists totally and find the way back to a more peaceful society."
"The EU should take action as outlined in the compromise resolution now before us, in the form of collective measures by the Union, a signal that the EU takes its relations with the region seriously and does not back away from serious problems."
"Unanimous action by the Union is needed and collective measures like this are an excellent basis for it."
"The question is whether the Union, the Dutch presidency, will have to courage to go for it."
"Let us hope so, because the region will never be really safe if the Union avoids this kind of problem, this kind of wasp's nest, and it is at the same time a stern test of the Union's human rights policy and its efforts to integrate human rights into its strategy for the Mediterranean region."
"Mr President, I listened to your statement with a fair degree of astonishment."
"You spoke of trust in the Algerian Government, but you overlooked the fact that Mr Zeroual was only recently talking about extermination."
"If that is a basis for trust, I am quite astounded."
"You also said that reforms have taken place."
"I am absolutely convinced that virtually no reforms have been implemented yet."
"There is one thing you must not forget, Mr President-in-Office: it takes two to live in peace, but only one to start a war."
"In this case it is not right to pick and choose negotiating partners either, as Mr Zeroual does; on the contrary, a statesman must speak to everyone."
"This means being open and accommodating."
"Allowing religion to influence these matters is not entirely helpful."
"It must not be forgotten that many occurrences are ascribable to the feeling of despair that arose from the democratic elections simply being cancelled because their result did not please the potentates, who are noted, moreover, for their corrupt practices."
"That simply must not be forgotten, Mr President."
"That is why we must be clear about something else too."
"Terrorism is a consequence of many sins that have been committed."
"Since the French moved out of Algeria, there has been one dictatorship after another."
"There has been no democracy, and what they call democracy today operates like this: parties are declared to be democratic and selected to take part in the elections, while the Algerian people are not allowed to present the parties of their choice."
"We must therefore consider the situation as it really is and be absolutely clear about the fact that it is high time to consider the basic principles of peace here."
"We regard peace and reconciliation in Algeria as vitally important."
"We said that in Barcelona."
"We say it again and again."
"But it will never be achieved if we only support one side, criticizing it mildly, perhaps, but not demanding the fundamental prerequisite of democracy, namely that all parties be allowed to take part in the elections on a basis of equal rights and opportunities."
"We must therefore follow an unequivocal political line here."
"A second aspect, Mr President-in-Office, is that we shall not succeed on our own."
"The European Union is far too weak to take real action at the present time."
"Let us not forget that we have already ruined our reputation as it is in Bosnia and elsewhere."
"The plain fact is that we are regarded by many as a paper tiger."
"We should therefore be trying to ensure that other forces join us in the peacemaking venture in Algeria."
"It could be the Arab League, which was mentioned in our resolution."
"It could be the Organization of African Unity."
"We shall not manage it alone, so if we are serious in our intent, we must make a concerted effort with other bodies."
"There is something else we should not forget."
"There is such a thing as a brave pursuit of peace."
"We saw it with General de Gaulle."
"He succeeded. He was prepared to speak to his adversaries, and that led to the solution which undoubtedly resulted in certain benefits for France too, painful though it may have been for the French people."
"I have visited Algeria many times, and I know what that meant to the French people, including those who lived in Algeria, but we have a responsibility towards that country."
"We are in a Community with the Mediterranean region, and the path you have described to us, Mr President, will certainly not lead to peace."
"We must apply quite different principles, and that is the purpose of our resolution."
"Madam President, President of the Council, it is not without some outrage that I speak today in this context to denounce yet again the fresh outbreak of blind terrorism experienced by Algeria these past few hours."
"I would like to send a message of solidarity to all those who are fighting, in peril of their lives, against terrorism, for the enforcement of democratic rights and respect for human persons."
"I am thinking in particular of women and children."
"The situation in Algeria preoccupies all Western democracies who are seeking positive dialogue whilst respecting cultural differences."
"The European Union is searching for an association agreement with Algeria, wishing to establish structured political dialogue."
"Last December, the European Parliament already voted on a resolution concerning Algeria, which the UPE group neither signed nor voted on."
"This resolution certainly had the effect of irritating President Zeroual and sowing the seeds of misunderstanding between the European Parliament and this country."
"Why do we have to go through it again now?"
"What is new that has not been evoked in this context?"
"The new important element which would justify further statements of opinion is the start of an electoral process, the exact dates of which have not been decided but are expected to be at the end of May, beginning of June."
"Discussions have been undertaken with all the parties, except the FFS."
"All the parties have let it be known that they would take part in the elections."
"In the face of this situation, how can the European Parliament play a positive role?"
"Certainly not by relaying the declarations of one or another party."
"Even less by posing as lesson-giver through resolutions which risk reducing dialogue between members of Parliament and Algeria, with the issue of successive resolutions which lead to negative reactions."
"This is not the wish of our group, UPE, whose desire it is to respect and consider as responsible the declarations of the political authorities of Italy, Spain and France, and also those of the United States, which refuse to practice political interference disguised as mediation."
"That we, as members of Parliament, are concerned about the situation is normal."
"But for goodness' sake let us keep to our own place."
"Let us plainly condemn terrorism and violence."
"Let us support the successful performance of the electoral process so that it may take place with complete transparency."
"Let us take part in the observation missions organized for this purpose, so that the result of this electoral consultation cannot be contested by anyone and democracy can finally be installed in Algeria, favouring the re-establishment of peace."
"We are replying today to the invitation of the Council, which desired a debate on Algeria."
"Does this initiative have to lead to a resolution, or would we prefer to invite the Algerian Foreign Affairs Minister, who holds bilateral dialogue with our countries, to come to talk to our own Foreign Affairs Committee, and answer questions posed by the members of Parliament?"
"It is not by voting on resolutions such as that put forward today to our vote that we will encourage a climate of meetings and dialogue."
"So my group will not vote in favour of this resolution."
"Like the Council, we say that Algeria deserves confidence and critical support."
"Madam President, this year Ramadan will have been one of the most murderous in the history of Algeria."
"Over 300 Algerians, men, women and children, have died."
"The GIA promised terror... it has certainly kept its word."
"Nevertheless, the Algerian authorities do not appear to be unduly concerned about this terrorism, which they qualify as 'residual' ."
"The dirty war thus continues with its procession of victims, for the most part civilians."
"The constitution of armed militia by the authorities is tending to precipitate the infernal cycle of vengeance and to lead inexorably towards civil war."
"The spiral of violence which Algeria is experiencing is allowing the authorities to justify and consolidate the legislation of exception which it has introduced."
"Since the end of Ramadan, press accounts issued during these last few days have recorded over 200 deaths."
"The methods used by the armed groups are becoming more extreme; entire villages are thus being burned down and their inhabitants are suffering the most abject barbarism that can be imagined."
"The population lives in permanent anguish, threatened either by bombs in the towns, or by massacres in the villages."
"The resolution passed here by our Parliament last December was, it is true, severely condemned by the Algerian authorities."
"I am sorry, and we are sorry, as all we did was denounce the atrocities whose victims are the Algerian people, this people who rejects violence and wishes to live freely and in dignity, this people who, more than any other, aspires to peace, freedom and democracy."
"To regain peace and eradicate the terrorism which rages in Algeria, the government must establish dialogue with all the democratic opposition."
"The European Council will have to assume its responsibilities and take part in the negotiations which will allow Algeria to go towards truly democratic elections, next June."
"The good mark accorded to the Algerian team by the Commissioner Mr Marín seems to be to be rather naive in the current political and social context."
"And with reason: the new law passed yesterday by the national Council of transition aims to harden the conditions of creation of political parties; all references to religion, language or region are prohibited."
"The social climate is not ceasing to deteriorate, over one quarter of the population is unemployed, and naturally the young are the most affected."
"Entire families have nothing to eat, for lack of decent incomes."
"For all these reasons, the Council and the Commission must be excessively vigilant with regard to allocating aid."
"The Euro-Mediterranean agreement must be targeted on development projects and projects which recognize the important role of women."
"The European Union must aim to support an economic transformation of Algeria, so that it can change from a State-controlled and oil-dependent economy to a more diversified economy with more emphasis on the private sector."
"This aid must be accompanied by conditions to be met with regard to fundamental human rights."
"Although it is true that it is not possible to imagine the construction of a democratic State without freedom of expression - as declared by Mr Zeroual - the Council must exert pressure so that the censure on information in the field of security may be lifted."
"The new draft law on the press which the government is preparing to introduce aims to muzzle the press."
"It is unacceptable for fundamental human rights - which include indefeasibly freedom of expression and consequently freedom of the press - to be called into question."
"Although I can understand the difficulties facing the Algerian government, I cannot accept that, every day, civilians pay with their lives for this violence which unfortunately has become established in Algeria."
"We must help the Algerian government and people to reinstate well-deserved peace."
"It is also a matter of our credibility."
"Madam President, the terror which has befallen Algeria is constantly crossing new thresholds of atrocity."
"In contempt of all civilized values, murder, rape and massacres are increasing, barbarism is becoming established."
"By means of the most horrible crimes, fanatical groups are opening the way to power to an obscurantist system which crushes all freedom and punishes by death those who do not submit."
"We must not hide our faces, that is the point."
"I would like to express the full and complete solidarity of our group with the Algerian people, and in particular Algerian women who suffer absolute martyrdom and reject the unacceptable."
"We must help the Algerian people, without setting ourselves up as lesson-givers."
"It is an entirely democratic, humanistic duty."
"Unfortunately it is not the direction our Parliament would take by passing the draft joint resolution of certain groups, which we strongly oppose."
"Firstly, the condemnation of terrorism must be total, not only with regard to the perpetrators of the crimes committed, but also with regard to those who finance and justify them."
"Placing all the parties involved in this conflict on the same footing, as in point 8, is to consider the murderers as political interlocutors."
"That is unacceptable, as are the presence and activity in broad daylight of some of these financial partners in the Member States."
"These networks must be dismantled."
"We can thus help the Algerian people by encouraging the dialogue currently engaged with the political and social forces which condemn terrorism, so that legislative elections may be held and favour the process of transition."
"The Member States and the European Union should effectively support the eonomic recovery of Algeria."
"The opening of negotiations for an association agreement can help, provided we go beyond the free trade logic which too frequently characterizes relations between the European Union and its external partners."
"Thus, we must remove the structural obstacles to development, which are the debt and intolerable financial constraints imposed by international financial institutions."
"These matters cannot continue to be considered as tabooed by our countries and the Union."
"At all events, the right of the Algerian people to decide its future for itself, with no foreign interference, is not only an intangible principle but also a guarantee of efficacy for any solution."
"Madam President, when horror reaches such a degree, reason often fails to accompany our actions. Here, we are behaving as if to give lessons was not our duty."
"With reason, we gave lessons on South Africa."
"With reason, we are giving lessons on Turkey."
"And if we wished to give lessons on Algeria, well, we are giving lessons on Algeria."
"Let us stop lying to each other."
"Representative of the Council, stop, in your naivety, which is the naivety of French foreign policy, saying: ' Everything is fine in Algeria - things are going in the right direction' ."
"A book has just been published, by Graham Fuller, who was the former CIA official for the Middle East, in which he explains that American policy aims for victory by the FIS."
"I would like to know what Western and democratic countries want in Algeria."
"There is the same political framework as in Afghanistan, where the Americans played the integrists, with the broken pots we know about."
"On the other hand, it is clear that we are on the side of the Algerian victims and people."
"It is clear that we condemn religious integrist terrorism."
"But it is clear that Mr Zeroual's government will not take Algeria out of the rut it has fallen into."
"That is our problem."
"Let us stop lying."
"When we now say we would like a solution involving dialogue, we must obviously ask the so-called Islamic organizations to condemn, not only politically but also morally, the use of terrorism."
"But it should also be said that the Islamic family code was introduced by the FLN, that Mr Zeroual's government maintains the Islamic family code, that Mr Zeroual's government also wants an Islamic state."
"That is the terror of Islamic terrorism."
"Why am I saying this?"
"Because I believe that we should push each other towards a certain laicity."
"We should push each other in a certain direction, and this means dialogue between murderers."
"Because some, I do not say all the government, but some of the institutions of the Algerian state are sheltering murderers, as on the other side there are murderers."
"In this dramatic and difficult situation, there is no easy solution."
"Does the FIS have to participate in the elections?"
"I do not know."
"Should it be excluded?"
"I am not sure."
"But if we do not move in the direction of democratic dialogue with a special European envoy, we will come to grief."
"We must give lessons in politics to all those who dream of a society that does not exist in Algeria."
"Madam President, in Algeria, in a few months, a few thousand people have been killed either by murderers who adorn themselves with the tawdry finery of Islam, or by solders transformed into executioners."
"Several years of this regime have led the Algerian people to a state of absolute despair, but the time has nevertheless come to recall the contents of the texts signed by the Algerian government in Barcelona, in 1995, on the exercise of fundamental freedoms and human rights."
"The signing of an association agreement between the European Union and Algeria is on the agenda."
"Parliament must render its attitude strictly subject to the guarantees the Algerian authorities will give with regard to keeping the promises they have made."
"I am not sure that we have to give lessons!"
"At all events, my country, which already has many towns in the hands of racists and xenophobes, would be in a particularly bad position for doing so."
"Instead let us be glad to see an electoral consultation take form on the horizon in the next few months."
"But a previous disturbing interruption of voting somewhat darkens this horizon."
"It remains that a sort of rationing for access of candidates must be avoided."
"All the political forces which oppose violence, which refuse to approve, excuse or 'understand' it, must be the recipient in this political battle."
"As regards the conference which would bring together all the parties concerned, it is probably premature and a cessation of the massacres would probably follow talks held protected from the eyes of the press."
"With regard to the proposal of mediation that could help the Algerians emerge from the drama which is tearing them apart, it arouses considerable emotion, especially among those who consider such a proposal as imperialistic, colonial, what do I know?"
"It should be said to all anti-colonial and anti-imperial supporters - among whom I count myself - that by force of being held back by blame or a guilty conscience, we should therefore accept that, as in Bosnia or the Middle East, a special envoy of the President of the United States should take the place that we have not had the courage to occupy."
"Madam President, Algeria continues to offer us a devastating spectacle of daily barbarism."
"The multiplication of armed groups places national unity in peril."
"The confrontations between progovernment militia and armed integrist groups maintain a permanent climate of violence in both urban and rural environments, which is ruining and discouraging efforts of development."
"A country which has all the necessary assets for achieving a rise similar to that of Asian countries is spoiling its chances and squandering its assets."
"What can Europe do to help the reconstruction of the Algerian nation?"
"Firstly reaffirm, very clearly, its desire for the survival of Algeria as a State."
"We have nothing positive to expect from a disintegration of the unified Algerian State."
"Within the Arab world, sound States constitute the best possible counterweights against the propagation of an Islamic fundamentalism which generates instability."
"No one will gain advantage from Algeria sinking into a 'hundred year war' and forming, on our southern border, an area of long-lasting instability."
"Instead each of our countries has an interest in that it should emerge from chaos, even if in a fumbling manner, and become a stable pole, organizing its development in partnership with us."
"The development of Algeria and better mastery of migration phenomena are unquestionably linked."
"Secondly, it is best to avoid anything that can feed civil war."
"In particular, avoid irresponsible interference, partisan gesticulations or irrelevant parliamentary resolutions which each Algerian faction immediately hastens to turn to its advantage."
"It would be the worst possible service we could render Algeria to give the impression that we are with one camp rather than another."
"We do not have to take the place of the Algerians to determine their fate."
"What we can do, if necessary, is to help ensure that the forthcoming legislative elections are as incontestable as possible, so that political confrontation replaces armed confrontation."
"We can also propose cooperation principally orientated, within the framework of the association agreement, in favour of reconstituting the social fabric, so that Algeria can one day have the intermediary bodies and mediation authorities necessary for the operation of a democracy."
"Madam President, so the House is trying once again to take a position on the civil war in Algeria."
"What will it lead to?"
"Nothing."
"Because a text of this Parliament will have condemned violence, denounced terrorism - blind, of course, as if terrorism were anything but blind! - denounced infringements of human rights, called on democratic elections and dialogue between all parties and expressed its support for democratic forums, will the number of deaths decrease in Algeria?"
"No one is deceived and, in particular, none of the signatories of this text, nor you, Mr Cohn-Bendit and Mr Kouchner, nor the self-proclaimed intellectuals, brought together at the Mutualité by solidarity with the Algerian people."
"You know well that the calls issued from Boulevard Saint-German in Paris or from this floor will not save a single Algerian life."
"On the other hand, it is our compatriots who are risking to pay with their lives for some remarks whose only effect is to increase the fervour of the Algerian terrorists, both those of the Islamic opposition and those of the military power, already active in our urban centres."
"But bombs do not concern those who do not travel either by RER or by metro."
"In actual fact, some wish to redeem themselves for behaviour in that which stands instead of conscience, media opinion."
"They are often the same who, in 1980, partisans of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, of the Vietcong in Vietnam, Maoists converted in the 'New Philosophy' , the press, show business, advertising, signed petitions in favour of the 'boat people' , victims of their ideology."
"They carry a fairly high responsibility in the misfortunes of Algeria, which do not go back to 1992, but to 1962."
"Some of our colleagues - is it not so, Mr Rocard? - have devoted their youth to supporting the FLN terrorists!"
"In 1962, did they not bear witness to the 3, 000 Algerian-born French people deported to the FLN death camps, the 150, 000 harka members scalded, buried alive, emasculated, dismembered by their friends!"
"Did they show one hundredth of the compassion they now show for the Nomenklatura fellaga ?"
"I remember Melouza, I remember all these crimes against humanity... but who will judge these crimes against humanity?"
"It is true that the victims were French and that the French are subhuman and do not have the right to justice or to the court of History."
"In defence of the latter, it could be said that they were not the only ones."
"All the governments of the Vth Republic, after delivering French Algeria to the killers of the FLN, did not stop supporting the Algerian dictators from Ben Bella to Zeroual."
"This support cost dearly."
"In 1962, our compatriots were led to believe that the withdrawal of our nation from the frontiers of France would have the advantage of relieving them of the burden of Algeria."
"Untrue!"
"This burden has become crushing."
"By the million, Algerians are leaving the poverty which engulfs their country."
"Each year, we are paying tens of thousands of million francs to the Zeroual nomenklatura , which only gives us spit in return and now even prohibits the teaching of French in Algerian schools."
"In January 1992, our leaders took part in the Algerian civil war, supporting the military coup d'état which quashed the first free elections."
"Our country has been gradually dragged into this conflict."
"At the time, we were the only ones in the House to point out the dangers of such a position."
"What should we do now?"
"In the first instance, protect the nationals of our States."
"In the short term, our governments - and the French government in particular - must stop supporting the faction which is currently in power, prevent the arrival of Algerian nationals and re-establish order in districts harbouring terrorist networks."
"For the rest, you do not know what to do, and moreover you cannot do anything."
"Madam President, no one with the slightest concern about human rights can possibly be other than horrified by the savage murders and devastating atrocities perpetrated in Algeria over the course of the last five years."
"Let us at least agree on that."
"Every day brings new massacres like the thirty-three villagers beheaded to which Mr Patijn referred."
"Schoolgirls have been murdered for refusing to wear a veil."
"Trade unionists have been killed like the leader of the General Workers Union."
"Innocent people are targeted."
"In this Parliament we surely are going to condemn that out of hand and condemn all those who support it."
"It is said that some of these people receive funds from Iran and other fundamentalists centres in the Middle East and that there are people in Europe who are supporting them."
"We must take whatever action we can to oppose terrorism of that kind. The Algerian Government must of course recognise that it cannot underestimate the immense importance of upholding democratic values and human rights if it is not to alienate those who oppose fundamentalism but believe in freedom and democracy."
"We welcome the proposals to hold elections later this year."
"It is vital that everything possible should be done in the difficult circumstances which prevail to enable all genuinely democratic forces to participate."
"That is not the position yet."
"In the long run, however, we must recognise in the European Union, as well as elsewhere, that people in the developing countries throughout the world are being driven towards support for intolerant and violent movements by the experience of increasing poverty and deprivation."
"Neo-liberal economics which result in more unemployment and hopelessness will bring in new recruits for fundamentalism and other intolerant creeds and fan the flames of terrorism and violence."
"Only by achieving better living standards for all can we provide the conditions for the advance of democracy and human rights which we all support and I hope that also will be borne very much in mind by the Council."
"Madam President, for quite a long time now European citizens have been horrified - and that word has been used quite a lot in this debate - by events in a country very close to the southern countries of Europe, and as a Spaniard I am particularly aware of that."
"The terrorists in Algeria are knifing hundreds of innocent citizens almost daily, including women, children and journalists, as the President of the Council has mentioned."
"We cannot keep silent in the face of such barbarity as human beings, let alone as politicians."
"But it also requires a very cool head and considerable objectivity, prudence and wisdom to grasp the complex problem it raises."
"Algeria is a Maghreb country, and like all the Maghreb countries, its political, economic, social and cultural development has special features which should not be forgotten."
"Countries like Spain, Italy and France, which are close geographically and in terms of their economic and social inter-relationships, are especially sensitive to the vagaries of the events taking place there, and hence they affect the interests of the European Union as a whole very directly."
"The Euro-Mediterranean Conference is a good forum for extending the search for solutions contributing to the stability of a zone which affects us all."
"The policy of assisting the economic and social development of those countries is intelligent and right, because the spread of fanaticism and violence has economic roots in underdevelopment and real misery and hunger."
"Furthermore, everything that can contribute to its political development, in terms of technical support and observation of its electoral processes and in the sphere of dialogue with the government, which has to deal with the terrorist violence, will undoubtedly contribute to bringing that country closer to the democratic culture and respect for human rights espoused by western countries."
"The European Union cannot turn its back on what is going on in Algeria at this moment."
"A great deal is at stake."
"The Council must bring forward initiatives which foster understanding and dialogue between the political and democratic forces in that country and cooperate in the fight against terrorism, which is unfortunately being transmitted to our own European soil."
"Finally, the European Union must play an active role to avoid projecting the poor image it has had in other conflicts very close to us in time and space."
"Madam President, the citizens of Algeria will only be able to live together in peace when the terrorist crimes have ceased and the process of democratic transition has been restarted."
"This calls for a dialogue between the representative political forces which can isolate the men of violence and allow a free and pluralist general election to be held."
"That is the direction European Union action and, of course, this Parliament's support, should take, rather than the one proposed in the resolution. We should work towards an agreement with Algeria, which would benefit both parties, contribute to solving the socio-economic problems of that country, for example massive youth unemployment, and promote full respect for human rights of both men and women."
"To end the Algerian tragedy, it is essential to guarantee the stability of the Maghreb and the Mediterranean, a priority objective for Europeans and even more so for neighbouring countries like Spain."
"Because, Madam President, it would be quite wrong to see European action in Algeria as an exclusively French issue."
"France has political responsibilities, but the first group of speeches in this sitting have shown that we too have the right and indeed the duty to speak."
"Madam President, what is at stake in Algeria is the safety of the people, and also respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, the stability of the Mediterranean basin and the future of EuroMediterranean policy."
"The European Union cannot remain silent, powerless and passive in the face of the dramatic events that are taking place in that country."
"We must first of all denounce the blind violence in which the Islamic terrorists are indulging, the daily massacres, the cars exploding in the streets of towns, the systematic massacre of journalists, intellectuals, of all those who commit the crime of wishing to think freely. But we must also denounce with equal vigour the violence and infringements of human rights committed by the security forces."
"The legitimacy enjoyed by the power following the presidential elections does not make all the means it uses also legitimate."
"Barbarism should never be answered with barbarism."
"That said, it would be dangerous to class together scandalous extortion, which must be denounced, committed by the authorities and the criminal fanaticism of the integrists."
"The sometimes scandalous behaviour of the authorities must not incite us to showing more complaisance towards the Islamic terrorists."
"The democrats must also be supported."
"One often forgets that there are democrats in Algeria."
"I am sure that they represent the majority of the Algerian people."
"These democrats are unfortunately divided, which is a factor of weakness, but they all lead the same courageous fight against the power at the risk of their lives, also against the Islamics."
"We must therefore show them our solidarity and give them our support."
"We must urge the Algerian government very strongly to finally open a dialogue without second thoughts, with all the democrats in Algeria and all the politicians and groups which would agree to renounce violence."
"Finally, we must announce our confidence in the Algerian people."
"Many Algerians today despair of their country."
"They see no future at the end of the road of pain and suffering."
"We must help Algerians to believe in Algeria, to be aware of Algeria's assets, as Algeria does have assets. First of all the quality of the men - and especially the women - who are fighting often with admirable courage."
"In May 1992, I had a long conversation with President Boudiaf."
"He told me his dream of making Algeria the leading Muslim country which, without renouncing its roots - all its roots - could become both a democracy and a nonreligious country."
"A few days later, President Boudiaf was assassinated."
"I believe that we must help the Algerians represent Mr Boudiaf's dream on their own behalf and make it a reality."
"Madam President, Mr President of the Council, despite the parliamentary respect you are entitled to receive from me and the respect I accord to the fine parliamentary speeches - flamboyant, emotional, stirring speeches - that we have heard this afternoon in this debate, with all due respect I do not think this is what is needed in Algeria now."
"What is needed is effective policy, no more, no less."
"We need to help."
"And we need to be capable of knowing how to help in the right way."
"Last Ramadan indeed resulted in an escalation of violence and terror."
"Faced with that we must condemn the massacre - and we do. We must also combat it with all the weapons at our disposal."
"Mr President of the Council, the next general election must become a genuine step forward towards democracy and peace."
"And for that to happen I have two suggestions."
"The first is for Algerian women to play an important political role in the future."
"Efforts must be made in that direction."
"It is possible and it will be effective."
"Algerian women should lead civil and political society in that country."
"And the Algerian people will support this aim."
"The second proposal is for the European Union to join forces with Algeria to provide some minimum guarantees of safety and freedom at the next elections."
"That is the kind of action we need."
"Mr President of the Council, the motion for a resolution the European Parliament is going to adopt also makes positive points which need to be taken into account."
"Since 11 February, President Zerual and the representatives of the various political forces have been involved in the necessary dialogue we are calling for, and that is an encouraging sign."
"Sending observers to the next general election is another positive signal."
"I repeat, we must act effectively."
"Let us do so."
"Madam President, I am grateful to all those who have spoken for their blunt and unconditional condemnation of terror and mindless violence."
"But I think that the great majority of speakers also advocated continuing our cooperation with Algeria and I should like to stress the importance of that again."
"The peoples of the European Union and Algeria are, if you like, ʼcondemned' to work together."
"For reasons of geography, for reasons of history and for social and humanitarian reasons."
"And from the European point of view we do that with total respect for the cultural and religious traditions of our North African friends and total repudiation of the fundamentalists' abuse of those traditions."
"The Council remains willing to work with the present Algerian Government provided we are convinced that it is working to restore democracy and better respect for human rights."
"We thus call on the Government to hold elections in 1997 and to make them open and free."
"For our part I repeat that the European Union is prepared, as part of its Mediterranean policy, to give structural aid on a longterm basis for the social and economic development of the Algerian people under a bilateral cooperation agreement."
"Thank you very much, Mr President-in-Office."
"I should like to inform the House that I have received six motions for resolutions under Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Question Time (Council)"
"The next item is Question Time to the Council (B4-0001/97)."
"Question No 1 by Wayne David (H-1026/96)"
"Subject: Police treatment of Sonia Esmeralda Gomez Guevara and Carmen Velasquez"
"Is the European Council aware of reports by Amnesty International concerning two Guatemalan girls, Sonia Esmeralda Gomez Guevara and Carmen Velasquez?"
"It is alleged that the two girls were detained on the 18th street in Guatemala City, accused by three uniformed men of being street children."
"The men apparently threatened the girls by saying that they would be arrested for marijuana possession if they did not go with them to the police station."
"En route, the girls were dragged into a back alley and, allegedly, Sonia was raped by two of the three men."
"To date, I have received no reply to my correspondence from either the President of Guatemala or the Guatemalan Embassy."
"Will the European Council inform the European Parliament how it intends to bring pressure to bear on the Guatemalan government on the issue of street children in particular and on human rights in general?"
"I should like to comment as follows on Mr Wayne David's question concerning the treatment by police of Sonia Esmeralda Gomez Guevara and Carmen Velasquez."
"The Council has not discussed the matter to which the honourable member refers."
"As he is aware the Council attaches great importance to human rights and fundamental freedoms."
"In the context of renewing the San José dialogue, to which Guatemala is a party, the promotion of human rights, including the issue of street children, is seen as a key objective which must be given priority in the European Union's relations with the countries of Central America."
"This is apparent too from the fact that the development cooperation programmes of the European Union and its Member States in Guatemala are aimed particularly at promoting human rights and providing information and training on human rights."
"I thank the President-in-Office very much indeed for that encouraging response."
"However, I wonder whether I could press him slightly further, and ask if he would explicitly state that, unless there is an improvement generally in the human rights situation, the European Union would consider withholding development aid funding?"
"Secondly, is the Council prepared to make any kind of representations concerning the specific case which I have cited in my question?"
"In view of recent political developments in Guatemala I wonder if now is the right time for the European Union to draw attention to political conditions there."
"I recall that very recently an important process of political reconciliation was completed there, something absolutely essential if democratic conditions are to be fully restored, and if human rights, including the rights of street children, are to be properly upheld, and in these circumstances there is little reason at present to do anything specific on behalf of the European Union."
"As part of the San José dialogue, which resumes in a few weeks' time, we shall of course raise this specific issue in the appropriate manner."
"Question No 2 by Felipe Camisón Asensio (H-1029/96)"
"Subject: Multilingual computerized services"
"What plans does the Council have to promote language diversity so as to encourage multilingual computerized services?"
"On 21 November 1996 the Council adopted a multiannual programme to promote linguistic diversity in the information society in the European Community which exactly meets the concerns of the honourable member."
"This programme, which has already begun and for which a total of 15 million ECU has been earmarked to be spread over three years, has the following objectives: firstly to encourage the use of technologies, aids and methods which will cut the cost of information transfer between languages and of developing multilingual services."
"Secondly, to further the growth of the language industries."
"Thirdly, to encourage the development of multilingual services."
"The Commission is responsible for implementing the programme and for coordinating it with the other programmes of the Community."
"I am delighted the Council has decided to boost all activities to facilitate the introduction of all its languages into electronic communications, but I have to remind you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that we are faced with an urgent operation which ought to be completed, if possible, even faster than the three years you have announced."
"It does not seem reasonable to continue with the current situation, where most or all computerized information services are offered exclusively in English, because that is an assault on the linguistic diversity of the Union, and an obstacle to the corresponding language industries, which are so important."
"The Council has told us today that it has made a budget of ECU 15 million available for the promotion of a programme of linguistic diversity within the Union."
"That is not much, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, but at least it is a start."
"I note that a series of objectives are mentioned - all of them are important, and naturally they include employment."
"But I want to draw attention to the fact that, in addition to this, there should be recognition of the importance of facilitating access for SMEs to this type of facility and reducing the conversion costs."
"I shall end, Mr President, by saying that all this is necessary because, unfortunately, the goal of a single language is not as close as the goal of a single currency."
"My thanks to the honourable member for prompting me on that."
"Coming as I do from a language region of 22 million people, rather smaller than your own, I understand your concern very well and I shall pass your comments on to the Council and Commission so that we can see if in the course of implementing this programme we can add some particular refinements."
"Question No 3 by Mihail Papayannakis (H-1030/96)"
"Subject: Convergence criteria and defence spending"
"The recent debate and commentaries concerning the 'criteria' set by the Treaty for the inclusion of individual Member States in EMU are a matter of particular interest."
"It has been increasingly suggested by many different, more or less official circles that the fulfilment of these criteria by each individual country is subject to a 'political interpretation', although the content of this 'political interpretation' varies from case to case."
"The Council has already formulated a policy on this matter, representing as far as possible a uniform view."
"Would it be possible, for instance, for a 'political' discussion and interpretation of this kind to cover the disproportionately high defence spending of one country (whose purpose is not to solve economic problems) if, for example, this spending accounted for a higher proportion of GNP than the average in the other Member States, so that at least the excess spending would not be taken into account in a 'political' evaluation of the progress of this country towards EMU?"
"My answer to Mr Papayannakis is as follows."
"Regarding the possibility to which the honourable member refers I must say for the record that under the current rules for EMU the convergence criteria are entirely clear."
"Defence spending usually counts just like other government spending when calculating the maximum deficit which must remain below 3 % of gross national product in every Member State, and if that level is exceeded it may mean the denial of access to stage three of EMU."
"Mr President, I do not know whether I understood the President-in-Office's answer correctly."
"Military expenditure is clearly public expenditure."
"There is no questioning that."
"Yet, in Dublin the following issue was discussed: that it could be debated whether the 3 % limit is being exceeded and whether that is permissible, since there are exceptional circumstances independent of the wishes of the Member State."
"It must be accepted that situations exist in which extraordinary military expenditure may be both exceptional and independent of the wishes of the Member State, especially when that expenditure is motivated by threats of force which are in any case internationally prohibited."
"So the question I asked the President-in-Office was to what extent, in such a situation, would it be possible to regard that kind of expenditure as a justification for exceeding the 3 %."
"I find the honourable member's whole case somewhat hypothetical."
"In principle I think we cannot, for the correct application of the convergence criteria for Economic and Monetary Union, really differentiate between categories of expenditure; spending is spending."
"Special extraneous circumstances are more concerned with special economic circumstances and not so much with external threats."
"Take my own country, for example."
"About half my country lies below sea level."
"But I do not expect special treatment on the convergence criteria because of the especially high costs of pumping out all that extra water."
"Question No 4 by Anne McIntosh (H-1033/96)"
"Subject: European Union measures to combat paedophilia"
"Will the Council outline the measures it proposes to take to ensure a common European Union approach to tackle the sexual exploitation of children, including measures that will ensure judicial cooperation between Member States in this area?"
"In view of the Council decision to agree to joint action to fight paedophilia, can it give further details on the multi-annual programme (1996-2000) for the training and exchange of persons involved in combating the problem?"
"In what ways does the Council envisage that its budget will be utilized?"
"Mrs McIntosh has asked an important question and I shall respond for the Council as follows."
"The European Council in Dublin expressed its abhorrence at the sexual exploitation of children and trafficking in human beings and undertook to take all necessary action against it."
"The European Council called on the Council and Commission to implement the measures agreed by the Council during the Irish presidency in an ongoing manner and to consult about the further measures required."
"As the Council previously indicated in earlier replies to the honourable member, the measures, some of which admittedly have not yet been formally adopted, aim to improve police and justice cooperation and they also relate to training."
"The measures are as follows."
"Firstly, a proposal by the Irish presidency to have trafficking in human beings included in the remit of the Europol drugs unit."
"Secondly, a Belgian proposal for a programme to encourage exchanges and training for persons in charge of measures to counter trafficking in human beings."
"This is the so-called STOP programme. It would need a budget of 6.5 million ECU."
"Thirdly, a proposal by the Belgian delegation and others to compile a list of experts and specialist bodies with a view to preventing trafficking in human beings."
"Fourthly, a Belgian proposal for a collective approach to the prevention of sexual exploitation of children and trafficking in human beings, together with measures for cooperation among Member States."
"The Council attaches great importance to the need to have these issues tackled swiftly and efficiently and the Dutch presidency will also give these things high priority."
"I thank the President-in-Office for his reply."
"My concern is that now in 1997 we are half way through the multiannual programme."
"It would be easier for us in the European Parliament to monitor this if we knew in some more detail what these measures are, as they are agreed."
"The President-in-Office referred to the work of the outgoing Irish presidency."
"Could he share with us his priorities during his tenure of office?"
"For example, the Irish President-in-Office was very keen on safe streets and proposed measures to make them safe for children as well as adults."
"I particularly welcome the cooperation we are going to see between the police and the courts, with an emphasis on training."
"I am particularly concerned that the Internet is being abused by both pornographers and paedophiles."
"If, for example, there is ever going to be a national register of known paedophiles within a Member State, would this also be shared between the other Member States' authorities?"
"Let me fill the honourable member in a bit."
"The motto of the Irish presidency was not just ʼsafe streets' but also ʼsound money'."
"I have taken due note of what she says."
"Please do not hold it against me if I cannot give you a precise answer at the present time, but I shall ask the Council, and notably the section of it which deals with justice and home affairs, to brief you later either in writing or verbally at a meeting with the Legal Affairs Committee on progress in the programme's implementation."
"I would like to return to the subject of the Internet."
"I am sure the Minister will agree with me that the Internet at the present time is still in its infancy."
"We know that paedophiles are using the Internet."
"Would the President-in-Office agree that this is the ideal moment to establish a European Union and, indeed, a worldwide code of conduct with mandatory ability to cut off sources which allow paedophile material to be accessed via the Internet?"
"This is an opportunity which we really ought to take and I hope the Minister can give us some concrete assurances in this regard."
"I share the honourable member's concern for efficient ways to tackle misuse of the Internet for the sexual exploitation of children and paedophilia."
"The Council of justice and home affairs ministers, and the telecommunications ministers too, are currently working on this."
"The main concern is to stop abuse by means of good national and international agreements and measures, but at the same time to prevent the huge economic potential of the Internet from being fragmented and weakened by a multiplicity of uncoordinated national measures."
"Question No 5 by Irini Lambraki (H-1036/96):"
"Subject: Funding Community action to deal with exceptional circumstances"
"Everyone knows that agricultural production is directly dependent on weather conditions and a number of other unforeseen factors."
"Effective measures to deal with the problems which arise from time to time - either from acts of God or from other causes, such as the recent case of BSE - often come up against the failure to provide the necessary appropriations in the budget."
"Does the Council consider that a mechanism should be created for tackling such exceptional circumstances, and what does it think of funding Community action by creating a specific line in the budget?"
"In reply to Mrs Lambraki I should say first of all that the European Community budget contains a number of headings under which emergency aid can be given to victims of natural disasters."
"They include heading B 4/3400, emergency aid to victims of disasters in the Community."
"Likewise all headings under Title B 5.2, which fund interest subsidies on loans for natural disasters occurring in the Community, and aid was provided under these to victims of the Italian earthquakes in November 1990 and Greece in March 1988 and September 1986 and of the hurricane in Madeira in 1993."
"We also have Title B 7.2, which covers food aid and humanitarian aid to population groups in the developing countries who are the victims of natural disasters or serious crises."
"In general and in line with the Treaty the Commission is responsible when drawing up the budget for proposing a level of budget appropriations as close as possible to anticipated needs."
"In the second place the recent BSE crisis has shown that the Community is reliably able to be flexible and to find the resources it needs to meet dramatic and unforeseen situations which cannot be categorized as natural disasters."
"The existing provisions and existing practices thus suggest that crises such as the BSE affair can be absorbed perfectly well."
"So I do not believe it is necessary to have large sums in reserve at all times to meet possible unforeseen emergencies."
"Mr President, I would agree with the President-in-Office if I had not scrutinized the lines to which he referred."
"Line B4, Mr President-in-Office, involves not a single ECU."
"Title B5 which you mentioned relates to specific cases of natural disasters, such as earthquakes, which happened in the past."
"It does not apply to the present."
"Title B7 provides for European Union aid, not to the EU Member States, but to third countries."
"So the three lines you mentioned are not relevant to my question."
"You also said, however, that in the case of the BSE crisis we did indeed find it possible to help with the great economic problems created by BSE."
"But, Mr President-in-Office, we found the resources to do so only by taking them from other lines, in other words farmers in other EU countries were deprived so that we could help Great Britain's livestock breeders."
"It was right to help them, but not to the cost of other breeders or farmers in our countries."
"For that reason, I believe that this reserve of 1 billion ECU - it is a reserve today, it is for the needs of agriculture, Mr President-in-Office, and we are holding it in reserve - could be used within the scope of the EAGGF to create a fund under the control not of the Commission but the Council, which would be used in cases such as BSE and other agricultural disasters in all the European Union's countries."
"I understand the thrust of the honourable member's argument, but I hope she will agree with me that we have to abide by a number of premises."
"Firstly, whether you agree with this or not, when drawing up the budget in the Council we work very strictly within the agreed financial perspective and the budget ceiling."
"If you ask for a large sum to be hived off for a general contingency reserve, that means that when the budget is drawn up that sum will of necessity be unavailable for legitimate, predictable budgetary spending."
"The cuts will be entered afresh."
"But what happens is that with a budget of some 70 billion ECU you find in the course of the year that here and there the funds are not fully used up, and these can then be used to cope with special unforeseen emergencies like the BSE crisis."
"I do not regard it as sophisticated budgetary policy to set aside very large contignency amounts which directly reduce the expenditure items which have priority and which are predictable."
"In reply to Mr Sjöstedt I must say that it is true that when the Intergovernmental Conference addresses the question of greater cooperation under the third pillar it will have to consider the question of how to integrate the cooperation which already exists amongst the Member States which are parties to Schengen and how to implement it."
"I can confirm that special consideration will be given and is already being given as part of those deliberations to the position of Norway and Iceland, which concluded a cooperation agreement with the Schengen countries in the form of the agreement signed on 19 December 1996, though it has not yet come into force. But it is too soon to say anything pertinent about how exactly all that will translate at the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Further to the response from the Council of Ministers, for which I am grateful, I have three supplementary questions."
"The first is whether we need a new agreement with Norway and Iceland if the Schengen Agreement is incorporated into EU law, or whether we can use the agreement which is already in place and which has been signed by representatives from these countries."
"My second question concerns the role of the courts: If, as a result of the amendment of the Treaty, the EEC Courts will now determine issues concerning the Schengen Agreement, does this mean that Iceland and Norway are now under the jurisdiction of the EEC Courts?"
"My third question is: If the Schengen Agreement is incorporated into the Treaty, how will we be able to distinguish what was originally the Schengen Agreement or what was Europol, for example, or any other aspect of the work which is currently part of the Third Pillar?"
"Will it not be impossible, in practice, to keep these matters separate when we are considering how they will apply in cooperating countries."
"I think it is still too soon to talk about whether a new agreement is needed with Norway and Iceland as a result of any change in the treaty relationship between the European Union and the countries cooperating under Schengen."
"Perhaps it will be, and in that case the Schengen Member States plan to consult with Norway and Iceland at the appropriate time."
"We shall see to it that we never confront Norway and Iceland with surprises or faits accomplis on this."
"Concerning your second question about the case law of the European Court of Justice."
"If the European Court of Justice is given powers over parts of the total scope of Schengen cooperation, if it ever comes to full integration of Schengen into the European Union, we shall need to regulate the position of Norway and Iceland in greater detail."
"And the case law of the European Court of Justice in relation to Norway and Iceland is nothing new; there are also special links to the Court's case law under the European Economic Area."
"The question is whether, if Schengen is ever integrated under the third pillar, it will still be possible to differentiate."
"Of course, that is just a question of good drafting and good implementation of the agreements, so that one little signature concerning the integration of Schengen does not create great confusion about what exactly Norway and Iceland are tied to and what they are not tied to; that is simply a question of good agreements and my feeling is that within the whole concept of flexible cooperation under the third pillar this is no big deal."
"Mr President, I represent Bavaria here, and I should like to ask you first of all whether the timetable has been fixed for the accession of Austria and Italy to the Schengen Agreement and what you can tell us about the current timetable for accession."
"Secondly, I should like to ask you about security at the eastern borders of the European Union."
"As President of the Council I cannot and should not answer the question about when and how Austria will sign the Schengen Treaty."
"I hope you will appreciate that, and concerning your further question about security at the Union's eastern frontier, I suggest you put it first to the appropriate authority in Bonn, in line with the usual rules on subsidiarity."
"I would like to link this to the question asked by Mr Sjöstedt a moment ago concerning the confusion which could arise if the Intergovernmental Conference proposes that the Schengen Agreement be incorporated into EU law."
"My question is: Would it not be more sensible to wait until the existing agreements have been discussed in the respective Parliaments of Sweden, Norway and Iceland?"
"There could be great confusion if the Schengen Agreement is incorporated into EU law before these agreements have been ratified by the respective parliaments."
"You are putting a question now not to the President of the Council but to a member of the Intergovernmental Conference;"
"I must make the distinction. I should say firstly that it is not every year that we have an Intergovernmental Conference, so waiting means waiting sine die , and I think it is most important to remove the uncertainty which has arisen because we have a legal situation developing under the first and third pillars of the European Union on the one hand, and a different legal situation and legal practice as part of cooperation under Schengen which are poorly coordinated with each other."
"I freely admit that, it is an institutional weakness in an area of cooperation, and that cooperation is judged an exceptionally high priority by all Member States working together both in the European Union and under the Schengen Treaty."
"The issue you raise of how exactly the relationship between Norway and Iceland will look once freedom of movement for individuals is regulated within the European Union is a question which also needs consideration under Article 7A of the Union Treaty."
"The parallel existence of free movement for individuals under the European Union and the existence of the Nordic passport union must be properly regulated either under Schengen or by the European Union, and I do not buy the idea that all that will lead to great confusion or insurmountable problems."
"In my capacity as Dutch state secretary I myself headed the negotiations we had with Norway and Iceland about integrating them into the Schengen cooperation process and I found that it was all very flexible."
"I have come to expect the whole approach of the Nordic countries and of Norway and Iceland in particular to be that they choose pragmatic approaches and solutions which fully preserve the sovereignty of these two countries; that is something which has never been in dispute."
"I anticipate no problems at all here, and I think your suggestion that we shall create confusion and should delay the whole thing amounts to a desire to back away from problems which urgently need to be sorted out."
"The questions put down by Mr Medina Ortega and Mr Holm both concerned the physical appearance of the new Euro notes and coins."
"Firstly, as far as notes are concerned the European Central Bank alone is empowered to commission the printing of bank notes."
"The European Monetary Institute oversees the technical preparation of the Euro banknotes."
"The European Monetary Institute, in its press release of 13 December 1996 when the model to which Mr Medina Ortega refers was presented, emphasized that firstly, it would go on working together with the designers to improve the banknotes and, secondly, that the European Central Bank would decide in 1998 on the final design and when manufacture of the notes should begin."
"As for the Euro coins, I think Mr Holm asked about these, I can tell you that the directors of the mints are currently studying the technical specifications for the coins."
"The shape and materials to be used in the Euro coin were discussed for the first time by the Council of the Union's finance ministers on 27 January."
"And here, I should stress, the nickel content of the coins or whether their composition should include nickel, was discussed."
"The Council of finance ministers asked the group of mint directors to carry out a more detailed study and suggest solutions."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, first I want to say that I am reassured by your remarks because we still have until 1998 for the final design."
"I would just like the European Central Bank to be informed, through the Presidency of the Council, of the concern of millions of European citizens who live in the Canary Islands, the Azores, Madeira, the Greek Islands, Ceuta and Melilla, in other words a series of very important territories, because this map does not show their territories, so it could be thought that the currency is not valid in these regions - given that there does seem to be an identification between the map and validity of the currency."
"The problem may seem trivial to you, but it is of fundamental concern to the inhabitants of these regions and I would like an assurance that the Presidency of the Council will transmit the concern of the Members who represent these regions."
"I shall be happy to pass on Mr Medina Ortega's comments to the European Monetary Institute."
"Thank you for the response from the minister responsible."
"I am pleased that you have not adopted a definitive position on the issue of the nickel content of coins."
"It is indeed possible to produce coins which are totally nickel free."
"In Sweden, for example, we have both ten crown pieces and five crown pieces which are nickel free."
"You have spoken about reducing the percentage of nickel in new coins."
"Swedish one crown pieces contain a maximum of 25 percent nickel."
"It would be interesting to know what percentage level we are talking about here."
"Mr Holm will appreciate that he is at this point questioning the President-in-Office of the Council."
"I would suggest he waits to see the mint directors' report to the finance ministers and the conclusions which the finance minsters draw from that report."
"Question No 11 by Nikitas Kaklamanis (H-1046/96):"
"Subject: Threats by Mrs Ciller against a Member State"
"All the news agencies report from Ankara that, on her return from the European Council meeting in Dublin, the Turkish Foreign Minister, Mrs Ciller, made the following statement at the Turkish capital's airport:"
"'If Europe does not accept the hand of peace that we are extending and Turkey remains outside, then Greece should really be fearful.'"
"How will the Council respond to such a direct threat to an EU Member State which is totally contrary to the spirit of the July 1996 Declaration of the '15'?"
"The Council attaches great significance to the further development of the European Union's relations with Turkey in both the economic and political fields."
"But a number of issues affecting relations between the European Union and Turkey still remain to be resolved."
"In line with the Council's declaration of 15 July 1996 the presidency is continuing its efforts to develop its dialogue and cooperation with Turkey further, with a view to helping in the search for solutions to questions still outstanding."
"Mr President, I thank the President-in-Office for his answer. However, I would like to tell him this: I am one of those who support Turkey's European orientation."
"I would even go as far as saying to the Council's representative that I am in favour of Turkey's full accession to the European Union, subject to one condition, however: that Turkey accepts the European Union's principles concerning democracy, human rights and dignity, and the economic limits established by the EU for any country that wants to become a member of the European family."
"However, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the substance of my question was not answered."
"I ask you, therefore: is the Declaration by the Fifteen of July 1996 valid?"
"If it is, how long are you going to wait for Mrs Çiller to answer you whether she accepts it or not?"
"And if she does not answer you, because eight months have passed, Mr President-in-Office, how does the Council intend to react?"
"And a final question relating to recent statements by Mrs Çiller: what is the Council's position on statements by Mrs Çiller that unless the European Union goes ahead with talks on Turkey's accession to the EU, Turkey will never allow Cyprus to accede to the European Union?"
"The declaration of 15 July 1996 was concerned not so much with Turkey's accession to the European Union as with getting the customs union with Turkey operational and that is the point at issue."
"To my mind not all the conditions have altogether been met and I think it is a matter of urgency that the Council should continue its dialogue with Turkey to reach total agreement on the conditions stated in this 1996 declaration so that the customs union can, as far as the Council is concerned, become operational as soon as possible."
"In reply to the questions put by Mr Megahy and Mr Crowley, I will deal with them both together, as you have indicated."
"The recruitment procedure for officials of the European Union is governed by the Staff Regulations of Officials of the European Communities and thus solely by Community law."
"This guarantees uniform treatment in all Member States."
"The procedure for recruitment via an open compeition is set out in Article 29 and Annex III of the Staff Regulations."
"According to Article 1(g) of Annex III the notice of the open comeptition may if appropriate state an age limit imposed to take account of special situations."
"Thus in practice the age limit is raised in certain cases, for example by five years to allow for the bringing up of children below school age or to allow for military service or handicap."
"In this way the age limit can be adjusted to take account of certain sectors of the labour market."
"For the last two years the Community institutions and organs, the Council included, have decided to streamline their recruitment methods and have pledged themselves to recruit officials by publishing notices covering several institutions, unless a specific institution has specific requirements."
"They also decided, for budgetary reasons and reasons concerned with certain stated quality criteria - I refer you to Article 27 of the Staff Regulations here - to apply a general age limit of 35 for eligibility to take part in an open competition for the entry grades."
"And the entry grades are D4, D3, C5, B5, A8 and A7."
"The budgetary reasons arise primarily from the fact that the contribution period for payment of a pension is 35 pensionable years."
"I refer you to Article 77(2) of the Staff Regulations."
"As for the quality criteria required in Article 27 of the Staff Regulations, it has been established that the age limit of 35 enables officials to be recruited who do, as the Staff Regulations require, meet the most stringent requirements of ability and performance."
"For entry to the interim grades, in particular grades D1, C3, C1, B3, B1 and A5, the age limit is generally 50. Lastly I should stress that under Article 27(2) of the Staff Regulations officials are selected without reference to race, creed or sex."
"I thank the President-in-Office for his very comprehensive answer on the general issues."
"I might say that I am not at all convinced that he has made out any good argument for discriminating against older people by limiting their age to 35."
"I hope that when the IGC concludes - and the Dutch presidency will play a big part in this - there will be an anti-discrimination clause that makes this impossible in the future."
"My specific question related to the situation that now seems to be arising in one Member State - and I congratulate Ireland for taking this step - which has banned advertisements that imply age discrimination."
"What I want to know is this: if the Council is recruiting in Ireland - and it ought to be able to recruit in Ireland for jobs in the European institutions - has it considered how it is going to be able to recruit there if the Irish Government says that it will not allow age discrimination in advertisements in its papers?"
"How then is the Council going to attract people from Ireland into these jobs?"
"Does the President-in-Office not think that it would be better to take the Irish example as a lead and apply it throughout the Community, for then there would be no problem?"
"I think it is premature to predict exactly what the Intergovernmental Conference will say on the subject of banning discrimination."
"I take on board your question about Irish law and Irish recruitment practices."
"I can only say that we are talking in this instance about Community law which has general application and that Irish law is applicable within the territory of the Irish Republic."
"Irish law is not specifically applicable to the recruitment of European Union officials."
"I also wish to thank the President-in-Office for his very comprehensive answer and also for his very comprehensive non-answer, because even though Mr Megahy and myself were tabling two different questions from maybe two different angles, the result we want to see is the same."
"I am not sure that I agree with the President-in-Office when he says that it is premature to speak about what the result of the IGC will be, because this Parliament has already put down several proposals with regard to an antidiscrimination article for inclusion within the new Treaty."
"In the draft Treaty prepared by the Irish presidency during its term of office last year, there was also a specific article relating to anti-discrimination, mentioning, in particular, age."
"I wonder whether the President-in-Office is aware of the demographic survey which the Commission has carried out in the European Union, which shows that the population is getting older and that if we want to fill positions within the European Union institutions, then change is required with regard to the age limit."
"I am happy to see that for the higher grades the age limit is 50 years, but maybe all grades should be able to recruit at an equal limit and we should look at that immediately."
"I am grateful to the honourable member for his observation concerning the Irish presidency's proposal for the IGC, but I stand by my reply that it is premature to speculate about what the IGC will decide on matters of non-discrimination."
"I appreciate your demographic arguments, but I will answer them by saying that EC rules and laws are not cast in stone and that if the labour market and the demographic situation require it, we can look at this again."
"At the moment I have no reason to ask the Union institutions to follow a recruitment policy different from the existing one."
"I would like to thank the President-in-Office for that comprehensive reply."
"I agree with my colleague, Mr Megahy, that the rationale behind this is a bit difficult to follow."
"For budgetary reasons he said, and that concerns pension entitlements."
"Surely there must be the situation of someone who is over the age of 35 bringing a pension in with them and would that not count as well?"
"Surely, you are not saying that no one over 35 can be sufficiently competent to take a position in one of the European Union institutions?"
"I would like to ask the President-in-Office if he is not prepared to re-examine the situation in the light of the demographic developments Mr Crowley has talked about."
"Perhaps he would be prepared to re-examine it, given that the rationale behind it, both on pensions and competence, are not sufficient and that it is worthy of reexamination purely on the grounds of discrimination."
"To be honest, the staffing policy of the European institutions is not really my speciality."
"I am not aware that the present basis of recruitment has meant any problems in recent years for the European institutions in maintaining a body of high-quality personnel."
"So I see no reason at all to frame initiatives now to change the existing practice or change the rules."
"In the interests of completeness I should say that this is a matter on which the European Commission has the right of initiative and that if the European Commission feels either that the labour market is no longer responding to the rules in force or that there are serious problems concerning this question of the principles of non-discrimination, I think the European Commission will not hesitate to use its right of initiative."
"I am very glad to hear that these rules are not cast in stone and could be changed."
"It is important to come back to the increased longevity of the citizens of the European Union."
"Bearing in mind that people are living longer and need to work longer, the apparent need for more experienced people and the excellent decision that has been taken by the Irish Government, could the Council not now, without waiting for the IGC, examine the situation and bring forward proposals to abolish age discrimination throughout the whole of the European Union?"
"I shall pass on the honourable member's concern to the Commission and Council."
"Question No 15 by Ioannis Theonas (H-0007/97)"
"Subject: Turkish threats over installation of missiles on Cyprus"
"23 years after the invasion of Cyprus and the continued occupation of 40 % of the island's territory by Turkish troops, the USA and Member States of the EU - ignoring Turkey's manifest arms superiority - are ordering the Republic of Cyprus not to buy a Russian missile defence system on the grounds that it will upset the 'balance of forces' in one of the most militarized regions in the world."
"Does the Council believe that it is the inalienable right of the Republic of Cyprus to strengthen its defence capability and, if so, what measures will it take in response to Turkish threats against Cyprus should it install the anti-aircraft defence system?"
"Does the Council support the proposal to demilitarize the island under international guarantees with Turkey withdrawing its occupying troops and settlers in the context of a just and viable settlement of the situation in Cyprus on the basis of UN resolutions?"
"Does that objective form part of the EU's initiatives for the region?"
"The question which Mr Theonas raises is an important one."
"The Council calls on all those involved to exercise restraint and to avoid any action liable to hinder or complicate the talks to be held later this year under the auspices of the international community."
"Recent events in Cyprus have shown once again the urgent need for work to be done, under United Nations guidance and in accordance with UN Security Council resolutions, to reach a comprehensive political settlement for Cyprus based on a bi-communal and bo-zonal federation."
"The Council favours demilitarization of the island."
"The Council reiterates its full support for the UN Secretary-General and his special representative on Cyprus."
"On 25 February next the association council with Cyprus will be meeting."
"One of the things to be discussed will be the political situation in the Eastern Mediterranean and of course in Cyprus itself."
"The European Union has repeatedly urged Turkey to work towards a solution for Cyprus in line with the UN Security Council's resolutions."
"Ambassador Heaslip, the presidency's spokesman on Cyprus, will be working closely with all the parties involved and will frame the necessary initiatives."
"As regards the promotion of security through European Union initiatives for the region, the Council would point to the Euro-Mediterranean process under which confidence-building measures are being developed as one aspect of our political and security partnership."
"Mr President, I want to thank the President-in-Office for his answer."
"However, I also want to express my grave concern about the fact that the European Union has so far avoided condemning Turkey's threats against Cyprus."
"Of course, I support a political solution for the Cyprus problem."
"In no case would I wish for any kind of military solution. Yet, I think that it is every country's duty to strengthen its defenses, and of course, defensive armaments are of concern to anyone planning to attack."
"Unless those missiles are not considered defensive."
"But at any rate from what has been said, and from what I know, they are defensive weapons, while Cyprus repeatedly receives threats from Turkey even regarding its right, if you will, to accede to the European Union - a point concerning which the President-in-Office had nothing to say - threats that Turkey will block its accession unless and until its own demands are satisfied."
"I appreciate the honourable member's concern."
"The Council will maintain regular contact with all the parties involved, including the Government of Turkey and the Government of Cyprus, and will do all it can to defuse the political tension as far as possible."
"Although I worked for the Ministry of Defence for years I do not now want to start a debate on the strict need to procure rockets with a range of 150 km as a legitimate means of defence against threats on Cyprus."
"Question No 16 by Alfred Lomas (H-0008/97)"
"Subject: Hostages in Kashmir"
"Bearing in mind the severe winter conditions in Kashmir, will the Council press the Indian Government to make fresh efforts to secure the release of the hostages?"
"In reply to Mr Lomas I can say this."
"Since the beginning of this hostage affair in Kashmir the European Union has made a number of approaches to the Indian and Pakistani authorities asking that no effort should be spared in bringing this crisis to a happy conclusion."
"Unfortunately no progress has been made and reports reaching us about the hostages in recent months have been sparse and contradictory."
"The presidency will leave no stone unturned in its search for news of the hostages and will continue to raise the matter with the authorities in the countries concerned."
"I thank the Council for that reply and for the efforts it has made in the past."
"But things do seem to have gone rather quiet of late, although people in Kashmir itself are extremely concerned and have been working - particularly the JKLF - to secure their release."
"It really is the problem of the Indian Government."
"After all, it controls Kashmir."
"That is why my question asks for pressure to be put on the Indian Government."
"As well as that, would the Council not agree that the real solution to stop all these sorts of acts - and there have been many deaths in Kashmir over the years - would be to grant the people their self-determination?"
"To take the last question first, I think the solution to the Kashmir question has to be sought by direct talks between the governments concerned."
"Whether or not that should result in self-determination or something else, the European Union is in no hurry to say."
"I have taken due note of the honourable member's concern about the hostage affair."
"I shall think about whether a little more pressure might be appropriate."
"I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his reply to Mr Lomas."
"Despite the action that the Council has taken in the past, I would like to know what further action the Council proposes to take over the next few weeks to deal with the hostage situation which has now dragged on for some considerable time, causing a great deal of suffering to the families involved, and also what political action it will take to bring about a solution to the situation in Kashmir, which should be based on the principle of self-determination."
"That is what the people themselves want, let alone the governments involved."
"This is an issue of concern to millions of constituents in Great Britain and certainly to thousands of my own constituents who have links with Kashmir."
"My thanks to the honourable member for the very pertinent way in which he has put his concern across."
"I must once again give the lie to the idea that the Council is not interested in Kashmir."
"The Kashmir question is discussed very regularly in the committee of political directors."
"We are looking very carefully for suitable avenues of approach, either direct measures or perhaps in future the sending of a troika mission so that we can not only be au fait with the situation in Kashmir but also talk forcefully to the Indian and local authorities about matters like this hostage question raised in questions here."
"Question No 17 by Sir Jack Stewart-Clark (H-0015/97):"
"Subject: Role of the EMCDDA in the Dutch presidency's work programme"
"I note that the Dutch presidency in its presentation of action to be taken calls for a 'multi-annual programme for the exchange of knowledge by the Member States on research methods, public information campaigns and facilities for specific target groups'."
"It adds that 'close cooperation between health professionals, the judicial authorities and the police is of essence' there."
"I am surprised that the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) has not been mentioned as such."
"Will the Council please confirm that EMCDDA will be used to the greatest possible extent to ensure that coordination among the various bodies takes place properly?"
"I can answer Mr Stewart-Clark's question as follows."
"At the European summit in Dublin a progress report was given on the fight against drugs which named a number of specific focuses for action in 1997."
"One of these was that a greater role should be given to research in the combating of drugs."
"Research features prominently in the recently adopted Community action programme on prevention of drug dependence which is part of Community action in the area of health."
"One of the programme's objectives is to improve knowledge about drugs, drug addiction and methods of prevention."
"A central role will be played here by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, EMCDAA."
"When approving measures under the Community action programme the Commission will take account of the work of the Monitoring Centre to ensure that there is no unnecessary duplication of work."
"I hear what you say, but we have created this monitoring centre in Lisbon at great expense."
"It is absolutely vital."
"There are a series of what are called detox centres in each of the national countries which are linking in to the drugs monitoring centre."
"It is absolutely vital that that monitoring centre is given support by the Council and by national governments."
"The reason why I put down this question, Mr President-in-Office, was because you talked about the exchange of information on various subjects connected with drugs."
"The monitoring centre was not actually mentioned at all."
"So my question really is: firstly - and you partly answered this - is the Council completely behind the monitoring centre, and secondly, will the Council make certain that the retox centres in national countries are given full support and that the quality of information coming from them is as good as can possibly be?"
"I can answer the first of the honourable member's pertinent questions with an unreserved yes."
"We believe that the Monitoring Centre merits our wholehearted support, given the scale and seriousness of the problem we face in Western Europe with drug addiction and trafficking."
"There is another reason too and that is to some extent a factor given the Dutch approach to the problem of drugs."
"We think that paying more attention to prevention and stopping people from coming into contact with the world of drugs and addiction is, together with crime control, one of the key ways in which we can get on top of this terrible problem more effectively. It is a problem we have been grappling with for years and shall be grappling with well into the future."
"I share the honourable member's underlying belief that if you have to get a complex problem under control you have to monitor it, you have to know, you have to measure and above all you have to have reliable and comparable data on the various forms in which this problem may manifest itself and how it manifests itself in the different Member States."
"I am thus totally in favour of the approach the honourable member advocates."
"I shall certainly bring it to the attention of the Dutch Health Minister who is, incidentally, an expert on the control of drugs."
"Question No 18 by Niels Sindal (H-0018/97)"
"Subject: Ratification of Europe Agreements"
"Two years have passed since the Europe Agreements with Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were signed."
"However, a number of countries (Belgium, Greece, France, Italy, Portugal and the UK) have still not ratified them."
"What steps will the Council Presidency take to ensure that these countries ratify the agreements?"
"In answer to Mr Sindal, the Europe agreements of association with Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were signed on 12 June 1995, that is to say just over a year and a half ago."
"Since then the ratification procedure has been under way and at present the procedures have been completed in nine Member States."
"As the honourable member knows, each country follows its own procedures and practices."
"It is not my place to go into those further or comment on them."
"But one should not have the impression that the procedures to ratify the Europe agreements with the three Baltic states are not progressing satisfactorily."
"Ratification of the Europe agreements with other countries in Central and Eastern Europe have also taken a while, two years."
"The procedures for other important agreements such as those with Russia and the Ukraine, signed in June 1994, are still in progress as well."
"I should point out that the presidency loses no opportunity of reminding Member States of the need to speed up the procedures for ratifying the various agreements which have not yet been completed, including those with the Baltic states."
"So the presidency is confident that those Member States which have not yet completed the ratification procedure for the agreements with the Baltic states will take the necessary steps to do so speedily."
"Thank you for that response."
"I am pleased to hear that the Council does not see any problems, but the Council must understand that certain countries applying for membership, namely Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, have been concerned by the fact that there has not been the same enthusiasm as that shown by the Union to other applicants, e.g. Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic."
"We have decided that all are equal in their application for membership."
"My question, therefore, is: can the Council confirm that the Commission has no favourites in its readiness to accept new countries?"
"I must say that this is the impression I was given as the former Chairman of the Delegation for Relations with Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania."
"I hope you can answer this."
"I can confirm that the Council has no favourites among the eleven countries seeking to join the European Union."
"Membership will as far as possible be based on objective application of the criteria set by the 1992 European Council in Copenhagen."
"The point which makes these ratifications so urgent is the situation in which we find ourselves in other areas."
"I am referring to the fact that government discussions are underway, and six months after they are concluded, we must commence membership negotiations with the Baltic States."
"It is clear that there is concern that we are not giving these issues enough thought."
"Now you have stated, Minister, that it is your intention to stress these issues continuously."
"I have to assume that you will do this in the Council of Ministers and that you will encourage your government colleagues, in those countries which have so far not ratified, to request their governments to tackle the issues as soon as possible."
"If this happens then I do not believe there is any cause for concern in the Baltics or in this House."
"My feeling is that there is no reason for disquiet in the Baltic states, nor for them to be worried about the process of defining the whole accession strategy which will start later this year once the European Commission has produced its opinion on the proposed form of negotiation."
"If you as members of the European Parliament are worried by the slow pace of the ratification procedure followed by some Member States, I suggest that everyone who knows national members of parliament who do not push those procedures forward adequately should get in touch with them and keep them on their toes!"
"Question No 19 by Jan Andersson (H-0020/97)"
"Subject: Initiatives to curb demand for drugs"
"Drug abuse is widespread in Europe."
"The trafficking and use of synthetic drugs is on the increase."
"Member States' views on how to combat drugs differ, but it is high time that the EU formulated a strategy to deal with the increase in abuse, which must include measures to curb both the supply of and the demand for drugs."
"The Netherlands Presidency's programme contains a number of general ideas for action on drugs, such as measures to combat drug trafficking and exchanges of experience of various preventive measures."
"Whilst this is commendable, no mention is made of measures to curb demand."
"What practical measures will the Netherlands Presidency take in order to reduce demand for drugs?"
"I should point out to the honourable member that under a decision of the European Parliament and Council on 16 December 1996 a Community action programme on the prevention of drug addiction was approved as part of measures in the field of health."
"This programme includes a whole range of incentives and support measures aimed at achieving this objective."
"The programme in question is geared broadly to two areas of action."
"Firstly, action to obtain and evaluate data, the objective being to improve knowledge about drugs, drug addiction and their consequences, together with knowledge of methods and means of preventing drug addiction and its attendant risks."
"This will be done in particular using information held by the European Drugs Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, which was mentioned just now, and the resources available under existing Community programmes."
"The second area of action is information, education and training, where the aim is to help improve information, education and training on drug addiction with a view to preventing drug addiction and its attendant risks."
"This will target young people in their own environment, at home, school, university, in their leisure pursuits, and it will target particularly vulnerable groups including former drug users."
"The Commission will be working on the finer detail of an action programme."
"As the honourable member rightly supposes, the Dutch presidency will also concentrate on the sharing of experience gained in the prevention of drug use."
"We shall also look at which elements of the collective strategy against drugs, adopted by the Council in December 1996, merit implementation in the area of preventing drug addiction."
"For the benefit of honourable members, not only Mr Andersson but others too who like myself are very much exercised by this subject, I should say that the Dutch presidency will be giving very high priority to the whole question of studying and eliminating the drugs problem, together with its control and its treatment by the judicial system."
"I would like to thank the Council for their answer."
"The reason for my question is that there are generally speaking two ways of fighting drug abuse, by tackling both supply and demand."
"We must use both these methods."
"We all agree with this as far as supply, i.e. trade in and manufacture of synthetic drugs, is concerned."
"But at the same time we know that, no matter how many producers and wholesalers we bring to book, there will always be drug abuse as long as there is a demand."
"This is why I think that demand is the most important issue, and most important of all is to ensure that young people do not begin using drugs at all."
"I have two questions one concerned with this issue and another concerning the response given to Mr StewartClark."
"Firstly: do you also think that the most important initiative in tackling drugs is to prevent young people from even trying them?"
"Secondly: amphetamines and other synthetic drugs are now being produced in Eastern Europe."
"Should not we in the EU be 'cleaning up our own backyard' now that we are in contact with Eastern European countries?"
"I agree with Mr Andersson's analysis, which draws a clear distinction between supply and demand."
"I think there is a large measure of consensus and policy agreement within the European Union about how to control supply."
"The main objective is to suppress drugs, to counter international organized crime and in this respect Mr Andersson rightly calls for relations with third countries to be borne in mind."
"We know that the rapid processes of social change in some Eastern European countries have led to special risks in the transportation and manufacture of hard drugs and I can assure you that account is taken of this fact in the Council's work."
"I said just now that the Dublin summit resolved to set up a group of senior representatives who will shortly come up with suggestions to counter organized crime; they will of course be examining large- and medium-scale drug trafficking and will make a point of looking closely at relations with third countries."
"As for controlling demand, because we are talking here about great cultural differences between countries and widely differing approaches, I think we need in future to acquaint ourselves a lot better with each others' experience, and I touched on that partly in my reply to Mr Stewart-Clark."
"There is plenty of room for closer cooperation between Member States, between specialists in the Member States, coordinated by the Monitoring Centre."
"We believe that in the Netherlands, prevention has been a key factor in analysing keenly and controlling the consequences for society and the whole of our youth, and I can assure you that this presidency will not relax its endeavours in this area."
"Question No 20 by Nuala Ahern (H-0022/97):"
"Subject: Prior notice of radioactive shipments to en-route countries"
"In the light of the fact that in signing the Barcelona Convention the French Government has clearly accepted its responsibility, in regard to shipments of radioactive and toxic materials from French ports, that prior notice should be given to countries en route, does the Council believe that France and the UK have similar responsibility in informing en-route countries in respect of nuclear cargoes sent by sea from their reprocessing facilities at The Hague and Sellafield respectively?"
"A number of rules are relevant to Mrs Ahern's question concerning the movement of radioactive materials."
"There is firstly Community legislation, namely Directive 92/2/Euratom of 3 February 1992 on the supervision and control of movements of radioactive waste between Member States and into and out of the Community."
"Secondly there are the rules on the movement of nuclear materials, drawn up by the International Atomic Energy Agency and, thirdly, there are the rules governing maritime transport, the IMO code on the carriage of dangerous goods by sea."
"This body of legal and administrative regulations also applies to movements of radioactive waste originating in the reprocessing plants which the honourable member mentions, namely La Hague and Sellafield."
"Regarding the applicability of the Barcelona Treaty, which the honourable member mentions in her question, I have to say that this is not pertinent here."
"This Treaty concerns carriage through the Mediterranean, whilst these reprocessed wastes from La Hague take a totally different route; they are destined for Japan and do not go through the Mediterranean."
"At the same time I should point out to the honourable member that it is not the business of the Council to guarantee compliance with international treaties which the Member States have signed in contexts other than that of the European Union."
"This is an individual responsibility incumbent on Member States, at least to the extent that Community law is not involved."
"Currently there is a nuclear shipment from La Hague in France wandering around the planet between France and Japan."
"Can the Council confirm that notification has been given to states en route?"
"You say it is not for the Council to monitor but who is monitoring it?"
"Is it Euratom?"
"Is the Member State itself responsible for informing other states?"
"Have the other states been informed?"
"Who has informed who and who wants to be informed?"
"And is prior consent given by states en route."
"I know that the Australian Government has been informed."
"It has made a public acknowledgement but we are not too sure what actually happens within the Union and in the space between leaving European waters and entering Australian ones."
"Have states en route also the right to be informed and by whom?"
"Who does this informing apart from France and the UK?"
"I understand Mrs Ahern's concern for these sensitive matters, but I must make the point that this is a debate between the Council of the European Union and the Parliament of the European Union, so I can only really talk here about the obligations imposed by the laws of the European Union, in this instance the Community legislation of Euratom, but these have specific requirements which are monitored too by the European Commission."
"You mention the question of notifications to third countries."
"These are not governed by the Community's laws and regulations, the organs of the European Union play no part in them, and if you want to know what the obligations covering movements of this kind are I must refer you to the obligations undertaken under the International Atomic Energy Agency and the IMO, the International Maritime Organization. Within these bodies individual EU Member States - I cannot recall off the top of my head which they are, I hope they will forgive me - are required to meet their own treaty obligations vis à vis third countries."
"This is not an area in which the European Union has any powers."
"I am sorry, Mrs Ahern, but you are not entitled to come back."
"I would love to let you, but I cannot give you the floor."
"Mr President, we have reached the end of Question Time, and I should like to protest against the reply given to me by the President-in-Office when I asked about controls and security at the external border of the EU, a reply which implies a violation of the Treaty. Citing subsidiarity, he suggested that I address my question to Bonn."
"He did not tell me, however, how that position could be reconciled with the third pillar of Maastricht, with the principle of a European Union without internal frontiers, nor did he tell me how Bonn is supposed to control the eastern border of the EU from Finland down to Greece."
"Mr Posselt, you know that we have not yet completed Question Time and that you are out of order."
"As the author is not present, Question No 21 lapses."
"Question No 22 by Alex Smith (H-0028/97):"
"Subject: Nuclear reprocessing plants and leukaemia"
"The 11 January 1997 issue of the British Medical Journal (Volume 314, pages 101-106) published a detailed article on the measured occurrence of leukaemia in young people living close to the nuclear reprocessing plant operated by COGEMA at La Hague on the Cotentin Peninsula in Normandy."
"Considering earlier studies of cancers around the Sellafield reprocessing complex in Cumbria by Professor Gardner and high levels of leukaemia near the Dounreay nuclear plant in Scotland, will the Council now investigate (and review) the health and environmental implications for the citizens of Europe arising from the continued operation of those reprocessing plants in the European Union?"
"Mr Smith asks about reprocessing facilities."
"I will echo my predecessor in his reply to an earlier question from the honourable member and say again that the Council attaches great importance to ensuring that a high level of safety and health is guaranteed in nuclear activities within the European Union."
"In this context I would remind the House that the Council recently adopted Directive 96/29/Euratom, laying down the basic standards for the health protection of the general public and workers against the hazards of ionizing radiation."
"This Directive tightens up the existing standards to take account of the latest scientific and technical information."
"If the Commission sees fit to put forward new proposals with an eye to the possible adaptation of Community legislation in line with new internationally recognized scientific facts, then the Council will certainly address these."
"It is for the Commission to monitor the developing situation in that field and to check whether the research to which the honourable member refers has universally recognized scientific validity."
"I am not, of course, denigrating this research which, as I understand it, is the work of eminent specialists."
"It is for the European Commission to take further action here."
"I thank the President-in-Office, who I am standing behind once again, for his reply."
"This week we have debated a report by a temporary committee of inquiry, which criticised not only the Commission but the Council for not acting quickly enough on a public health matter."
"Here we have another potential public health danger, and given the reply that the President-in-Office has just provided, could I say that things should be taken more seriously."
"I would ask him whether he will undertake to ask the Commission to review the credibility of this study which was done in the Channel Islands and see if it warrants some further examination or adjustment of the regulations which cover it at the moment, particularly in the light of the public health concerns?"
"In response to Mr Smith's further question, I shall bring this research directly to the European Commission's attention."
"I would like to thank you for your various answers here tonight."
"You referred to the Euratom regulations and directives a number of times, but the Euratom Treaty might as well be on the planet Zorg for all the democratic control that we have on it in this Union."
"It should have been reviewed well before now and incorporated into the Maastricht Treaty or gotten rid of totally."
"Would you confirm that the Dutch presidency has amendments to the Euratom Treaty on the table at the moment, during the IGC process and that it will look at those amendments and/or institute a review of the Euratom Treaty itself during the IGC negotiations?"
"I am not quite sure I grasped the humorous allusion which the honourable member made."
"If the allegation is that those responsible for implementing the Euratom Treaty are fast asleep, I must refute it."
"Secondly, there are currently no proposals on the table at the Intergovernmental Conference to amend the Euratom Treaty."
"Consumer credit"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"A4-0345/96 by Mrs Mosiek-Urbahn, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive amending Directive 87/102/EEC (as amended by Directive 90/88/EEC) relating to the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning consumer credit (COM(96)0079 - C4-0243/96-96/0055(COD)); -A4-0010/97 by Mr Caccavale, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, on the Commission report on the operation of Directive 87/102/EEC for the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning consumer credit (COM(95)0117 - C4-0185/95)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the draft directive amending the consumer credit directive is a small but significant step in the direction of more consumer protection."
"The main thrust of the amendments concerns the definition, which is binding upon all Member States of the European Union, of a uniform method of calculating the annual percentage rate of charge."
"This will have a particularly advantageous effect for consumers, because it makes it easier for them to compare financial services products on a cross-border basis."
"Furthermore, the Commission's proposal carries out a certain degree of harmonization of bases for assessment, inasmuch as the annual percentage rate of charge will now be calculated for the year on the basis of 365 or 366 days."
"However, in my report I propose that the standardized calculation for the year should be made only on the basis of 365 days."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights has given its support to this proposal, as have the votes of my group."
"This clarification is necessary because the Commission's version is liable to be misunderstood and it also allows the calculation to be made on a basis that is equal to the number of days."
"Calculation on such a basis, however, would involve disadvantages for the consumer."
"It would mean that the actual value and the actual period of time would have to be used in each case, with the result that in February, for example, we would have only 28 days, whereas in January we would have 31."
"That would mean that the actual interest would change in months of different lengths, despite the nominally uniform rate of charge."
"The comparability of interest rates would thus be restricted."
"Since this draft directive does not undertake a complete harmonization of the bases for assessment, the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights is also opposed to the Commission's proposal to introduce a symbol when quoting the actual interest rate."
"The Commission would like to make it clear, by means of this symbol, that the actual rate of interest quoted has been calculated on the basis of the consumer credit directive and is comparable with the equivalent rate of interest in the other Member States."
"However, since the cost elements that have to be taken into consideration in the calculation still vary considerably from one Member State to another, for example the discount, which is taken into consideration in one country but not in another, there is no genuine comparability of the actual interest rates."
"Such a symbol, therefore, could be misused in order to deceive the consumer, and would be contrary to the aim of the proposal."
"As far as the Caccavale report is concerned, I should like to make the following comments. Naturally the citizens of Europe are first and foremost consumers."
"Therefore the Commission's reports on the incorporation, into national law, of the provisions governing consumers, and their application in the Member States, are of particular importance."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, in its report, did not merely make a critical evaluation of the Commission's report; it also attempted to offer practical solutions to the questions raised by the Commission."
"I should like to highlight two points in particular."
"The Commission would like to extend the consumer credit directive to include loans for the purpose of renovating or modernizing a building which are not secured by a mortgage."
"In its report, the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights states that it is against such an extension, and in my view it is right to do so, because to include such loans within the scope of the consumer credit directive would involve a disadvantage to the consumer."
"It would no longer be possible to provide such loans, which are tied to a specific purpose, at the favourable mortgage interest rates, but they would have to be provided only at the higher, consumer-credit interest rates, to the disadvantage of the consumer."
"My second point is that the Commission has raised the question of the appropriateness of a European directive on mortgage credit."
"The Committee and my group take the view that such a European directive at the present time is something that they cannot agree to."
"Mortgage credit is inseparably connected with security and application procedures, which differ greatly between different countries."
"European-level regulation of mortgage credit would therefore mean approximating the security and application rules at the same time, hence ultimately the EU-wide harmonization of national property law provisions."
"This, however, would not be compatible with the principle of subsidiarity."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the market in consumer credit has expanded very rapidly in recent years and will experience exponential growth in the years to come."
"It is, however, the case that we have today a situation in which one contracting party is in fact the privileged party."
"This is not just a matter of the legislation or, to put it better, though legislation too has its impact, it is clear that we are today living in an economy based on the supply-side."
"The fact is that the financial institutions are in a position to impose their own choices, their own products and their own contracts - including those containing barely comprehensible clauses - because the supply-side is very frequently limited and inflexible."
"That is why we believe it is necessary to have European legislation that extends, in some way, the 1987 directive because, within the meaning of Article 100a(3), as well as Article 129a, first sentence: ' The Community shall contribute to a high level of consumer protection' ."
"But if we are to protect consumers we do not require legislation that is merely protective."
"We do not believe that protective legislation is needed."
"As the Commissioner, Mrs Bonino, frequently says, the consumer is not a species under threat of extinction; but we do need to speed up a process that encourages consumers to take an active role, that protects their right to seek and obtain useful information, that secures respect for their rights and interests and their wishes, as freely exercised and expressed."
"That, then, is why we are thinking in terms of legislation that provides horizontal and parallel regulation, that does not form a superstructure over the legislations of the Member States and that is able to regulate the rights of consumers and users and relations between their associations and the public authorities. It has also to provide possibilities for less time-consuming protection by the courts and the conciliation procedure now needed to guarantee the kind of uniformity throughout the Community - not cumbersome but stable - necessary for the proper operation of the internal market."
"We believe that, in order to protect consumers, we have basically to apply the principles of free competition, and that means offering consumers genuine choices and according them both the right to choose between different products and the right to change without incurring a penalty."
"We therefore see the consumer as an informed and mobile player, in line with clear rules and with due respect for the commitments entered into."
"We see the consumer as having a real power of choice, and that can and will act as an incentive and a steer to producers themselves, who will need to make an effort, including at an economic level, to innovate and be creative."
"A broader range of supply and greater competition will mean that consumers are given real freedom of choice between several products and therefore the possibility of exerting an influence on the supply-side and on the development of the market."
"Currently, it is quite apparent that citizens who enter into contact with the banks and financial institutions have difficulty in evaluating the various services on offer."
"That is why consumers must ask for and obtain all sorts of information; they must learn to make comparisons, choose, avoid excesses and plan their own commitments."
"Transparent behaviour and clear statements of conditions are, in the final analysis, needed to secure both the protection of the more vulnerable consumers and, above all, market efficiency."
"That is why we are drawing attention to a number of crucial points in our report."
"A new concept of the consumer, for instance, broader than that contained in the corpus of European law and that is able to cover all - including small businessmen - who find themselves at a disadvantage in relation to the financial institutions, at the very same disadvantage as Community consumers find themselves in relation to the financial institutions."
"Of course, we do not wish to revolutionize the concept of consumer as such, but we believe that this is an important and substantial point which may properly be related to the specific sector of consumer credit."
"And that is why we have recently tabled an amendment which we would ask honourable Members to support so that this new concept of the consumer is able to stimulate market opening and variety of supply and generate more competitiveness and greater competition."
"We also believe that lack of openness in the market in consumer credit is most apparent from the usury that exists and the transfer to the black market of a whole range of possible and potential consumers who do not find in the banks and financial institutes the variety of offer they need."
"We also believe that - in relation to mortgage credit, for example - evaluation is needed."
"We are not against the idea of extending the 1987 directive to mortgage credit also."
"We have tabled an amendment on this that leaves the question open and would ask our colleagues in the other groups to support it."
"We are asking them to support the Commission's idea."
"Mr President, I wish to end by making a couple of important points."
"We would ask that the House support the amendments concerning the standardization of contracts with a view to a self-regulating code of conduct; we ask the House to back the extended concept of consumer as well as the possibility of making a close assessment of the concept of mortgage credit; we ask the House to support the new concept of opening up the market and opening up competition."
"Mr President, I should like to state my position regarding the Caccavale report, not the MosiekUrbahn report."
"The timetable of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights forced us to issue an opinion as early as the end of April last year."
"We as a Committee are asking the Commission to amend the 1986 directive."
"Why should credit for the initial financing of a professional activity not fall within the scope of this directive?"
"Why, when consumer credit is advertised, should there not be minimum requirements that are, for the person seeking the credit, informative, comprehensible and truthful?"
"Why should new forms of credit, e.g. credit-card loans, not be covered by an amended directive, or by a directive of their own?"
"Why should there not be a cooling-off period in all Member States?"
"How can we reduce usury and overindebtedness for an increasing number of citizens of the European Union?"
"Can this perhaps be traced back to the fact that many credit providers do not possess the necessary training and probity?"
"Do we not need a European provision on this subject?"
"Our Committee believes that we do."
"The 1986 directive was intended to help to harmonize national provisions."
"It was adopted before the Single European Act came into force."
"It required a unanimous vote in the Council, which means that everybody agreed on the lowest common denominator."
"But when it came to implementing the directive in national law, things turned out very differently."
"In some cases substantially better protective regulations were introduced, but there was no sign of any harmonization, and this makes things difficult when it comes to cross-border activities."
"I should like to point one thing out to Mr Caccavale. Paragraph 16 of the resolution says there should be no Community rules for credit secured by mortgage."
"In the explanatory statement, however, it says that Community rules are appropriate."
"This is, at the very least, a contradiction."
"Our Committee is asking for a directive."
"It is precisely here, in this grey area, that there plenty of negative examples involving the treatment of French citizens by German banks."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, I want to congratulate Mr Caccavale on his determination in getting his report through, because I must say that his zeal to find consensus on the numerous amendments to his report has produced a debate more like a diplomatic negotiation than a parliamentary vote."
"The internal market is going through an essential stage. After the great fanfare of 1992, we are immersed in the application stage, the final objective of which is to bring Europe closer to the daily lives of the citizens."
"They will be more aware of the value of the Union when they can effectively use instruments to defend their rights or carry out financial operations solely for consumption, outside its territory."
"Consumer protection at European level as regards credit is becoming increasingly complex, as a result, amongst other things, of the free play of supply and demand and the imminent entry into force of the third stage of monetary union, which presents a crucial legal problem around the principle of continuity of contracts."
"As mentioned in points K and L of the report, credit policy is still a matter for the Member States, although they must respect Community law."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, will the day ever come when consumer credit is a Community matter and has ceased to be a state matter?"
"Would it not be an important, impressive achievement for the citizens?"
"As we said this afternoon on the Whitehead report, one of the great difficulties about credit is settling disputes."
"I will not dwell on that because we must prioritize simplicity, as I said this afternoon, because transfrontier situations are involved and the cost of credit must not rise to the point that it becomes impossible or only possible on paper."
"Mr Caccavale's report takes up a series of basic principles of civil law which give me great satisfaction as a lawyer: the reciprocal obligation to give correct and complete information (principle of good faith), capacity of the parties, agreement on the essential elements of the contract, the cause, the object and the purpose."
"There is just one point I would like to express a difference about, point 10 of the report, because it establishes absolute unilateral cancellation."
"Surely there is a contradiction here with the principle of continuity of the contract?"
"The application of the contract, according to the time-honoured theory of civil law, must never be at the whim of one of the contractors."
"To conclude, Mr President, I want to say that the law represents or should represent the golden mean."
"That is why I have enthusiastically supported the report, particularly the point on usury."
"But the law must be neither interventionist nor dirigiste ."
"It is enough for it to create an appropriate and balanced environment."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we have all admired your conduct both today and yesterday."
"The report by Mr Mosiek-Urbahn is also welcomed in my native country, Finland, which is one of the countries which will be affected by the amendment."
"Consumers welcome it: we will gain a better effective rate of interest and a uniform European system."
"That is all I wish to say about the Mosiek-Urbahn report."
"There are many points in the Caccavale report which point to the need for further analysis."
"This will be necessary when we finally achieve a uniform capital market through the third phase of EMU."
"The experience we have of deregulation of the capital market has already shown that there are huge differences between Member States."
"In Scandinavia we currently have an over supply of capital which has definitely improved the position of our people."
"The biggest problem, as I see it is for the marginal groups, those who basically cannot get any form of credit, those on low incomes, those with a poor credit rating and those who were left with debts when the economy overheated."
"We must have regulations in the future which protect this group's legitimate interests."
"I think that the problems we are discussing today are middle class problems, which is a fairly typical occurrence in the current political climate."
"Caccavale's report also shows quite clearly the problems which face us if we wish to standardise regulations for the capital market."
"We are hampered by the fact that standardisation of regulations concerning civil rights is not easy."
"The term mortgage used in one part of Europe means something totally different elsewhere."
"I think that Caccavale's attitude, that we should approach this with an open mind, is something which my group would be able to support."
"This will be necessary if we really want common rules for both bankruptcy and for credit."
"I also welcome point 9 of the proposal which concerns stricter regulations governing advertising."
"Point 9 in the Caccavale report has a totally different meaning to the proposal on business communication which we will be discussing at some point in the future."
"I hope that we will study point 9 and revert to it when we do discuss business communication."
"Mr President, in both the report and the draft amendments to Directive 87/102, we are dealing with an important aspect of the provision of financial services in the context of the European Union, and we are doing so in a situation in which all the relevant considerations are influenced by our preparations for taking decisive steps towards monetary union."
"I should like to express my respect, and my gratitude, to all those involved at the Commission and to the rapporteur, for their evident circumspection and attention to detail."
"In view of the importance of the issue, I should like to thank Mr Caccavale in particular, for raising the question of an expanded definition of a consumer, i.e. a consumer in the sense of a free citizen."
"In that respect I am definitely in favour of Amendments Nos 1 to 5, and I support them."
"Unfortunately, Mr Caccavale, I cannot say the same for Amendment No 6; in this case I believe that your original version was more precise than what you are now proposing."
"There is no denying that I have the impression that the final horizontal regulation of these difficult matters requires the completion of monetary union."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate both the rapporteurs, Mr Caccavale and Mrs MosiekUrbahn, for their reports."
"But I would like to use this opportunity to highlight the difficulties that people on low or no earned incomes have in the European Union and the fact that credit must not become a source of financial assistance simply for those who are well-off."
"People without security or assets have great difficulty obtaining credit."
"In Britain many people have to rely on consumer catalogues because that is the best way that people on low or no earned income can obtain credit."
"I would also like to raise the issue of people who are very mobile and their credit ratings."
"In Britain, for reasons not really understood by myself, people who move a lot do not have such a good credit rating as people who are very stable."
"This is taken as a measure of whether people should be allowed credit."
"I also think that it is unfair - and this has been highlighted as a problem recently - that people living at the same address as someone with a bad credit rating also have difficulty getting credit."
"Indeed, if you were to go to a high street and make multiple applications for shop credit cards on the same day, that could lower your credit-worthiness."
"I think the Commission must look at the way that organizations measure credit ratings and the ability of consumers to correct not only their own credit ratings, but perhaps those of members of the family."
"I also think that the Commission should do whatever it can to encourage credit unions because these are very useful for people on low incomes and encourage self-help."
"Finally, I would like to draw the Commission's attention to the micro-credit conference that was held between 1 and 4 February in Washington, which tried to highlight the usefulness of micro-credit to people who cannot traditionally get credit from normal credit organizations."
"This is also applicable to industrialized nations."
"I would like the Commission to take it very seriously indeed."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are indeed having a day brimful of debate, proposals and initiatives on financial services."
"I congratulate the House because, just two years ago, when I took on this portfolio, I thought the financial services and consumer sector was a field that was not exactly taboo but very sensitive - the kind of thing that places those on opposite sides particularly on edge."
"This shows that the approach we opted for - and which seemed the most time-consuming - drafting the Green Paper on financial services and thus inviting everyone to a dialogue and to make proposals, proved in the end to be perhaps the most effective approach."
"I in fact believe that now, in the light of the responses to the Green Paper, not even the producers of financial services can claim that the problems do not exist because they have actually been documented."
"But I think that all of that was discussed this afternoon, in connection with the Marinucci report, with my colleague, Commissioner Monti."
"To deal more specifically with the two proposals on the table - more precisely the proposal concerning the first report and your comments on the proposal for a single mathematical formula - I do not need to remind you just how long-standing a dossier this is, debated by the House on several occasions."
"At any rate, it seems to me to be important that we have somehow reached the final stage."
"In that connection, I wish to clear up three specific issues."
"As far as the symbol is concerned, the Commission takes note of Parliament's view."
"I wish simply to say that it was introduced and backed by a number of Member States; if then there is a change of view, the Commission can only note it."
"As regards the period of time used as the basis for calculation: the standardized or the actual calendar year are clearly both possible criteria, and they both have a certain logic behind them."
"The Commission wishes only to stress that the criterion of the actual calendar year is more precise than the standardized year - which you are proposing - which would perhaps be easier but, from the point of view of the consumer, simply less precise in terms of the calculation."
"In addition, rounding-off the result of the calculation, as the House is proposing, seems to me to be counterproductive because while it may be a simplified formula, for the purposes of informing the consumer, it is important that the statement of the actual annual rate should be as accurate as possible."
"Finally, since the Commission has frequently wished to see a deadline of one year set for the transposition of directives, it must welcome the fact that Parliament's amendment gives a deadline approaching that, albeit a little longer than the one proposed by the Commission: at any rate, we are moving in the same direction."
"One last comment concerning what we might describe as the positive list, or the negative list of the elements to be included or left out of the calculation."
"As you will be aware, the Commission's initial proposal contained the idea of a positive list which, as you will remember, was rejected."
"We now therefore have the negative list of elements to be excluded from the calculation."
"I have, however, to say that the research conducted by the Commission in preparation for this directive showed that the final outcome is in fact practically the same whichever method is used: the Commission has put forward the negative list because the earlier approach was rejected."
"At any event, the Commission is certainly prepared to study along with the House means of achieving greater harmonization, including by inviting the Member States to submit data to show that these problems exist."
"I have to tell the House that the material the Commission has received from the Member State which created the most problems in relation to the negative list, namely France, frankly revealed no evidence to back any of those concerns."
"In conclusion, it seems to me that we should all welcome the fact that this directive is now on the way to completion and that, therefore, as far as consumers are concerned, the adoption of a single mathematical formula for calculating the actual annual rate, although still limited in some respects, represents a major step forward as compared with the legislation of ten years ago."
"Turning to the report on consumer credit, I wish to make just a few points, perhaps to clear up some misunderstandings that may have arisen and that I am anxious to sort out."
"It is clear that the Commission agrees with Parliament's perception that the market in consumer credit has expanded rapidly over the past ten years."
"We have only to remember that at the time of the current directive, 87/102, hire-purchase was still more or less the only form of transaction."
"Today, however, from credit cards to other means of payment, things have changed greatly and will change still further as the processes become more internationalized with the introduction of the single currency and the euro."
"For all of those reasons, the Commission - and I think that Commissioner Monti announced this today - intends putting forward a directive amending the old directive on consumer credit, in the light also of the Green Paper on financial services. And it will also be providing a package of initiatives - on which it will be presenting a legislative proposal - on intermediaries, not only in the insurance sector but in the credit sector also, specifically in order to respond to and resolve a series of problems that you have raised."
"Let me describe to you, by way of information, some of the features of this new amended directive: first of all, the increase in the ECU 20, 000 ceiling as currently set; extension of the scope of the directive which could cover loans for renovation work not secured by mortgage - and I shall return to this because it seems to me that there continues to be a degree of misunderstanding here; extending it, for example, to cover, misleading promotional sales; the ban on promissory notes and a whole range of other elements that you have mentioned."
"All in all, a directive the substance of which has been genuinely amended."
"Let me now consider, simply in order to prevent misunderstandings, paragraph 4 in which the House rejects the Commission proposal to include in the scope of the directive loans for renovation and modernization work not guaranteed by mortgage."
"Your rejection of this seems to me to be based on a misunderstanding because any extension of the scope of the directive to cover renovation and modernization work does not, in our view, seem to pose a threat to the market in loans for renovation guaranteed by mortgage, clearly bearing in mind the particular features of the latter type of loan."
"It seems to me, then, that on this point, greater clarity could perhaps help us each achieve a better understanding of what the other is trying to do."
"As regards paragraph 16, which rejects the idea of Community rules to harmonize mortgage credit, here again what we have is a misunderstanding because it is not the Commission intention to align the national laws in force or the provisions of civil law - that would not in fact be possible - but simply to set under way a process of reflection on the possibilities and ways of extending to cover that form of credit also the rules on information, transparency and protection provided for in the current directive."
"Moving on then to my third point: as far as paragraph 10 is concerned, and this limits to consumer goods only the right to early payment which the Commission is in fact proposing as a general principle applicable to all forms of credit, Parliament's position appears generally to be too restrictive."
"I believe that it is possible to be more flexible and not restrict ourselves to a position of the kind that emerges from the report."
"Finally, paragraph 12 also seems to the Commission to be too restrictive."
"Our view is that it is necessary to fix a uniform cooling-off period of longer duration and of more general application than envisaged in the amendment which, for reasons not clear to me, seeks to limit this possibility to consumer goods only."
"In my view, the Commission approach is more broadly-based and more beneficial to consumers, and I would ask the House to consider this in the light of what I have said."
"Finally, I have to say that I have some reservations of an institutional nature when it comes basically to equating the rights of consumers and small and medium-sized undertakings."
"Clearly, I support these views at a political level but, I repeat, I do have some reservations of an institutional nature in the current circumstances - in relation to consumer policy, competence and the Treaty itself."
"However, I take the view that this is the purpose of the institutional dialectic and that we need institutions that stimulate new approaches - including from the cultural point of view - and new forms of assimilation. Consequently, although the current institutional position prevents me from accepting those paragraphs, I do consider this an important step in opening up a debate - that is currently cultural rather than institutional - on the approach we should be taking and, more generally, our philosophy of the consumer and citizen, interpreted, of course, as encompassing small and medium-sized businesses also."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12 noon tomorrow."
"Recognition of qualifications"
"The next item is the report (A4-0003/97) by Mrs Gebhardt, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive establishing a mechanism for the recognition of qualifications in respect of the professional activities covered by the Directives on liberalization and transitional measures and supplementing the general systems for the recognition of qualifications (COM(96)0022 - C4-0123/96-96/0031(COD))."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are, admittedly, not too many people present at the plenary session at this time of night, but we should still take this debate seriously."
"The groups within this Parliament, having undertaken serious preparation, have something to say about the simplification of the recognition of professional qualifications in the European Union."
"We are not talking about peanuts here; we are talking about fundamental citizens' rights which are repeatedly allowed to go to the wall, in contrast to the economic interests of the internal market."
"What is at issue here is the recognition of equal abilities in commerce, crafts and industry, which the citizens of the fifteen Member States can understand, and which will make it easier for them to live together within this Community."
"If one looks at this recognition directive in simple terms, one might imagine that somebody had got hold of the legislative procedure broom and swept together the crumbs of thirty-five individual regulations."
"But it is not as simple as that."
"This directive has another dimension."
"It creates clarity with regard to professional development opportunities in the European Union, and it strives for equality, which is a fundamental citizens' right."
"I was not able to take part in the French revolution, but where would we be in Europe now without the objective of égalité ?"
"Translated into present-day terms, égalité means equality of opportunity."
"In Europe, that means that an equivalent qualification must be valid everywhere."
"This is how we create freedom of movement for our citizens."
"This is no great discovery."
"We are simply creating a situation of normality."
"In earlier times, craftsmen in particular had their journeyman years, before finally settling down permanently somewhere."
"But let us go back to the idea of qualifications as a prerequisite for carrying out an activity or setting oneself up in business in commerce, crafts and industry."
"This does not mean that they have to be acquired in the same form everywhere in the European Union."
"It means that we must mutually recognize knowledge of equal value, without a lot of bureaucracy."
"Let me give you an example: it was rather ridiculous that the German Federal Land of Bavaria, following the fall of the Iron Curtain, did not want to recognize the DDR Abitur."
"In East Germany, the Abitur, or school-leaving examination, was obtained after twelve years of schooling, whereas in Bavaria, children obtained their Abitur after thirteen years."
"Yet there is no reason to suppose that Bavaria has produced more great scientists than the eastern part of Germany."
"It is the same throughout the professional world of Europe."
"Anyone who is master of his craft, who knows his job, is just as good in Rovaniemi, in the Arctic Circle, as he is in Paris, Athens or some little town in Southern Germany."
"This is what the directive is intended to emphasize, and it also creates more clarity than the previous regulations."
"For this reason, the Commission's proposal is very much to be welcomed."
"From the citizens' point of view, however, it still contains too many ifs and buts."
"As a Parliament, it is not so easy for us to get rid of them, but we can do something to improve the proposal."
"With this in mind, a number of amendments have been tabled."
"We shall be discussing these amendments and taking decisions on them, and we expect the Commission to go along with Parliament."
"But this is not going to be so easy."
"What the Commission has placed before us is something that has been drafted without any great enthusiasm, it will be extremely difficult to make it comprehensible to the general public, and it has various shortcomings."
"This is demonstrated by the number of amendments that have been tabled."
"These amendments show that once again the European Parliament is having to do the work of the administration."
"That is not what we were elected for."
"We were elected in order to ensure, by means of policy decisions, that 370 million people can live happily together in both the present and the future."
"And what have we got in front of us?"
"A document that was intended to simplify and make more transparent the opportunities for professional development in Europe."
"Regrettably, the Commission has not only shifted its own responsibilities onto the European Parliament: it is now making our work even more difficult by ensuring that we do not receive sufficient information."
"Even greater simplicity would have been desirable, as would even more clarity, but these things cannot be achieved without the necessary information."
"Therefore I invite the Commission - and the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights is with me on this - to provide Parliament with this information without delay, so that we can rapidly improve this half-hearted directive and really give people, in commerce, crafts and industry, freedom of movement and freedom to establish themselves in the Member States of the European Union."
"We are now taking a pitifully small step in that direction, but we, as a Parliament, owe even these small steps to our citizens."
"In future, the Commission must not prevent us from taking bigger steps."
"Perhaps I could just add one more thing. It would have been nice if we had been able to carry out these simplifications in Article 4, but this was not possible because there were, quite simply, no reports available on the experience gained from the thirty-five earlier, individual directives."
"I am not a member of the Legal Affairs Committee, Mr President, but as an MEP I do take an interest in citizens' rights."
"I am thus especially happy with Mrs Gebhardt's report, happy because I now have something positive to tell our young visitors here in Strasbourg and Brussels and especially happy now that in 1997, the year in which the Maastricht Treaty is to be revised, we have an instrument with which to counter the creeping Euroscepticism apparent amongst our people."
"This is of course a theoretical thing which brings a welcome degree of simplification and clarification to our Community law and in practical terms broadens people's opportunities for exercising their profession and promotes occupational mobility as well."
"And that is important, because almost daily we talk in Parliament about jobs, and this is good for jobs."
"Mrs Gebhardt says that there is now greater equality of opportunity from the North Pole to Southern Germany."
"I think, for example, that doctors in the Netherlands will now have more chance of finding work in a neighbouring country like Germany, for example."
"That is fantastic."
"She thinks it is still too little."
"I say, better this little step than nothing."
"I think it provides excellent mortar for the bricks of this European home we are building, and my Group is very pleased with this report."
"I compliment Mrs Gebhardt on it and I think we shall be voting in favour tomorrow."
"Mr President, the development of the system for recognising diplomas is fundamentally linked to citizens' basic rights to move freely and exercise their profession, as well as to the attainment of equal treatment."
"This Directive seeks to simplify Community law and render it more open from citizens' point of view."
"Unfortunately, progress in this direction is still inadequate."
"There is still a considerable need for further development in the years ahead."
"As far as matters of principle are concerned, an important change was introduced in the late 1980s when the socalled euro-professions objective was abandoned - in other words, the attempt to harmonize professions - and instead a start was made on recognition of diplomas and other documentary qualifications."
"This system must now be made to work openly and without discrimination against anybody."
"The flood of complaints demonstrates that much still remains to be done at Member State level to eliminate obstacles."
"From the point of view of members of the public, it is important that the so-called procedural guarantee should operate in practice in all situations."
"Member States should compare applicants' qualifications with those required in the host country, and if equivalence is established, an application for recognition should be granted."
"The applicant should also always be given the opportunity to show that he has acquired in some other way a skill which was lacking, if he has no diploma in evidence of it."
"In my view this is a very important gain in flexibility."
"The rapporteur rightly expresses surprise at the fact that it is not possible to obtain up-to-date statistics on a matter which affects citizens' rights to such an extent."
"It is high time that the Member States were required to forward to the Commission information particularly about those problems which people still encounter if they wish to exercise their profession in another Member State."
"Only on this basis will it be possible to determine what changes need to be made and to introduce them."
"Mr President, this report appears to be of a technical nature but is in fact of huge political importance because it concerns citizens."
"On behalf of the Commission, I congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Gebhardt, on this very clear and cogent report presented on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights."
"This was certainly no easy task, given that the proposed directive is very complicated, involving the codification of 35 directives and the introduction of machinery for the recognition of diplomas for a large number of different professional activities."
"Fortunately, the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights approved this report, thereby avoiding prolonged debate on the technical complexity of the proposal."
"It has thus backed the work of the Commission in simplifying Community law and has confirmed the assessment of this proposal for a directive made by the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment which considered it to be a contribution to the fight against unemployment."
"For the most part - I am happy to tell you - the Commission is able to accept all of the amendments tabled by the Committee on Legal Affairs."
"While I say that the Commission is happy to accept all of the amendments, I have to say categorically that I reject one thing Mrs Gebhardt said when she used the expression 'without enthusiasm' ."
"Even though the House is not perhaps packed at the moment, I would like it to understand what is being done with its support, with your support, to construct the Europe of citizens."
"The Commission approach is to give priority to the citizen."
"The citizen is something more than the consumer - to whom my colleague, Mrs Bonino, referred a short time ago - more than the saver or worker: the citizen is the entity for whom we are all working."
"The approach of this Commission is to work for the Europe of citizens even in relation to what may appear to be the most economic-based aspect: the single market."
"And this proposal, on which we have this evening Mrs Gebhardt's excellent report, reflects the approach of the Commission: priority for the citizen, simplification, transparency and information."
"Far from 'lacking enthusiasm' !"
"We are very enthusiastic, thanks also to Parliament's support in the construction of this single market for citizens, this Europe for its citizens."
"Let me now draw your attention to the measures that have been taken recently to give real substance to what could otherwise be the flimsiest form of European construction: we have the Simone Weil Group mandated to consider the real problems of freedom of movement; the package of proposals I have put forward for the abolition of frontier controls within a framework of security; the ever-increasing number of actions for infringement we are bringing against the Member States, in particular for breaches of directives concerning the free movement of citizens and the recognition of diplomas."
"But in addition to that, and as Mrs Zimmermann rightly said, it is not enough to construct Europe for citizens: we need to develop information for citizens, we need to ensure that citizens are aware of the possibilities Europe is creating for them."
"Within that context, and again with the support of the House, but with the enthusiasm of first the Commission and then Parliament, we launched the programme Citizens First - Burger Europas, specifically designed to provide the outside world in this area also with detailed and accurate information which will finally enable citizens to understand what Europe is really doing for them and will allow us, via extensive telephone feedback, through the Internet etc, to understand the real obstacles citizens encounter in exercising their rights of European citizenship."
"And so, I am certain, that at this point, Mrs Gebhardt will agree with me that we are taking this measure enthusiastically, not with any lack of enthusiasm, and we know that the European Parliament is backing this difficult but very important Commission initiative."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken at 12 noon tomorrow."
"Staff Regulations of Officials of the Communities (Equal treatment of men and women)"
"The next item is the report (A4-0046/97) by Mrs Lindholm, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, on the amended proposal for a Council Regulation (Euratom, ECSC, EEC) amending the Staff Regulations of Officials and Conditions of Employment of Other Servants of the European Communities in respect of equal treatment of men and women (COM(96)0077 - C4-0565/96-00/0904(CNS))."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first I want to congratulate Mrs Lindholm on her report, for which I was appointed draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights."
"With the approval of the amendments tabled to the final report, the Staff Regulations of Officials of the European Communities will represent a good model in terms of equality of treatment."
"It is vitally important to provide a progressive legal model in this matter for several reasons, two of which I would like to consider."
"First, because it explains the principle of equality of treatment clearly and fully in one administration, when the practical and legal application of that principle is turning out to be so difficult and problematic."
"Secondly, because it is willing to adapt, unlike most sets of rules, to current social circumstances, recognizing the existence of and increase in de facto partnerships - both heterosexual and homosexual - in our society, and according them the same rights as others."
"It is a priority to introduce these corrective measures because they are crucial to reversing discrimination against women by which, with equal training and ability, it is men who gain the higher positions."
"In addition to seeking to correct this process, the measures and amendments are positive because they are transitional measures and do not adversely affect formal equality, since they are only intended to correct inequalities in the sphere of appointment, promotion and development, and the preference is of a temporary nature."
"Finally, I want to say that the principle of equality of treatment for women - for which we have worked and continue to work so hard - and the principle of equality of treatment for homosexuals, which was dealt with in a parliamentary resolution in February 1994, are regularly flouted and the battle to apply them has to be waged day after day, so they must be included in the regulations, as they are in this one, and I trust we will approve it."
"Mr President, this evening we are talking about the status of officials and the employment of officials in the institutions of the European Community."
"I believe that the European Community in particular must set an example by implementing what we are always discussing here concerning the equal treatment of men and women in all areas of our Community."
"Regardless of whether this is in the area of employment or in other areas, the important thing is that we should set a good example, and that we should be the ones to show what we in the European Union want."
"On behalf of my group, I should just like to comment in detail on one or two points."
"Mrs Lindholm has already made it very clear that people who live in a permanent relationship should not continue to be discriminated against by being given different treatment."
"We cannot have a situation in which I receive equal treatment only when I have acquired a certain status, namely by landing safe in the haven of matrimony."
"Nearly twenty years ago I entered into a marriage because I knew that if I did so I would be taxed differently and would gain certain advantages."
"We cannot have a situation in which we acquire our marriage certificates for that reason alone, and I believe that it ought to be possible for me to have equal rights without having to get a piece of paper from the state."
"There are many people who live for years in a permanent relationship and who are disadvantaged purely because they have not taken a trip to the Register Office."
"This applies not only to salaries, but also to social insurance, in cases of sickness and in many other areas."
"I believe that in our open society it is time we put an end to this."
"The second point that I should like to raise is the question of the age limit."
"I should like to add something to what Mrs Lindholm has already said."
"The fact that women have a different career pattern because they take time off to have children and then go back to their jobs later is not the only issue at stake."
"Last year, we had what was known as the Year of Lifelong Learning, and we talked about the fact that going back into education for a second time provides people with new opportunities and/or a new career."
"Is it not possible that the age limit would be an obstacle here?"
"Many people do not take their A Level equivalents until the age of 30, and only then do they go into further education or to university, and these people then have no chance at all if there is an age limit."
"The age limit must be removed."
"Mr President, I have five points to make."
"First of all, my group fully supports all aspects of the report concerning equal treatment for men and women."
"In fact, we consider that equality to be an achievement of the historical process, the final act more or less, after the freeing, at least in theory, of the slaves, blacks, children, foreigners and people of different race."
"We welcome a completely new and far-reaching approach to equality in relations between men and women also."
"My second point, however, is that we have some reservations concerning Amendments Nos 3, 8, 10 and 11 which we shall be voting against because they introduce, unintentionally, I believe, an element of discrimination by equating the family, based on heterosexual marriage, with de facto partners and homosexual couples."
"Well now, there is, in my view, an obvious and clear difference between entering into a public and specific commitment vis-àvis the state and society in order to form what our international charters and our constitutions describe as 'the fundamental group unit of society and the state' - and I am quoting by heart Article 16 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights - which should be recognized and protected by the state, and, in contrast, not entering into that public commitment which, in the case of homosexual couples at any rate, cannot be linked to the ability to procreate. That, after all, is why the family is the fundamental unit, because it is in the interest of both society and the state that there should be children and they should be brought up within the family."
"Not only that, those who enter into marriage subject themselves to a range of rules laid down by public law because this is in the public interest, and that does not happen in the other examples."
"We have only to think about the reasons for annulling a marriage and for divorce and the conditions of marriage and divorce."
"Moving on to my third point, I want to make it absolutely clear that in relation to individuals of different sexuality also, in particular homosexuals of all kinds, we have to uphold the principle of equality."
"That needs to be stated categorically and backed by the force of the Christian democratic ethic also."
"All human beings are equal and that has to be clearly stated."
"But the fact of enjoying equal dignity does not mean that institutions that are per se different may be treated as equivalent."
"And now to my fourth point."
"Why is the family described in our international charters, including the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, as a 'fundamental unit' ?"
"Is it a public asset or a private asset to be protected?"
"What is a matter of public interest, and I have already said this, is the possibility of producing children, otherwise the principle of freedom applies: everyone should do as they please and the state should guarantee only freedom but should neither encourage nor protect."
"It may be said that companionship also, the fact of being together is something that needs in some way to be protected."
"I am prepared to accept that line of argument but it then needs to be developed fully and not applied exclusively to companionship of a sexual nature."
"Companionship that is based on culture, psychology, science, friendship or distant kinship may also deserve protection - why not!"
"My last point: I do not deny that there are special situations;"
"I am receptive to those who say: but what about when there are children?"
"What about when there is a whole life lived together and based on mutual support?"
"I am receptive to this!"
"But I believe we need to undertake a process of reflection and to make certain distinctions."
"Not in every case then, but in some specific cases."
"It is one thing to encourage and quite another to take circumstances into account."
"All in all, I believe that we need to embark on a process of reflection, but this should not take place behind closed doors but in the open, with wide-ranging discussion of this particular issue: the problem of companionship and de facto partners."
"There is no need to try to sneak in an issue which is in fact hugely important but that cannot be dealt with in the context of a regulation of this nature."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I must say that when the committee discussed the proposal for this report from this good and tenacious rapporteur, it presented a sorry spectacle for a relatively new member from the Scandinavian countries."
"But I am glad that we have been able to unite across many groups in trying to correct the situation described by the rapporteur, the 'collapse' of this report, and that we have now presented amendment proposals which we believe have a good chance of being accepted."
"I do not want to speak on behalf of Scandinavia but I would still like to say that there are those watching what we do and how we vote here tomorrow, as some of the Union's credibility as a defender of women and of equality will be decided through the vote taken by us tomorrow."
"For this reason I hope that the group's common proposal will be accepted."
"I am also pleased that we will be able to carry out useful goal driven work on equality as a result of the proposals presented, and that there will be legal support for the intentions which both the current Commission and the Commissioner present have stated, i.e. that we are striving for a more equal representation of both sexes in the Union's institutions."
"We must continuously have this at the back of our minds, otherwise hidden forces will be working in other directions and we need a plan to guarantee success."
"We are also talking about age discrimination."
"I support the proposals that have been presented."
"As for equal status for various forms of relationship, I cannot see that this poses a threat to marriage or the family in any of the Member States."
"It is more of an opportunity."
"Those proposals which have been put forward to recognise registered partnerships of varying sorts, other than traditional marriages, do not encroach on the law of any country."
"Mr President, of the amendments passed in Parliament's part-session of November 1993 and put forward for incorporation into the Staff Regulations of Officials of the European Communities, the Commission has only adopted the one expressly prohibiting direct or indirect discrimination based on sexuality."
"The fact that the Commission did adopt that amendment is of course a step forward which we must appreciate."
"But there are other amendments geared to drawing up measures to convert the prohibition of direct or indirect discrimination into practical reality, measures such as the creation of a committee responsible for promoting and monitoring the application of the principle of equality, bringing forward appropriate programmes of positive measures, and proposing a system of promotion for officials based on a preference clause, and the Commission has ignored them."
"Its lack of sensitivity cloaks a basic problem: the institutions have limited autonomy to deepen and broaden the principle of equality of treatment."
"But in terms of rights - particularly individual rights - European legislation has been intended to be a model, and has sometimes succeeded in establishing a legal, and also a moral, point of reference."
"And now is the time for legislators to shoulder this responsibility."
"It is not just a case of legislating for the Staff Regulations of the Officials of the Community; it is also a matter of constructing a working model for economic and social rights and for promoting systems which constitute an expression of equality of treatment, and the end of all legal forms of discrimination based on sexuality."
"So we need to adopt the amendments if we want the European Union to become a model in promotion of equality of treatment."
"Some may say these regulations had more limited aims, and that they were amply fulfilled by general rules on the principle of equality in the system applying to officials, without going into detail."
"But the elimination of discrimination based on sexuality obliges us to go into detail: legal guarantees of equality of treatment cannot disregard details like the under-representation of women, their vertical segregation in management spheres, their horizontal concentration in certain activities and, in the case of European officials, in certain categories."
"Not to deal with these issues would leave the principle of equality of treatment devoid of content, the opposite of what is sought by these amendments, which have my support, on behalf of my group."
"Furthermore, equality of treatment as a means of deepening democracy must extend to all Community citizens, in matters of labour, civil, contract and commercial law, regardless of their sexuality and their chosen lifestyles."
"Otherwise individuals would be penalized for their behaviour and their freedom of choice would be limited."
"So it is necessary to recognize the right of de facto partners, heterosexual or homosexual, to benefit from social provision."
"Finally, taking on these commitments means making progress towards not only a more democratic society but also a freer society."
"I think the Commission has a duty to pursue that aim."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the present case we are dealing not only with equal treatment between men and women in the staff regulations of officials of the European Communities, but also, as Mr Casini has just explained so impressively, with the removal of discrimination of any kind on grounds of sexual, religious or philosophical orientation, in other words, exactly as set out in Amendments Nos 3, 8 and 11."
"The European Parliament has a double obligation here."
"It cannot fall below the standards adopted by other transnational institutions such as the United Nations, the World Bank or the European Monetary Institute, and neither can it forget the decision on equal treatment for persons of the same sex living in a permanent relationship, which was taken by this House in February 1994."
"There are no legal or theological arguments against such a decision: no theological arguments, because neither in the Old Testament nor the New Testament tradition is there anything to indicate a preference for one specific family structure, and no legal arguments, because the exercise of personal freedoms cannot be limited to a specific religious, sexual or philosophical orientation, particularly in regulations governing public services."
"It would be contrary to the liberal basic principles of the European Union if any restrictions of any kind were to remain in the staff regulations for its officials."
"Mr President, the European Radical Alliance group fully supports the aims of the draft regulations submitted to us."
"If the European institutions wish to continue playing an active role in the fight against sex discrimination, they should start by giving an example in the treatment reserved to their officials and agents."
"This is why my group also approved of the general inspiration behind Mrs Lindholm's report; in fact we co-signed most of the amendments which take up this inspiration to improve the Commission's draft."
"Speaking on my own behalf, and aware of the fact that I am going against the current of current trends, I must nevertheless say that I do not feel it possible to support amendments 5, 12, 13 and 14, which pose a true problem of political philosophy, as they establish an inequality of right in the recruitment and promotion of Community officials."
"In the case in question, it is not only equality between the sexes, but a different vision of society."
"The main currents of thought latched onto these problems a long time ago."
"The ideologies which, to sum up, I will call 'collectivist' , tend towards an 'equality of situation' , with the known consequences on freedoms and individual responsibilities."
"As regards liberal ideologies, they continue to rest on that which I will call the 'principle of charity' : one relies on individual initiative to correct the inequalities of situation."
"For my part, I am radical and I refer to the principle of justice whereby discriminations based on objective criteria (race, sex, language or origin) must be condemned and the equality of rights and chances must be ensured."
"This is why, with the men-women problem, I prefer qualitative equality to quantitative equality."
"This is why, more generally, I think that an inequality of fact is not corrected by creating an inequality of right, unless we move towards an 'ideal' society where each man and each woman occupies a place assigned to them by arithmetic calculations."
"In so far as I am concerned, I do not want such a society."
"Mr President, Commissioner, my dear colleagues, the Council's draft regulations submitted to us have received the approval of our group, but I am led to make two comments, one on procedure, and the other on substance."
"As regards procedure, Mrs Lindholm's first report was rejected after discussion of the amendments, on the 27th January, in a meeting of the Committee on Legal Affairs."
"What happened?"
"Non-consensual amendments had only just been passed, often with a majority of only one, as mentioned by this report."
"At the time of the final vote, the conversion of a positive vote into an abstention, by a member of the Commission who found that the report did not go far enough, led to equal votes, and so to the rejection of the report."
"In the same stride, the motion for a legislative resolution, submitted to the vote rather rapidly, suffered the same fate."
"I would like to say that I am happy to point out that on the 6th February, the Committee on Legal Affairs accepted as its own a draft I had made in accordance with the letter of the regulations and the logic of the procedure, which aimed to invite it to issue an opinion on the Commission's initial draft."
"The text thus adopted permits our discussion of this evening."
"It does not prevent the debate and it also permits the filing of amendments in a plenary session."
"Having said that, I would like make a comment on substance."
"The situation of inequality of treatment of men and women has led to the adoption of measures which raise serious legal problems, calling into question the very basis of our republican regimes."
"To sum up, we have moved from a system of quotas in the positions offered to a system of positions reserved by the famous positive discriminations."
"I agree with what my colleauge, Mr Hory, has just said."
"He could have quoted the famous phrase of a Communist minister of public office: ' In an inegalitarian society, one must be inegalitarian in order to re-establish equality' ."
"This actually raises two problems."
"The first is of a legal nature. The constitutional Council in France, the constitutional Court in Italy, the constitutional Court in Germany and the European Court of Justice in the Kalanke judgement, have condemned the measures which systematically favour, in an equal situation, the recruitment of women in the name of the famous principle of equality."
"But this also poses a philosophical problem relating to the nature of these positive discriminations and to the fact that they call into question the very basis of our democracies, as it is the very concept of citizenship that is in question."
"What should we do?"
"We must naturally plan some equality measures."
"We should also proceed with instigations, as sometimes happens in the political parties."
"We must not make a mistake in the debate."
"I am not sure that the amendments proposed there are eighteen which come from the same signatories will permit advancement."
"10 on non-marital community, or amendment no. 11 on the partnership registered as statutorily equivalent to marriage, the authors of these amendments shift the debate."
"They take the risk of seeing the Commission's draft rejected."
"For the excellent reasons just expounded by Mr Casini, we will not vote in favour of these amendments."
"After all, if they were approved and if then the Commission's draft were rejected, the situation of women would not be improved."
"This is why we wish to keep to the Commission's text."
"Mr President, I welcome the rapporteur's report."
"It goes a great way to removing the inequality that exists not only for women, but also for men and women who are victimized because of their sexual orientation."
"The amendments put forward by my colleague, Mrs Zimmermann, and others also go a long way to try and remove this particular form of discrimination."
"In answer to the last speaker and also to Mr Hory, you cannot remove centuries of inequality by just turning around and saying that we are going to rely on the same men to give women justice."
"That is just not going to happen."
"Thank God women are beginning to catch up with that."
"In the past 50 years we have seen women striding forward and pushing themselves forward to make sure these inequalities are removed."
"When Mr Hory first spoke, I thought that given the generous statements he made to Mrs Lindholm, he was going to come out very strongly in favour of removing these discriminatory barriers and going a certain way towards equal representation of women."
"But he turned around and struck at the very core of the report by saying that he could not support Amendments Nos 5, 12 and 14."
"Amendments Nos 5, 12 and 14 are those amendments which actually say to the Commission: ' You will ensure that there is genuine equality in your ranks when you are recruiting personnel' ."
"My own particular concern with this report is on Amendment No 18."
"I believe that you have to go further than the courts to deter inequalities."
"I also agree that we have to struggle within the places where people work."
"Therefore it is important that we actually give shop stewards and workers' representatives these tools to sort out the problems prior to them going to court."
"That is why I believe that Amendment No 18, which we have tabled in the name of the Socialist Group, should be supported by the House as a whole."
"It would allow those workers' representatives to obtain the records of various officials in order to compare them with the records of others who are standing for positions."
"I must stress that what we are talking about here is the work experience."
"I look at the German translation and its says 'Laufbahnen ' ."
"From my German colleagues I understand this refers to curriculum vitae."
"The correct interpretation, as I understand it is 'Arbeitserfahrung ' , which is work experience."
"Can we ensure, Mr President, that you and others, including the staff secretariat check out the amendments as they are tabled to make sure they reflect the wishes of the Members that tabled them?"
"That particular amendment is tabled wrongly."
"The translation is wrong."
"I trust and hope this House will correct it."
"Mr President, I speak for the Dutch section, a small section, of the Christian-Democratic Party which hopes to have some reinforcements tomorrow."
"I have been busy for two and a half years with petitions from European officials calling for equal rights; these were homosexual couples. Sadly I have got nowhere."
"I constantly had to prod the then Commission to dig this dossier out and dust it off."
"I am grateful to the rapporteur and those honourable members who have put down amendments for giving this subject another chance today."
"Employers, good ones at least, know that a happy home life is good for people's work."
"It is good for people's work if there is someone at home who cares about the worker."
"That does not apply in the European institutions."
"Janet marries John, we push the boat out, and no one worries about the financial consequences."
"If twenty years later John dies, Janet is taken care of for the rest of her life, no problem."
"It is very different in the case of Robert and Arthur, and even more so for Jill and Jean, because women get an even worse deal here."
"This difference, Mr President, is called discrimination."
"A term reviled in this House, except when applied to homosexual couples. Dutch bosses employing a staff policy like this would find themselves in jail."
"Not here."
"Here the employer sits at his desk and pontificates about discrimination everywhere else in the world, but not amongst his own staff."
"I have two clear questions for the Commissioner."
"If Parliament adopts the resolution and the amendments tomorrow, what will the European Commission then do about the Staff Regulations?"
"How long does it have to take before this discrimination is in fact removed?"
"Why is there no respect for the laws and constitutions of the Member States which handle these matters rather well?"
"Why does the European Commission not have the courage to help people like Arthur, who cannot get a residence permit for Belgium, and use its influence with the Belgian Government so that these people do not have to flee to the Netherlands to live and commute to Brussels to work?"
"The European Commission does nothing about it."
"Self-respecting politicians want a society which survives, amongst other things, by loving its neighbour."
"An employer can do his bit here."
"Two people who care for one another have a far better chance in society than if each is alone."
"Everyone accepts that, except the employer, the European institutions, when it comes to officials who cannot or do not wish to marry."
"Mr President, I would like to take this opportunity of informing everyone in the House that I come from Stockholm."
"In Stockholm, the majority of 'families' consist of one person."
"As for the logic which says that children are a necessity for a family, I think that homosexuals should also have the right to adopt children, and that would be that problem solved."
"I welcome the work by Mrs Lindholm to get EU institutions to take European Parliament resolutions seriously, resolutions where we speak in favour of equality and non discrimination, resolutions which have been repeated many times here in the House and accepted with considerable agreement."
"Maintaining an age limit when recruiting and refusing homosexuals living in a partnership or living together their rights, those rights enjoyed by their heterosexual colleagues, is not just active discrimination but also repudiates national legislation, including Swedish national legislation."
"We have the capacity to speak with great dignity and with very fine words."
"Now, during the forthcoming vote on the Lindholm report we have the opportunity to turn these fine and proud words into reality by voting in favour of the amendment proposals presented."
"I hope now that, not only the majority of members will vote for these amendment proposals, but all members will do so, even if the discussions in committee may suggest the opposite."
"I hope this so that we can give substance and credibility to words such as competence, equality, equal rights and rights for all, regardless of age, sex and sexual preference."
"If we vote against these amendment proposals we will be actively contributing to discrimination and also actively contradicting ourselves."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the arrogance of many men - and I would like to make it clear that I mean many, and not all - is quite unmistakable, even in this House."
"To say that equality is possible if we simply make everything absolutely equal in legal terms is really so arrogant that one can hardly comprehend it."
"All the things we are discussing here - curriculum vitae, employment structure, the world of work, the conditions governing appointment and promotion - all these things are based on the lives and experiences of men."
"And they say to us, in all seriousness, ' Yes ladies, all you have to do is to become like us men, and then you too will have equal opportunities' . Do they seriously believe that that is what we want, that we do not want to carry on being ourselves?"
"Surely that is not true!"
"Really that cannot be true!"
"The family is a valuable thing, it is true, but it is not everything."
"We should not forget that the family is not, in fact, the norm, or the universally applicable way of life in our society."
"It is becoming less and less so."
"And a family does not mean having a marriage certificate."
"Family means people with children, and what does a marriage certificate have to do with that?"
"It is a question of living together, of being together, and that is what has to be taken into consideration, regardless of whether the people who are living together are of different sexes or the same sex."
"There is no reason why these people should be disadvantaged merely because they say quite openly, ' I live as I am, and I would like to have the same opportunities and the same options as other people' ."
"There is no reason why we should deviate from the basic principles that we have already adopted here in the European Parliament."
"We adopted these, as Mr Ullmann has just said, as long ago as February 1994."
"Mr President, the Commission proposal on which Parliament is now being consulted has a long history behind it."
"The Commission first forwarded a proposal for consideration by Parliament four years ago, in March 1993."
"The proposal has two objectives. It seeks firstly to incorporate in the Staff Regulations the principle of equality between men and women, and secondly to make it possible to adopt special positive measures to improve the position of women if conditions are discriminatory from women's point of view."
"Parliament delivered its first report in November 1993."
"On the basis of it, the Commission altered its proposal and incorporated in it the principle of non-discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation."
"It was only in March 1996 that I was able to forward the Commission's modified proposal to the Council, because before the Staff Regulations can be amended, extensive consultations are required, particularly with staff representatives."
"As it was a very long time since the Commission had made and altered its proposal, Parliament asked the Council for a further opportunity to state its views, and this request was granted in October 1996."
"Now the committee has tabled numerous amendments."
"They relate both to equality between men and women and to the principle of nondiscrimination on grounds of sexual orientation."
"I should like to stress that the Commission proposal now under consideration is only a small and partial reform, and not a complete administrative reform."
"The objective should be to adopt this small and partial reform, now that four years have elapsed, so that we can concentrate on the need for bigger changes."
"The debate has mainly focused on two issues, on which I should like to make a few comments."
"One concerns the age limit and the other the position of cohabiting couples."
"The proposal suggests that age limits for competitions to recruit staff to the Community institutions be abolished."
"This idea has been debated over a very long period, and the arguments for and against are well-known."
"I should like to stress that the Staff Regulations permit the use of an age limit but do not require it."
"Thus there is no requirement to operate age limits under the existing rules."
"It would be justified to reflect about when the use of an age limit is justified and when it is not, and to consider the matter separately from case to case."
"One practical problem about which I should be happy to speak to the committee at greater length is the organization of competitions."
"Most recently in 1993, when a competition for young A-grade officials was held in twelve Member States, there were 50 000 applicants from the twelve countries with nine languages."
"Ultimately, 600 were placed on the reserve list - that is, just over 1 %."
"It was an enormous administrative task and tied up huge amounts of administrative resources."
"If a similar competition were to be held now, as it shortly will be, the number of applicants from all 15 Member States would no doubt be substantially larger, yet at the same time the number of new jobs will be significantly smaller, because of budgetary constraints."
"The age limit has been used as one method of controlling the number of applicants."
"How justified it is is debatable."
"On the other hand, I should like to stress that age limits have not always been applied as a recruitment condition."
"Many temporary staff have been recruited by the Commission without any age limit being applied, and many of them have gone on to become permanent officials through internal competitions."
"Last year, at my proposal, the Commission approved a new policy on temporary staff, which is as follows: in future, two types of competition are to be held - one type for young generalists and one type for older staff who already have work experience."
"The intention is that all competitions should be open and public, both those for younger applicants and those for mature candidates, but the mature ones would be required to have specialist knowledge."
"This procedure has already been used when recruiting in the new Member States."
"For the more junior A-grades, young people with little or no work experience were recruited."
"Separate competitions were held for more mature staff to be employed as A-4s or A-5s, higher up in the hierarchy."
"I have just compared the results of these competitions, when recruitment began."
"Of the young applicants from the new Member States who were placed on the A-grade reserve lists, 51 % were women."
"In the more mature age group, only just over 30 % of the applicants placed on the reserve lists were women."
"This undoubtedly reflects social development."
"The position of young women is already a good deal stronger now than it was 10 or 20 years ago."
"But this is a matter which should be considered case by case."
"I am not sure whether it is essential to abolish all the rules concerning age limits."
"Each case can be considered on its merits."
"But as I have said, the Commission is now also opening competitions to more mature applicants."
"I shall now turn to the principle of non-discrimination on sexual grounds. The Commission is aware of the problems of cohabiting couples and the unequal position in which they find themselves, and it has sought solutions to the problem."
"Last summer, the Commission approved an administrative reform guaranteeing homosexual and heterosexual cohabiting couples all the entitlements enjoyed by married couples which it was possible to grant without amending the Staff Regulations, that is, on the basis of the Regulations as they now stand."
"I have heard that the European Parliament and the Council are preparing similar reforms."
"I would encourage Members to keep abreast of these developments."
"Parliament now proposes that the Staff Regulations should also be amended so as to entitle unmarried couples to the same social and financial benefits as married couples."
"This is quite justified from the point of view of equality."
"But before the Commission submits a proposal to this effect, we need to make a political judgment. What I mean is this: the Council's attitude towards the entitlements of officials has, to put it mildly, been hostile, and it has on a number of occasions proposed substantial cuts."
"If we propose that cohabiting couples should be placed on a footing of equality with married couples, there is a risk that the Council may respond by abolishing those entitlements enjoyed by married couples which do not exist in many countries."
"One should reflect carefully on whether to take this risk, because we shall also have to discuss the matter with staff representatives."
"I do not personally have anything against the idea."
"I entirely agree that married couples and cohabiting couples should be treated equally."
"The danger is simply that the Council may take the view that equality should be achieved by abolishing married couples' privileges, thereby securing a position of equality for cohabiting couples."
"All in all, I should like to say that, on many points, I agree with Parliament's amendments."
"But what needs to be decided now is whether to proceed with this small, partial reform, which has already been in the pipeline for four years, or whether to reopen the debate and the consideration of the proposal."
"One alternative is to take a decision on this small reform now and then go on to prepare a complete revision of the Staff Regulations, which in many respects needs to be undertaken before enlargement."
"Unfortunately, the timetable for dealing with such matters is enormously protracted."
"This proposal has taken four years: how long will it take if we embark upon a complete reform?"
"It might be a good idea to discuss this with the committee."
"Even just internal negotiations and consultations with staff organizations take a huge amount of time."
"The procedures are lengthy."
"If something is to be done, it should be done in such a way as to be completed within the lifetime of the present Parliament and Commission."
"May I thank the committee for the interest it has taken in the issue; I shall be happy to continue the discussions on this and related matters later."
"Mr President, I put three clear questions to the Commissioner and I have not had answers to them."
"After two and a half years I think I am entitled to some."
"The Commissioner says he agrees with the amendments, but he does nothing further."
"The Commission has the right of initiative."
"Let us now see the Commissioner doing something, and let him at least give me an answer to my questions."
"I will repeat them: one, what will the Commission do if Parliament adopts the amendments tomorrow?"
"Please, Mr President, will you see to it that Parliament receives answers to these three specific questions."
"Mr President, I have just said that we ought to reflect on whether or not to move towards a decision on this partial reform at all."
"If there is a desire to do so, a decision should be taken on the proposal as it stands."
"If we want to reopen the whole subject, we shall probably have to go through a procedure which will take a couple of years longer to complete."
"In compliance with the principle of cooperation with staff, we shall have to enter into fresh consultations on this whole subject."
"The Commission needs to think about this."
"Personally I would be inclined - although this is a matter for the Commission to decide - to take a decision today to approve this small reform; the views stated by Parliament could then be taken into account when considering the Staff Regulations as a whole."
"Another point which is legally problematic is this: can the Staff Regulations of the European Communities treat nationals of different Member States differently?"
"So far, legal experts have held that the Staff Regulations must treat all officials equally."
"They do not provide any legal scope for discriminating among officials on the basis of their nationality."
"This is what the experts say, and since this is the legal interpretation, it is difficult for the Commission to deviate from it."
"As Member States' views change - we do now have a couple of countries which have granted rights, and made arrangements for registration, for cohabiting couples and particularly for homosexual couples - this of course improves the chances of getting changes through the Council."
"I should be very happy if the Member States' views developed in such a way that things could be put in order in this respect."
"The third point to which I have drawn attention is the unavoidable need for a political judgment as to whether we should propose equality for married and unmarried couples."
"Is the Commission ready to run the risk that, as a result, married couples' existing privileges, particularly those of a financial nature, may be abolished and equality may be secured in this way?"
"Many people may regard this as a simple matter, but I can assure you that from the point of view of the staff organizations the issue is a very delicate one."
"Thank you, Mr Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken at noon tomorrow."
"(The sitting was suspended at 11 p.m.)"
"Approval of the Minutes"
": - The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, I have a comment on the Minutes."
"On page 18 of the German version, Item 16 (' Union policy towards Algeria' ) the motion for a resolution tabled by the Group of the Party of European Socialists mentions my name."
"I am not supporting this motion."
"Furthermore, I informed the services that I was withdrawing my signature."
"Mr Sakellariou, that will be pointed out at voting time."
"The correction will be carried out."
"(The Minutes of the previous sitting were approved)"
"Mr President, the House will recall that I, along with other Members, have raised on a number of occasions, the incarceration of Roisín McAliskey, who is seven months pregnant, in a category A jail."
"The Foreign Minister in Ireland has clarified with the British Ambassador to Ireland and the German Ambassador to London, that there is no objection by the German Government to her release from jail."
"I would now call on you, Mr President, to ask the British Government to release this woman from jail as a matter of urgency."
"Mr President, I just wanted to point out that we had a full debate on this matter yesterday and that it is not in order to return to urgent resolutions which were not adopted."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten."
"We have taken note of your remarks."
"ONP and universal telecommunication service"
"The next item is the report (A4-0049/97) by Mrs Read, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive (COM(96)0419 - C4-0581/96-96/0226(COD)) on the application of open network provision (ONP) to voice telephony and on universal service for telecommunications in a competitive environment (replacing European Parliament and Council Directive 95/62/EC)."
"Mr President, colleagues on the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy will know that this is the third attempt on the voice telephony proposals, even before the deadline for liberalization on 1 January 1998."
"I want to place on record that the committee, and indeed this Parliament, have worked at considerable speed to facilitate these proposals going through their various stages for the telecommunications Council early in March."
"This was not an ideal way to work but I think we have done remarkably well in the circumstances."
"This, as you know, is the proposal under the telecommunications dossier which has the most direct consequences for the citizens of the European Union."
"It is for that reason that the committee has concentrated on certain consumer aspects of these proposals."
"The fear is, of course, that operators will concentrate on the most profitable segments of this market and that is, very often, not the ordinary domestic consumer."
"We have tabled amendments on universal service - so central to these proposals - on consumer protection, and a number of my colleagues have tabled most helpful amendments which strengthen the Commission's proposals, particularly on the rights of consumers' organizations to be consulted about changes."
"There are amendments to protect low-income consumers and I welcome the Commission's own ideas on flexible payment schemes."
"I have tabled amendments supported by the committee and retabled many on behalf of my group about protecting disabled consumers."
"It is not often widely appreciated, but some of the developments in the field of telecommunications technology can disadvantage certain disabled consumers."
"For example, text telephones are of almost no use to blind or partially-sighted consumers."
"We have put down amendments about the quality of service and about the protection of consumers in rural areas - isolated areas or less populated areas."
"I would be particularly interested in Commissioner Bangeman's comments on the question of to what extent these proposals should cover mobile telephones."
"I know this has been controversial and not necessarily supported by all political groups in this House."
"I would ask them to listen carefully to what the Commissioner has to say and perhaps consider their vote accordingly."
"It is true that the mobile telephone market is developing at very different rates in the different Member States."
"But I think it is very clear that this will sooner or later be one market."
"It seemed to me, and the committee supported me, that we should make some moves towards this now."
"The field we have chosen is in the field of funding of universal service and that of consumer protection: fairly small but significant moves and for me the most coherent and logical place to start."
"It is not without interest this week, when we are debating this report on voice telephony, that the record-breaking World Trade Organization agreement has finally been concluded."
"It was interesting that both the Commission and the WTO itself took credit for that agreement - I am sure both were due that credit."
"It highlighted what an immensely lucrative, important industry this is - in its own right and as an adjunct to so many industries."
"We welcome the agreement and recognize particularly the marker that has been set down and hope that the European Union will move towards the pricing levels consumers in the USA enjoy."
"At the same time we realize that this is an industry which I am sure will want, and which certainly can afford, the basic consumer protection measures I am sure that this House will support."
"That is all the comments I have to make."
"I commend the proposal to you and assure the Commissioner and the Council that the Parliament will do all it can to make sure that this measure proceeds at a suitable pace to meet the deadline of 1 January 1998."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the impending liberalization of the telecommunications market offers the European economy a wealth of possibilities and areas of activity with important repercussions for employment policy."
"But, despite the inconspicuous and purely technical impression it gives, it also represents an important social challenge."
"In the existing economic and social circumstances, general access to the network -which really means the affordability of the services - is a sine qua non for equality of opportunity and non-discrimination."
"So the nature and extent of the liberalization of the market in this sector must always take due account of the consumer's interests."
"Today, a certain minimal service has already become an economic and social necessity of life. Liberalization must ensure that those with special needs - the elderly, the handicapped, people on low incomes and those living in geographically remote areas - receive that minimum service at an acceptable price."
"That is the essential thing - a rule of communication, especially for the lower strata of society, the less well-off, and indeed, this also shows that voice telephony is an important instrument for social integration - and, if negligently handled, can become a substantial factor in disintegration."
"That is why there has to be a fair social dialogue, in which consumers and consumer protection organizations have a binding say in the decision processes regarding general controls to ensure fair competition and the necessary price transparency, the setting-up of various discount schemes for private and business users, investigations into suppliers holding a dominant position in the market, and also the continuing development of new systems."
"This will create much greater transparency, and that is what we need."
"This is merely a just complement to liberalization, as I see it, a complement that is necessary in the interests of the market economy and of democracy."
"But the key to this particular directive, or so I believe, is that the consumer must benefit to the full from technological advances in voice telephony."
"From my angle, the angle of consumer protection, there are five essential points here."
"One is that prices must be affordable and fair."
"The second is that the services offered must be of a high quality."
"The third is transparency of prices and services, the fourth is access to the law and assistance with certain kinds of arbitration procedure, with disputes, and the fifth is the involvement of consumers in technological changes."
"But if everything fails to work properly, there is something we must think about even at this stage."
"If free competition and suppliers' sense of responsibility fails to result in an appropriate standard, we must give thought even now to minimum standards at European level and to the consequences for suppliers who fail to meet those standards."
"If, then, at the end of the day, it proves possible to supplement and enrich the proposed directive in a practical way with Mrs Read's report, then we shall be able to say that we have achieved an advance in terms of consumer policy, and I hope that that is what will happen."
"Mr President, first of all I should like to thank Mrs Read on the exceptional work she has done."
"She has produced a report of high quality under great pressure of time and the Council on Telecommunications has every reason to be extremely grateful to Parliament for its rapid work."
"It is now up to the Council on Telecommunications to follow this same example for the Parliament does not intend to hold up this business and impede liberalisation on 1 January 1998."
"The interest of universal service lies of course in a liberalised market as does also consumer protection."
"This immediately raises two important questions of policy - firstly: what does universal service cover, and secondly: who is paying for it?"
"With regard to what universal service covers, with the development of a liberalised market with European telecom firms which must be able to develop as fully competitive parties on the international market, means on the one hand that very close attention must be paid to the new responsibilities they will have to assume."
"On the other hand you cannot ignore the question of consumer interest."
"There is a tension between these two elements which must be carefully balanced."
"Another important aspect is that what is technically possible in one country may not yet be possible in another."
"So you cannot afford to ignore the differences which unfortunately exist within the European Union."
"And finally it is important to take account of the convergence between fixed and mobile telephone networks and the fact that there are going to be major technological changes in the coming years."
"That means that the definition of universal services which we are now discussing is limited in time and must apply to the whole of the European Union."
"An EU-wide definition of universal services is very important to ensure that only services for telecom firms which are covered by the EU definition need to be paid and to prevent them being hit with yet another universal services charge imposed on market parties."
"That is why Amendment No 10 is so important."
"My group is of the opinion that for the time being mobile telephones should not be included in the universal services because of the major differences between the EU countries, but we must keep that door open because of convergence."
"That is why we kept the door open in Amendment No 7."
"That brings us, Mr President, to the second political question: who pays, who contributes to the costs of the universal service?"
"My group believes it should be clear at this time that only providers of voice telephony services via the fixed net, in other words not the providers via the mobile net, should be expected to contribute towards the costs; but we must examine in due course the extent to which they should also be expected to contribute."
"Hence Amendment No 15 in which that is proposed."
"What we want to avoid at all costs is that new service providers are already obliged to contribute now to the universal service."
"That would be most undesirable, it would hamper the creation of the information society."
"Mr President, I wish to draw attention to the problem of the disabled."
"There is a tendency to provide them with as much as possible for free."
"But I do not think that is wise, for not every disabled person is the same."
"Some are economically very independent and I think they themselves would take it as an insult and a blow to their emancipation if they were to receive special treatment."
"So do not try to settle that now on an EU-wide scale, but do it at a more local level."
"The same holds good for the socially weak."
"A measured, de-centralised approach is to be preferred."
"I am totally in favour of helping the socially weaker to avoid social exclusion, but that should be done specifically at the lowest level, namely in the region, city or country, and not on an EU-wide scale."
"Mr President, time passes quickly, January 1, when the free market for telecommunications services will be introduced, is fast approaching."
"Generally speaking, I could say that we in Scandinavia; Sweden and Finland, have had a free market since 1992."
"Our experience of the free market has been good; any problems, for example problems connected with providing a service to sparsely populated areas, have been relatively trivial."
"Our experience shows that the best way to achieve a free market is to establish basic legislation which gives a framework for the regulation of the market."
"The market then needs to be supervised by us as elected representatives."
"We can ensure that any anomalies which we do not want are put to rights."
"What we mean by this is that we must be ready with legislation for a liberalised market, but we must not introduce more regulations and laws than are required to enable the market to function properly."
"This is our experience in Scandinavia."
"The most important areas to regulate are consumer safety and protection and the right for everyone in the information society to benefit from new technology."
"Our group would also like to emphasise that this issue is not just one of technology, but it is equally a matter of democracy and equal rights for those living in peripheral and sparsely populated regions and of equal opportunities for all, for the old, the young, the handicapped and those who, perhaps, do not normally work with this form of communication."
"Mrs Read's report is basically a sound report."
"Our task as elected representatives is to supervise the market and ensure that we meet public and civic needs."
"All suppliers must be obliged to provide finance for public services."
"It is important to ensure from the beginning that civic interests are represented."
"We would prefer not to include mobile telephones in this report and we will vote for such proposals in the House when voting takes place."
"For the most part we are in favour of the committee's amendment proposals and will lend our support to them."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we must follow Mrs Read's example in relating this report to the WTO agreement, though that agreement is even more ambiguous than has previously been pointed out."
"There is still the intention, instead of a transition to a new development model which will be viable in the future, to overcome the present difficulties of capital accumulation by opening up what had previously been public sectors to the private markets and private competition, and that does involve problems."
"I believe we can perfectly well debate this matter here in connection with the question of the mobile telephone service, because it is true, as Mrs Read said, that this is going to become one market, and the Commission's strategy and tactics of splitting it up into smaller and smaller sectors for technical reasons and regulating them in different ways carry less and less conviction."
"In this connection I would like to thank Mrs Read very specifically for having repeatedly stressed the cohesion of this whole voice telephony sector, as compared with the Commission's piecemeal strategy. Perhaps, too, this may have enabled the other side of the House, which is not with us at present, to grasp that flexibilization or liberalization can only be regarded as advances if we really take our regulatory function seriously, if we really succeed in providing the necessary government-backed guarantee for all, particularly including those population groups and regions which have to face up to handicaps, obstacles and problems."
"This includes the universal service, and universal service in a more dynamic form."
"It includes the need for the consumer associations to play their part."
"It includes specific guarantees for the disabled, in this sector more than others, and I can only stress that point."
"Communication is a public asset."
"Part of it can be supplied privately."
"It can be opened up to the private sector, but it must be regulated so as to retain government control over it."
"I wish to begin by congratulating Imelda Read, who worked very quickly, and very painstakingly and clearly set out her case, which I support."
"Mobile phones should be included, unlike what the previous speaker said."
"This is a growing market."
"I know that it is not growing at the same rate in all the Member States but, nevertheless, it is a developing market and will, I imagine, become more and more commonplace everywhere in the EU."
"So mobile phones should be included."
"This must also be a universal service."
"I have a certain interest here because I represent perhaps one of the remotest parts of the European Union - the Highlands and Islands of Scotland - 90 islands."
"The people in my islands have the right to expect the same access as anybody else, whether they come from a very populous country like the Netherlands or a big city."
"I am concerned to ensure that it is a universal service, and I start off by saying that that would be essential to my support for this proposal."
"We have talked a bit about people with special needs."
"I was distressed to hear the speaker from the Group of the European People's Party say that we would demean disabled people by offering them special tariffs."
"I do not see that at all."
"These people have a disadvantage and are entitled to our support and should get a special tariff for the service."
"The mobile phone companies or organizations are very profitable."
"This is indeed a profitable segment of the industry and I do not see why we should not oblige it, before it is too late, to make this a universal service, with special conditions to help disabled, handicapped and blind people."
"People with a mobile phone should have the right to have an entry in a directory if they wish, with the same right not to be in the directory if they do not wish."
"So I hope that this House will support the principle that Imelda Read has so well explained of having a universal service."
"Mr President, a more liberal market for telecommunications will create about 1.3 million jobs in the year 2005, according to a French research agency, but not in the telecommunications sector which will see a drop in employment."
"But improved telecommunications technology will stimulate employment in other sectors."
"It strikes me that private telecommunications firms are in favour of liberalisation and state firms are against this process."
"They apparently have a lot of hidden unemployment they want to conceal."
"That is why we must produce regulations which work to the benefit of nationalised firms."
"The European Parliament should not be misled by the short-sightedness of trades unions who are only interested in the effects on jobs in big nationalised companies."
"This debate is about the progress of the liberalisation process: will we meet the deadline of 1 January 1988?"
"We hope that we shall not see a repetition of the post dossier where France, Germany and the southern Member States apparently want to see liberalisation postponed until 2003."
"The European Commission is apparently going along with this."
"But does the Commission not realise that the longer one waits the sorrier the state of the post sector and the telecommunications industry in Europe will become."
"To stand still is to backslide."
"Either that or the Commission is running the risk of a parliamentary inquiry in the future into they way it is dealing with the telecommunications and post sector."
"Liberalisation is fine, but not at any price."
"That is why we developed the idea of the universal service."
"I think that this concept is feasible if it is not defined too broadly, for then we would be keeping monopolies in position whereas the aim is to liberalise the market."
"Universal service forces companies to serve the whole market and not hive off the best bits."
"But the more refined the requirements for the universal service the higher the costs of the basic services."
"Too much regulation harms the weaker groups, which are precisely the ones we want to protect."
"We must try to find the best solution here."
"With this in mind I support Amendment 10 to Article 3, but Amendment 19 to Article 7(1) is clearly a case of over-regulation."
"The seriously speech-impaired opt for a private text telephone."
"This service is included in the universal service."
"A public variant is therefore unnecessary."
"On the question of tariff I think we should abandon the concept of a fixed maximum tariff."
"Competition is not served by establishing a uniform fixed price based on costs, nor are consumer interests."
"Costs are not an appropriate yardstick; they may be much higher in one Member State because of an inefficient nationalised company there."
"Mr President, in general, we support the rapporteur's proposals and, in particular, those concerning consumer protection by quality of service, information contracts and settlement of disputes, and we are also in favour of the introduction of families as a special category of users."
"We support the rapporteur's proposal to extend application of the regulations concerning consumer protection to users of mobile telephones, though it is obvious that the directive should not govern mobile telephones, since the fixed telephony and mobile telephony markets are still separate."
"Another aspect involving consumer protection is the social aspect."
"The introduction of flexible payment schemes to prevent disconnections when more vulnerable users, and especially low-income families and/or disabled people, find themselves in difficulty, must be supported without question."
"As regards the options concerning the universal service, I wonder whether the Commission's proposals are not somewhat more realistic, in the short term, than those put forward by Parliament."
"For the moment, any overly broad definition of the universal service would involve unacceptably high costs that would stifle competition."
"In the long term, we need to arrive at the proposed solutions but, in the meantime, it would be useful if the Commission could develop some costing forecasts for the various levels of the universal service."
"It would also be helpful if the Commission could instigate research on internal relations within the Member States concerning the free market and competition in this sector, respect of the regulations and any illicit profit-making or illegal use of sources."
"The liberalization of telecommunications markets will be a highly significant event; if it is to be achieved in full, it is important that the directive we are discussing here, like the others included in the package, be adopted as soon as possible."
"Mr President, Commissioner, there are many here who have stated that this sector currently under discussion is a sector which is fast developing and a sector which indeed needs to be allowed to develop quickly in order to bring about a competitive market and a competitive industry in Europe."
"We know that huge investment is needed in order to have real access to information in all parts of Europe."
"Bearing in mind what has gone before, I also think it better that we do not regulate."
"I am a little concerned that both the report and the Commission's proposal suggest that we should."
"We know what services were available, but it is more difficult for us to predict what will be required in the future."
"There are no 'free lunches' and what we are concentrating on at the moment is guaranteeing old levels of service."
"There is a risk that we will take resources away from necessary future developments."
"Such development could bring about fantastic opportunities for the handicapped, for example, to participate in society in a totally new manner."
"As my colleague Mr Lindqvist has already said, in the Scandinavian countries we have had fantastic results following liberalisation."
"For instance, the cost of a long distance call in my native country Finland has gone down by seventy percent and the number of telephone boxes has increased by a quarter since liberalisation was introduced."
"Consumers have benefited from this liberalisation."
"We currently have a situation in which different Member States are at different stages of development."
"For this reason Member States need the freedom to decide how they will support the handicapped and the freedom to decide which rules they will apply. They may support the handicapped through social support for example."
"I have expressed a certain amount of concern in my statement from the Legal Committee which has not been included by the Economic Committee."
"We would like to see restrictions on when national regulatory authorities can intervene."
"We know that national regulatory authorities are not always totally free from a monopoly situation."
"There is a risk, therefore, that they will intervene in a way which is discriminatory."
"In conclusion, I would like to support what Mr Lindqvist said, that mobile telephones should not be included, as they will stand in the way of the future developments which we need."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in view of what is happening worldwide, the WTO negotiations show that Europe did the right thing in aligning itself with the mainstream of events."
"So we must pay tribute here to the Commission and to Parliament, because without them the telephone market would never have been liberalized."
"It must be said that we achieved the relatively satisfactory results we can see today by going against the wishes of the Member States and utilizing the resources provided by the Treaty."
"We must never forget: if there had been no Commission, if there had been no Parliament, we should still be dealing with fifteen totally partitioned telecommunications markets, fifteen monopolies or virtual monopolies."
"That is the situation, and it was right that the House should be reminded of it."
"In essence, we in this Parliament are agreed - and I congratulate Mrs Read - on the problems of competition and price transparency, the need to set reasonable prices, and the fact that there must be a universal service to protect the consumer."
"So where do we still disagree?"
"Our intentions are the same, but we disagree about ways and means."
"We share the same objective: we want as many citizens as possible to have access to as many quality services as possible at prices which are as low as possible."
"But how are we to achieve that?"
"The question which greatly divides us today is whether we should, as of now, make the mobile telephone subject to the same regulation as that envisaged for the fixed telephone."
"This is where opinions differ."
"They differ because we, for our part, believe that the important growth of the mobile telephone is due to the effects of competition, and will achieve the objective I have just stated much more efficiently than it can be achieved by any other means."
"If we try at this stage to impose on operators the burdens of the universal service, it will result in a fatal price increase."
"Mrs Ewing and Mrs Read have to understand that there is no such thing as a free service."
"It takes a certain kind of mentality - which I shall not call socialist - to believe that things can be easily distributed and that one can be very generous on behalf of the community as a whole."
"But there is always a cost, and if you ask those operators to bear additional costs today you are going to slow down the distribution of the product; people who cannot afford to pay for a mobile phone today will never be able to afford it."
"Look at what happened in Sweden, in Finland, in the United States."
"Mrs Read said, ' I hope that European citizens will very soon be able to enjoy the same services at the same price as the citizens of the United States.'"
"But if the United States had followed Mrs Read's policy, it would never have arrived where it is."
"It arrived there by following the opposite line."
"It imposed universal service conditions once the results of competition had become established, at a time when a vast majority of the population already had access to quality services at very attractive prices."
"This is a mistake we must not make."
"We must wait until mobile telephony has acquired a market share in the region of 30 or 40 % - and then impose universal service charges."
"It happens very quickly."
"It is easier to impose a directive than to create a network, not to mention the fact that it is also much cheaper."
"Mr President, I can follow on from what my friend Fernand Herman has just said."
"I think, though, that he does Mrs Read an injustice in believing that, in the report she has presented today, she proposes a policy which would be the precise opposite of what has been done in the USA."
"That, at any rate, is not the impression her work makes on me, even though I agree with Fernand Herman in principle."
"So I should like to start by thanking Mrs Read."
"We owe a debt of gratitude to her, and to the whole Parliament, especially because she had to work so quickly."
"I regret that, but, as you all know, the deadline of 1 January next year is putting pressure on us all."
"I am sorry to have to tell you that I cannot promise that this will be the last time we discuss ONP and all the other subjects we have talked about in past years, because convergence - both technological and economic - will bring together all of these previously separate markets, and of course that will compel us to adopt new approaches."
"However, that is not our subject today."
"Our subject today is first, if you like, the fundamental question of the various policies and secondly a subject involving very practical conclusions."
"But since the practical conclusions are themselves inevitably somewhat dependent on what is regarded as being right in principle, a valuable first step is to verify once again, by reference to what Mrs Read and others, and Fernand Herman too, have said whether our fundamental approach is right."
"First, I should like to refer once again to the fact that we now have a liberalized market - this is no longer in any way disputable, even by unreconstructed Marxists like Mr Wolf."
"This situation is perceived as an improvement on a public sector monopoly."
"That is a very substantial step forward, because I can well remember that when this debate began there were still people advancing the argument that Mrs Ewing has just touched on once again today: communication is a public asset, and so we need a public sector organization and preferably a monopoly to ensure a better service for all."
"I can remember back to the beginning of the liberalization debate."
"What Mr Fernand Herman has said is right: Parliament and the Commission have achieved something substantial here, and we are not at the back of the queue but - as the WTO negotiations clearly showed - the concepts we have developed make us leaders in the field, technologically and politically, so that we have no reason to fear whatever comes next from the WTO."
"But - because I myself was a target for the attacks and because it always amuses me, so I remember it clearly - in the early debates the issue really was: are deregulation and liberalization even possible at all, or are they just fantasies conjured up by these ultra-liberals?"
"And now, thank God, and I say that not with the arrogance of someone who was right all along but simply because the result is a good one, everyone can see that the ultimate result of liberalization, when you draw the bottom line and add up the pros and cons, brings major advantages for the consumer, in particular, and that gives me great satisfaction. Because the fact that we can now operate with lower tariffs, not only for data transmission but also, especially, for the telephone service, has become obvious."
"And that should be our starting point."
"Here, as elsewhere, competition means that prices fall and quality rises."
"That is not to say - nor has the Commission ever said - that we should now leave competition to run itself; of course there is a need to regulate certain matters which do not automatically arise from competition."
"The great question that always confronts us is: what arises automatically from competition and what has to be regulated?"
"And, if it has to be regulated, then how?"
"This is very difficult to predict, because technological development goes hand in hand with competition here, and many things are quite different from what they usually are in industry."
"I have always made that point."
"Now let us go back to the question of the 'universal service' ."
"The nature of the product range and the nature of the costs arising compel every supplier to offer as wide a range as possible."
"The argument that one regularly hears to the effect that people will concentrate only on the things that pay - either on major population centres or on the well-to-do and on companies which can afford the telephone and are going to have to afford it - is wrong."
"Of course, it will happen in some cases."
"That goes without saying."
"There will be suppliers - there already are - who initially concentrate on large companies and, indeed, are forced to do so because in the first instance they do not have an extensive network."
"But having an extensive network is always more profitable, because the more customers you can reach the more convincing the service you can offer."
"And then you can reduce costs as well."
"There are companies today - and if I'd said this a few years ago no doubt you would have laughed at me - giving away handsets, for example, free of charge, because they are not interested in the apparatus or the profit it can bring but in the service."
"Fine, you may say, OK, that's just another way of passing on the costs, their charges are higher as a result."
"No, because this is another area where there is competition now - I see Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf staring at me in amazement, because as an agricultural expert he has absolutely no experience of competition and this is all something completely new to him."
"There are companies today who provide free phone calls if the user accepts that he will occasionally be interrupted by advertisements."
"That may not be very pleasant, of course, especially in the case of certain personal phone calls."
"To be suddenly interrupted by advertisements is something that would certainly upset Mrs Lulling and me."
"But that isn't what matters."
"What matters is that if someone wants to make free phone calls, he can make them - he has no need to pay anything at all."
"My argument is precisely this: let's just wait and see what competition produces in the way of universal access, which is no longer any kind of financial or other problem for anyone, including the disabled."
"Of course there are certain kinds of disablement that require technological solutions, that is true enough."
"But even there, I believe, technological progress will make many things possible that we today still regard as impossible."
"That is the first point."
"What I mean, then, is that you should not regard the problem of universal access as being mainly one to be solved through social policy."
"It is mainly one to be solved by technological advances and the development of the market."
"What problems remain, is the question that arises next, and how are we to solve them?"
"I am convinced that there certainly is a continuing need for regulation, especially in the case of positions of market dominance."
"And the question that arises here is: should mobile telephone suppliers not be treated differently?"
"Do we not need to adopt an asymmetrical procedure, penalizing the supplier who has a fixed network, a de facto monopoly, and making things easier for the mobile phone operators, the newcomers to the market?"
"Originally we thought this was the right approach."
"Now we are wondering whether we may not be able to restrict it."
"For example, both should be treated equally when it comes to entries in the telephone directory."
"So that motion for an amendment can be accepted."
"And there are other things we should regulate here today, which must certainly be the same for both."
"But it is right, of course, that anyone who has this kind of permanent network still has an enormous competitive advantage at present."
"We are trying to regulate that, by regulating access to the network."
"It is not true to say that we are simply leaving it unregulated."
"And, here again, there will in future be competition between networks, and we will still have to deal with Mr Hoppenstedt's report."
"For example, personal satellite communications will also enable us to overcome this bottleneck situation whereby some people today are still owners and users of fixed networks."
"Once there is competition between networks, the situation will look completely different."
"Those are just a few ideas."
"I hope we will succeed in coming up with a regulation here which makes allowance for justified interests but does not result in the situation against which Mr Van Velzen rightly warns us: we may make the development of such things so difficult from the very start that not even this success, achieved through competition and technology, for disabled persons or other socially disadvantaged groups, is achieved."
"If we fail to allow such a network to develop at all, then, even retroactively, we shall not be able to enjoy the benefits of this utilization."
"The big question here, going far beyond the confines of this sector, is: to whom should the costs of social policy be passed on - who should bear them?"
"And I believe the simplistic principle once again put forward here by Mrs Ewing - they earn so much money, so they can afford to pay for it - is wrong."
"Just ask the mobile telephone operators, who have to make a substantial investment at the outset and do not yet earn as much income as the older companies, what they have to finance in the way of start-up costs and how difficult the situation is for some of them."
"And even if they did a very great deal of money, it would still be open to doubt whether that really is a sound principle."
"We talk about unemployment in the European Union."
"Our unemployment is much higher, frighteningly so, than it is in the USA."
"Why?"
"Because we constantly penalize the labour factor."
"No one can be naive enough to believe, after all, that that kind of cost burden on a company is not passed on."
"Of course the company has to pass it on in its costs."
"But the transmission of data, in general terms, has become the most important production factor of all today."
"If we require it to bear the additional burden of the social policy, we will be hounding more and more jobs out of Europe."
"So we must finance the social policy from the earnings of business."
"We must have the courage, when we want to do something, not just to lose it in the financing but to finance it openly from the budget."
"That's where the money has to come from - from taxation - and then we can think about what we want to do for whom."
"That would be the right way of creating jobs, too."
"A final word on the WTO question."
"The enormous step forwards that this represents is widely underestimated."
"This market today is worth six hundred billion dollars worldwide - and the percentage growth rate is in double figures!"
"That means that if we can succeed in maintaining and improving the position we have in this sector today, that is one of the very few hopes we have of creating new jobs."
"That is why this WTO resolution was so extremely important for us, and it is a very good thing that other resolutions have followed, so that we have finished up with a sensible regulation."
"I should also say something briefly about which amendments we are accepting and which we are not."
"But, as this is the first reading, I may then give a full report to the rapporteur."
"First, as I have already said, we are entirely receptive and willing to accept the principle rightly stated by Mrs Read, that we must now give consideration to consumers, and to particular groups of consumers."
"For that reason we are accepting Amendments Nos 2, 3, 10, 13, 14 and 41."
"There are some amendments we prefer not to accept, for the reason clearly stated by Mrs Thors: there are certain social entitlements which can be handled better at regional and national level, where people have a better idea of what is what."
"For that reason we are not accepting Amendments Nos 11, 15, 21, 34, 36, 44, 46 and 49."
"As far as the inclusion of mobile telephony is concerned, the point mentioned by Mr Van Velzen and others, we are willing to accept Amendments Nos 5, 7, 9, 16, 23, 26 and 42, in whole or in part."
"That is how things stand today."
"Once again, ladies and gentlemen, I cannot promise you that we will not have to return to this topic again, and again, in future years."
"Mr President, I want to raise a point of order about the order of voting."
"But I cannot resist saying to Mr Bangemann that operators want to offer free telephone calls to some subscribers for the same reason as banks sometimes offer free banking facilities to students: they see this as a lucrative and profitable sector in due course."
"We can see here in this industry what will be the global Klondike gold rush of the next millennium."
"It really is an immensely profitable industry."
"But I want to ask you, Mr President, and the services whether you would consider the order of voting at 12 noon?"
"This is the first reading, but a codecision procedure with some complicated amendments and some split voting and at least one important vote of principle on the inclusion of mobiles."
"It is unthinkable that we should not get to this by 12 o'clock."
"I ask you to take it early in the order of voting so that we can give it proper consideration."
"Mrs Read, I shall forward your remarks to the services responsible, who will put the problem to whichever of my colleagues will be in the Chair."
"It will be for him or her to decide."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12 noon."
"Telecommunications - satellite personal communications services"
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"the recommendation for second reading (A4-0051/97) on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council Directive (C4-0633/96-95/0282(COD)) on a common framework for general authorizations and individual licences in the field of telecommunications services (rapporteur: Mr Van Velzen); -the recommendation for second reading (A4-0050/97) on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council Decision (C4-0634/96-95/0274(COD)) on a coordinated authorization approach in the field of satellite personal communication services in the Community (rapporteur: Mr Hoppenstedt)."
"Mr President, today we celebrate a very important triumph - namely the words of the Director General of the WTO, Renato Rugiero, after the conclusion of a WTO agreement on opening up the telecommunications market world-wide."
"The Commissioner has already referred to this."
"If the European Parliament approves today the amendments we have tabled, then we shall also be celebrating a victory for at long last, after many years of messing around with directives on licences, the European Union will have a framework for telecommunications licences in the Member States."
"The new WTO agreement stipulates specifically that the signatories will set up regulatory bodies, guarantee interconnection rights at reasonable prices, but above all the signatories of the agreement guarantee transparency and non-discrimination in licence decisions."
"The EU directive before us today will therefore serve as an important link for the Union itself and the Member States of the Union to fulfil their international WTO obligations."
"What does the transparency in the EU licence decisions consist of?"
"First of all the telecom companies must announce well in advance the conditions and form of the licences, whether an individual licence or general authorization."
"The system of general licences based on specific legislation is of course preferable to a bureaucratic system of individual licences."
"That was precisely why this directive came up against so many problems in the Council."
"The amendment I have laid before the House today will therefore help to emphasise the general licences more in the future and not so much the individual licences."
"Secondly, the going price for a licence may not be set exceptionally high."
"This is also where telecom companies in the European Union have problems."
"Some Member States are planning to demand high prices for licences and thus create an unfair advantage for sitting telecom firms since they never needed to pay for a licence."
"That is why I am also pleased that this directive sets out clearly that it is only the administrative costs of granting licences that can be recouped."
"Thirdly, the aim of transparency is served by making the licensing conditions basically the same throughout the Union and by not making the procedures for granting licences too complicated or too diverse."
"Different procedures with obscure requirements are currently thwarting Europe's telecommunications industry at the moment."
"That is why harmonisation is highly desirable."
"Fourthly this kind of licensing system must offer scope for the service providers."
"But even with all these welcome developments there are still some serious predicaments in the path of this directive."
"That is why we must be aware of the enormous pressure of time that Parliament is under if we want to have a liberalised market by 1 January 1998."
"After we have completed our work the national parliaments still have to pass this legislation."
"But I must say that the cooperation procedure with the Council and Commission has not been satisfactory in my eyes."
"Last May we voted in the first reading on this licence directive in the expectation that the Council would determine its view on this directive very quickly."
"That expectation was misplaced, however, because it was only at the end of December that we received its common position, and many compromises were agreed on in the dark chambers of the Telecommunications Council and Member States with Member States making guesses about the practical feasibility of matters."
"This process took place in silence, without any public debate, without any democratic accountability and without any information about why Member States took the views that they did."
"Furthermore the Commission changed its original favourable position on some of the EP's amendments in the first reading during Council discussions."
"It would be to the Commissioner's credit if he were to explain to the House here today his reasons for the change of heart, for example why the Commissioner welcomed the amendment on mutual recognition but later changed tack."
"If we do not yet have complete harmonisation then mutual recognition is still an effective instrument for creating an internal telecommunications market; agreements have also been made in the WTO on mutual recognition while the European Union itself is unable to reach agreement on this issue."
"The European Parliament has shown itself very willing to cooperate."
"It preferred to start with a restricted directive rather than dragging its feet or running the risk of this directive being blocked in the Council in the second reading."
"Liberalisation is a higher good."
"I wish specifically to address the President-in-Office of Council, Mrs Jorritsma, to ask here that if the European Parliament approves this report today will she accept the specific responsibility of acting on this legislation with speed."
"And by that I mean that I expect that the Council Presidency will pass this directive in the Telecommunications Council on 6 March without any problems."
"There are of course other points of concern in this directive."
"I shall mention a few."
"The Member States still have too broad a margin to introduce restrictive licensing conditions."
"We still do not know if the one-stop shopping procedure will be passed."
"We have now become dependent on an international club of telecom regulators, the CEPT and the ECTRA where the Commission's position is far too restricted."
"There are still too many opportunities for national regulatory bodies to put through their own desiderata."
"It would be highly desirable if we could set up one single large committee."
"The Commission would be doing the sector a great service if it were to set up a kind of telecom legislation help desk in the near future where the national regulatory bodies could come with their questions on European telecom legislation, for this is how you could start the groundwork for setting up a European regulatory authority."
"The Commission now has the important job of ensuring the strict compliance with the contents of the directive."
"It must pay close attention to the prices being asked for licences, the Member States' compliance with deadlines and the conditions attached to the licences."
"I think that these will be the most important issues in the immediate future."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to preface my actual report with a few comments on matters of principle, to make the significance of the report clear."
"The commercial use of space satellite systems for global communications is a subject which, only a few years ago, would still have been regarded as something from the realms of science fiction."
"Today, times have changed."
"Technological progress, deregulation and the convergence between broadcasting and telecommunications are currently contributing to the creation of a global satellite infrastructure which in turn opens the way to new commercial applications."
"The SPCS systems - personal communications satellites - under discussion here are only one of many possible examples of new satellite services."
"The step from space travel research projects to the commercial use of satellite communications is of the greatest economic and political importance to Europe."
"Satellite communications offer new markets for European industry and so, of course, also create jobs for the future."
"At the same time, the new satellite systems, especially because of their geographical range, advance the process of economic and social cohesion in Europe and, most of all, the cohesion between Europe and the rest of the world, and thus the development of the global information society."
"Regrettably, however, Europeans have long underestimated this enormous economic and social potential of satellite communications, and so failed to formulate a common policy."
"Exceptions confirm the rule, and I turn to Commissioner Bangemann and point out that encouragement was given here at a very early stage."
"I should like to mention, once again, the WTO Conference in Geneva in November 1995, at which, as far as new systems of frequency distribution and occupation were concerned, the Americans pipped the Europeans at the post."
"The Americans are far ahead of us in the commercial utilization of the new satellite systems, because of Europe's lack of foresight, enterprise and co-ordination."
"American companies are already launching the first satellites - well, the experiments failed because of the carrier system, but they are going to keep on trying."
"I am more than happy that Europe, in general, now seems to be awakening from its slumbers."
"The European Commission's communication on space travel of December 1996 clearly illustrates how important the promotion of applications and markets in satellite communications is for the purposes of improving Europe's competitiveness."
"I therefore welcome, too, the proposed action plan on satellite communications, which will certainly also include the SPCS services, and I hope that it will encourage European industry to take action and invest."
"The most important prerequisites for future investment include legal certainty and agreed procedures for the awarding of frequencies and licences."
"We have already heard about this elsewhere."
"Only a harmonized European policy on approval can prevent fragmentation and allow the satellite services to be introduced quickly."
"Which brings me to my report."
"For Parliament, it is a source of extreme satisfaction that the Council has largely accepted the compromise proposed on the basis of the first reading."
"The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy thus approved the common position unanimously, except for a small, logical change in timing."
"From the institutional standpoint, we have here an excellent example of constructive and pragmatic cooperation between the Parliament, the Council and the Commission."
"I can only hope that this example is followed, and in this context of course, as the rapporteur, I must refer to the laborious procedure with telecom."
"My colleague Mr Glante is one of the most long-suffering Members of Parliament sitting on these committees, and I must say that it is simply unacceptable for so much time to be wasted before the joint procedure with the Council and Commission eventually produces a result on a subject of this kind."
"As proposed by Parliament, the aim now, instead of a selection procedure at EU level, is harmonization in the utilization of frequencies and the approval conditions for satellite services by CEPT."
"However, the mandate for CEPT is tied to a clear schedule."
"Should the Commission or any Member State form the impression, which is entirely conceivable, that work within CEPT is proceeding too slowly, the Commission can take action at EU level."
"It remains to be seen whether CEPT can fulfil its mandate efficiently and effectively and justify the confidence placed in it."
"The co-ordination procedure proposed here is an experimental move."
"If it fails to come off, we shall have to try a different approach."
"The WTO Conference has been mentioned several times previously."
"I need not repeat everything, or the content of the discussions, but the expectation is that about 1700 satellites will be launched into earth orbit in the next few years."
"This number may be slightly too high, but there will be a large number of satellites together, of course, with the preceding valorization of the carrier systems and all the other derived benefits."
"The satellites, of course, will also take the information society a step further along its road, not just terrestrially, in other words with the existing networks, but via satellite to Africa, the island states and the whole world."
"How much added value can be expected from this has also been stated earlier."
"I should like to quote one parameter from a newspaper, which says that the agreement is good news for companies, and of course for consumers too, who now spend more on telecommunications than they do on oil."
"In other words, there are gigantic sums at stake here, and I believe that the regulation we are proposing here will do a great service to the European Union as it moves forward to satellite communication, satellite networking and the networking of the telecommunications sector as a whole, and will thus represent an enormous step forward."
"Thank you for your attention, and I have no doubt that we in this House will adopt a unanimous resolution on this subject."
"Mr President, I want to start by congratulating my colleagues Mr Van Velzen and Mr Hoppenstedt as is customary on these occasions."
"It is a small and select band of us who are involved in this very specialized area."
"I had thought that we should make a giant Advent calendar both for Parliament and the Commission and we could tear off the days as we near the day of liberalization."
"Perhaps fairly soon in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy we will take the opportunity of asking the Commission what will be the consequences in these various respects if we do not meet this self-imposed deadline."
"It is true that these two proposals are key building blocks in meeting that target and I want to say that the Socialist Members of this House will be supporting both these reports."
"Mr Van Velzen has rightly pointed out the long history of the attempts to come up with a position on licensing, and I am very pleased that the emphasis of his work and of the Commission's was that there should be a presumption in favour of general authorizations rather than individual licences."
"We all know that the granting of licences and the conditions attached by some Member States to the granting of licences have been unduly restrictive and protectionist and there are cases before the European Court in this respect."
"Mr Van Velzen is absolutely right that we need to create a clear and predictable licensing environment and of course he is right to say that there should be clear time limits."
"If ever there was a case that 'justice delayed is justice denied' it is in the field of licensing and interconnections currently going through the conciliation process."
"If those who want to enter this market cannot get a licence on clear and fair terms and within a reasonable timescale, that will be a major obstacle to achieving the goal."
"So, we have no hesitation in supporting both Mr Van Velzen and Mr Hoppenstedt."
"In his comments, Mr Hoppensted rightly said that the question of the convergence of the technology and the limitless possibilities of the technology were a guiding factor in the drawing up of his report."
"He is absolutely right."
"He also talked about big money."
"Many people not used to dealing with high finance find that when you start adding on the zeros and the billions it is very difficult to imagine just how all-encompassing this industry is."
"But it is true that many of our hopes, for example, in the field of employment and of life-enhancing technical progress, centre on this particular field."
"I congratulate my colleagues."
"They will have our support when it comes to the vote and we look forward to seeing the Commissioner to discuss both the possibilities and the problems should we fail to meet that target in some respect."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I must start by thanking both rapporteurs most sincerely for their efforts and congratulating them on the results."
"This is an intensely political subject, and one of fundamental interest, too, because the issue here really is the creation of new systems, new market incentives."
"On the one hand we must meet the needs of an open market, and on the other we know that there is a very special need of regulation here."
"I believe, though, that the Commission has been able to find satisfactory answers to most of these questions."
"The situation is that market access can be structured on an objective, non-discriminatory and transparent basis."
"Commissioner Bangemann deserves our sincere thanks for that."
"Starting out with the idea that the issue at present is to bring something to the table that is politically feasible, I expressly welcome the Commission's proposal."
"I would like to add, though, that, in my view, it would have been more desirable, politically and economically, to grant more powers to the European Union institutions in this sector generally, and also in the licensing procedure and in the area of international co-ordination in particular, to enable a more efficient system to be obtained at European and global level."
"I only hope that this failing will not have a seriously disadvantageous effect on Europe in the global race for access to satellite communications services."
"At any rate, the Commission will need to play its part effectively in its role of observation and co-ordination."
"Bearing in mind that the liberalization of the telecommunications sector is scheduled for January 1998, the adoption of a resolution is of course a matter of great urgency."
"I am glad that we have succeeded in taking an important first step in the right direction, even under such heavy time pressure."
"It will be important, though, not to lose sight of further technological developments but to continue adjusting the general conditions to suit developments in this field."
"Once again, many thanks for everything that has been achieved."
"I believe a good start has been made."
"Mr President, I should like to remind Commissioner Bangemann of his days as a social liberal, and to remind him too that social policy can look forward, and not just backward."
"Economics is not a natural process."
"It has to be constituted on the basis of social policy - the not particularly unreconstructed Marxist Polanyi called it 'embedding' - otherwise there is no way in which we can avoid certain destructive tendencies from the outset."
"Now to the reports."
"We too support both reports and congratulate our colleagues."
"The harmonization of licences in the internal market certainly makes sense, though we regard the proposed six-week period as too short."
"My answer to Mr Hoppenstedt is, of course, we would have to have a debate on space travel."
"But that is not what we are doing."
"As I see it, we must think back once again to Parliament's original position, because in this very House we have the problem of the worldwide monopoly which Mr Bangemann has rightly referred to here - I think the issue in question was on-line services."
"That is the task in store for us."
"Unless Europe is given a stronger role, unless the Commission has more opportunities to act, this trial run of the co-ordination procedure will prove something of a lame duck."
"That is what I fear."
"Even so, that is how we are going to have to do it, given the time pressure that has been put on us."
"And I would like to say another word of criticism about that."
"We are once again in a position where we have to decide on individual questions without really having time for a broad strategic debate."
"That is annoying."
"We really ought to be proceeding together, and the Commission's action programme clearly offers a framework for that."
"But we also need to relate this to the detailed debates - the technical debates."
"Unless we succeed in doing that, we shall constantly find ourselves in this kind of rushed situation, and that is a bad thing."
"Even so, we are going to vote in favour now."
"But I would like to make one more point: we must tackle the problem of the global monopoly."
"We must tackle the problem of active, constructive involvement of the European Union within the World Trade Organization, and that will probably require more extensive rules than are to be found in this lame compromise."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Hoppenstedt, it really is very reassuring and helpful to pat one another on the back as far as the TEN telecom consolidation is concerned."
"I think many procedures go very smoothly, very quickly, as this report has shown."
"Some start very quickly and then slow down."
"TEN telecom consolidation got off to a rather laborious start, but I hope we shall be reaching a compromise very shortly."
"Some of my hopes here rest on the Dutch presidency."
"I should like to concentrate on the Hoppenstedt report."
"As the rapporteur very correctly says, Europe is lagging behind the USA, the leaders in matters of satellite communications."
"This is all the more painful in that these satellite communications are a logical complement to the existing high-speed infrastructures, or indeed make them possible in the first place."
"This makes it all the more amazing that the Member States have reacted so negatively to the Commission's proposal and have been unable to agree on a procedure to be implemented by the Commission."
"This reaction is particularly amazing when you consider that it is those same Member States that are constantly calling for a global reaction to global challenges, which certainly include satellite communications."
"It is simply amazing that Europe can reach agreement on a common monetary policy and a common economic policy, and even implement them, but cannot agree on something like leaving the awarding of satellite frequencies to a European institution."
"The compromise proposed by the rapporteur has our support, and is likely to provide an adequate solution to the problem we face."
"I hope that the co-ordination of the selection of service providers and the harmonized use of frequencies, to which the Member States have committed themselves, really will function in practice and will not result in constant, tedious negotiations that will leave Europe even further behind in this area."
"I believe in giving praise where praise is due, so a word of praise for the Council."
"Regarding the conformity of the licensing procedure with the ONP text, there is an unusual degree of unanimity between Council and Parliament, and I welcome that."
"In conclusion, may I thank both rapporteurs and express the hope that Honourable Members will give unrestricted support to this compromise when we come to the vote."
"Mr President, Mrs Read came up with one attractive proposal: the Members of this House - and, I believe, I myself - who have been working for so long on this question of the creation of a functional, efficient telecommunications market should devise a kind of advent calendar on which we can tick off the progress of the final stages between now and 1 January."
"I think this is an excellent idea."
"We must see whether we can make it universally accessible, in which case we shall be able to finance it with charges imposed on mobile telephone operators."
"I could make an alternative suggestion: we can make ourselves a kind of board game and roll some dice."
"If you land on a Council square you have to wait at least three months or move two spaces back."
"At least the various parts played are evened out a little."
"Coming first to Mr Van Velzen's report, I thank him for it."
"We, like Parliament, believe that we need more Europewide regulations and institutions, as you know, and you asked why we changed this standpoint in the Council's discussions."
"The only explanation for that is the Council's continuing attitude."
"If not a single Member State - not even Mrs Jorritsma, who is certainly one of the more liberal members of the Telecommunications Council and now, thank God, its president - is willing, for example, to set up a European body - not in the institutional, technical, legal sense - to which applications can be made for certain kinds of licence, so that the conditions, the scope of the licence and all other associated questions are regulated in a similar way or the same way throughout Europe - then we are still in a situation which is not ready for this kind of regulation."
"We considered whether we should go on waiting for the Directive, which is impossible in view of the date and the legal basis we are creating for national regulations, or whether we should accept a compromise."
"It may be that the compromise is lame or lazy."
"I think Mr Frischenschlager used the world 'lame' - that may well be."
"But at present, probably, nothing more is possible."
"Even so, I will see what view the Council takes of the six amendments which you have tabled and which we all support."
"We support the six amendments without exception - incidentally, please add that fact to the credit account you opened for the Commission up until November."
"We scored a point here, even if not directly with BSE, but we will accept all six amendments."
"In other words, we can check out once again what the Council's attitude is."
"Basically, the problem can be described in simple terms: we certainly need more Europe-wide regulations."
"How that can be achieved is something on which opinions still differ."
"Part of the reason for this is that the Member States have not yet overcome their mistrust of such Europe-wide regulations."
"But the fact that they will be necessary, even from a purely technological standpoint and for the purposes of international competition, as Mr Wolf has said - rightly, on this occasion - is completely obvious."
"So what we need is a kind of confidence-building process, and perhaps we may be able to persuade the Council that we need to set up a kind of informal group, an informal committee, bringing together the various national regulatory authorities, so that the national decisions can be discussed there, and perhaps their negative effects can be discussed too, and then, with luck, a kind of mutual confidence will develop."
"We went through a similar process with the London agency for licensing medicinal products throughout Europe."
"In that case, again, the national experts are incorporated into the decision process, and they quickly acquired confidence both as regards the soundness of the agency's decisions and as regards its impartiality."
"We hope - and I have already discussed this idea with Mrs Jorritsma - that we might succeed in persuading the Council to embark on this kind of informal co-operation, so that this confidence can develop."
"The question remains: will this Directive allow fragmentation into 15 different approval systems?"
"We hope not, because after all we have set up numerous common conditions to which all European licensing procedures must conform."
"So this Directive offers operators, wherever they apply for a licence, guarantees in such areas as the imposing of deadlines, the provision of appeal procedures, which is a particularly important point, the establishment of principles and restrictions for the levying of charges - another important point."
"Mrs Read pointed out that if unacceptably high fees are demanded for such licences, then of course the market is not being opened up to competition, and in fact we do already have a few cases of that kind which we are looking into at present."
"The global procedure envisaged by the Directive, which is intended to make it easier to obtain general and individual licences in certain Member States, and the mechanism for the further harmonization of general licences are examples of moves towards greater convergence."
"I admit that we need more, and we proposed in this House that the effects of the Directive should be reviewed no later than 1999 and new proposals made."
"It may be that we need not wait so long."
"Mr Wolf has constantly pointed out from the beginning, in other words ever since we have been talking about these matters, that we are pursuing what he calls a piecemeal strategy."
"He implied that the Commission was doing this deliberately, pulling the wool over the eyes of those involved, as it were."
"That was not our intention, it was just that we simply have to solve certain problems before the calendar moves round to 1 January 1998."
"Mr Wolf is right, however, in saying that a more general framework legislation is needed for two reasons."
"First for reasons of convergence, to which I have already referred."
"As with the satellites - and I shall be coming to Mr Hoppenstedt's report in due course - all I can do is make the same point: we are already in a situation in which, from the technological standpoint, all the areas of communications and telecommunications, including the media, which had previously been developed in a non-uniform manner, can coalesce."
"That is technically possible today."
"The use of the digital process will break down all the frontiers, and the question of the extent to which standards are required for this has also been answered - everything is available."
"In economic terms, this is not happening, because this is a market and has to ascertain what the consumer really wants and what he is prepared to pay for it."
"That is why we have few economically successful capabilities, as yet, to exploit a convergence that is technologically possible."
"But this will very soon change, because there will be a number of economic opportunities, and those opportunities will increase simply because by doing so they will become cheaper and more attractive."
"One example is electronic commerce: as you know, we made this capability a focal point of our action programme, and I feel sure that it will not just be used for buying and selling goods and services at long range but that the capability it offers will solve other problems too."
"In any case, perhaps, there may be a particular kind of news service, and then the question arises: is that television or not?"
"The Land media institutions in the Federal Republic are going to have to wrap up warmly, and so too are the public service broadcasters."
"Not that I have anything against them, I want to stress that again, so as not to give Mr Wolf the impression that I have completely forgotten my social liberal past. But it is completely clear: the grounds always trotted out by the Federal Constitutional Court for the special position of public radio and television - shortage of resources and an entitlement to a basic service - have ceased to exist!"
"With digital technology and broad-band fibres and other transmission facilities, which will include satellites, a shortage of resources is a thing of the past!"
"As far as the basic services are concerned, you can already obtain anything you want, obtain it from private suppliers if you want to, and obtain it - if you turn to the news stations or other stations - in absolutely the same quality as is provided by public service broadcasters."
"In other words, we need to talk again about what television and radio are and what their relationship is to the available on-line services, etc."
"The upshot of all this will be that we will have to produce a framework law, which we can perhaps refer to as the telecommunications law but will actually cover many other things too, to get to grips with all these questions."
"We must at least define the place where individual regulations are going to have to follow."
"We did originally intend, then, that this would have a stronger impact, but I think the review clause provides us with the possibility of coming back to these questions shortly."
"This applies to the committees, too."
"Obviously it would be better to have a single committee for all these matters, but we really haven't reached that stage yet, and so we should start to make a stealthy approach!"
"Now I come to the report by my friend Karsten Hoppenstedt."
"I think, Mr President, that I can once again take the opportunity to talk until we come to the vote, unless you want to have a break."
"This is an unfair advantage for the Commission, admittedly, and I don't want to overdo it."
"Mr Hoppenstedt has already made all the important points."
"First, it really was important to draw attention to the problem generally."
"All the developments taking place in this sector are so new that they are often beyond the compass of those who deal with them, and they think to themselves, well, let it happen, and when it has happened, then we'll see what we have to do."
"And that is completely wrong!"
"Not only that, but this is a fine illustration of a principle of modern industrial policy."
"Unless political authorities intervene at a very early stage in these processes of technological development and economic exploitation, not always in a regulatory sense but with a view to developing these possibilities, then the process loses its dynamism."
"It is completely clear, and very easy to see from the ITU decision, that the Europeans - our Member States - had simply failed to recognize as yet what the significance of personal satellite communications would be."
"I see a frown from the Council - it really is nice that the Council is represented here, for once, and we are glad to see it."
"Of course you are free to frown, Madam, but you have no reason to."
"Because when I first spoke about this problem at the Telecommunications Council, not all Ministers were acquainted with the fact that this decision had been made."
"Of course, one can and must have a frequency."
"We could just as well have been in a position to apply for a frequency for ourselves as well, but we hadn't got that far and our industry sees the only way out as being to acquire holdings in these American companies."
"Well, nothing wrong with that!"
"I am no protectionist, I am no chauvinist, and of course American companies must have the same opportunity to compete as any other companies."
"But if European companies are not represented at all, if they are simply absent, then that should arouse the interest of the politicians and they should do something."
"So I welcome the position Mr Hoppenstedt has adopted."
"I hope we will succeed in convincing the Council further, and there are some signs of that."
"We had a conference in Paris, at which the Member States and the industry were represented, and there was a major opening-up of the debate there."
"I would like to make that point now, in justice to the Council and the Member States."
"Something has changed, the climate is different."
"We have to be quick now."
"Because what Karsten Hoppenstedt said was right: if that booster rocket hadn't come a cropper, the first satellites would already be in place."
"Not only that, but we have a unique opportunity, in terms of technical developments, to bring about a combination of stationary satellites with the new Leos, something which in turn would give us a certain edge."
"So we should work energetically on that."
"I should also like to thank Parliament expressly for the conciliation we have achieved so far."
"Thank heavens, we have been able to achieve initial positions in the TEN telecom question which could also help to advance satellite communications, in particular."
"I hope that the Council will also be able to adopt this position, which has now developed in consultation with the Parliament, because then we could encourage and promote - partly by deploying funds which, though inadequate, will at least act as an incentive - implementation and further development work on these systems."
"That, Mr President, is what needs saying about Mr Hoppenstedt's report."
"I am of course willing to adopt the points he has made, and especially the point that we should endeavour to co-operate intelligently with the existing organizations, in other words with CEPT."
"We have no intention of circumventing existing organizations that are doing a good job, but it also makes sense to set a deadline, because that makes it clear that we can also act independently if need be."
"I could continue for another 20 minutes, but I think that would be overdoing it."
"And a coffee break does seem like a good idea."
"Thank you very much."
"Thank you, Commissioner Bangemann."
"Since we still have a few minutes left, I can invite the two rapporteurs to speak again, if they so wish."
"Mr President, you will not be surprised to hear that I am very pleased with the Commissioner's reply."
"I have noted that six airmails are booked in with Mr Böge, the chairman of the BSE Committee of Inquiry."
"I shall personally ensure via the interconnection that it also happens."
"The second point I wish to make is the following: I agree with the Commissioner that working towards a European Regulatory Authority will be heavy weather."
"I welcome your start with an informal working group in the Council."
"But I also urge that the Commission should perhaps make a start on a kind of help desk which can contribute towards creating a relationship of confidence with the national regulatory authorities."
"I believe that could become a confidenceinspiring move."
"Finally I would like to ask this: you have just received, as I understand it, a very voluminous study on the added value of a European Regulatory Authority and I wonder if you are prepared to forward a copy of it to Parliament, or at least to those people who are on your advent calendar."
"Thank you, Mr Van Velzen."
"Commissioner Bangemann, would you like to respond?"
"I didn't actually want to continue the debate."
"But I am glad that the Commissioner has offered to make it available via the worldwide web."
"We probably know what you're offering us; otherwise I might have to give the exact number."
"But that can probably be obtained easily enough."
"I am very grateful that we can now opt for this form of access."
"Perhaps we should run a test and make it available only over the worldwide web, to find out how many Honourable Members really are connected to it."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
"(The sitting was suspended at 11.50 a.m. and resumed at 12 noon)"
"Mr Gollnisch, as you were speaking, I was wondering which of the Rules of Procedure your intervention was based on, but in any case we are not going to debate the matter."
"Votes"
"Mr President, since this is an unusual procedure, we need to be absolutely clear about what we are voting on."
"The question is whether mobile telephony should be included in this Directive or not."
"That is a very fundamental matter, and so we will be voting yes or no on this question."
"I believe that the voting procedure should be made absolutely clear, so that all of us really are certain about what point we are voting on."
"Mr von Wogau, the chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy is right."
"It is a crucial amendment and I hope colleagues here will vote for it."
"But to be absolutely clear, it does not ask for mobile phones to be included in every aspect of this proposal, only in certain key aspects covering the funding of universal service and consumer protection."
"Then people really will be clear what they are being asked to vote on."
"(Parliament adopted the draft legislative resolution)"
"Mr President, this vote was on the agenda yesterday, but it was postponed in order that the procedure could be clarified."
"This relates to maximum residue limits in veterinary medical products of animal origin."
"The proposal is in two parts."
"One changes the timetable so that instead of the original directive expiring in 1996 as it did, it would expire much later because the Commission needs the extra time in order to assess the substances."
"The second part relates to the substances themselves and frankly, it is not possible for Parliament to assess that part in the time we have available."
"We were asked for urgency on one article, and one article only."
"This created some difficulty."
"Between yesterday and now I have taken further advice from Parliament's services."
"We have consulted with Mr Bangemann's cabinet and also with the Commission's legal advisor."
"We are all agreed that the present urgency procedure, as requested by the Council on 11 February, applies only to the extension of the time limit for setting MRLs for certain old substances."
"We all recognize - Mr Bangemann and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection - that this time-limit has to be prolonged."
"We are also therefore agreed that as long as Parliament votes only on that issue, it cannot be regarded as having given its opinion on the whole original proposal."
"Mr Bangemann, in effect, said this yesterday."
"He also said yesterday that if, by any chance, the Council tried to adopt legislation based on the original proposal, he would simply withdraw it."
"I would be grateful if the Commissioner would reiterate that for the benefit of Members who were not present at yesterday's debate, because a great many people were coming into the Chamber when Mr Bangemann had us in thrall with his speech."
"He made a speech in English, French and German yesterday."
"He is to be congratulated on his linguistic skill."
"However, what we have done is this. I have asked Parliament's services to produce a revised draft legislative resolution as a kind of ad hoc way out of this difficulty."
"That ad hoc resolution has been discussed with the political groups this morning and they have, so far as I am aware, all accepted it."
"The revised text is available but unfortunately only in English because of the time constraints."
"It may be that you would want it to be read aloud."
"I am happy to do that."
"In conclusion, subject to whether you want me to read it out or not, I recommend to the House that it votes, first of all, only on the Environment Committee amendment to Article 14 of the Commission proposal and on the revised draft legislative resolution in respect of which no amendments at all have been tabled."
"The relevant amendment - if I remember rightly - is Amendment No 8, originally tabled by Mrs Jensen, and there is an all-party agreement on that."
"If the House will agree to that then it can make both Mr Bangemann and myself happy at the same time."
"This is a coincidence which has not always been achieved."
"Mr President, I am glad that yesterday's efforts have produced a result."
"It was probably an avoidable misunderstanding, but such misunderstandings often have more serious consequences than the unavoidable kind."
"To make things completely clear, let me place the following on record: the Council requested the urgency procedure only for Article 14, the provision which is intended to extend the time limit for the evaluation of substances already on the market, in order to fill a legal vacuum that exists."
"Parliament's opinion, therefore, can logically and with complete legal propriety only relate to Article 14."
"This means that Parliament has not yet been consulted on the actual substance of the proposal, but only on Article 14."
"The Council, meaning the presidency, has again stated in a letter to Mr Collins and myself, and to others, that the Council does not decide on matters of substance until Parliament has expressed its opinion on them."
"So the Council will not be taking any final decision."
"The Council has confirmed that in writing."
"But since Parliament still has doubts - I don't know whether distrust is the right word - there are certain doubts about the Council, not about the Commission, on this occasion, Mrs Roth-Behrendt, you trust the Commission blindly..."
"(Noise, heckling) ... all right, let's say certain Members of the Commission, let's limit it to that."
"Obviously I cannot speak for the Council; I myself do not share these doubts, in view of the letter, but if the Council, contrary to all expectation, should take or wanted to take a general decision, the Commission will withdraw its proposal so as to make that impossible."
"(Parliament adopted the draft legislative resolution)"
"The Green Group has pointed out that in the Dutch translation of this report, the expression 'sexuele geaardheid' should be considered replaced by the expression 'sexuele voorkeur' ."
"Mr President, back-door attempts are being made to replace the normal term in Dutch 'seksuele geaardheid' (sexual orientation) with a term which is not usual in Dutch, namely 'seksuele voorkeur' (sexual preference)."
"The translation of the English 'sexual orientation' is 'seksuele geaardheid' ; I object to the back-door way in which an attempt is being made to change the content of the Dutch text."
"Mr President, this kind of problem is far from simple, it is all connected with so-called political correctness and we must be careful here in this House; ' seksuele geaardheid' (sexual orientation) is a very correct term, also politically correct term, in Dutch society and that is the one that should be used in this report."
"Mr President, I have been speaking Dutch for 53 years and Mr Blokland is absolutely right."
"Before the final vote on the report"
"Mr President, before we proceed to the final vote and pursuant to Rule 129 of the Rules of Procedure, I should like to propose that the report be referred back to committee."
"I would remind the House that the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights rejected Mrs Lindholm's report and that, at the end of a long debate, we unanimously agreed to submit the Commission's proposal to Parliament unamended."
"Amendments have been tabled by some political groups."
"Those who had tabled other amendments in the Legal Affairs Committee have refrained from doing so, in line with the spirit of that committee's decision."
"But I believe it is out of order for amendments to have been proposed and voted upon, and I think that respect for the powers of the Legal Affairs Committee requires that the text should be referred back to it for a decision, in any case, in the light of the decisions taken in this House."
"Mr President, I agree with the proposal made by my colleague, Mr Fabre-Ausprey, for reasons I do not need to repeat here; I know I am one of the people to whom he has alluded."
"I, too, believe that this document should be referred back to the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, which could then resubmit it to this House."
"Mr President, what I was going to say has in fact already been said, which is that we agreed in committee to proceed in this way."
"In addition, unless I have totally misunderstood the order of proceedings, Parliament can put forward their proposals in the part session."
"I am therefore in favour of voting here and not reverting to the committee."
"(Parliament rejected the proposal to refer the report back to committee)"
"(Parliament adopted the draft legislative resolution)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first I want to express the recognition and appreciation of those of us who have signed up to this solution, to the Members who have worked so hard on the draft resolution on Algeria. At the same time I want to remember what we all know: that Algeria is experiencing a terrible tragedy."
"Parliament passed a resolution on Algeria in December."
"Yesterday we listened to a statement from the President of the Council which struck me as extremely cautious."
"I believe - and the Members who signed with me believe - we should think again before approving a resolution which contains certain statements many of us do not agree with."
"There is no urgency because we passed a resolution in December, and the matter needs further thought, so we think it is better to adjourn the debate for two months."
"Besides, haste is always inadvisable."
"And I will give you the proof, Mr President: I have before me various language versions of the document we are supposed to be voting on, which contains only one amendment - Amendment No 1."
"In every text, in the different languages, Amendment No 1, which seeks to add a new paragraph 7, refers to the situation in Sarajevo and Mostar."
"You will have realised already that this has very little to do with Algeria."
"It is a material error, but it reflects the haste with which we sometimes deal with such delicate matters."
"So I request this adjournment under Rule 131 of our Rules of Procedure."
"Mr President, I agree with Mr Cohn-Bendit, that goes without saying."
"(Parliament rejected the request to postpone the vote) Joint motion for a resolution, on behalf of the ELDR Group, the PSE Group, the ARE Group, the V Group, the GUE/NGL Group, and the PPE Group, to replace the following motions for resolutions: B4-0061/97, B4-0067/97, B4-0086/97, B4-0097/97, B4-0145/97 and B4-0146/97, concerning the situation in Algeria"
"(Parliament rejected the joint motion for a resolution)"
"I put it to Parliament that the sitting should be extended for a few minutes, so that we may vote on the Caccavale report."
"(Parliament rejected the proposal)"
"I voted for the Van Velzen report with some reservations."
"Licences issued for mobile telephone networks need to be creative of user-friendly systems."
"They should not be allowed to create monopolistic arrangements for air-time providers."
"Experience shows that they issued 'locked in' contracts and are guilty of overcharging for their services."
"I would like to see greater real competition which would result in realistic charging and higher standards of consumer service."
"Gebhardt report (A4-0003/97)"
"The general system for the recognition of diplomas and other educational qualifications was adopted in 1989 (between 1991 and 1994, 11, 000 people obtained recognition of their diplomas)."
"It was supplemented in 1992 in respect of courses involving less than three years' higher education."
"However, this system does not cover every situation."
"Professions which have been the subject of specific mutual recognition directives (six medical professions and architecture) and those in the fields of trade, industry and crafts are excluded from the scope of application of the general system."
"Today's proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive relates exclusively to professions in the fields of trade, industry and craft."
"For some years, these professions have been the subject of 35 directives of two types: liberalizing directives to eliminate the various obstacles (such as the nationality condition) to freedom of establishment and the provision of services; and transitional directives to guarantee recognition of acquired experience in the absence of mutual recognition of diplomas."
"The proposal is that a single directive should be adopted to confirm the regulatory provisions of the 35 existing directives and introduce procedural guarantees for applicants with a view to simplifying Community legislation and increasing its transparency."
"This is very important!"
"The Member States are obliged to grant the application for recognition when the applicant's qualifications are equivalent to those of a citizen of the host country."
"If these qualifications cannot be attested, the applicant must produce proof (with information relating to good repute, financial standing and proof of the existence of insurance) that he possesses the requisite qualifications."
"The State's decision, then, has to be taken within a brief period (within four months from the making of the application) and must be supported by a statement of reasons."
"This underpins the rights of the citizens and helps to promote mobility and the implementation of freedom of movement and, consequently, the reduction of unemployment within the European Union."
"The European Parliament wishes the Commission to inform it, and the Council, of the application of the directive in the Member States."
"It also wishes to reserve the right to participate in any decision on an amendment to the directive."
"I am fighting for a civic Europe - a Europe of citizens."
"The proposal and the Gebhardt report are moves in that direction."
"That is why I support them, and I congratulate the rapporteur."
"Articles 52 and 57 of the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community make provision for freedom of establishment and the free provision of services."
"These articles are of direct application, as established by the decisions of the Court of Justice."
"This means that professionals - doctors, lawyers, architects, engineers, etc - are entitled to provide their services and pursue their activities in another Member State."
"They are, in any event, required to join the professional register in the country in which they intend to pursue their activities and to respect its ethical rules."
"The professional association of the host Member State is required to recognize the qualification issued by the authorities in the Member State of origin."
"But certain problems have arisen, with some national governing authorities pointing to major differences between training/specialization courses or even between university courses."
"By so doing, they have denied or severely obstructed recognition of the qualification concerned."
"To get round these problems, the EC adopted a set of harmonization directives concerning particular professions (vertical directives)."
"In 1989, Directive 89/48/EEC introduced a new horizontal system applicable to all qualifications and diplomas."
"This system was subsequently complemented by Directive 92/51/EEC, for qualifications acquired on completion of courses lasting less than three years."
"The general system so set up for the mutual recognition of diplomas and qualifications means that liberal professionals may exercise their activities in any Member State."
"The obligations with which they must comply are as follows:"
"they must have a valid diploma or qualification that gives them access to the profession in a Member State; -they must be in legal possession of the appropriate professional qualification and be a member of the appropriate national association; -they must join the professional register in the country in which they intend to pursue their activities.The governing authorities of the Member State cannot refuse to recognize valid qualifications and diplomas issued by the country of origin."
"They can only, on justified grounds, require awareness of the ethical rules of the profession."
"The report produced by Mrs Gebhardt concerns a proposal for a directive which would include professions originally governed by sectoral directives in the general system for the mutual recognition of diplomas and qualifications."
"This would complete the general system for the mutual recognition of diplomas and qualifications and, for this reason, our group will be voting in favour of the report."
"Mr President, I am especially keen to support this report today as, like many of my colleagues, I have been angry to learn of well-qualified people from my own constituency who have been denied jobs in other Member States."
"In my view there can be no excuse for further delay from national governments in this area."
"One of the great attractions of the EU for many skilled people should be that they have the option to follow their careers in other parts of Europe if they so wish."
"I particularly welcome the idea that, in cases where the authorities refuse to recognize someone's qualifications, they should be obliged to allow that person to submit evidence of their knowledge or experience."
"It is also important that these new proposals from the Commission allow for a right to take cases to the courts."
"By all means let the Commission report back on how well governments implement these measures within five years - but I urge all my colleagues with similar cases to bring them to the Commission's attention as I have done this week."
"Five years is too long to ask our constituents to wait for their skills to be valued across the European Union."
"Read report (A4-0049/97)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are a few months away from completing the liberalization of the European telecommunications market, and we already have a number of directives on the subject."
"They complement each other, sometimes overlap each other and even contradict each other, and here we are today amending a directive before it is even applicable."
"I know how technical the issue is, and what is at stake, but I do regret the fact that the procedures are so cumbersome and the texts so unreadable, just ten months away from what will be nothing short of an economic and psychological revolution."
"Nevertheless, I do have the opportunity today to restate our commitment to the universal telecommunications service in a competitive market."
"This concept is quite a novel one, and it is the result of a grim struggle by a majority in the European Parliament."
"It enables our concerns to be refocused on the consumer, even if not as completely as we would like, and that in itself is very important."
"If, as one might expect, liberalization has beneficial effects for the telecommunications market, there are also some who say that competition will bring positive benefits for the consumer, and we can hope that it will."
"But it must also be said that the market is never aware of the imperatives of planning, of equal access to the service for all, and of social justice for underprivileged groups or areas."
"So although, like the rapporteur, I commend the efforts made by the Commission to take due account of these factors, I also say that we must be vigilant in supporting anything that contributes to social cohesion and the installation of a genuine universal service."
"What is more, at this stage of the procedure, and with the benefit of hindsight, I mistrust the amendments which the Commission, and especially the Council, will make to this text."
"That is why I believe that Parliament must send out a very strong signal along these lines."
"The undersigned have voted for those points in the Read report which we consider of most benefit to the consumer."
"At the same time we are, in principle, against commercialisation and so called market making for the basic infrastructure."
"This process has led to the destruction and fragmentation of the infrastructure to the detriment of system distribution. It has produced a lower level of openness and increased differences in standards between regions and consumer groups."
"Coordination between national, state telecommunications companies would have provided greater and fairer technical development and rationalisation."
"The Swedish example before liberalisation is an illustration of this."
"The Danish Social Democrats have today voted in favour of the report on the ONP conditions for the voice telephone service and provision of the necessary supply services in the area of telecommunications."
"The Danish Social Democrats are very satisfied with the report and welcome it in the campaign for a general deregulation of the telecommunications market."
"The Danish Social Democrats agree that consumers must, as a general rule, be offered services such as connections and reasonable prices, but we do not believe that the only possible way of ensuring this service is a situation in which Member States are required to introduce arrangements for the financing of these necessary services."
"The Danish Social Democrats agree that it must be possible to make emergency calls from public pay-phones free of charge, but taking account of the prospect of disproportionately high costs, we are not in favour of the idea that there should be pay-phones for the transmission of written texts to the same, or to a similar, extent as there are ordinary publicly accessible pay-phones."
"The Danish Social Democrats agree that services based on telephone transmission should be available to consumers at a reasonable price, either free of charge or for a nominal sum, but we do not feel Member States should have to cover any difference that might arise between the actual cost of the service and the reasonable price paid by the consumer."
"The Danish Social Democrats agree that a subscriber should be protected against having his telephone disconnected in cases where, for instance, there is a dispute between the subscriber and his telephone company over the validity of a telephone bill; on the other hand, we would make it clear that it is generally a reasonable contractual consequence for a telephone to be disconnected if the bill is not paid."
"Lindholm report (A4-0046/97)"
"Mr President, I believe this report contains a number of highly dubious provisions."
"First, it appears to legitimize positive discrimination in favour of women."
"The distinction which the rapporteur makes between formal freedoms and real freedoms is worryingly reminiscent, to me, of the distinction made by the Marxists in this context, and we know that where there were no formal freedoms there were no real freedoms either."
"I am inclined to say that 'where there is no formal equality, there is no real equality either' ."
"The second point I would like to challenge relates to the implicit recognition of homosexual marriage."
"It is not up to me, any more than it is up to anyone in this House, to pass judgement on what takes place between consenting adults."
"The problem is whether the community should be required to acknowledge forms of union which are not geared to procreation."
"Procreation is the only reason for the social protection enjoyed by marriage, and it is the reason why I still believe it is undesirable, in our society as in any other society, for the law to give special protection to other forms of union."
"The principle of equality of opportunity and treatment between men and women is one of the philosophical foundations of our European Parliament."
"It is right that the Community institutions should echo that, and the proposal for a regulation which is before us is along the right lines."
"Our rapporteur has made various proposals regarding that regulation which we can only endorse."
"One of these is the establishment of an equal opportunities committee within each institution."
"Furthermore, and in the context of the benefits and rights granted to married officials, the rapporteur would like to extend those provisions to unmarried couples, whether heterosexual or homosexual."
"Parliament would do itself credit if it were to draw up identical rules for all individuals, whatever may be their sexual orientation or their attitude to marriage."
"The problem is, quite simply, one of justice."
"We are very pleased today to learn that Parliament has voted in favour of abolishing discrimination against homosexuals and increasing equality between men and women employees in the EU institutions by proposing concrete changes to the rules of service which are approximately 50 years old."
"As the amendment proposals are totally in line with the Commission's proposal and are a tangible version of this, we urge the Commission to act in accordance with Parliament's decision as soon as possible."
"The Danish Social Democrats have today voted in favour of the European Parliament's report on the Commission's proposal to change the regulations governing civil servants in EU institutions."
"The purpose of this, on the one hand, is to promote equality of treatment for both men and women in terms of employment conditions."
"On the other hand it is aimed at extending the ban on discrimination, so that this will also include sexual orientation."
"The Danish Social Democrats have a positive attitude to promoting equality between men and women."
"We therefore support the report in as much as it simultaneously provides opportunity for promoting the rights of homosexual men and women in EU institutions and, in the longer term, provides a good starting point for promoting opportunities open to them in the Member States."
"Whitehead report (A4-0317/96)"
"Mr President, the protection and defence of consumers, that is, all of us, is one of the cornerstones in the construction and development of the single market and the Treaty on Union."
"But the third Consumer Policy Programme (1996-1998) is inexplicably lacking in many of the advantages and positive measures of the previous programme."
"Basically, the third programme is a wish-list for European consumers, without clear and specific commitments."
"The programme's 'priorities for action' cover a wide variety of spheres involving consumers' interests, but, I repeat, they are vague and imprecise, like almost everything else the Commission has presented recently."
"Once again, it must be stressed that if we want to make progress properly and effectively, the Commission's first priority must be to complete outstanding activities and consolidate and evaluate the work done in the period 19931995, so that this new programme can be set up on the basis of experience."
"None of this has been done, and besides, the programme lacks a coherent strategy, a timetable of specific commitments, an action plan, and so on, to progress consumer policy in line with consumers' interests."
"The amendments tabled battle to improve it, but if these serious gaps are not filled it will be difficult for the Union to boast that the citizen, as consumer, is one of its priorities."
"These points will determine my vote."
"We have voted in favour of the Whitehead report as we are very anxious to improve consumer protection in the Union."
"There are currently considerable shortcomings in this area and we support many of the proposals which have been put forward in the report."
"But we think that the main problem, that the free movement of goods is considered more important under EU law than environmental and consumer considerations, is not sufficiently highlighted."
"We are totally opposed to point 19 in the report which expresses its support for the EU propaganda campaign for a single currency."
"It is a good thing that the position of consumers is to be strengthened on the internal market through increased consumer information, better labelling of food, and better access to resources and raw materials etc. This section of the report is good."
"The long term goal must be to improve the standing of environmental and consumer demands on the market."
"But we cannot support the EU's minutely detailed regulation which is proposed through the introduction of common rules for distance selling of financial services, for interest on late payment by creditors, for sanctions for non payment and the harmonisation of collection procedures."
"We are also against point 19 in the report which expresses support for the publicity campaign for the Euro."
"Marinucci report (A4-0048/97)"
"It is sensible to strengthen consumer rights and interests in the area of financial services, banks and insurance services for example."
"But there is no reason to regulate all this at EU level for example by regulating distance selling of financial services."
"This is why I have voted against this report."
"That concludes voting time."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.25 p.m. and resumed at 3.00 p.m.)"
"Mr Caccavale has the floor for a point of order."
"Mr President, I asked the previous chairman, Mr Anastassopoulos, if my report could be voted on this morning."
"Now, quite unexpectedly, the agenda for this morning's vote has been changed and I have not had the opportunity to put my report to the vote."
"There are now two possibilities: either we put the report to the vote this afternoon, immediately after the motion for censure, or - and this is the option both I and my group would prefer - we postpone it until the next part-session in March, since, obviously, this evening's vote would not have the same significance."
"Thank you very much, Mr Caccavale."
"You have already detected the 'enthusiasm' aroused by the possibility of having to vote on your report after the vote on the motion of censure."
"I think it is preferable, for your own report and for the agenda, if we take it in March."
"Thank you for giving us that opportunity."
"Mr President, I refer to the decision you have just made at the request of the rapporteur to put this off until March."
"Presumably he cannot be here this afternoon."
"Before you make that decision, could you check with the Council programme to see whether or not this might be on a Council agenda."
"If it is, that decision is quite unacceptable."
"I will check and try to make sure the Council is present."
"Thank you very much for your advice, Mr Collins."
"Mr President, I do not think the point is whether the Council should be here."
"The point is that there is still a voting session tonight and tomorrow morning."
"If the rapporteur is here, are we to understand that he is not going to be here for the voting session?"
"He could be here and his report could be voted then as anybody else's would be if it could not be dealt with earlier."
"Mrs Green, I did not refer to some personal reason of the rapporteur's."
"I said voting on this report immediately afterwards could delay our business."
"And as the rapporteur offered two options I welcomed the second, which presents no problem: voting on the report next month."
"I think the Council will be present, if it feels that is appropriate, and we will do everything we can to make sure that it is, but as the decision has been taken and no problem has been raised at this time, it is agreed that the vote will take place next month."
"Welcome"
"I have the honour of welcoming an official delegation from the United States Congress, led by Mr Benjamin Gilman, chairman of the Committee for International Relations of the House of Representatives of the United States."
"This delegation, the most long-standing of our delegations from third countries, is in Strasbourg to take part in the forty-sixth interparliamentary meeting between the European Parliament and the United States Congress."
"Our transatlantic relations are entering a crucial stage at this time and we are facing many new challenges throughout the world."
"I really do hope that the parliamentary exchanges we have over the next few days will reinforce our existing solid relationship."
"I wish the delegation from the United States Congress a pleasant stay in Strasbourg."
"BSE (Vote on motion of censure)"
"Mr Happart has the floor for a point of order."
"Mr President, this is not a point of order but a procedural motion."
"I should like to know what Mr Santer is going to do for the human victims and for their families."
"(Mixed reactions) What Mr Santer is going to do about..."
"(The President interrupted the speaker) who betrayed the inter-institutional agreement..."
"Mr Happart, you no longer have the floor."
"You asked me for the floor in order to table a procedural motion, but this is not one."
"We discussed this matter at length the other day, and the Commission gave such explanations as it felt to be relevant."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"(Parliament rejected the motion of censure)"
"Madam President, at the risk of delaying the proceedings, I should like to give my explanation of vote - or more accurately, my group's explanation of vote - orally, because the Presidency, yesterday, did not allow me to finish a point of order which explained the majority voting position of the group of the European Radical Alliance."
"Today, therefore, I want to make it clear what the position of our group was, and why a majority of us voted in favour of censure."
"First, however, I should like to repeat my regret regarding the procedure selected for the various votes on the BSE crisis."
"By deciding to vote yesterday on the report by the Committee of Inquiry and the oral questions relating to that text, Parliament indubitably weakened the censure initiative and so helped to undermine one of its own most important prerogatives."
"That was why our group, the Radical Alliance, did not take part in the vote on 19 February."
"Otherwise, just to make things clear, if we voted in favour of the censure motion, that decision was in no way directed against the Commission as an institution - quite the contrary."
"The position of the radicals was dictated by their view of the European institutions."
"We are federalists, which is why we regard the Commission as a precursor of the possible Federal Government of tomorrow."
"And if we want public opinion to stop regarding the European Commission as a technical, opaque and irresponsible administrative body, we must give it a political responsibility - a responsibility which is permanent, single and collegiate."
"That explains the vote by the Radical Alliance."
"Madam President, I voted in favour of the censure motion because I do not wish to be an accomplice of the Commission in this serious affair."
"I am aware of the responsibilities of the Delors Commission, but those of the present Commission are overwhelming, because Mr Santer and his colleagues 'knew' for two years!"
"As soon as they knew, they should have alerted the institutions, the Member States, public opinion."
"They failed to do so, because it was Mr Major who took that initiative last spring."
"As soon as they knew, they should have proposed the necessary steps to protect public health."
"They failed to do so!"
"As soon as they knew, they should have given their loyal support to the parliamentary Committee of Inquiry!"
"They failed to do so."
"And, today, the Commission is refusing to safeguard the moral, material and financial interests of the Community and its citizens by taking the necessary steps against a Member State."
"As the protegé of Parliament, the Commission is emerging from this crisis weakened and discredited."
"I am sorry to see it - it is not good for the institutions and it is not good for Europe."
"A better solution would have been a strong vote of censure, to enable a new, reconstituted Commission to return to work in a healthier climate."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted against the censure motion."
"Bearing in mind the exceptional gravity of the BSE affair, I should like to explain that vote orally."
"The Committee of Inquiry, under the talented leadership of its Chairman, Mr Böge, did a remarkable job."
"President Santer and Mrs Bonino - and, incidentally, we are very glad that Mrs Bonino is now in charge of an essential part of the department in question, in accordance with the structural reform we wanted - responded favourably yesterday to some of our questions regarding major points in Mr Medina's excellent report."
"Our duty is to remain vigilant, and it is with regard to that strategy of vigilance that differences of opinion have arisen."
"Some of us felt it was right to vote in favour of immediate censure, but the majority thought that the threat of censure would be a more effective way of exerting pressure to ensure that our recommendations are in fact put into practice - more effective than packing the Commissioners off home when virtually none of them has done anything at all discreditable."
"I shared that point of view and supported the joint motion for a resolution, which recommended that procedure in point 7."
"It seemed to me, therefore, that voting to put the Commission to the test one day and then voting for immediate censure the next would be totally contradictory and would never be understood by the public."
"A choice had to be made."
"Each of us voted with his conscience."
"Personally, I am at ease with the choice I made."
"I am deeply convinced that the strategy adopted by Parliament yesterday, by a very large majority, will be seen during the coming months to be the most effective way of preventing such crises."
"Madam President, I was one of the 71 signatories to the motion of censure against the Commission, and I am one of the 118 Members who voted in its favour."
"My purpose in tabling that motion and voting for it was not particularly to condemn any individual Commissioner but to censure the whole of the Commission, the Commission as a collegiate body, the Commission in its entirety and as a continuing entity, both before and after the changes of 1995."
"I shall not dwell on the grounds for the censure."
"It was necessary to sanction certain serious irregularities, especially those so ably expounded by my colleague Edouard des Places in his speech on Tuesday. 'Responsible but not guilty' is a formula we reject, and one that I reject personally."
"If it had been censured, the Commission would in all probability have been reappointed immediately, but no one could have said that we had done nothing."
"Well, the motion of censure will have an effect even so."
"As with the investiture of President Santer, as with what is going to happen next month with Community transit, the European Parliament has denounced it, the European Parliament has condemned it, and at the end of the day the European Parliament has backed down."
"After this unsuccessful motion of censure, this backing down, there will be no more motions of censure."
"That is one of the beneficial effects of this operation."
"Madam President, I did not vote in favour of censuring the Commission."
"Not that I wasn't tempted to do so."
"I even recommended my group to support the censure vote, last week, and I regret the fact that the principal groups in this Parliament - including my own - thought it better not to censure the Commission with a clear, massive and immediate vote."
"I regret it because such a vote, apart from sanctioning a Commission which I freely accept was not solely or even principally responsible, would have been a salutary shot across the bows of the institutions and the Member States, a few months away from the IGC, inviting them to question a decision-making system which has displayed its fundamental flaws, bureaucratic opacity, dilution of responsibility, and a system of sanctions which is rigid yet full of holes, making it impossible to reach the guilty parties and forcing us to sanction the whole Commission for the fault of one Member - slaughtering the herd, as it were, because of a single sickly animal."
"I understand that the groups did not share our view - neither my own group nor the Socialist Group."
"So we had a choice between two attitudes: a vote of no political significance to express individual disapproval, or supporting a strategy of conditional censure which does have some real value."
"Mrs Fontaine has said everything that needed saying."
"Personally, I made a choice between the ethic of conviction and the ethic of responsibility - between a politically insignificant protest and an effort to induce the Commission to put its house in order."
"Madam President, on Tuesday night in this House I made my position clear in a speech on BSE."
"I said that Northern Ireland had been sinned against, both by the United Kingdom Government and by the Commission, as well as by the Council of Ministers and Parliament."
"Yesterday I voted against the joint resolution on the findings of this special Committee of Inquiry on BSE because I do not believe that any British minister is answerable in law to this Parliament or any of its committees."
"On Monday night, as a member of that British Parliament, I voted a censure motion against Mr Douglas Hogg."
"I also totally opposed the findings of the Committee of Inquiry in demanding that compensation money paid to UK farmers be paid back."
"Consequently, I could not today vote for the censure motion on the Commission tabled by those who want what I believe to be outrageous measures applied to my country."
"That is why I abstained in this vote."
"Madam President, I abstained."
"This is a difficult position to be in."
"I know it amounts to not voting in favour of censure, but I didn't want to vote against it either, because I believe that the deferred censure formula is the right one."
"It is the right one if we regard the next few months as a sort of stay of execution, which the Commission must use to carry through essential reforms."
"I am not sure how determined the Commission is in this respect. Furthermore, the way in which President Santer has just left the Chamber once the vote had gone his way might give us cause for scepticism and anxiety."
"But it should be clearly understood that many of us - many of us who, today, did not vote for censure - will vote for it at the end of the year unless the essential reforms have been instituted."
"That is why the Commission would be wrong to regard today's vote as giving it free rein."
"A clear-sighted view would be to regard it as a serious warning, because today's vote was a success for those who tabled the motion of censure."
"Madam President, it has been said that one cannot blame a new Commission for the old Commission's negligence."
"I agree with this view."
"Both Commissions deserve blame."
"The former Commission, through its negligence, was guilty of manslaughter."
"The present Commission has covered up this offence and has refused to cooperate so that a full explanation can be reached."
"In my view this is even more culpable than the actions of the former Commission, and this is my reason for not supporting the majority view about postponement, but instead to hold a vote of no confidence today."
"I have no confidence in the Commission."
"A Commission which will not even issue a telephone list of the Commission's employees."
"Such a Commission's disregard for general democratic principles, and the general principles of transparency, does not deserve confidence, but replacement."
"We representatives of the Suomen Keskusta party in the European Parliament consider that the Commission has been guilty of serious negligence in dealing with BSE."
"We supported the resolution adopted by Parliament on Tuesday although in various respects we considered its formulation inadequate."
"We did not support the vote of no confidence in the Commission because the worst negligence was committed during the previous Commission's term of office."
"We supported the resolution calling on the Commission to take speedy and effective measures to prevent the spread of BSE."
"If the Commission fails to carry out the measures called for by Parliament in this resolution, we are prepared to give serious consideration to a vote of no confidence in the Commission."
"As a member of the Parliamentary Committee of Inquiry into BSE, I was able to spend six months studying the main aspects of this affair."
"I voted for censure because I am deeply convinced that the United Kingdom bears a considerable responsibility and that the mistakes, failings, errors and dissimulations of the Commission are obvious."
"That applies, of course, to the Commission under the presidency of Mr Delors, but also to President Santer's Commission."
"There is no doubt, as I see it, that the Commissioner for Agriculture, Mr Fischler, is responsible; he began by underestimating the situation, then went on to conceal some reports and block others."
"It would have been desirable, for the honour of the Commission, for Mr Fischler to resign from his post."
"The fact is that the European Union, through the agency of the United Kingdom and the Commission, has failed in a fundamental duty - the duty to protect the health of its citizens."
"Public opinion in the Member States would be unable to understand our failure to sanction such a failure."
"That is why I voted for censure, even though I appreciate the significant advances represented by President Santer's proposals with a view to correcting past errors - one way, as it were, of acknowledging the responsibility and culpability of his Commission."
"We have been confronted by one of the most crucial problems that a Member of Parliament can encounter in the exercise of his duties."
"Ethical stringency, the way in which we see our duty as Members of Parliament, the defence of the health of our fellow citizens which is their most precious possession, an analysis of the irregularities that have taken place and the ways in which they can be remedied, the desire to ensure that Europe is constructed on a healthy, solid basis, and also respect for the persons concerned - we are not a court, after all - all these principles arise simultaneously in connection with this matter, and at the end of the day they must determine how we vote."
"Conversely, anything which might be seen as the result of a mere episode in the development of the trial of strength between Community institutions or as the defence of strictly national or even commercial interests, or as the commonplace course of an essentially diplomatic game, or worse still as political protection, is not worthy of consideration in connection with the moral problem that has arisen."
"Provided that these principles are accepted, I believe the motion of censure must be carried."
"Of course the British Government and the previous Commission bear the main responsibility, but the report by our Committee of Inquiry showed that the present Commission bore its share of that responsibility."
"And, at this time, it is that Commission on which we are being asked to give a verdict."
"The fact that other institutions may be at fault cannot exonerate it completely."
"I cast this vote despite the esteem in which I hold the Members of the Commission and its President, and a number of senior officials of the Commission."
"I vote with my conscience, convinced that this is what our fellow citizens expect of us in a debate such as this."
"And, contrary to certain widely held opinions, I am conscious as I cast my vote of playing my part in reconciling public opinion and the politicians, and bringing our fellow citizens back closer to the idea they would like to have of the integration of Europe."
"The motion of censure which I sponsored, and for which I and my colleagues in the Europe of Nations Group then voted, was aimed first and foremost at the Commission because of its irresponsible behaviour in the mad cow crisis."
"But, over and above that, it was also an accusation levelled at an entire European system which, through its aberrations, has allowed the manipulation of information, the paralysis of the nations' defensive reactions and the propagation of the disease."
"The main value of this affair is the new light it casts on the real nature of the European institutions."
"First, the Commission - this one and its predecessor - bears an overwhelming responsibility for its part in this tragedy."
"A responsibility arising not from a single or chance act but, rather, from a consistent pattern of behaviour, observed over a long period and inherent in the very objectives which the Commission has made its own."
"Having adopted as a priority objective the establishment of freedom of movement, which it misinterpreted as meaning the abolition of all border controls, it saw a threat to the single market in every suggestion made by a Member State with a view to re-establishing national controls, even going so far as to threaten them with proceedings before the Court of Justice, both in 1990 and in early 1996."
"Now, whatever the real faults of the British Government may be, they cannot explain or excuse the inertia of the Commission in confronting the dangers, its abandonment of the principle of caution, its failure to get to grips with the public health aspect, an attitude which it carried to extreme lengths when, as late as June 1996, it managed to push through the conditional lifting of the embargo on gelatin, tallow and semen, all with a view to re-establishing freedom of movement as quickly as possible."
"Anyone in any doubt need only leaf through the pages devoted to that episode by the European Parliament's Committee of Inquiry."
"You will find such damning phrases as 'political pressures' , ' gave in to manipulation by the industrial sector' , ' low degree of transparency' , ' lack of credibility of the Commission's positions' , ' at present trying to avoid part of its responsibility' , etc."
"After all, it was indeed the present Commission, not its predecessor, which on 18 December last year authorized the introduction onto the European market of American transgenic maize, still driven by its obsession with freedom of movement, obstinately deaf to warnings and blind to the lessons that it should have learned from mad cow disease."
"When obstinacy is carried to this point, we can no longer talk of an isolated error - this is a deliberate attempt to force through, at any cost, a perverted form of integration, whatever it may cost the peoples of Europe."
"No one can help wondering, after all, by what mysterious reversal the powers of commercial regulation delegated by the Member States to the Commission, essentially for the better protection of the peoples of Europe, have thus been used against those very peoples, to break down their defences for the benefit of shameful financial interests."
"Anyone who takes note of this reversal, and better still analyses the mechanisms by which it took place, will tear away the veil of hagiographic propaganda in which the Commission has shrouded itself and see it as it really is."
"But, apart from the institution targeted by this motion of censure, we want to question a complete European system which is being developed against the interests of Europe's peoples."
"We condemn an agricultural policy whose aim is integration into the world market via a productivity race."
"We condemn a unification which would prohibit any controls at the internal borders and any possibility that an individual country could safeguard the vital interests of its population, or even its own concept of health, security or environmental protection."
"We condemn the political view that holds that, for the ultimate good of its peoples, Europe should be integrated stealthily by omniscient technocrats who alone can overrule our personal interests."
"We think, on the contrary, that Europe's agricultural objective should be high-quality production, necessarily protected by some form or other of Community preference; that the single market must tolerate the right of nations to differ or to defend themselves, something which in our view is not incompatible with a rational interpretation of free trade; and finally that the European Union, to make good its democratic shortcomings, must be returned to the direct control of its Member States, a task which, from today, should become the priority of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"An empty gesture - that was the predictable effect of this premature filing of a motion of censure against the Commission."
"That is the expected result of a campaign which was not designed to succeed, just to make a demagogic political point which has attracted support in certain unsophisticated quarters."
"It is not enough to table a motion of censure, hoping for a bit of media coverage - what is needed, too, is a strategy calculated to make it achieve its end. Otherwise it is simply an empty effort to amuse, not to say abuse, the gallery."
"Now, we all know that making use of this procedure is a novelty."
"If we want to make it a successful novelty - it is regrettable, of course, but it is happening - this House needs preparation to enable it to overcome its delicacy."
"It was necessary to abandon a futile initiative in favour of one that might prove effective; that was the point of the resolution adopted yesterday and the 'conditional motion of censure' which I and other honourable Members support."
"This is a double-barrelled weapon: first, it places the Commission under surveillance and should encourage it to mend its ways in this area, and in others too; secondly, it gives Parliament time to prepare itself to take the plunge, if necessary, and accept its responsibilities."
"Haste and impatience rarely ensure success."
"Today's motion of censure was premature."
"Tomorrow, either the Commission will have changed, or it will be changed!"
"After reading the admirable report by the Committee of Inquiry, one can only be appalled by the responsibility borne by the British Conservative Government."
"By giving priority to deregulation at the expense of all health considerations, by denying any danger of damage to human health and by failing to observe the ban on exports of bone meals, the British Government acted recklessly and in some cases culpably."
"The European Commission, for its part, has committed a number of obvious errors to which we cannot close our eyes."
"How can we not call for penalties against an institution which has played down a crisis affecting public health?"
"Who was it slowed down the adoption of simple safety procedures for inactivating the meals?"
"Who was it that lifted the embargo on gelatin?"
"Who was it that acted in such a way as to give the market preference over public health?"
"Not only that, but the lack of clarity within the Commission during the handling of the BSE affair is evidence of unfair use of the institutional agreement."
"The vote on the motion of censure against the Commission is a political response to that institution's demonstration of its lack of any sense of political responsibility."
"How can we claim to be creating a Europe based on solidarity if it is incapable of protecting its citizens against diseases released by its own industries?"
"In the interests of the Union's citizens, then, and having regard to the responsibility ethic, we must censure the actions of the Commission."
"There are grounds for criticising the Commission's handling of mad cow disease, but the criticism is not so serious as to warrant a vote of no confidence."
"Had it been possible to direct the vote of no confidence towards the British Government or the previous Commission, I would have voted in favour of it."
"As it is, I have not done so."
"The parliamentary decision is putting pressure on the Commission for future action."
"These demands are reasonable and I will support them."
"But I will not support the motion that Parliament will combine these demands with the threat of a vote of no confidence if they are not met."
"Parliament always has the opportunity to dismiss the Commission so there is no need for it to tell them how it should act in the future."
"If the Commission has the confidence of Parliament then it should be treated with respect; if there is no confidence, Parliament should dismiss the Commission."
"There is no need for an in between stage."
"A lack of clarity in this respect damages both parties and reduces the impact of the European cooperation as a result."
"A vote of censure against the European Commission is a serious act, and we should admit that it may not be the best way of dealing with this situation."
"After all, let us not forget that the main responsibility lies with the British Government, whose attitude to this case has been unspeakable from the start."
"Then comes the responsibility of the European Commissioners, who failed to do their duty, thus making the last two Commissions collectively liable."
"The fact remains that, today, the situation is so serious, the collective liability so great and the risks to the future so terrible that we cannot allow this day to end without a political show of force."
"Admittedly, we had a sound resolution yesterday which puts the present Commission under the gun."
"I approved of it, and I voted for it."
"But today, Thursday, 20 February 1997, confronted with the motion of censure as tabled, we cannot in all conscience sit back and see it receiving no more than a few dozen votes."
"That is why I shall be voting in favour."
"I am voting for it not in order to condemn any individual but in order to condemn a course of action that calls for condemnation, an intolerable collective irresponsibility, criminal blindness."
"I am voting for it in the hope that it will make it possible to stop what still can be stopped, to make good what absolutely must be made good, and to compel all those responsible to be vigilant in the future in order to ensure that no such tragedy occurs again."
"This issue is so grave that it is hard to understand how something like this could have happened in the European Union."
"Reading the report of the temporary committee of inquiry into bovine spongiform encephalopathy, there is no doubt that the Commission deserves to be censure for its downright failure to fulfil its responsibilities in terms of prevention and protection of public health."
"If the Commission's responsibilities are collegiate and that is why it was impossible to vote on each Commissioner individually at the beginning of this legislature - as requested by the European Parliament - then, by the same token, responsibility today encompasses the entire College."
"The argument is clear, especially on such an issue, which is criminal from every point of view and where there can be no contrivance: the health of the citizens cannot be put at risk and cannot be negotiated over."
"My vote of conscience merely reflects what I have said."
"The way the BSE epidemic has been handled, especially by the United Kingdom, and its utterly tragic consequences for consumer health require a response from this Parliament that is not just convincing but also responsible, and which will help to guarantee proper protection for citizens in terms of public health."
"So Parliament must condemn the British Government strongly and clearly as the great and genuine perpetrator of the BSE crisis; and it must also denounce the Council's culpable silence in the face of the British Government's lack of action and transparency."
"But it also has a duty to demand that the Commission follow up the recommendations contained in the report of the temporary committee of inquiry into BSE, adopt the legislative, organizational and personnel measures proposed in it without delay, including measures to guarantee the independence and solvency of the scientific committees and put an end to the dysfunctions which currently exist within the Community's administration."
"It must also demand that the IGC be asked to institute the necessary reforms to allow Parliament to participate fully in drawing up legislation relating to public health and the CAP."
"That is why I voted in favour of the resolution on the results of the committee of inquiry into BSE yesterday."
"Because in it, as well as condemning those really responsible, we require the Commission to adopt measures to prevent another epidemic which might threaten the health of the citizens and to implement them within a set time-limit, failing which we will move a motion of censure on the Commission."
"Responsibility tends to be condemned with grand but empty gestures."
"So I think a motion of censure on the Commission now - especially considering that the real fault lies first with the British Government and secondly with the Commission presided over by Jacques Delors - would be irresponsible and a mere gesture that would do absolutely nothing to deal with the causes of this very serious BSE crisis."
"So I have voted against the motion of censure."
"Following the proceedings of the European Parliament's Committee of Inquiry, the European Commission has been held responsible for serious errors and omissions."
"It is entirely logical, therefore, to draw the appropriate political conclusions."
"The Commission, as an institution, must accept its responsibilities and pay the penalty."
"That is why I have no hesitation - I am in favour of an immediate censure."
"The present Commission has covered up the activities of its predecessor and has not shown the transparency that the Committee of Inquiry had a right to expect."
"While it would seem that there is no doubt about the political responsibility of the agriculture commissioners, Mr MacSharry and Mr Steichen, especially for the period 19901994, the present Commissioner, Mr Fischler, quite apart from obvious errors for which he must be called to account, has obstructed the proceedings by concealing certain matters, as witness the existence of memoranda that were not sent to the Committee of Inquiry."
"That is serious."
"The Commission is a collegiate institution."
"As the law stands at present, only the institution as a whole can be sanctioned."
"But there is nothing to stop our governments from reappointing Jacques Santer and those Commissioners who have done nothing wrong."
"Indeed, it would be logical for them to be reappointed."
"And it should not take too long."
"The European public would not understand it if the European Parliament were to do nothing."
"I believe that immediate censure is the only appropriate penalty to put an end to the irregularities and compel the new Commission to take the necessary structural and political decisions swiftly."
"We must have both efficiency and ethics."
"Furthermore, if the present Commission were to fail to take such steps, I should have no hesitation in censuring it twice in six months."
"The Commission's serious responsibility for the way BSE has been handled and for the risks to public health is unequivocally stated in the report of the committee of inquiry."
"In view of those statements and given the collegiate nature of the Commission, the principle of the continuity of the institutions and the responsibilities ascribable to the present College of Commissioners, the European Parliament must exercise its duty of control with dignity."
"What is more, the Commission misused the interinstitutional agreement, hid the truth and unjustifiably attempted to lay some of the blame on Parliament."
"Damaging the harmony of the European institutions in that way is unacceptable and deserves censure."
"Only a new Commission can command the legitimacy to implement the recommendations of the committee of inquiry."
"To strengthen the construction of Europe, fulfil Parliament's duties and uphold the commitment that Members have to society, we are obliged to demand the resignation of the Commission."
"The repercussions of BSE on human health are only beginning and Parliament must remain free of any blame."
"That is why the United European Left tabled the motion of censure on the Commission and why it has voted for it."
"I have given my support to the resolution adopted by Parliament yesterday (Wednesday 19th February 1997)."
"I have done this because I consider it important that the concrete demands for improvements, stated in the resolution, to prevent a similar crisis in public health must be implemented by the Commission."
"This is necessary to improve the work in the field of public health and by so doing increase confidence in the European Parliament's elected representatives."
"But, in my opinion, the resolution is too weak."
"This is why I also made the decision to vote for the vote of no confidence in the Commission, even though I realise that this should firstly be directed towards the British Government and the previous Commission."
"The current Commission also has a responsibility in this and the investigating committee's report is so lacking in openness and analysis that a vote of no confidence is justified."
"In the case of the 'mad cows' , the Commission has committed a number of sins, not venial sins, of failing to control, inform and apply transparency, which can be sanctioned with a motion of censure, at least as a condition for restoring consumer and citizen confidence in European institutions."
"The European Parliamentary's Committee of Inquiry has competently denounced these failures, showing that the Parliament is an effective control body."
"However, it so happens that in the constellation of culprits for this present situation, the current Commission is just the latest and last in line, after the Council, the veterinary committees, the British Government and the previous Commission."
"After all there are no Community competencies in matter of public health which are sufficient to lay all of the blame with the Commission."
"There is an urgent need to create them in the Intergovernmental Conference."
"The Treaties do not provide for the individual responsibility of Commissioner."
"Yet this could be out of proportion with the collegiate responsibility of the Commission as such."
"The success of a motion of censure would mean that the European Parliament will have taken power, in an institutional framework which is still dominated by the States and for which the European Union is not prepared."
"Since the Commission is not appointed by the European Parliament, it would be difficult to avoid a situation in which an incoming Commission would not be the same as the present one."
"This would open a crisis which could actually take the focus off efforts to bring about a single currency which are mobilising both the institution and the states and, by extension, the full democratisation of the European Union."
"It would be a better approach to set the current Commission a deadline to carry out the necessary reforms in the sector of animal production and offer vital guarantees to restore confidence."
"If this is not the case, we will have to pass a motion of censure, and then I think it would be more likely that we could achieve a much broader majority calling for that."
"For the time being I think we should give our support to the 'green revolution' and 'compulsory labelling' announced by President Santer of the Commission."
"I am against a full motion of censure on the Commission at this stage because I believe that to dismiss the present Commission for the failure of its predecessors would be wrong."
"In any case I do not believe that even the former Commission was guilty of criminal negligence, even though it did fail to recognise the potential danger and failed to take appropriate action."
"The Council of Ministers was equally responsible for these failures."
"National governments also have responsibility for the safety of food and they failed also to warn consumers of the potential danger."
"So why should we unjustly make a scapegoat of the present Commission and plunge the Union into a political crisis?"
"Such action would resolve nothing and disrupt the very work that must be urgently done."
"What we must now do is recognise the weakness in our administrative system that has led to our failure and effect the necessary changes."
"We must also base all our future decisions on the best scientific knowledge available to us."
"Thanks to on-going research, much more knowledge is available to us today than it was eight years ago."
"It is our good fortune to be better informed than our predecessors."
"I know the BSE problem is indeed a very grave one and that an estimated 15 people have died from the associated disease of CJD."
"Nevertheless, it has affected a very small number compared with the thousands who die every year in the EU alone from the failure of the food handling industry to practise good hygiene."
"Recently 15 people died in one Member State from food poisoning as a result of eating contaminated food from one small wholesale establishment."
"Hundreds of thousands of people die in the EU each year as a result of smoking tobacco and consuming alcohol and yet we subsidise the production of those products, even though we have unquestionable scientific proof of their threat to human health."
"Some of the intemperate statements in this House and elsewhere have created the impression that beef products carry a significant risk to health."
"In fact the risk to health from eating beef is very insignificant, no matter what part of the EU it comes from."
"I will vote for the motion of censure against the Commission, for a very simple reason. We approved the investigative committee's report on the responsibilities of the European Union's bodies and of the British Government for dealing with BSE."
"That report is very clear and its conclusions are shattering and unquestionable, and in any case nobody has questioned them."
"So the question to be faced by every Member of the European Parliament was and is how it would have been possible for a motion of censure not to be tabled!"
"The motion, of course, is only directed against the Commission, and that indeed, collectively. But our statutory system does not provide for censure against individual Commissioners, and much less so against the Council of Ministers or individual governments."
"As representatives of the European Union's citizens who must be committed to the protection of their rights, public health, and their security in everyday life, it is our elementary duty, within the existing framework, to react and apportion responsibilities and impose sanctions, to the extent and wherever that can be done."
"We cannot plead that in this matter, economic and political interests took precedence over public health, and none of our institutions reacted accordingly."
"It is then that we would have an institutional crisis, and not in the event that the European Parliament approves the motion of censure."
"As one who is unreservedly pro-European, I consider that Europe needs powerful institutions and that those are tested and demonstrate their worth when times are difficult, and not just in day to day administration."
"Together with my colleagues in the Europe of Nations Group, I voted in favour of censure."
"Why?"
"Because it is not enough simply to expose the responsibilities and disastrous slackness of the Commission - they must be penalized."
"That is what the families of the victims expect - those who work in the stricken meat industry, and all those who elected us so that we could be vigilant in supervising the activities of the Commission."
"I voted in favour of censure because I do not accept the principle of 'responsible but not guilty' ."
"But, some will say, it is Mr Delors's Commission that is responsible and you are penalizing Mr Santer's Commission."
"That argument disregards the principle of continuity inherent in any authority."
"It disregards the fact that, although Mr Delors's Commission does indeed have a great deal to answer for, Mr Santer's Commission has covered that up, while pursuing precisely the same irresponsible policy regarding gelatin and transgenic products: the same casual attitude to scientific data, the same structural permeability to pressure exerted on the Commission by lobbyists, the same indifference to public health."
"The same lack of transparency, the same obstructiveness: Parliament's Committee of Inquiry had the utmost difficulty in obtaining the basic data it needed, especially from the Agriculture Commissioner, Mr Fischler."
"So, even leaving aside the matter of human responsibility, it is the institutional mechanism that is at fault, and it is that mechanism that must be totally changed if confidence is to be restored."
"I voted in favour of censure because I didn't want the lessons of this major crisis to be wasted - I wanted the Intergovernmental Conference to feel the full effects of the mad cow crisis."
"The BSE story has demonstrated that, when the appointed authority usurps the function of the elected political representatives, when the Commission wields supreme political responsibility in a particular area, it is not effectively protecting the fundamental interests of the European public but is acting as the agent of special interests."
"We cannot, then, rely upon a body that functions in that way or delegate to it the exercise of whole areas of our own sovereignty."
"I voted in favour of censure because if, in such a clear-cut case, the European Parliament fails to accept its responsibilities with regard to the Commission and abandons the attempt to control the Commissions's activities rigorously, it no longer has any reasons to exist."
"If it becomes the function of the European Parliament to protect its own - the European Socialist Party protecting Mr Delors, the European People's Party protecting Mr Santer, this party protecting that Commissioner - and if, at any rate, its function is not to protect public health in Europe, then the fact is that we are operating within a system of connivance rather than democratic control, an oligarchic and ideological system where the Commission is taboo, above censure, whatever it does."
"In a system like that, anything can happen."
"I voted in favour of censure because the lesson that Mr Santer seems to want to learn from the crisis is to use is as a justification for another institutional power play: the generalized application of the codecision procedure, extending it to include the Common Agricultural Policy."
"This panic-stricken advance is scandalous and unacceptable."
"The time has come to stamp on the brake - which is up to the IGC - and halt this perverse mechanism which the Council, out of weakness, is allowing to develop; a mechanism whereby every crisis, every failure by the supranational bodies serves as a pretext for the seizure of additional powers and resources."
"So the Commission has failed in its duty?"
"Well, we'd better give it greater powers and additional officials...."
"It is time for the Council to get a grip on itself and comply fully with its political responsibilities, preventing any other administrative body from taking its decisions for it."
"The principle of subsidiarity, too, needs to be revived: each government must be able to take its own steps to protect those who elected it, imposing higher levels of protection than those laid down by the European Union and establishing its own control mechanisms in such important areas as health safety."
"This is the only way for the European Institutions to recover any credibility now that they have been so severely weakened by the devastating revelations of the European Parliament's Committee of Inquiry."
"The fact that the motion of censure was tabled by a large number of Members from all parts of the political spectrum and all parts of Europe shows a growing awareness that the European institutions are in need of radical reform."
"If Europe is to be saved, we must as a matter of urgency put a stop to the malfunctionings of the Community machine, to the proliferation of irresponsibility."
"The Commission must be put in its place, and the Council must fully accept its political responsibilities: it is now a matter for the IGC to take concrete steps to reflect these essential lessons of the mad cow disease crisis."
"The European Union is the hard core of world democracy, and as such it has certain duties, particularly when it comes to setting an example."
"Nothing can exonerate us from those duties: not the general esteem we feel for the members of the present Commission, not the concern we might feel not to obstruct the requests by any particular State currently under consideration in Brussels."
"The question that confronts us is how democratic control is to be exercised within the Union."
"Public opinion today is sceptical or lukewarm regarding the prospects for continuing progress towards European integration."
"Too often, our citizens feel remote from the decisions being taken in their name - in their interest, as we tell them."
"They can clearly see the Commission's dual power: the power to propose and the power to act."
"But how that power is controlled is much less clear to them."
"They can only feel consternation as they are bombarded with information on the proven failings of governments and the stratagems adopted in certain quarters - by the British Government and European officials - to conceal the truth or delay its exposure, and so protect national or private interests in a field as vital - literally vital - as human health."
"These irregularities have been taking place over a period of several years, and this House cannot settle for undertakings and promises to do better."
"A strong signal must be sent out to all those who may be disappointed and tempted to abandon the high hopes that swept this continent in the aftermath of the terrible Second World War."
"By voting for the censure motion we are casting a vote of confidence in Europe's institutions and declaring our complete awareness of Parliament's role as the protector of the citizens' rights and freedoms."
"I abstained in the vote on the motion of censure against the Commission given the findings of the BSE Committee of Inquiry, because:"
"to vote for would be committing a half-injustice turning the present Commission into a scapegoat for malfunctionings which occurred before they took office and for which, apart from the Commission, others are responsible, namely the Council; -voting against would be boosting a Commission which, while continuing to give signs of a glaring lack of leadership and a resulting overall loss of strategic direction (already foreseeable when it was invested), but above all an excessively political understanding of subjects of general interest to the citizen, such as public health, really ought to be censured, and if it does not mend its ways, punished.The truth is that there really is a 'lack of Europe' in the field of public health just as there are generally speaking in the fields of the third pillar which more directly concern the citizen."
"With a few individual exceptions of honour this Commission is undoubtedly responsible because it has failed to focus on a situation which could easily become explosive and even uncontrollable."
"If it were voted for, however, the motion of censure would be a 'red card' ."
"I think that given that we are now in the early stages of the Intergovernmental Conference, it is better to show a 'yellow card' in the shape of a joint resolution, which was adopted yesterday, and with which I agree."
"Topical and urgent debate"
"The next item is the topical and urgent debate on subjects of major importance."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B4-0058/97 by Mr Bertens and others, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party, on the situation in the Great Lakes region; -B4-0076/97 by Mrs Sauquillo Pérez del Arco and Mr Pons Grau, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the murder of development aid workers in Rwanda; -B4-0092/97 by Mr Pasty and others, on behalf of the Union for Europe Group, on the situation in eastern Zaire; -B4-0101/97 by Mr Hory, on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance, on the situation in eastern Zaire; -B4-0114/97 by Mr Fernández Martín and others, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, on the situation in the Great Lakes region; -B4-0116/97 by Mr Carnero González and Mr Pettinari, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, on the situation in the Great Lakes region, especially in eastern Zaire; -B4-0129/97 by Mrs Aelvoet and Mr Telkämper, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament, on the Great Lakes region."
"Madam President, this is not the first time we have discussed the appalling situation that exists in Zaire, Rwanda and Burundi."
"Once again, that region has fallen a prey to violence, bringing tragedy to thousands of civilians, refugees and displaced persons."
"In this situation, I should like to follow the example of Mr Bertens - even if we didn't sign the same motion - and express the concern felt by the entire Socialist Group."
"And its regret, too, at seeing that neither the European Union nor great powers like the United States have really got to grips with the problem by launching sustained diplomatic initiatives and deploying a multinational force with a mission not to wage war but to protect civilians and try to support moves towards peace."
"Today, the situation is deteriorating, but we can also see where the responsibility lies: with the governments concerned, admittedly, but also with those Europeans who become involved in that region and supply their 'know-how' and their 'technology' ."
"I have to say that it is really nothing to be proud of to see mercenaries operating in that region."
"So what do we suggest?"
"Obviously, that everything possible should be done to obtain a cease-fire within the framework of a regional conference for peace, security and stability in the region, which could be held under the aegises of the UN and the OAU."
"But if holding such a conference requires making use of means other than mere diplomatic initiatives, I believe that is a necessity to which we must face up."
"We call upon the Council to adopt a joint action programme which would enable it to act in other ways than by adopting resolutions."
"We call upon not only the European Union ministers but also the United Nations to support Mrs Bonino's initiative, so that full accounts should be available, enabling a way to be found of solving this refugee crisis in eastern Zaire."
"We have seen Mrs Bonino on television, clearly showing her emotion and also her anger at seeing children, women and old people suffering the effects of this situation."
"There need to be humanitarian aid channels, if indeed from the political standpoint, we are at present unable to achieve any result."
"Finally, we believe that the situation in the region can only be normalized if, during this conference, all the problems are tackled."
"There is the problem of the inviolability of frontiers, but there is also the problem of democracy and respect for human rights."
"Democracy in Zaire!"
"Many people believed that President Mobutu, Mobutu the dictator, might work in favour of stability in the region."
"We can see how wrong that is."
"He too bears responsibility for the present chaos, and we can only hope that everything possible will be done to open the way to democracy in that country, as the only means of bringing peace."
"And there must be justice for Rwanda, too, justice for all."
"I believe that a great deal needs to be done before reconciliation can be achieved, but once people are conscious of living under the rule of law, conscious that they can return to their homes unmolested, the chances of achieving that reconciliation will perhaps be better than they are at present."
"That is the message we want to give to the Commission, which is represented here, and to the Council, which is not."
"We call, as a matter of urgency, for very strong action to be taken."
"Madam President, the heart of Africa is trembling and quivering with violence, violence that claims more victims, shifts national frontiers and threatens countries with disintegration."
"Such a country is Zaire, the nucleus of the African continent."
"Old colonial links with Europe have long since stopped being any guarantee."
"On the contrary, it is precisely arms supplies from Europe that have prevented the people from participating in power in those countries and so helped to create this chaos."
"At last there is a wise African leader who realises that the disintegration of Africa will mercilessly drag the rest of the continent down with it."
"Mr President, let the Union use this debate to support this wise African leader in his appeals, to support him in every possible way, to stop arms supplies, to withdraw the mercenaries, for it seems as if the phenomenon of unemployment has now turned into one of mercenaries in Africa, not just Zaire, but also Angola, Chad, everywhere."
"Withdraw the mercenaries, set up humanitarian corridors with a military and UN guarantee, call on the new secretary-general, Kofi Annan, to protect the refugees for that is the job of the UN."
"Madam President, as the author of the motion for a resolution tabled by the Group of the European Radical Alliance on this crisis in the Great Lakes region, I should like to explain why I did not feel I should call upon my group to endorse the compromise reached by the other groups."
"I had two reasons."
"The first was that I felt the degree of urgency had been underestimated - not only the urgency of humanitarian aid to the Rwandan refugees in Zaire and the displaced Zairean civilians but also the urgency of the aid to be provided to the Rwandan authorities to enable them to accept a million refugees who are now returning to their country, and those who want to return there."
"This really is a matter of urgency."
"Nor did I see, as far as our urgent procedure is concerned, what value there was in emphasizing our commitment to the territorial integrity of Zaire."
"It may well be an important matter, but I do not feel that it is worthy of an urgent resolution, and I fear that this step may be interpreted by the protagonists in the crisis as a declaration of support for the Kinshasa regime, a declaration which seems to me inappropriate."
"That is why, when the time comes, I shall also be opposing the amendment proposed to us by our friends in the Liberal Group on the subject of a military intervention force, because I fear that, having regard to the present situation in eastern Zaire, any form of military intervention - even designed to ensure safe passage for humanitarian aid - may seem to be a territorial statement in a conflict which primarily concerns the Zaireans."
"I hope, therefore, that the Security Council's resolution, especially through its proposal for a regional conference, will make it possible to find a lasting peaceful solution to benefit the entire Great Lakes region."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen. Seldom has a debate been held in the European Parliament in such dramatic circumstances as is the case today."
"Commissioner Bonino said on her return from Zaire that she was returning from hell and that the situation in Eastern Zaire was an intolerable scandal."
"Not to mention the never ending executions in Burundi."
"The most recent information indicates that the refugees in Zaire are not so much trying to escape the war but to escape wide-scale slaughter which threatens not only the indigenous population but also refugees, first and foremost women and children."
"Recent history in Central Africa was dreadful but what is happening there today is no less so, and what makes events there even more scandalous is the incomprehensible attitude of the United Nations."
"Do I have to remind you that last December it was decided to set up an international intervention force which was disbanded a week later, on the pretext that the Rwandan refugees had returned home, whereas it is now quite clear that there are still several hundreds of thousands holed up in the woods of Zaire."
"Emma Bonino said she met people who were officially dead."
"And what about the camp where there are more than 5, 000 children without any parents?"
"They are dying like flies, and who cares about them?"
"The credibility of the United Nations is really at stake."
"Why was the information that the United States is believed to have held not passed on?"
"Masses of modern weapons are being used in the battles between so-called rebels and the remains of the Zaire military."
"Where do these weapons come from?"
"Why is nothing done to act on rumours?"
"Why do nothing to dispel the rumours that Western powers are somehow involved in the invasion in Zaire?"
"Why can we now read reports which state that the spoils to be gained in Zaire are 'enormous' ?"
"To quote verbatim from a document: ' the riches to be shared from Zaire are enormous' ."
"And who understands anything any more of Mrs Ogata's stance?"
"Did we not hear the rebel leader Kabila say that the new Berlin conference should be convened?"
"Do those who short-sightedly support something like that realise that that treatment of Africa is grist to the mill of nationalism in the world and of demanding changes to frontiers or countries on the basis of ethnic background?"
"Right from the beginning this Parliament unanimously said that all military operations in Kivu had to stop."
"It goes without saying that the refugees must be able to return home, that they should do so or find shelter somewhere else, but be able to do so without any pressure."
"And a tribunal worthy of the name should be able to fulfil its task."
"The United Nations must realise that the equivocal policy of last December seriously detracts from their power."
"If the weapons fall silent, the international conference for the countries of the Great Lakes regions must be held."
"Or do people want to hide the truth here as well?"
"A European policy on Africa makes no sense if we are unable to convene this kind of conference."
"Let this House at last raise its voice so that it can be heard by the whole world."
"This Parliament condemns imperialism, in Africa as elsewhere."
"It upholds peace, development, tolerance and the protection of human rights."
"It is now time to see if we mean it seriously."
"Madam President, there is now an obvious lack of political and humanitarian interest in what is happening in the Great Lakes region."
"Hundreds of thousands of refugees and displaced persons are now at the mercy of geo-political strategies originating from Washington and Paris which are blocking any relief activities in the region."
"The USA is supporting Tutsi military regimes that are being maintained and developed on the basis of balances determined by their mono-ethnic armies and the commercial traffic these armies control."
"Europe and France, on the other hand, are giving their support to the dictator Mobutu, who is actually the cause of so many disasters in the region."
"Caught in the middle are millions of innocent, starving Africans who are paying a totally unacceptable price for our crazy foreign policies."
"It almost seems as though the USA has opted to foster chaos and use those in power in the region to impose its policy, instead of doing what ought to have been done, which is to promote a multinational buffer force that might have enabled the Great Lakes region to move towards the future democratic legitimization of those regimes, the international conference for a regional solution and the economic reconstruction and institutional reform of Rwanda, Burundi and Zaire."
"But all of this is happening partly because of the unacceptable divisions between the Member States of the European Union, whose very credibility is at stake in this crisis."
"I am referring to the Council of 20 January - noncommitted and unproductive Council which says a great deal about Europe's inability and unwillingness to intervene in the area."
"This is a decision that shocks us and which we utterly reject as a dark stain on the tradition of European solidarity that makes us, even without striking a blow, a party to the death of thousands of people every week."
"The resolution on which we shall be voting today and which my group supports sounds this cry of alarm and proposes a set of measures that we trust will be ratified by this Parliament."
"Madam President, the continuing civil war in eastern Zaire will plunge the population even deeper into their appalling suffering."
"It is always the civilian population that bears the impact of such suffering - the women, the children, the old men, the young."
"The latest news tells us that not only has the government of Zaire been hiring mercenaries, but that there has been widespread rape of women and girls."
"We should help to find a political solution."
"What form might that solution take?"
"We must support the UN's initiatives."
"The latest initiative by Nelson Mandela makes sense; he says that a solution lies in Africa itself, and that we should support it with technological and financial resources."
"There is a need for an action plan for humanitarian aid for southern Africa."
"The mercenaries must be pulled out."
"The first thing we can do to help is to look at the situation in our own countries."
"Here, close by, we have the Foreign Legion."
"That is an example of a mercenary force which is being sent out there, isn't it?"
"We must ensure that such things no longer happen, that we support the War Crimes Tribunal for Rwanda, and that this has a deterrent effect."
"Nor should we abandon our development policy."
"If we have budget cuts here, the money for civilian development will be lacking."
"And, finally: an immediate stop must be put to such things as weapons coming from Germany and, as rumour has it, the police equipment for a dictator like Mobutu being provided by German political institutes."
"That is a major contribution to peace."
"Madam President, if I may I should like to clear up that last point immediately."
"Mr Telkämper refers to rumour."
"We should not stoop to peddle rumours in this chamber."
"If an attempt is made, in a country where such tragic events are taking place, to help with the training of security forces so that they can develop into civilian police forces, without the institutes being responsible for arming them, then I believe that, too, represents a contribution to achieving the objectives this House would like to see achieved."
"But now for the subject of today's motion. The catalogue of disasters at this time in the part-session has become almost a matter of routine."
"Time after time, too, we hear that the action taken has produced no effect."
"So I regard it as an absolute necessity to come up with a different kind of action."
"If the problem of the overcrowded refugee camps cannot be solved, if it is impossible to achieve what Mrs Ogata has called for - the disarming of the militia in the camps - then the question arises of whether we should not direct our efforts towards decentralizing those camps, making it impossible for so many militia men to find concealment among 200, 000 refugees, and for bandits to pursue their flourishing arms trade there."
"We constantly hear - it happened again in this presidency's paper - words like 'concerned' , ' demands' , ' condemns' ."
"Those words have not solved any problems yet."
"Europe, too, must finally get its act together and send troops, a military force to safeguard humanitarian rights."
"And when we come to debate Mr Fassa's report in due course, we shall find that same demand expressed by the Committee on Development. And I hope that this approach will enable us to enforce the law, instead of just demanding it."
"Madam President, the European public has reacted with indignation to two catastrophes: the one which has taken place in the Great Lakes and - another political catastrophe - the fact that the European Union has been incapable of intervening to put an end to the destruction of human life taking place in the Great Lakes."
"There are even countries like Spain which have paid with the lives of three aid workers for the presence of civilians and the absence of European Union policy in that part of Africa."
"There is indignation about what is happening and the lack of intervention, but there is also indignation about the known causes, the conflict over spurious strategies and indeed the continuing de facto support of dictators like Mobutu Sese Seko."
"We hope the recently adopted United Nations Security Council resolution will operate in favour of a political solution to the situation and that the conference mentioned in our resolution will finally be called, which also requires the European Union to engage in joint action as demanded in the text."
"Madam President, the Commission shares the deep anxiety - the dread, perhaps I should say - of this House about the situation in the Great Lakes."
"It understands the concern of the European Parliament to increase awareness of this subject within the international community."
"You are doing something that needs to be done."
"The escalation of this violence could further exacerbate the political problems and widen the scope of the humanitarian crisis in that region."
"On behalf of the European Union, the Council presidency has just made a declaration on Zaire, inviting the warring factions to negotiate an immediate ceasefire and facilitate access for the humanitarian organizations to enable them to bring aid to the distressed populations."
"In view of the gravity of the humanitarian situation in Zaire, Mrs Bonino undertook a mission from 30 January to 2 February with a view to facilitating access for humanitarian aid in the east of the country."
"As I understand it from listening to your speeches just now, this was indeed one of your main concerns."
"I should also remind you that an appeal was launched on the occasion of Mrs Bonino's trip and does seem to me, in fact, to have created international awareness of the problem."
"Regarding humanitarian aid work, Mrs Bonino made a point of stressing how its implementation was being baulked at present by security problems and administrative difficulties."
"That was why my colleague Emma Bonino made representations to the government calling for the international human rights conventions to be respected."
"The protection of humanitarian organizations in the countries where they operate is a matter to which the Commission pays the closest attention."
"Let me remind you of the recent murders, including the killings of representatives of these humanitarian organizations, especially in Rwanda."
"Those murders have had a very powerful and easily understandable impact on the personnel of the humanitarian agencies, many of which have reduced their programmes or are even thinking of withdrawing."
"Although the immediate problem today is to find a way of resolving the deteriorating situation in Zaire and Burundi, and although you have rightly emphasized your concerns about this, referring to the problem of the arms traffic and other problems associated with the impossibility of establishing humanitarian aid channels for the present, the ultimate objective of the European Union's efforts must be to find a global solution."
"It is up to the international community to bring the warring factions to the negotiating table and find answers that will enable us to resolve this crisis."
"The purpose of humanitarian aid is not to resolve the conflict."
"Unfortunately, the reason why humanitarian aid is needed is that there is no solution to such conflicts."
"That is why the Commission welcomes the recent resolution by the United Nations Security council on 18 February emphasizing the urgent need to protect refugees and displaced persons and to make it easier for humanitarian aid to reach the victims."
"I can assure you that the Commission will be unsparing in its efforts to ensure that that resolution is translated into action."
"Madam President, I should like to raise a point of order pursuant to Rule 108."
"Since Mrs Günther reacted to what I said, I should once again like to emphasize expressly that I did not imply that the Hans Seidel Institute was involved in the training of the police force of the dictator Mobutu or helping to arm that police force."
"Mr Telkämper, that was more like a declaration than a point of order!"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B4-0082/97 by Mr Bertens and others, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party, on the crisis in Albania; -B4-0089/97 by Mr Pasty and others, on behalf of the Union for Europe Group, on the situation in Albania; -B4-0093/97 by Mr Dupuis and Mr Hory, on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance, on the situation in Albania; -B4-0105/97 by Mr Roubatis and others, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the situation in Albania; -B4-0113/97 by Mrs Pack and others, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, on Albania; -B4-0126/97 By Mr Alavanos and others, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, on the situation in Albania; -B4-0138/97 by Mrs Aelvoet and others, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament, on the situation in Albania."
"Madam President, Commissioner, the situation in Albania is highly explosive."
"The dreams of making a fortune of a large part of the population have been shattered and the hard reality of daily life in Albania is making the people extremely bitter."
"It is not of course up to the Union to help out the Albanian people financially when their gambling goes wrong."
"But we do have to call on the Albanian government to act properly in this situation."
"Repression, violence, arresting the opposition, gagging the press is not the way to end the unrest."
"That is like a red rag to a bull."
"The Commission and Council should call on the government of Mr Berisha to abandon their repressive methods and make a fair, payable and responsible gesture to the duped people of the country."
"The government must try in a dialogue with the opposition to find a solution to the current economic and political crisis."
"Further democratisation and liberalisation are needed to haul Albania out of the mire."
"The Union must be prepared to offer its help here."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am extremely concerned about the situation in Albania, but I am even more concerned about the consequences it might have and about the European Union's response at a time of such terrible difficulty, which could have serious implications for the country's future economic development."
"I do not want to see anyone taking advantage of this to aggravate an already difficult and delicate situation."
"As members of the European Union, we have a moral and civil duty to give Albania as much help as we can to prevent total destabilization of the country and region."
"We need to act as carefully and correctly as we have done in the past, and I recall that we sent observers to follow the most recent elections in 1996, who were able to verify the honesty and correctness of those elections."
"The Commission should, within the framework of its programmes, provide technical assistance for the reform of the financial and banking sectors, since, as a result of the collapse of the pyramid investment schemes, Albania is now facing a deep financial and economic crisis."
"And this is undoubtedly a personal disaster for a large part of the population in Albania."
"Finally, we need to support President Berisha in his calls for law and order, while deploring and condemning the violence of the suppression that has left four people dead and hundreds injured; and we need to urge the Albanian authorities to conduct, as soon as possible, an investigation to identify and condemn those responsible for the misappropriations that have led to the ruin of thousands of small savers."
"And lastly, we need to support Albania's political leaders, of both the majority and the opposition, in their attempts to restore calm in a population that is living through a very dark moment."
"Madam President, Albania has a population of three million, equivalent to one of the smaller regions of the Union."
"Here again, we can see that the Union, the Commission and the Member States, too, especially some States such as Italy, have been working on numerous projects but have achieved little."
"A great deal of money has been spent, as usual, but little attention has been paid to an essential feature of the rules of the game - the establishment of certain guarantees and systems to ensure that the irregularities that have taken place are not repeated."
"We know all about these pyramid saving schemes. We have seen them before in Romania."
"Commissioner van den Broek told us that the Commission had been abreast of affairs for many months and that, despite the scale of the financial resources released for Albania over the last five or six years, the Commission was unable -which I find incredible - to put a stop to this business before it exploded."
"That is absolutely staggering!"
"I think it really is high time for the European Union to adopt a foreign policy worthy of the name. Otherwise, we shall go on spending money, it will cost us a great deal, and we shall not even achieve a minimal result - a minimum of development in these countries."
"Madam President, a few years ago I visited Albania, just after it had become independent."
"It was the most depressing experience of my life."
"The depression was caused not by the poverty - I had been to a lot poorer countries in my time - but by the look of shock and hopelessness on the faces of the local inhabitants."
"Indeed, going to poor countries, one often sees extensive economic activity on a small scale."
"In Albania there was nothing. People were stunned and had no idea how to respond to the changes."
"I became aware then of the enormous gulf that lies between our line of thinking and their line of thinking."
"We talk very glibly about democracy and market economy without realizing that both these things require a major effort and, in fact, are part and parcel of our upbringing."
"It is very difficult to introduce these into an area which has never known democracy and never really known a market economy."
"It was always obvious that Albania would encounter serious problems and, of course, this is exactly what has happened."
"We should not be too surprised at the pyramid schemes because they are basically get-rich schemes."
"One of the messages that we have been giving to these countries is that if you embrace capitalism you get rich very quickly."
"Well, the reality of capitalism is that a lot more people get poor very quickly and most of us trudge along in the middle, having to work very hard to keep our heads above water."
"That is an important lesson to be learned."
"Another important lesson to be learned is that democracy is not simply about going to the ballot box to elect a government that then behaves like every other government before it."
"Democracy is about a proper interplay between the forces of any particular society."
"So in this resolution on Albania we have sought to condemn - as we should condemn - those who have tried to manipulate this situation for their own reward."
"We are concerned about the reports of the involvement of international crime and gangsters in these get-rich schemes and we have condemned, of course, the action of the government."
"Having condemned, what we have to do is look at how we can improve the situation."
"What we have sought to do in this resolution is to draw attention to the need for the EU to provide specialized assistance, particularly for financial institutions and the building of financial institutions."
"Let us not forget that the history of capitalism in the United Kingdom is strewn with get-rich schemes which have collapsed and banks which have collapsed - this is nothing new."
"We have to use our experience and work closely with the Albanian people and their government to try to build proper financial institutions which will open up their economy and develop prosperity."
"On the one hand, we should condemn, on the other hand, let us have a look at how we can help them more effectively."
"It has been said that Albania is crucial to the region, if we lose control of Albania, we lose control of the region."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I must thank Mr Titley for his very wise remarks, and I am glad that he has said what he has, because I see it the same way that he does."
"Unfortunately, our motion is not quite as balanced as what Mr Titley has said and what I am going to say, but that's what happens, unfortunately, with motions."
"Vast numbers of Albanian citizens handed over their savings to confidence tricksters who promised them incredible profits."
"Infected with gold fever, people were incapable of attaching any credence to timely warnings - the supposed prospect of fabulous wealth simply befuddled their senses."
"They were easy prey, precisely because they had no experience whatever of such hideous excesses of capitalism."
"Today, confronted with the grim reality, they are naturally trying to place the blame not on themselves but on the government."
"It may well be that the government failed to warn them early enough, but without rock-solid evidence and in view of the euphoria of the investors, the job may simply have been too difficult for them."
"When they did broadcast warnings on television in September 1996, they were not believed."
"But the misfortunes of the population and the problems the Albanian government faces as a result are too great to be abused for selfish ends."
"Unfortunately, the opposition is doing just that, criminally exploiting the unrest for party political purposes."
"Hooliganism directed against public buildings and the police does lasting damage to public order, and must be stopped."
"The fact that there were some cases where this was done without the appropriate sense of proportion is very regrettable."
"People were killed, and that is terrible."
"Obviously, those responsible must be called to account."
"How many Members took note of the moderation and democratic maturity with which the Albanian parliament conducted the debate on the proposed declaration of a state of emergency, and then eventually rejected it?"
"All of them were more or less blinded, the opposition politicians no less than some members of the government."
"But now everyone should be trying to pick up the pieces as quickly as possible and refraining from untenable accusations or suspicions."
"The government has begun to pay back the small amount of money retrieved, and will continue to do so."
"The Committee of Inquiry must clarify the background, and the EU Commission should help to reform the finance and banking sectors and provide strong support to the government as it works to build the sound and credible structures of a market economy."
"So, please, let us not confuse cause and effect, and let us not make party political capital out of these matters."
"Our thoughts must be turned to the misery suffered by the Albanian people, and to the urgent matter of enlightenment."
"Madam President, in just one minute all I can do is ask the Commissioner two things."
"Commissioner, I will not ask you for your opinion about the political situation, human rights, the rule of law, or any of those ardent issues in Albania."
"Can you give us the Commission's estimate of the losses brought about by the so-termed pyramid systems?"
"I hear talk of two billion dollars. Far above the gross national income of the country itself."
"The magnitude of those losses, Mr Commissioner, shows that this was not accidental, as some here are saying, nor any oversight."
"A system was in play."
"Eight banks were involved, four of which have declared bankruptcy, and we are waiting for the others to do so as well."
"A new economic situation is arising."
"And the second question is: with what image, with what perspective is the Commission cooperating with Albania?"
"What advice is it giving that country?"
"Towards what prospect is it urging Albania?"
"Because there are some who have confused capitalism with gambling and public fraud, and nothing else."
"Madam President, I, too, should like briefly to express deep concern at the deterioration of the political situation in Albania that has been triggered by the collapse of the pyramid investment schemes, and also at the heavy-handed response of the Albanian Government and police."
"The incidents that have occurred should somehow have been avoided and every effort should have been made, in particular, to prevent situations in which people died."
"The Albanian Government has proved itself totally incapable of responding to the accusation of collusion with the companies that embezzled investment funds."
"I cannot believe that Berisha and his government were unaware of what was happening, that is, massive fraud at the expense of the Albanian people."
"I therefore believe that, in pointing to the dangers of the presence of international criminal organizations, we should also point out that the Albanian Government needs to conduct a full and transparent investigation and, at the same time, launch a dialogue with all the opposition parties, for, without dialogue, it will be impossible to achieve the political stability that is so vital now."
"The European Union must provide the Albanian Government with the assistance it needs to enable it to restructure the current savings system and introduce appropriate legislative measures to tackle this emergency situation."
"Madam President, when the situation in a small, troubled country, Albania, is dramatic, when that country is part of a wider volatile area, when the economic ruin of thousands of small savers threatens to destabilize the newly emergent democracy, when there are serious suspicions of Mafia involvement, I believe our reaction should be immediate and realistic, and not confined to wishful thinking about Jeremiads or ideologically tinted advice."
"The first requirement is to offer technical aid capable of restoring the discredited banking system."
"But if even that is to be effective, it must go together with generous economic support."
"At a time when we are all talking about the globalization of the economy, it is tragic that a small country in a sensitive area of Europe should be allowed to founder economically and politically because of unscrupulous profiteers and incapable governors."
"Madam President, the Commission naturally shares the deep concern of this House at the serious social unrest that has recently broken out in Albania as a result of the collapse of these pyramid saving schemes."
"Mr Papayannakis has asked what the scale of this calamity was."
"According to studies by the International Monetary Fund, very substantial."
"They are talking about 30 % of GDP, one billion dollars."
"So this is indeed a major crisis, which is why we are concerned, though I can tell Mr Tamino that we are also concerned at the violence of the social unrest to which this protest has given way."
"Mrs Baldi and Mr Dupuis have asked what the European Union is doing and why it has taken no action?"
"The problem is that Albania, having regard to its past history, has no adequate, or sufficiently sophisticated, legislative and regulatory framework to govern its financial and banking systems."
"That is why, since 1992, the PHARE programme has been granting substantial aid to Albania - aid which does indeed extend to the reform of the banking system and, especially, the privatization of a number of state-owned banks."
"The situation subsequently improved, and Albania enjoyed a considerable degree of economic success, particularly by complying with the ideas of the International Monetary Fund."
"The problem is that a substantial and rapid deterioration took place in 1996, leading the Commission, from the end of October last year, to offer Albania technical assistance in solving the legal problems which were being and are being caused by the control of these so-called pyramid investment funds."
"But the Albanian authorities refused the Commission's offer."
"I can tell Mr Titley and Mr Lambrias that we are trying to help the Albanians."
"That was why the Commission sent a mission to Tirana on 5 and 6 February - as recently as that - to prepare the PHARE operational programme for 1997."
"On that occasion, we were able to assess the impact of the crisis and come up with new aid proposals."
"However, as things stand, I am sorry to say that the Albanian authorities are still preferring to find their own solution to the problems created by these saving schemes."
"The Commission is sorry that the Albanian Government has rejected its proposal."
"This refusal is worrying - I should make this clear - because three or four so-called pyramid companies do still exist and their future is uncertain, to say the least."
"I gather that the offers of assistance made by the International Monetary Fund and by the United States were also rejected by the Albanian Government."
"In view of this, and in these circumstances, with the prospect of a further deterioration in the situation, the Commission has asked the Council presidency to raise the matter at the 'General Affairs' council next Monday, 24 February."
"The Commission is suggesting that the Union should first invite all the parties concerned to show restraint and refrain from violence."
"The Commission further believes that it would be as well to remind the Albanian authorities that resorting to undemocratic ways of resolving the crisis could have profound repercussions on the quality of current relations between the Union and Albania, and especially on the negotiation of a new agreement between the Union and Albania."
"In other words, if we want to achieve any results in this matter we must combine humanity with firmness."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"53rd session of the UN Human Rights Commission -B4-0063/97 by Mr Bertens and Mrs Larive, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party, on China and the United Nations Human Rights Commission; -B4-0077/97 by Mr Barros Moura and others, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the 53rd session of the UN Human Rights Commission; -B4-0091/97 by Mr Pasty and others, on behalf of the Union for Europe Group, on the 53rd session of the UN Human Rights Commission; -B4-0094/97 by Mr Dupuis and Mr Dell'Alba, on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance, on the resolution on China/Tibet in the UN Human Rights Commission and on the standpoint of the UN Member States; -B4-0111/97 by Mrs Lenz and others, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, on the 53rd session of the UN Human Rights Commission; -B4-0123/97 by Mr Carnero González and others, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left on human rights - Geneva; -B4-0142/97 by Mrs Müller and others, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament, on the 53rd session of the UN Human Rights Commission; -B4-0062/97 by Mr Cars and others, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party, on the abolition of the death penalty; -B4-0095/97 by Mr Dupuis and others, on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance, on the most frequent cases in many countries throughout the world in which the death penalty is imposed; -B4-0124/97 by Mr Carnero González and others, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left, on the UN Human Rights Commission and on the abolition of the death penalty; -B4-0134/97 by Mrs Aglietta and others, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament, on the death penalty; -B4-0098/97 by Mr Dupuis and Mr Dell'Alba, on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance, on the grave human rights violations in western Turkestan (Xinjian);"
"Iran -B4-0059/97 by Mr Cars, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party, on Iran; -B4-0075/97 by Mrs García Arias and others, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on Iran; -B4-0108/97 by Mrs Lenz and others, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, on the Iranian writer and publisher Faraj Sarkouhi; -B4-0119/97 by Mr Vinci and Mr Pettinari, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, on human rights in Iran; -B4-0143/97 by Mrs Roth and others, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament, on the disappearance of the Iranian publisher Faraj Sarkouhi, his brother Ismail Sarkouhi and his assistant Parvin Ardalan;"
"Mordecai Vanunu -B4-0070/97 by Mr Crampton and others, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the continuing solitary confinement of Mordecai Vanunu; -B4-0144/97 by Mr Telkämper and others, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament, on the continuing solitary confinement of Mordecai Vanunu;"
"Chad -B4-0057/97 by Mrs André-Léonard and others, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party, on human rights violations in Chad; -B4-0118/97 by Mr Pettinari, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, on human rights violations in Chad;"
"Indigenous peoples of Indonesia -B4-0065/97 by Mrs Pollack, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the violation of the rights of indigenous peoples and the clearing of tropical forests on the Indonesian island of Yamdena; -B4-0130/97 by Mrs Hautala and Mrs McKenna, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament, on the violation of the rights of indigenous peoples and the clearing of tropical forests on the Indonesian island of Yamdena."
"Madam President, The Union must speak out strongly at the coming meeting of the human rights commission in Geneva."
"It must be properly prepared to reach a common position at the UN Commission on Human Rights."
"The preparation appears to be better than last year, but there is still room for improvement."
"Last year our position was coordinated in Geneva and this time the coordination is taking place three weeks earlier in Brussels."
"But I still think it regrettable that not more time is devoted to it."
"Better preparation increases our chance of successfully influencing the UN Commission."
"Today this House must get it clearly across to the Council that China, Turkey, Burma and East Timor are part of the list of priorities."
"Next week's Council meeting will take the decision."
"I hope that the President-in-Office of Council will come out clearly on the universality of human rights, for example, which are also to be applied to China."
"The new, and perhaps also the old, Chinese leaders must be condemned, if necessary without fear in the UN context, for the deterioration in human rights in their country; it is clear everywhere that the situation has not improved."
"The Council must speak out loudly in Geneva in favour of an international coalition without any consideration of possible economic retaliation on the part of the Chinese."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am going to try to use my 60 seconds to say something sensible on the subject of what this Human Rights Commission and its 53rd session are about."
"Mr Ferber, talking rubbish is a human right too, so we can forgive your heckling!"
"It is difficult to make a selection among so many different topics when we come to debate this 53rd session."
"As Parliament's rapporteur on the subject of the sexual abuse and exploitation of children, I should like to ask those representatives of the Council and the Member States, and of our Parliament, who are going to attend this conference in Geneva to make this question a central point of debate, alongside the traditional, political debates that are held there: what has gone wrong in a society which has become brutalized to the extent reflected in what we now know of the sexual abuse and exploitation of children?"
"In particular, I call upon the European nations to reflect that we must pay the most particular attention to this phenomenon in our own countries and we must eliminate its causes and its effects if we, as Europeans attending such a conference, are to have long-term credibility when we point the finger at human rights violations outside Europe."
"So I ask those travelling to Geneva to consider this subject especially carefully."
"Madam President, the motion for a resolution lists some ten countries, but the most important one for me is China."
"It is the biggest country, the largest population, a growing market, attractive to Western investors, and no sign of movement in the human rights situation."
"I mention the occupation of Tibet, the situation in Turkestan and Inner Mongolia, the lengthy prison sentences for dissidents, including Wei Jingsheng."
"This is the China whose successor to the late Deng Xiaoping must be persuaded that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights applies to the whole of this earth."
"China - because very shortly Hong Kong will come under the rule of Peking and the first signs of oppressive machinery are already visible there."
"China - because the opposition there is hoping for a slow but sure rise in the degree of tolerance and openness."
"China is coming to the human rights conference in Geneva, a unique opportunity to get together with our colleagues from the American Congress who so recently sat on the platform to use our transatlantic relation in the pursuit of respecting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which every dissident on this earth calls on - these are the values we want to see implemented."
"China cannot be allowed to hide behind so-called Asian values, for these do not apply to this earth."
"Madam President, I entirely agree with Mrs van Bladel."
"I believe there are many good reasons for concentrating on China, and not because of the passing of the self-styled Great Architect who unfortunately forgot the fifth and most important modernization, as Wei Jingsheng put it: democracy."
"There are 1, 200, 000, 000 living in China outside the rule of democracy, and that applies more especially to millions of Tibetans, Mongols and Uighurs in eastern Turkestan."
"I am very glad that this House, for the first time, is beginning to discuss them."
"For these people, deprived as they are of democracy and liberty, it is an important and urgent matter for the European Union to confront the situation with firmness and not to do as it did last year when, for weeks on end, we witnessed delaying tactics on the part of the European Union - tactics which eventually resulted in a position that was not defended and on which no attempt was made to reach a consensus with the other Member States of the Commission on Human Rights."
"This year we need a firm position."
"I believe the signs are encouraging."
"Mrs Albright has told us that the United States is prepared to support the same resolution as the European Union."
"So we need to press on resolutely along those lines, and to put pressure on the European Union governments that are still resorting to passive resistance."
"I think it is right to name the countries concerned: they are your own country of France, Commissioner de Silguy, and Italy."
"The European Union must adopt a strong and unanimous position."
"Only by doing so will we be able to escape from a mood of resignation in the face of the grand design being offered us by the Chinese leadership - development without democracy."
"Unless Europe starts to put up a determined fight, that grand design will take a stronger and stronger grip, not just on China but also on many other countries throughout the world."
"I believe the time has come to say so, loud and clear, and to take the necessary action."
"The sessions of the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva are, you might say, something else that comes round once a year."
"But I believe that we in this House, more than most, should take them very seriously as a possible yardstick for worldwide respect for human rights."
"Because this is a situation in which diplomats scrutinize the worldwide human rights situation while giving the most careful consideration to the interests of their own countries, that scrutiny carries a great deal of weight with the various states."
"The European Parliament is more motivated by considerations of democratic policy, and so here too there are occasionally differences."
"With the aid of the EU Commission - and I must contradict Mr Dupuis here, to some extent - the Council appears at such conferences as the co-ordinator of the Member States, and last year demonstrated a consistency which is astonishing for our Member States."
"So we should like to pass on to the Commission and the Council the points that have emerged from past years' work as being necessary."
"Nothing much has changed - the problem countries are still the same."
"The list is a long one."
"This afternoon, some of those problem countries will be dealt with here."
"Nor should the death of the reforming Chinese politician Deng prevent us from drawing attention to the constant human rights violations in that country, as indeed other Members have done, and that point should not be removed from the Geneva agenda."
"The motion for a resolution calls for other things too, of course, things that we feel should really be taken to heart by the Human Rights Commission, such as the development of standards or conventions for impunity, or for the trial procedure for politically motivated crimes."
"This is becoming a key question in more and more of the world's countries as they make the transition from dictatorship to democracy."
"Then there is the protection of children against sexual abuse and exploitation: I think that what Mr Schulz said applies in reverse as well, and that if we have, for once, achieved something good in our own countries we have the right to promulgate it elsewhere."
"Majority opinion in this House favours the abolition of the death penalty, and we should always clearly emphasize that."
"The questions relating to indigenous peoples, too, have become very important."
"We therefore call upon the European Union and the Member States to treat human rights as a really central issue in the structuring of foreign policy and relations between peoples."
"Madam President, I should like to call the Commissioner's attention to a specific human-rights issue: the question of the death penalty."
"It seems strange to have to raise the subject in this House on the threshold of the year 2000; and yet it is a human-rights issue that persists in many of the countries with which we have relations."
"As the Commissioner knows, Europe has, over the past few centuries, developed a strong humanitarian culture and I wonder why so little is being done to convince our partners and third countries to abolish the death penalty or, at least, to introduce a moratorium that I hope would become definitive."
"I believe the Geneva Conference could be an opportunity to reach at least this major objective, and I think it is right and important that the European Union should coordinate its Member States in this respect and exert pressure, actually at the Geneva Conference, to obtain the moratorium I should like to see."
"I should just like to remind the House of three cases of particular interest to the Green Group."
"In all these cases the European Parliament has adopted appropriate resolutions, and I should like to urge the Council most strongly to emphasize those resolutions in Geneva."
"First, Colombia."
"Following Parliament's resolution of October 1996, the consequences of which included the resignation of the Colombian Ambassador in Brussels, Mr Marulanda, the murders of dispossessed farmers and attacks on the human rights movement have actually increased."
"This is an area in which the United Nations must now take action."
"Secondly, Nigeria."
"Wole Soyinka, the Nigerian Nobel laureate, was until yesterday a guest of Parliament."
"He vehemently stated the case for an economic boycott, and especially an oil boycott, against General Abacha's military regime."
"This demand must be taken up by the UN commissions, because only the UN can impose this kind of international boycott."
"Thirdly, Turkey."
"The Turkish government, supported in some places by Europeans, has so far always been able to avoid condemnation by the UN Human Rights Commission."
"But the human rights situation in Turkey has not improved by one iota."
"The EU must finally abandon all its misguided diplomatic considerations and make it its primary concern to condemn these human rights violations in its own back yard, especially against the Kurdish people."
"That is our request to the Council, and we call upon it to act as a matter of urgency."
"Madam President, unfortunately we cannot totally prevent some of our citizens from committing crimes, even such serious crimes as murder."
"But we can, quite rightly, demand that States do not legitimate such crime by themselves killing, that is executing their citizens."
"The prime evidence for me that the European Union is based on humanitarian feeling and respect for life is that all Member States have abolished the death penalty."
"Madam President, the European Parliament has also reason to be confident that all Member governments will be reminded of Parliament's wishes in this resolution during the meeting with the UN Commission on Human Rights, and that they will demand a universal, all country, moratorium on execution."
"Parliament should request the President of the Commission to give an account of the Member States handling of this matter."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on this rare occasion when you are not immersed in matters relating to the single currency but have found time to consider human rights, I should like to address you very specifically, as other honourable Members have already done, on the matter of the death penalty and the moratorium which we are asking the Member States to apply and which we should like the Commission to support at the next conference of the Commission on Human Rights, to be held in Geneva."
"This is a very important subject."
"On the eve of the third millennium, it is intolerable that the death penalty should still feature in the penal codes of most members of the international community."
"The European Union should launch an initiative at the UN General Assembly in favour of an immediate moratorium, something that would make a great contribution to advancing the cause of human rights."
"The idea is one of particular interest to certain Member States, including your own, Commissioner, if I am not mistaken."
"I hope that the Commission, too, will be attentive to it."
"Madam President, I can agree with a great deal of what Mrs van Bladel, Mr Dupois and Mrs Lenz have said about China."
"At best, the events in China last night may herald a new era in the country."
"The revolutionary old guard which was forced to struggle in tough conditions for self determination for China and against foreign influence and attempts to isolate the world's largest country have now gone."
"At best, and I know that many take a more pessimistic view, the new generation will be able to realise that no country can play a role of any importance in the year 2000's globalised world if they do not totally respect human rights."
"In my capacity as leader of the Chinese delegation I have had many contacts with the Chinese both with the government and those in opposition."
"Many Chinese believe that we, here in the European Parliament are pursuing a particular campaign against China."
"They have counted the number of resolutions adopted which criticise China."
"I think it is important that we stress to China that we are not running a campaign against China, but a campaign for human rights."
"There are very few countries on this earth that have not been criticised by us at some point in time; even countries which are members of the European Union are criticised."
"It is therefore a campaign for human rights directed at all those who do not respect them."
"There are also a number of people in China who believe that we are not aware of the existence of other traditions and cannot accept such a thing."
"They think that we want to force all sorts of European traditions and values onto them."
"I cannot understand this at all."
"Human rights are not a particular European invention."
"Europeans do not have an awful lot to boast about historically in terms of human rights."
"Human rights are a universal value."
"European representatives must also stress that we are not trying to force European human rights onto them, but that we are trying to make everyone understand that universal human rights are part of modern society."
"As the leader of the Chinese Delegation I have, of course, sent a diplomatic message of regret at the passing of Mr Deng, as the death of any person is a loss for someone."
"In the same way, I must send a message of regret that human rights activists are still sitting in Chinese prisons, simply because they want to add a fifth modernisation to Mr Deng's four modernisations."
"Of course, opposition is as much a part of the present as the labour camps and the death penalty are a relic of the past."
"Madam President, I want to draw the attention of the House in particular to paragraph 8 which calls for the adoption of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples at the level of the UN Commission on Human Rights as agreed by all parties involved, including indigenous peoples."
"This is a very important declaration that we are being asked to support."
"Parliament has an honourable record in supporting the rights of the aboriginal peoples who can only too easily be forgotten because they have no states to protect them."
"Often, even the right to the land they live on is challenged by the states that surround them."
"We adopted, as a Parliament, a resolution in 1994 calling for the establishment of a delegation with the indigenous peoples."
"This will be pursued this year."
"This is very important indeed."
"It will give a sign of encouragement to peoples whose survival is at risk."
"When we talk about endangered animal species, we should certainly support them."
"But there are many peoples, languages and cultural groups which are also facing grave threats."
"So I urge you to support the entire resolution and, in particular, to give ringing endorsement to paragraph 8."
"I ask the Commission to take this forward with our support to the United Nations."
"Mr President, The Iranian author Faraj Sarkouhi has been viciously attacked by the authorities in Iran."
"His assistant Parvin Ardalan appears also to have been attacked."
"This is a despicable act and we in the European Parliament wish to make our views known on this."
"But it is the 'critical dialogue' which our Member Governments are supposedly conducting with Iran which is even more amazing to us."
"We in Parliament find it difficult to see that this has led to any positive concrete results."
"If Iran does not soon show signs of increased respect for human rights and reconsider its attitude to torture, executions and conspiracies against the lives of non Iranian citizens, this critical dialogue must be reviewed and a new policy using different political means towards Iran must be put in place."
"Mr President, despite numerous condemnations of flagrant infringements of human rights in Iran by many organizations as well as the European Parliament and efforts made by representatives of the Iranian Government to persuade us that the situation has improved, regrettably this is not the case, as numerous events have demonstrated."
"According to Amnesty International, the number of executions at least doubled in 1996 and arrests of all who step out of line, now of oil workers on strike, and the persecution of religious minorities have continued."
"Furthermore, support for Islamic fundamentalist groups involved in terrorism in other countries like Algeria is reported to have been maintained and some 30 opponents of the regime have been killed abroad."
"The German authorities have continued to charge Iranian officials with responsibility for the killing of Kurdish leaders in Berlin in 1992 and there have been allegations about the importation of weapons even into Belgium, possibly for outrages there."
"Worst of all, an Iranian foundation has stepped up the reward offered for implementing an illegal death threat against Salman Rushdie who is not now and never has been an Iranian citizen."
"In the circumstances we must reiterate and renew our condemnation of the continuing gross violation of human rights in Iran at home and abroad and increase pressure on the Iranian authorities on all these issues."
"Discrimination against women is also very acute in Iran and we must fully maintain our criticism and take a stand against this."
"The policy of critical dialogue has not succeeded in bringing about a change in the Iranian Government's policy despite all the talk of the moderation of Rafsanjani and the mellowing of the regime."
"We must therefore take a tough line with Iran."
"We must not only pass this resolution but continue to press the government in every feasible way genuinely to recognize human rights."
"Mr President, not a week goes by without news of further human rights violations in Iran."
"Two such cases have made headlines just recently."
"The press was still discussing the arrest of the writer Sarkouhi, who publishes one of the few critical periodicals left in Iran."
"Then came word that a private foundation in Iran had increased the bounty on Salman Rushdie."
"The Bahai, trade union members and women are being threatened by the fundamentalists."
"The government is arresting people."
"So where is the dividing line in this case between governmental authority and religious fanaticism?"
"This Iranian government is supposedly concerned to improve relations with Europe, but how does it actually imagine that such relations are to be established, and on what basis?"
"Our wish for the Iranian people is that respect for the international principles of human rights will finally re-establish contact between our peoples."
"The European Council stated its position clearly on the anniversary of the fatwa against Salman Rushdie."
"But when he criticizes the EU, he should be aware that only an international community like the European Union can provide sanctuary."
"Many other people, too, in Iran are suffering from the acts of the Iranian regime; death threats and terrorist attacks outside the country cannot be ruled out."
"Mr Newens referred just now to the German case."
"We in this Parliament stand up for human rights, freedom of religion and opinion, the rule of law and democracy, and we will ensure that Iran is not in any doubt about that."
"Mr President, I, too, should like to address the Commissioner on this issue, since we are, today, strongly condemning the State terrorism practised by the Iranian authorities. But this is not the first time we have done this and I wonder what good it does, whether it actually does any good to go on and on condemning, without really doing anything."
"Far too many of the regime's political opponents have been killed over the past few years, in various places throughout the world, by the special services of the Iranian security forces."
"It has even happened in my country, in Italy."
"These security forces continue to threaten Iranian citizens who are living in the Member States and conducting legitimate political activities against the regime."
"I believe that Europe's policy with regard to Iran is too complaisant and that what we and, in particular, the European institutions should be doing instead is to pursue a hard-hitting policy. For what is happening in Teheran today is that there is apartheid against women, democracy is being treated with contempt every day and physical attacks on opponents are a matter of course."
"It seems to me that the situation is very serious and sufficient to require special action that, in my opinion, has unfortunately not yet been taken."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as other Members have already said, the human rights situation in Iran really is worse than it has ever been."
"Women, religious minorities and intellectuals who venture even the faintest criticism of current policy become victims of blatant repression and brutal persecution."
"A clear sign of the steady deterioration is that even the official figure for executions in the year 1996 has doubled to 110."
"We know that this is only the tip of the iceberg, and that the number of unreported cases of people being abducted without any form of due process, subjected to the most cruel tortures and then murdered is far greater."
"The latest examples of these terror tactics are the repeated disappearance of the publisher Sarkouhi, who was previously held captive in November by the Iranian government and maltreated for 47 days, and - as Mrs Lenz and others have mentioned - the latest increase in the bounty on Salman Rushdie."
"Both of these, incidentally, represent attempts by Iran to influence the outcome of the Mykonos trial in Berlin, which has now produced clear proof that the Mullahs have been responsible for the murders of opposition figures abroad."
"Time and again, the intolerable circumstances in Iran and the policy practised by the regime of the Mullahs and its secret service of exporting terror have prompted the European Parliament to utter strong words of criticism."
"But that criticism is directed not only against those in power in Iran but also against governments within the European Union, and especially against the Federal Republic of Germany."
"That criticism is directed against the unqualified commitment to the policy of so-called critical dialogue."
"The time really has come to accept that this so-called critical dialogue has failed."
"It has been of use to economic relations, and it has repeatedly provided confirmation for those in power in Tehran that their policy can be pursued with impunity."
"As far as human rights are concerned, this so-called critical dialogue has changed nothing, and yet the preservation of and respect for human rights is the most important issue of all!"
"Mordechai Vanunu"
"Mr President, three previous resolutions passed by this Parliament since 1990 have been ignored by the Israeli Government."
"There have also been many questions."
"I asked both previous Prime Ministers of Israel and was told that the whole matter was one for the Israeli justice system."
"It is not and was not."
"It is our concern."
"Vanunu revealed to the British press that Israel had nuclear weapons."
"Also, he was kidnapped from an EU country, Italy, against international law."
"However, that is in the past."
"What is not is that for over ten years Vanunu has been kept in solitary confinement in a so-called civilized country, in conditions which Amnesty International describes as cruel, inhuman and degrading."
"He is certainly treated far worse than either the American or British spies who were sentenced for selling their secrets to the Soviet Union."
"This resolution is really an appeal for clemency."
"Vanunu cannot damage Israeli security."
"I ask the Israeli Government to end the solitary confinement and to arrange for an early release of this long-serving prisoner."
"Mr President, I welcome the fact that after so many attempts and such a long lapse of time we can once again discuss the case of Mordecai Vanunu in this House."
"As Mr Crampton just said, we have passed three previous resolutions and we have achieved nothing."
"I believe the European Union and the Israeli government, too, have a duty to take action on behalf of this person."
"We should ask the Israeli government to show clemency by ordering an early release for Mordecai Vanunu."
"What did he do?"
"He told the Sunday Times something that everybody now knows - what Israel's nuclear potential is."
"If we go to Israel we can talk about the country's nuclear weapons capability, we can talk about his arrest - there are no problems with that."
"The fact that he was abducted, that this is now part of history, that he was sentenced to 18 years' imprisonment under conditions incompatible with the rule of law, and that ten years of that term have now passed - this must prompt us all to do everything in our power to release this man from his solitary confinement."
"I believe that our Committee on Human Rights should concern itself with this situation and should call upon our governments to take action in this matter, because solitary confinement is a barbarity."
"He has no contact with the outside world, except for his brother, and that is a thing we deplore in any state where such a thing can happen."
"The least that the State of Israel should do is to hold him under humane conditions, and to ensure that his relatives can visit him and that he can take exercise."
"But I believe that after 10 years and now that there is really no longer any charge against him - secret services use means that are much crueller, much more terrible, and as for the information on nuclear weapons, we all know that anyway - there really is no reason to continue holding him at all."
"So this House calls upon Israel to show clemency."
"Mr President, ten years' solitary confinement in a cell is an inhumanity, but in all honesty we must admit that recently Mr Vanunu has regularly been offered additional privileges which he has rejected."
"I also think that his situation should be improved but my group cannot support the motion for a resolution in its form before us today."
"I would have much preferred this House to spend its energy on a matter in the same region which is so important in relation to human rights."
"Mr President, for a long time now Germany, France and Greece have been calling for the extradition of the former SS-officer and war criminal, Alois Brunner."
"This man is in Syria."
"When can justice be given to the victims in France and Greece?"
"If Syria is of good will and wants association agreements with the EU then let it go ahead with the extradition of Mr Brunner."
"Mr President, the Middle East is working slowly towards peace."
"The Hebron agreement has at last been produced."
"The visit here this week in Strasbourg of a joint Israeli-Palestinian parliamentary delegation is a sign that business can now be done with both the Palestinians and the Israelis."
"The time is also ripe for another breakthrough."
"Mr Vanunu has been in solitary confinement in a small cell for more than ten years because of the alleged security risk that he is said to represent ten years after the event."
"In the light of the changed circumstances my group calls for clemency and for attention to be paid to the human rights aspects of this sad case."
"But this House must be realistic."
"I am honest enough to say that the request to all concerned to produce all the evidence on Mr Vanunu's arrest is ludicrous."
"If paragraph 4 is not deleted - and we shall table an amendment to that effect - then the Liberal Group will most unfortunately be forced to vote against this motion for a resolution."
"Chad"
"Mr President, I spent the period from 3 to 6 January as a European observer in Chad to witness the holding of the country's first democratic elections."
"Although this first ballot was properly conducted, I am sorry to say that I cannot express any enthusiasm about the human rights situation."
"I saw for myself the violence used by the forces of order against the Chadian people, men, women and children."
"Immediate extermination without trial seems to be standard practice."
"Although I can understand the difficulties facing the political leadership in Chad -the build-up of arms among certain sectors of the community following thirty years of war, the looting, the assaults - I certainly cannot accept a situation where the guilty parties, or alleged guilty parties, are subjected to violence and conspiracy unworthy of a country in which - I am happy to say - the democratic process is under way."
"I therefore call upon President Déby and the future government to put an end to these practices and to install an efficient and just legal system acting in the interests of all and with respect for the rights of each individual."
"Mr President, I am deeply concerned about the situation in Chad."
"The allegations in the resolution are very serious indeed."
"I was also in Chad for the first stage of the legislative elections and I shall be returning to Chad this weekend for the second stage, on your behalf, at the invitation of the government of Chad."
"Today the Prime Minister of Chad has come to Strasbourg on the eve of the elections."
"I have had a meeting with him."
"The Prime Minister has offered the opportunity of a prison visit, besides certain meetings in Chad this weekend, which I have accepted."
"The Prime Minister is aware of the grave concern of this European Parliament."
"I welcome the Prime Minister to the European Parliament and I say to him that we are aware of the recent history of Chad and that there has been some progress in human rights, but we are in no way satisfied."
"The government of Chad and this European Parliament have a responsibility to cooperate in order to deliver a radical and urgent improvement in basic human rights, to allow Members of the European Parliament in Chad this week to collect further first-hand information and to defer the vote today until March in order that we can make substantial progress."
"I appeal to all parties to let us do this, to set a timetable and to take this issue more seriously than simply to adopt the resolution, so that we can make progress in Chad and have a vote, if necessary, in March."
"Indigenous peoples of Indonesia"
"Mr President, Yamdena is an island in Eastern Indonesia, and the Indonesian Government has granted very extensive logging permits to certain forestry companies."
"Our concern is that this logging may be carried out without any regard for the rights of indigenous peoples."
"The area is also extremely ecologically diverse and rich."
"Has the Commission sent any kind of fact-finding mission to the area?"
"It promised to do so in informal talks with Members of this Parliament last November."
"I should also like to know what view the Commission takes of this matter."
"The Commission has supported many forest protection projects in Indonesia, but now, in a way, the basis for this protection of forests is under threat."
"Will the Commission step up its measures to protect forests in Indonesia, including the Yamdena region?"
"I shall answer all the questions in the order in which they were asked."
"As regards the 53rd session of the Commission on Human Rights, I must tell Mr Dell'Alba that I am indeed unaccustomed to dealing with the human rights clause in connection with matters pertaining to the euro, but I shall do my best today to answer the questions that have been asked."
"As you know, the Commission is paying the closest attention to the preparations for this next session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights."
"Like Mr Schulz, indeed, I find it very difficult to make a choice among all these subjects."
"Human rights violations are, sadly, very widespread on this planet, Mr Kreissl-Dörfler, and in every case they are always firmly condemned by the European Union - not only firmly but effectively, too, as you will see if you refer to most of our agreements which include 'human rights' clauses."
"The European Union is particularly active at the United Nations and never misses an opportunity to restate its concerns on this matter."
"As far as China is concerned, I can tell you that the Union intends to resort to what it considers to be the most appropriate means, while being careful not to jeopardize the prospects of resuming the bilateral dialogue."
"We need to take effective action here, while being careful not to appear ridiculous or lose our credibility."
"What matters, I believe, is the result."
"The question of a resolution on the human rights situation will be debated at the Council of Foreign Affairs Ministers next Monday in Brussels, Mr Dupuis, and I can tell you that a joint approach with the United States is a possibility."
"Bilateral contacts with the Chinese authorities have also been established on this subject."
"Regarding your other causes for concern, I can tell you that the European Union does intervene, as a matter of priority, in the areas of children's rights and women's rights."
"Mr Dell'Alba, Mr Cars and Mr Pettinari have mentioned the problem of the death penalty."
"I believe that the Commission has no jurisdiction on this."
"I shall therefore pass on your message to the Dutch presidency."
"I can assure you, as far as I am concerned at any rate, that I entirely agree with your analysis and with your concerns, and I believe that, at present, there is not a single European State that still applies this penalty."
"I believe we should indeed be agitating for its abolition internationally."
"Unfortunately, however, I can only give you a personal commitment on that point."
"The European Union has also tabled a draft resolution on children's rights, covering the problems of forced labour, sexual exploitation, children in war zones and street children."
"I believe this draft resolution is supported by a majority of the Member States of the European Union."
"Point two: human rights in Iran, including the case of Mr Sarkouhi."
"The Commission is aware, like Parliament, of the gravity of the human rights situation in Iran, where repression seems to have hardened in the course of the last two years."
"However, it is my duty to inform you that the Iranian authorities have sent a request to the United Nations special envoy in Iran with a view to obtaining technical assistance from the UN in areas such as penal reform, the training of judges and aid to the NGOs involved in women's affairs."
"As Mr Pettinari says, we must condemn the human rights violations."
"To disregard such acts can only, as I see it, encourage their continuance, which would be unacceptable."
"The European Union therefore strongly condemns these blatant violations of basic rights by Iran."
"I recall that Iran has signed the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, and should abide by its undertakings if only for that reason."
"Like Mr Newens, therefore, the Commission strongly deplores the announcement by a private body of an increase in the bounty offered for the death of Mr Salman Rushdie."
"Within the framework of the critical dialogue - and no, Mrs Roth, that dialogue has not broken down - the European Union is endeavouring to obtain further assurances from the Iranian Government regarding Mr Rushdie's safety."
"That is why the Commission is calling upon the Iranian Government to condemn this action unreservedly and to encourage the body concerned to withdraw its bounty."
"Also, like Mrs Lenz, the Commission is very concerned at the fate of Mr Sarkouhi, an Iranian writer and publisher."
"According to our information - or at least to information available to us - Mr Sarkouhi has allegedly been arrested and tortured on several occasions during the past two months."
"The Commission is asking the Iranian Government to provide all information in its possession regarding Mr Sarkouhi's situation, and it also intends, with the support of the Member States, to bring pressure to bear upon Iran for his immediate release."
"Point three: Mr Mordechai Vanunu."
"The Commission is still keenly aware of the matter of Mr Vanunu's solitary confinement, and I can tell Mr Telkämper and Mr Crampton that we are concerned by the conditions of that confinement."
"Similarly, the Commission is paying close attention to respect for human rights in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza, and these matters regularly appear on the agenda of the bilateral discussions with the Israeli authorities."
"The Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement recently concluded between the European Union and Israel is to be ratified shortly."
"Within the framework of the political dialogue with Israel that this agreement establishes, the European Union will be better able to exert a positive influence on human rights issues, and especially on the problem of Mr Vanunu's imprisonment."
"Let me remind you that the Union - and the Commission in particular - will be able to base its arguments on the clause which makes respect for human rights an essential element of the agreement; if that clause is not observed, the agreement lapses."
"With regard to Chad, the Commission considers that the transition to a pluralistic regime has brought a significant improvement in respect for political rights in that country."
"However, the situation still gives cause for concern."
"The outrages perpetrated by the forces of order, which you mentioned, are jeopardizing the country's democratic achievements."
"In particular, firing on offenders is a serious breach of human rights, which are an essential element of the fourth Lomé Convention under which Chad has certain obligations to the European Union."
"Let me assure Mrs André-Léonard and Mr McGowan that the Commission has already made representations to the Chadian authorities asking that the orders given to the police should be compatible with respect for human rights."
"Furthermore, the Commission is calling upon the Government of Chad to take all necessary steps to ensure significant progress in respect for human rights and the establishment of the rule of law."
"Finally, regarding the tropical forests of the Indonesian island of Yamdena, the Commission is paying close attention to this matter, as you know, and to the question of deforestation and its consequences for the local people and the environment."
"The Commission has not sent a mission to the area, Mrs Hautala, but it is helping to finance studies that are taking place, because sustainable forest management is the keystone for the Indonesian development cooperation programme being administered by the Commission."
"At present, more than ECU 71 million has been earmarked for projects in this area."
"The Commission has also embarked on a review of the priorities for the development programme with Indonesia."
"Within that framework, the possibility of undertaking micro-projects, especially in the sectors of water, sanitary infrastructures and education, is currently being examined."
"I must however make the point that the room for manoeuvre available to the Commission in its attempts to influence the situation in the island at short notice is, ultimately, very small."
"After all, the assessment and approval procedures for development projects normally take between 20 and 30 months, and that period, sadly, means that it is not always possible to take into account the damage that may have been caused to the environment."
"I therefore believe that the granting of aid to local NGOs devoted to defending the rights of the local people is worth considering."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5.30 pm."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B4-0087/97 by Mr Cars and others, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the situation in former Yugoslavia; -B4-0090/97 by Mr Pasty and Mr Azzolini, on behalf of the UPE Group, on the situation in former Yugoslavia; -B4-0099/97 by Mr Vandemeulebroucke and others, on behalf of the ARE Group, on the political situation in Serbia; -B4-0104/97 by Mr Wiersma and others, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the situation in Mostar and Eastern Slavonia; -B4-0127/97 by Mr Carnero González, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the situation in former Yugoslavia; -B4-0139/97 by Mr Aelvoet and others, on behalf of the V Group, on the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and eastern Slavonia; -B4-0156/97 by Mr Pack and others, on behalf of the PPE Group, on the situation in former Yugoslavia."
"Mr President, Carl Bildt, who is chief representative for the EU in the former Yugoslavia, often talks about the need for time and the fact that we must be patient."
"Likewise, the UN representative for Human Rights often speaks about the need for time to resolve the problems in the former Yugoslavia."
"Like them, I would like to emphasis that this is often the case."
"But, at the same time, it is also important for us to demonstrate in various ways, that although the passage of time is not leading to such rapid progress as we would have hoped, this does not mean that we have lost our interest in and commitment to the former Yugoslavia. We still want to find a definitive solution which means that human rights are respected and that people can live freely where they so desire."
"I believe that the resolution under consideration today and our continuing discussions are primarily a means of expressing Parliament's desire to press on in its quest for further action concerning the former Yugoslavia."
"I would like therefore, on behalf of the liberal group, to express our concern over what has happened in Mostar: over the fact that acts of violence there have added to the difficulties in the search for a final solution, and that the international police task force are quite obviously not adequately equipped to be able to resolve the situation."
"We can also express our regret over the fact that we have not found a decisive solution to the Brcko-issue and we hope that we will also have better success here in the future."
"With regard to this latter situation, we would like to conclude by saying that it is important that we maintain the desire for cooperation and mutual understanding between the UN and Europe which was demonstrated in Brcko, and that pay due attention to this in our final decision on the future of Brcko."
"Mr President, I would endorse the remarks of the previous speaker."
"What we are confronting is the difficulty of balancing the rights of the various communities who used to form part of Yugoslavia."
"In Mostar, we have the Croat and Muslim sides and it seems to me that the only way we can get some kind of solution is to have a kind of de facto federation of Mostar on both sides of the Neretva river."
"Likewise, the delicate situation in Brcko I think may be resolved by a similar compromise."
"Here, at least, we have the Dayton solution to allow the situation to stay as it is for at least one year under Serb control."
"At this stage, in both cases, we have to be patient and ask the people on the ground to be patient and to let the situation settle down a little, and after a year we will review it."
"Likewise, the position in Kosovo at the moment is potentially dangerous."
"We have to ask that the rights of Albanian speakers are fully respected in that area so we do not create a new flashpoint just when things are settling down elsewhere."
"Mr President, as Mr Macartney has just indicated, there are a number of problems in the former Yugoslavia which concern us at the moment but perhaps the most symbolic has to be the situation in Mostar."
"Mostar, after all was the city of EU administration, and Mostar shows the strengths and weaknesses of the EU initiatives in former Yugoslavia: the strengths, because there is no doubt that in Mostar we have seen tremendous technical assistance which has helped rebuild it; the weaknesses, because, of course, Mostar has shown the lack of political will by the Council of Ministers to support some of its rhetoric."
"Of course, we all remember that terrible day when Mr Koschnick nearly died."
"He was given very little support by the Council of Ministers."
"What we have in Yugoslavia, is not peace but an absence of war and we are currently hoping that in the absence of war the communities will start to live with each other again."
"But it is very much more hope than anything else."
"It is clear from recent events, most noticeably in Mostar, that things are not working as well as we would like."
"We have seen the weaknesses that were inherent in the Dayton Agreement, the inability to deal properly with de facto ethnic cleansing, the impression that was left by Dayton that it might be possible to create some sort of Croat federation within the Bosnian federation, which is really behind much of what is going on at the moment."
"The inability to deal with the big states, most notably Croatia, and President Tudjman's activities, particularly in relation to the Croat community in Mostar and the inability also to deal with what I suspect are the real villains behind the situation in Mostar, that is the gangsters on West Bank who have clearly got the city tied up for themselves and do not want normal peace to be resumed."
"We have to make it clear that it is vital for the international community not to allow Mostar, given its symbolism, to get out of control."
"We need the international police task force and indeed the stabilization force to be more vigorous in keeping the communities apart; to stop the cowardly attacks which we have seen recently in Mostar; to investigate them and to take action against the guilty parties."
"Quite frankly, if we feel that the international police task force does not have enough power then we ought to be looking at how to increase those powers so that they need not stand helplessly watching people being attacked, injured and, even killed."
"We ought to also send out a very clear message that much has been done in Mostar."
"The international community has spent a huge amount of money, if that work is undone, if those projects are destroyed again, the people on the ground have to understand very clearly: the international community is not going to be prepared to find the money a second time."
"This is the last chance for Mostar."
"We must not allow it to be destroyed and we should, in fact, give no more support to the West Bank until they are prepared to work together with the rest of Mostar to build a peaceful community."
"Mr President, it seems to me that, unfortunately, there is once again a risk of renewed fighting in former Yugoslavia."
"The tensions in Mostar are evidence of the fragility of the cold peace in the Republic, and the international arbitration committee's inability to give a definitive response as regards the status of major cities in the area is a sign of the former Yugoslavian authorities' unwillingness to base their countries' future on multi-ethnic co-existence and reconciliation."
"Many parts of the former Yugoslavia are showing signs of a clear lack of political will to deal with the causes of tension through dialogue and policy."
"For this reason, the Commission and Council should, in my opinion, make it very clear that European aid for reconstruction is dependent on a policy of co-existence, the free and safe return of all refugees to their home towns, irrespective of their ethnic origin, and respect of the new institutions set up as a result of the Dayton Agreement."
"I therefore call on the Commission not to sit back and simply watch the rising political tension and to urge the Council to accept its responsibilities and demand full compliance with the Dayton Agreement from all its signatories."
"Mr President, as previous Members have already said, the situation that is emerging in the former Yugoslavia demonstrates the limitations of the Dayton Agreement, which our group has pointed out on several occasions."
"These limitations have given rise not to peace but, at best, to an absence of war."
"But it is not simply a question of going beyond the Dayton Agreement; it is also a question of actually implementing that Agreement."
"Instead what we have is a situation in which the Agreement is still not being fully implemented and in which nothing is being done to move towards full implementation, resolve the emergency and make the shift from an absence of war to peace."
"For these reasons, we are very concerned about what has been happening in the various parts of the former Yugoslavia, and particularly, because they are so symbolic, in Mostar and Brcko."
"In particular, I should like to point to the need to reinforce the mandate and increase the capacity of the international police task force, whose action is crucial for any peaceful development of the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina."
"In the case of Brcko, this means that we need to acknowledge that the safe return of refugees must be guaranteed and that the Deputy High Representative must be provided with the necessary resources to enforce his mandate."
"In this respect, I should like to stress that it will be impossible to establish any real peace if refugees do not return and if there is no guarantee that the committee provided for by the Dayton Agreement to deal with the return of property will become operational."
"In addition, we obviously need to guarantee dialogue - something that we, the Green Group, have long been demanding."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by condemning the acts of violence by the Bosnian Croats in the strongest terms."
"Secondly, I would expect anyone who can exert any influence on those responsible for this conduct or misconduct to do so immediately."
"Thirdly, I would also expect the perpetrators to be punished and removed from office."
"However, I would also like to draw attention to the fact that present events in Mostar can trace their origin back to errors committed at Dayton and particularly to the recognition of the so-called Republika Srpska, from which the Serbs today infer that they have nothing to do with Bosnia Herzegovina."
"And that has made it very difficult for the Bosnian Croats to renounce Herceg-Bosna."
"Secondly, I would call attention to the fact that Sarajevo is becoming more and more of a Muslim city, making it difficult for non-Muslims to enjoy equal rights there."
"We should similarly be aware of both these facts, and ensure that this does not constantly give rise to further protest campaigns in Mostar."
"Thirdly, I would like to say that the weak attitude of the European Union's contact group regarding the maintenance of Bosnia-Herzegovina as a multiethnic entity, as laid down at Dayton, is to be condemned."
"The consequence of it is that other Dayton signatories, Croatia and Serbia to be specific, are also less than totally committed to implementing the Dayton Agreement as quickly as possible."
"Fourthly, I should like to point out that those in the region who are standing by Dayton, meaning those who want to let the refugees return home and are actually doing so, should receive swift and really visible support."
"They must be allowed to expect that their Dayton-style good deeds really will be crowned with success, that it is visible, that they receive their reward."
"That is the only way in which we shall be able eventually to persuade others to do what they actually promised to do by signing - observing the provisions of the Dayton Agreement."
"Ladies and gentlemen, while it remains impossible - in Brcko, in Mostar, in the Republika Srpska and in many places in the Muslim-Croat Federation - for refugees really to return, and as long as we are unable to name a day by which the refugees must be allowed back, we shall continue having difficulties."
"We have had good experience of deadlines in the European Union."
"We have one at the moment, for the euro."
"I think that in the case of Dayton, as well, we should try to set a deadline by which the refugees must be returned, because only the return of the refugees can enable reconstruction aid to bear fruit and peace to be restored."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by expressing my complete agreement with what Mrs Pack has just said - I too believe the Dayton Agreement bears a very great responsibility for many of the problems we are witnessing in the former Yugoslavia, problems which are now becoming particularly acute in Mostar and Brcko."
"I must admit, though, that the present motion for a resolution fills me with astonishment in certain places at the constant use of double standards."
"When we listened to the announcements about the city of Brcko on 14 February, we were first told that the city would be awarded to the Serbs."
"Not until this rightly provoked massive protests from the Muslims and Croats was it announced that the decision would be deferred for a year."
"Well, we can already begin to imagine what kind of decision will be taken in a year's time."
"There will be a capitulation to the more vociferous and probably stronger claimants, the Serbs, although until the Muslims were driven out they were by far the largest ethnic group in Brcko, followed by the Croats, with the Serbs ranking only third."
"Every faction in the world that pursues a policy of ethnic cleansing is now gazing spellbound at Brcko - because they see the possibility that their dangerous and degraded activities may be ratified by international arbitration."
"That, in my view, is one of the main dangers."
"Nor, following the experiences of recent months with the Serbian part of Bosnia and the flagrant disregard of numerous provisions of the Dayton Agreement, must we allow ourselves to be deluded into thinking that Brcko, once it is under Serbian control, will function in the future as a crossroads through which the historical highway to the north, of vital importance to Muslims and Croats, can pass."
"As soon as international control ends, that gateway will be closed."
"We should, after all, learn a lesson or two from history. Wherever an unnatural corridor has been created, it has led to the next war."
"We need only remember what a disaster the Polish corridor brought down upon us."
"One more point about the motion on Mostar."
"It would be nice if, at least occasionally, we were to honour the legal principle of audiatur et altera pars , instead of blaming everything on the Croats, which is what always happens here."
"Mr President, the Commission is keeping a close watch on the matters raised by honourable Members regarding the former Yugoslavia."
"First, may I say that as far as the implementation of the civil aspects of the Dayton and Paris agreements are concerned, the present period is one of consolidation."
"The Peace Implementation Conference clearly indicated, at the last ministerial meeting in London, what results were to be achieved during this period."
"Despite the progress already made, many problems have yet to be resolved."
"Some honourable Members have just emphasized, rightly, the fact that not enough is yet being done to comply with the promise of collaboration with the International Criminal Court."
"That collaboration is one of the main political conditions for access to reconstruction aid."
"The European Commission thus feels that, in the case of the Republika Srpska, it can only implement projects aimed at improving collaboration between the two Bosnian sectors."
"If the country is to achieve the reconciliation it needs, it is an essential condition that war criminals should be handed over to the judicial authorities."
"It should also be recalled, in this context, that many of the refugees come from regions that now form part of the Republika Srpska, and that the presence of war criminals in those regions is obstructing their return."
"On the other hand, the central government of Bosnia-Herzegovina is functioning, but important decisions certainly still need to be taken, especially on the economic front, regarding such essential matters as the functioning of the Central Bank or the adoption of a single currency for all the Bosnian areas."
"These steps are essential for the economic stabilization of the country, and a necessary condition for the mobilization of donors."
"Politically, cooperation within the Federation still leaves much to be desired and, Mr Titley, events in Mostar are seriously prejudicing relations between the Croats and the Muslims."
"The Commission has drawn the attention of all parties to the fact that the situation in Mostar is crucial for the cohesion of the Federation."
"The Commission has stressed the need to do everything possible to prevent the situation from deteriorating."
"I should remind you, even so, that the European Union has mobilized considerable resources in men and material to try to reconcile the population of Mostar."
"We must not allow the action of a few unruly elements to frustrate these efforts."
"Regarding Kosovo, which is another stumbling block in relations with the former Republic of Yugoslavia, I am sorry to say that there still seems to be no sign of a solution."
"The authorities in Belgrade must understand that this obstinacy is preventing any progress in their relations with the Union."
"The Commission regrets the fact that no Union presence is yet being tolerated in Kosovo, and that Belgrade is even refusing to grant a visa to Mr Vanderstoel, the SOEC High Commissioner for minorities."
"Finally, the arbitration decision regarding Brcko has been provisionally adopted."
"The international community has now taken on the task of creating, next year, the political and economic conditions that would enable that decision to become final."
"The European Commission will be assisting this process by launching, within the framework of the reconstruction effort, projects which may help to improve the situation."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B4-0069/97 by Mr Ford and others, on behalf of the PSE Group, on racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism; -B4-0100/97 by Mr Hory and others, on behalf of the ARE Group, on the rise of the extreme right in the European Union, especially France; -B4-0117/97 by Mr Pailler, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on threats to freedom of expression and creation; -B4-0131/97 by Mrs Roth and others, on behalf of the V Group, on the resurgence of racism and neo-fascism in Europe; -B4-0136/97 by Mrs Roth and others, on behalf of the V Group, on the introduction of visa requirements for minors who are dependents of immigrants in the Federal Republic of Germany."
"Mr President, can I rise to support the joint resolution and the two amendments in the name of some French colleagues on the issue of racism, xenophobia and the extreme right."
"This resolution asks that the one country, the United Kingdom, which has not done so, should agree immediately to the establishment of a European observatory to monitor racism, xenophobia, and anti-Semitism."
"They have already agreed to use Article 235 to establish both the drugs observatory and the European observatory on health and safety at work and we can see no reason why in this particular area there should be any problem whatsoever."
"If they have any doubts about the need to work together at a European level they need only look back to the events which took place a few weeks ago when Danish neo-Nazis, with supporters of the British National Party, got together through Sweden to send letter bombs to mixed raced couples in the United Kingdom."
"If that is not an example of a need to work together at a European level, I do not know what is."
"Secondly, the resolution attacks the activities of some of the extreme right-wing parties in the European Unions specifically the Front national in Toulon, Orange and Marignane."
"Because of the Front national demonstration due to take place here in Strasbourg in March we heard this morning Mr Gollnisch making an impassioned plea for tolerance and freedom of speech."
"I have to say I have not heard so much hypocrisy for such a long time!"
"We can see what is happening in Orange where libraries are being censored, grants are being cut off and people are not allowed even to get married if they want to marry foreigners."
"The last time I went to Marseilles to do a press conference on the issue of racism, it took French riot-police with riot-shields and tear gas to allow me to make that press conference due to a demonstration by the same Front national Mr Gollnisch belongs to."
"What I want to say in conclusion is that I am delighted to learn today that the Council of Europe is going to make this chamber available on Easter Monday to enable the people in Strasbourg who want to protest about the activities of the Front national a forum to express their tolerance and their rejection of the evil politics of the people over there."
"Mr President, may I say that, for once, our urgent procedure really has lived up to its name - after all, it is a matter of the utmost urgency to counter the rise of racism, xenophobia, anti-semitism and the far Right in Europe, examples of which can be seen everywhere."
"I shall mention just four."
"First, crimes and offences inspired by racism are proliferating throughout Europe."
"You will say that this is, unfortunately, an everyday occurrence, that these criminal activities prove that the worse can happen at any time."
"Secondly, we have just seen an unprecedented event in France: a victory for the far Right by an absolute majority of votes cast in a partial municipal election at Vitrolles, showing that the worst can become acceptable for some of our fellow citizens."
"Thirdly, in another large French city, Toulon, the far Right council is stepping up its aggression against freedom of expression and against artistic creativity, showing that, however it may be disguised, the bad always comes to resemble the worst."
"Fourthly, there is the urgency of the situation."
"The urgency, as I see it, derives from the fact that several conservative governments in Europe, and especially the French government, think they can stem the tide of fascism by making concessions to it."
"In particular, the traditional French Right is legitimizing the problems posed by the far Right by suggesting that there is a causal link between immigration - and even the symbolic figure of the foreigner - on the one hand and economic difficulties, unemployment and insecurity on the other."
"This policy is not only ignoble but totally unsuccessful."
"All the repressive legislation on immigration adopted in France to appease the far Right has merely encouraged it."
"Stigmatizing immigration provides a direct causal link to fuel the advance of the far Right."
"Today, by adopting the motion for a resolution tabled by five groups, and our Amendments Nos 1 and 2, the European Parliament can help us to make the French Government withdraw its intention of adopting a law to subject foreigners to incrimination and rejection, an opportunist law, admittedly, but nevertheless the very, very old law of the scapegoat."
"Some will help us to avoid allowing their friends to commit a gross political blunder."
"But the majority in this House will welcome this opportunity to reassert their humanistic view of European integration, the integration of a Europe built on the values of tolerance and freedom and the principles of universalism - the Europe of enlightenment against the Europe of obscurantism."
"Mr President, the purpose of this motion is to demonstrate, with reference to a list of facts which could unfortunately be even longer, that racism today is indeed an actual and growing reality throughout Europe."
"Although each country has its own specific national features in this area, the foundations of racism are the same everywhere: in essence, the instinctive and simplistic rejection of those who are different, different in their skin colour or their culture, or alternatively a deep-seated and longstanding social crisis, portrayed as inevitable by succeeding governments which refuse to equip themselves with the resources to master it."
"France takes the biscuit - if I can put it that way - with its political translation of these two foundations of racism into the electoral successes of the National Front."
"The French Government, which, though protesting, allows attacks on freedom of expression and creativity and allows cultural censorship to operate in Toulon and certain other cities, is violating democracy."
"A form of hypocrisy that ill conceals ultra liberal orientations which further increase insecurity and poverty."
"In any case, what can you expect of an administration that makes use of laws such as the Pasqua laws and the Debré laws; which exploits, by legitimizing it, the racist argument of the far Right parties, equating a foreigner with an illegal immigrant and an illegal immigrant with a delinquent?"
"Rap, hip-hop, contemporary creativity in general, all these artistic movements which have been censored or threatened with censor are shot through and enriched with the diversity of the world's cultures, and call upon us to open our hearts and minds to welcome the foreigner in the words of Jacques Prévert: ' Strange strangers, you are part of the city, you are part of its life.'"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Year against Racism is being celebrated everywhere."
"But celebrations are not enough, and there is one thing they must certainly not be allowed to do - they must not be allowed to obscure reality."
"And reality, in the European Union, is marked by routine racist violence, increasing xenophobia and a rising tide of anti-semitism."
"The figures on violence are shocking."
"On 7 and 8 February alone, a Vietnamese, a Lebanese asylum seeker and two Polish citizens were attacked and very seriously injured in Germany, and a 17-year-old punk was a victim of racist violence in Magdeburg."
"But another reality is the ambiguity of a policy which talks about anti-racism while at the same time intensifying institutional racism and institutional discrimination."
"As a first example, take France."
"The previous speaker has already mentioned this."
"The draft Debré law enormously increases the already stringent provisions of the famous or infamous Pasqua laws, elevating denunciation to the status of a duty and a law, under which anyone who provides lodging for a foreigner is obliged to disclose his personal details."
"This is the basis for xenophobia, for new splits in society, for disintegration and violence."
"No wonder that the French National Front, the original source of such repellent policies, is growing."
"As a second example, take Germany."
"Federal Interior Minister Kanther gets himself appointed as national coordinator of the European Year against Racism, and what is the very first thing he does?"
"He introduces compulsory visas and residence permits for the children of German residents entering the country from the traditional labour recruitment countries, especially Turkey."
"This new regulation affects 800, 000 children."
"Is that Germany's idea of integration, when Turkish children are degraded and marginalized as second-class citizens, when the right to a family is apparently supposed to apply only to German families, and when these children are declared to represent a threat to order and security?"
"Human rights are indivisible, here as elsewhere."
"The regulation imposed by the Federal German Government is a blatant violation of human rights and must not be allowed to set a new example in Europe!"
"This regulation violates laws, it violates the UN Convention on Children."
"The deteriorating social situation of Turkish workers is discriminatory against these fellow citizens and breaches the terms of the association agreement."
"I should like to know what the Commission, as the guardian of the Treaties and also as the guardian of the implementation of the association agreement, is going to do about it."
"Mr President, I realize that this may not entirely be a point of order, but I seem to recall that it was the French Socialist Government that made it compulsory for foreigners to obtain temporary accommodation certificates."
"If I am wrong, I hope someone will correct me!"
"Mr President, Commissioner, we can always rely on Mrs Fontaine to be totally relevant and scrupulously precise."
"Quite simply, the purpose of the temporary accommodation certificate is no longer the same."
"We introduced it in 1992 as a way of persuading the police that an accused foreigner was in a regular situation and could therefore be given a document to establish his place of residence."
"That is what that instrument was at the time it was introduced, with my full agreement, by Robert Badinter and Pierre Bérégovoy. Once it is perverted to become an instrument to enable the police to keep track of the holder, that is an about turn, a complete perversion."
"And I am afraid that, in that interpretation, my dear Nicole, it is Mrs Roth who is right."
"But, that said, you have put the history book straight."
"Thank you very much, Mr Rocard."
"All of these speeches which are slightly off the agenda are extremely interesting and, as it were, have given a breath of fresh air to the monotony of some of these debates. The presidency looks upon them with a certain amount of sympathy but, in any case, he must do his duty."
"Mr President, fascism does not usually come to power unexpectedly."
"That is why we must pay careful attention to the early warning signs."
"It begins by marking out its territory and organizing the stealthy conditioning of minds. During this phase, culture plays a leading part."
"For devotees of a totalitarian ideology, culture can only be conceived as restricted, sterilized, official; and artists are, by definition, obstructive, cosmopolitan, generous and particular about their freedoms. Creativity is regarded as subversive, and writers themselves are suspect, except of course for those in charge of indoctrination."
"In France, in those cities where local government has fallen into the hands of the far Right, this process of standardization has begun."
"Admittedly, books are not being burned - the purifying flame is being put to a more cunning use."
"Disruptive artists are being kicked out, writers whose names don't sound right are being censored."
"As the municipal libraries cannot be eliminated for the time being, their function is being deprived of any substance."
"In a word, the brainwashing machine is in operation."
"To combat the advance of these ideas, some have seen fit to occupy the same ground - other honourable Members have referred to this."
"Unfortunately, in that little game, every time you bet, you lose, and you are constantly being forced to add to your stake."
"But the threshold of what is tolerable is soon crossed, and the vast protest movement in France has just given notice of that to the Government."
"Having said that, are we in this House at last going to attack the real problems that fertilize the soil for extremism - are we going to attack unemployment, the ravages of unrestricted free enterprise and their disastrous effects on the social fabric?"
"Admittedly, the Commission has not been idle, but in view of the Council's opposition to change, what is the use of Mr Santer inveighing about the struggle against unemployment?"
"Patience is not necessarily a virtue."
"Sometimes it is necessary to kick up a fuss, to abandon the politics of peace and quiet and, at long last, provide an answer to the real problems of our citizens."
"Mr Hory, I fear that I do not really see eye to eye with you on this motion for a resolution, because it seems to me to be a masterpiece of mix-and-match."
"By lumping together news stories from various European countries you finish up with a review of the week's news, a selection of samples, but not a good subject for a resolution."
"The basic evil is there: illegal immigration."
"Illegal immigration is harmful to legal immigrants, casting suspicion and discredit upon them."
"Illegality gives rise to marginalization."
"And how can anyone live on the margin, Mrs Pailler, without having the misfortune to lapse into practices that may become criminal?"
"Anyone can diagnose the problem, but remedies are needed."
"A few have already proved effective, but the disease is worsening and we need to improve the remedies and change the dose."
"All of us in this House, or nearly all, are united against racism, xenophobia and the far Right."
"But we are not united about the means."
"I am not convinced that petitions - even when swollen from day to day by the editorial tricks of certain French newspapers which take the same names and add forenames the following day, along with other somewhat dubious tricks, are enough to demonstrate the generous impulses of the heart and stir up a deep-seated movement among the public."
"A public, incidentally, that is not made up of fools - 59 % of French people favour the Debré laws - because they are confronted with petty crime, overcrowding of certain flats, the conditions in which the illegals live."
"Is it even fair to use the term 'illegal' for some of them?"
"Must we say nothing of the exploitation of their labour by their own immigrant fellow citizens?"
"Every European country is trying a different approach."
"Not all are perfect, but all can become so."
"Controlling illegal immigration is the only way of ensuring that the Schengen agreements are applied satisfactorily."
"My group is amazed that the signatories to this motion, so particular about the rights of the Members of the European Parliament, in claiming, as we all do, the right to amend the texts put before us, should so violently deny the Members of the French Parliament the privilege of exercising those same rights."
"The text of the draft Debré law is about to have its second reading in Parliament."
"Our French colleagues are responsible."
"They know what the electors want."
"They have a mandate to represent the electors."
"Do you believe them incapable of respecting it?"
"Would you allow the national parliament to give you orders?"
"All this agitation might have just one purpose: making us forget the deafening silence of the French opposition when this law was considered at first reading?"
"Mr President, the lack of future prospects for many unemployed people, the fear of those at risk of losing their jobs, the sense of marginalization or exclusion - these make up a very large part of the stockin-trade of those far Right movements which seem to be enjoying a fair wind in most States of the European Union."
"Can we wonder at the fact that fear, uncertainty and indifference are exploited by those movements for dubious purposes?"
"The attitude of the political community, confronted with this situation, should be neither simple nor simplistic."
"The least appropriate attitude, and I may say the most dangerous, would be to model one's political action on the methods that are resulting in the electoral successes of the extremist parties, for the simple reason that the electorate will eventually, sooner or later, prefer the original to the imitation."
"No: action against racism, xenophobia and anti-semitism must adopt a multi-disciplinary approach, appealing to actors from the most varied backgrounds, and in particular from community life, the last resort when all others have demonstrated their inability to get to grips with these problems."
"The European Union, for its part, should redouble its efforts to carry through the activities and campaigns already in progress."
"I am thinking particularly of joint actions between the Council of Europe and the European Union."
"The development of..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, once again Parliament is debating racism and xenophobia."
"Only a month ago we were congratulating ourselves on the launch of European Year against Racism and Xenophobia, and today we find ourselves obliged to deal with this matter again in topical debate."
"And the fact is that not only have disturbing events occurred in the last few days, but this is accompanied by a debate in France on the Debré Bill which is going to strengthen the ideas of an advancing ultra-right, of an ultra-right which is feeding on social discontent and linking immigration with delinquency in a simplistic and tendentious way."
"The challenge for the European Parliament and the governments of the Member States is to take the bull by the horns, abandon hypocrisy and double standards and, as well as condemning these threats to people's freedom, go to the heart of the problem and lay the foundations for eliminating the causes of this rise of intolerance."
"The creation of employment and the promotion of collective structures which allow the development of the individual in coexistence and solidary can provide an example for that."
"Mr President, the motion for a resolution before us, allegedly dealing with racism, indulges in a practice that is too common in this House, confusing xenophobia with the legitimate desire of the peoples of Europe to control immigration into their territory."
"In particular, it is hard not to feel some anxiety when the motion for a resolution singles out for particular opprobrium the text currently being discussed by the French Parliament."
"It seems to be directed at a provision which would compel those providing accommodation for foreigners to declare their departure to the local authority."
"What is the purpose of that provision?"
"Now that the majority of checks on individuals at the internal borders have been eliminated, it has been found difficult to keep count of foreigners from third countries leaving when their residents' permits expire, which in turn makes it difficult to know how many are remaining in France illegally."
"This irregular situation is, of course, being put to use by those who exploit the illegals, and who are now being referred to as 'the new slave traders' ."
"To solve this problem, the draft Debré law came up with the idea of imposing upon those providing accommodation for certain foreigners an obligation to declare their departure."
"You can think what you like about the effectiveness or appropriateness of this measure, but what is certain is that it is the direct result of the absence of border controls."
"So we come to this logical conclusion. A choice has to be made: either a declaration of departure made to the local authority or the police - which many people regard as a meddlesome formality or even police harassment - or the same declaration made at the time the foreigner crosses the border on his way out."
"This second solution seems simpler, but it does require the existence of a minimal police presence at the border."
"There is also a more general conclusion that can be drawn from this business."
"Border controls can ultimately be seen as the most liberal way of controlling immigration, the way that involves least restriction on civil liberties."
"If these controls at the outer borders are eliminated, it will automatically be necessary to increase the frequency of police checks throughout the interior."
"That is what we fear, and that is why my group has always fought against the European policy of abolishing the internal borders, because we believe, taking it all in all, that the screening effect they provide is ultimately a strong safeguard of freedom."
"Mr President, one of the original motions for a resolution before us was entitled 'On the threats to the freedom of expression and creative art' , which I can only interpret as a really burlesque form of humour, of absurd theatre of the highest degree, especially as it was tabled by the French communist party, a party which has more than won its spurs in the sphere of threats to freedom of expression."
"Be that as it may, I for one have long stopped getting enraged about yet another resolution on the so-called fight against so-called racism and so-called xenophobia."
"These are phenomena which only stay alive and take on greater importance in the crazy minds of a few intolerant people who try to brand any form of protection of national identities with these terms of abuse."
"First of all I see that the protectors of the national identity are being increasingly applauded."
"Just look at the exemplary democratic election victory of our colleague Bruno Mégret in Vitrolles."
"And look too, for example, at the German Federal Chancellor Kohl and whether a country with millions of unemployed can really afford millions of non-European guest workers."
"Secondly I must say that the paper indignation of this empty Parliament is not taken seriously by any sensible person in Europe any more."
"To give you one example: after the vote on 30 January on the European Year Against Racism the Flemish Christian-Democratic members of parliament told their own electorate that they had admittedly voted in favour of the resolution but that they were really against it."
"Well now, if even the Christian Democrats can allow themselves such funny jokes and cracks against this House, you surely cannot expect me to take this circus seriously?"
"Mr President, I welcome the fact that I am speaking after having had to listen to Mr Vanhecke so that I can say that as far as I am concerned the most important aspect of this Parliament is that it forms a buffer against racism, xenophobia, neo-fascism and neo-nazism."
"That for me is the most important thing about this Parliament."
"That was so more than ten years ago, Mr Vanhecke, when Mr Le Pen came to this House for the first time and when we had the joint solemn declaration signed by the Council, Commission and Parliament, and that was also the case when we had the remit to the Kahn commission and when we have our annual resolutions in this House, and when too we agreed on the European Year Against Racism."
"But, Mr President, although the attitude of the overwhelming majority of this House is very heartening, the written word is often is stark contrast with the realities in our Member States."
"And I am not talking about the National Front in France or the Flemish Vlaamse Blok or other extreme right-wing parties or of their loathsome declarations are predictable."
"No, Mr President, I am talking precisely about 'respectable' parties, I am talking about democratically elected parliaments which are tending towards worrying nationalism and are proud of the fact that they allow in as few asylum seekers as possible, which take ever more inhuman action against illegal immigrants which they themselves create by their petty minded admissions policy."
"The examples in the motion for a resolution, which I shall not repeat, speak for themselves but I really do think that France takes the biscuit with the Debré proposed legislation."
"It reminds me of the darkest period of our history, our European history."
"A history which we must remember every single day of our lives and which is in fact the very source of our European unity."
"That is why, Mr President, we should choose to align ourselves with all those Frenchmen and women who are out in protest against it."
"Mr President, one of the most interesting lessons I learned from the Committee of Inquiry into racism and xenophobia, which I had the honour to chair during the previous parliament, was that combating racism and xenophobia involved combating the illegal working and illegal immigration associated with it."
"It is that lesson which the French Government, in the wake of other governments, is courageously trying to put into practice."
"That is the purpose of the Debré law, or rather of the draft Debré law."
"And I would invite those who oppose that draft, without having read it, evidently, to visit certain illegal sweatshops and places where illegal immigrants live, where these wretched people are hidden away in the most inhumane conditions imaginable."
"If you want to know what this debate is really about, ladies and gentlemen, you will find it there."
"That is why, unlike those who have seen the emergence of the National Front as a historic opportunity to cling to power, or regain it, on the basis of the indignation which that party arouses, I am among those who support the action of the French Government which, with courage and a degree of flair, is trying to fight on the same front..."
"(The President cut of the speaker)"
"Mr President, the joint motion for a resolution concerns the dangers of the re-emergence of racist and xenophobic attitudes in some of the Community's Member States and, more specifically, France and Germany."
"If Alleanza Nazionale were a movement that wished to conceal and disguise its feelings on the subject, it would have made a tactical decision not to speak on this resolution."
"Instead, and precisely to demonstrate our complete good faith and our unequivocally anti-racist and anti-xenophobic stance, we should like to argue that this resolution is a very poor policy document, and this for two main reasons."
"The first is that the left-wing opposition parties of various Member States are hoping to take advantage of a vote in favour by this House to use it against their respective centre/right governments."
"It is no mere accident that no mention has been made of the Italian Government's recent proposals concerning the expulsion and non-admission of non-EU nationals - proposals that are based on, and even go beyond, French and German legislation on the matter."
"The second reason for opposing this resolution is that it attempts to assimilate the word 'right' with the term 'racist' . The intention, therefore, is to suggest that anyone who is right-wing is also racist and that anyone who is a racist can only be a right-winger."
"This is a semantic strategy, whose masters can be traced to the centres of the former Communist world that specialized in disinformation."
"For the Communists, anyone who was to their right was a Fascist and to call an adversary a Social Democrat was an insult and a put-down."
"We reject this subtle strategy because our observations both of history and of recent events show that racist and xenophobic attitudes have been adopted by numerous States and governments that have defined themselves as, and indeed are, left-wing."
"To cite just a few examples, I would like to remind fellow Members of the way in which the Communist Ceausescu treated the Hungarian minorities, of the way in which the Tibetan minority is being oppressed by Communist China and of the fact that all the ethnic minorities in the Soviet Union were humiliated, deported and lumped together by a left-wing totalitarian ideology."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Nordmann has just told us that the only way to fight racism and xenophobia is by putting a stop to illegal immigration."
"I have rarely heard such rubbish!"
"I come from a country where Hitler collected 43 % of the votes in 1933, and we had no illegal immigration in Germany then!"
"But what we did have in Germany then was a vast economic imbalance and a vastly unjust distribution of economic resources."
"And that is what we have today in the European Union between the population groups and the social classes, and it is what we have, for example, in the relations between this Union and the southern hemisphere or eastern Europe."
"Those are the causes of the pressure of immigration upon the European Union, pressure which is being massively exploited by the ladies and gentlemen on the Right for their own unpleasant purposes."
"Let me just say one thing to Mr Vanhecke: when he says he no longer gets het up about anything, that's not news to us."
"And when he says he welcomes the electoral victory of Bruno Mégret, we even believe him."
"Except that Mr Mégret has not won an electoral victory, because Mr Mégret was not allowed to stand for election at all, because Mr Mégret is a criminal who was not allowed to stand!"
"His wife won the election."
"Over on that side of the House there are always characters making out they have nothing to hide."
"They have more skeletons in their cupboards than the rest of this Parliament put together!"
"I say that again, unambiguously."
"And as for you, Mr Berthu, your ranks include a whole bunch of people with long criminal records, sitting here pretending to be the crème de la crème of European politics."
"I just have one thing to say to you, Mr Berthu: the only good thing about Mr Vanhecke is that he freely admits being a fascist and a racist."
"As for what you have said here, my only comment on that is this: if I can read Le Pen like a book I can read you like a paperback!"
"I really feel I have to say that."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, as I spoke so quickly to start with I am going to add another ten seconds on the end."
"There is a very important point that we have not yet mentioned today, the fact that this whole debate we are holding, which to some extent was forced upon us by the far Right, completely overlooks one point."
"There are victims of racism in the European Union - Mrs Roth has pointed that out - everyday victims, and I wonder where people like Mr Nordmann..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, to be brief, I do wish Mr Schulz would stop constantly resorting to Stalinist methods."
"The best way to fan the flames of racism is to start by being slack about immigration controls and then go on to draw endless parallels between racists and those of us who are making an honest effort to defend the people whom we have a duty to protect."
"Mr President, I don't think that what I have to say will produce such a heated reaction."
"The Commission is fully aware of the very adverse impact of illegal immigration on public opinion, and especially on the spread of racist and xenophobic attitudes."
"It therefore regards it as essential to pursue a policy that combines combating illegal immigration and the traffic in human beings with the integration of immigrants who are lawfully resident here and the campaign against racism, xenophobia and anti-semitism."
"As far as combating illegal immigration is concerned, let me remind you that the Council adopted, in September 1996, a recommendation on combating the illegal employment of third-country nationals."
"That recommendation specifies that the illegal traffic in labour must be regarded as an offence and subject to criminal penalties."
"Over and above that, cooperation between the Member States is needed to identify the origins of the traffic in human beings and define the best means of combating it."
"With this in mind, the Council has set up a working group to exchange information."
"With regard to police cooperation, the mandate of the 'Europol Drugs' unit covers action to combat the traffic in human beings."
"Furthermore, the Commission, in accordance with its medium-term social action plan for 1995-97, is preparing a Green Paper on the problems of illegal working."
"This Green Paper should pave the way for broad discussions on the action to be taken by the Union, the purpose of which would be to eliminate any practice detrimental to the well-being of workers or obstructing the proper functioning of the labour market."
"With regard to the admission of third-country nationals into the territory of the Member States, the Council has adopted four resolutions: one applies to employees, one to the self-employed, one to students and one to family re-unification."
"The Commission intends to submit a proposal for a convention on admission."
"The object of that initiative will be to move towards greater harmonization of Member States' legislation and practices."
"In the long run, the aim is to establish an official status for long-term foreign residents in the territory of the Member States."
"The European Union cannot confine its activities to immigration control."
"It also has to deal with the growth of xenophobic attitudes in our society."
"As you know, many initiatives have already been taken at the instigation of the European Council."
"The European Year against Racism is the first example of an agreement between the Community institutions and the Member States with a view to undertaking specific actions to combat racism."
"It provides a framework for a campaign to alert the public to the danger represented by racism and to increase the emphasis on positive action intended to combat it."
"The creation of a European observatory to monitor racist and xenophobic phenomena, proposed by the Commission in November 1996, will also help to give concrete expression to the Union's commitment to confront the increase in racism."
"The Commission finds it a matter for regret that one Member State is still blocking the realization of this project."
"In terms of criminal law, the Council adopted in 1996 a joint action designed to improve judicial cooperation in connection with racially motivated crimes."
"Finally, the Commission has also exerted pressure to have a clause inserted in the Treaty, at the Intergovernmental Conference, prohibiting any form of racial discrimination."
"The combined effect of all these initiatives will be to improve the effective safeguarding of human rights and basic freedoms within the Union."
"The European Year against Racism and Xenophobia provides an opportunity for intensive mobilization, but the action taken must continue after the Year has ended, and it will be the duty of all those involved - the European institutions, the Member States, the social partners, the non-governmental organizations, the media and also the general public - to ensure the continuity of this effort to combat racism, xenophobia and anti-semitism."
"Don't worry, Mr President, I don't intend to re-open the debate."
"But I did ask the Commissioner a question, and I asked him politely, and so I would like an answer."
"What is the Commission, as the guardian of the Treaties and also as the guardian of the association agreement between the European Union and Turkey, going to do about the introduction of visas for children and compulsory residence permits for the children of immigrants, for about 600, 000 Turkish children?"
"In my view it is incompatible with the provisions of the association agreement."
"That's what I asked you, and I would like an answer."
"I can tell you that, as the Commission is the guardian of the treaties, it will ensure that the Treaty is strictly respected, in accordance with the mandate given to it."
"As regards the specific question you asked me I am sorry, but, lacking the necessary information, I cannot give you an answer though I have taken careful note of the question. I shall report it to Mrs Gradin, and she will answer you directly in writing."
"Mr President, now that this debate has ended, I wish to make a personal statement pursuant to Rule 108."
"Mr Schulz impugned all the members of my group when he attacked Mr Berthu just now."
"He did so, according to the translation I heard, by referring to the so-called criminal records of members of my group."
"I demand that he retract his allegations."
"We in our group are not under any suspicion of having..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, it was clear to everyone here that I was not criticizing Mr Fabre-Aubrespy's group."
"All I said was that I can read Mr Le Pen like a book and Mr Berthu like a paperback, a reference to their intellectual capacities."
"If that is an insult to the entire group, I can only beg for leniency!"
"That concludes the debate."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"Before the vote on the resolutions on Chad :"
"I should like to ask if the authors of these resolutions are leaving them on the table."
"I have received confusing information on this."
"This is because of the visit to Strasbourg by the Prime Minister of Chad, who has made specific offers to the European delegation that will be in Chad this weekend."
"Are the authors maintaining the resolution or taking my advice, which I spelled out in detail, that this should be withdrawn for a month?"
"I have heard rumours, but I have received nothing official."
"Work of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly in 1996"
"The next item is the report (A4-0019/97) by Mrs Baldi, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the outcome of the proceedings of the ACP/EU Joint Assembly in 1996."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the role played by the ACP-EU Joint Assembly in the discussion under way on the issues and challenges facing the European Union and its ACP partners over renewal of the framework for cooperation is vital."
"Very soon, we shall be starting to prepare for the negotiations on the future of relations between the European Union and the ACP States beyond the year 2000."
"In this respect, I should like to emphasize Joint Assembly's essential role and contribution in the discussions launched in 1996 on the issues and challenges represented by renewal of the framework for cooperation which, beyond the year 2000 and in a worldwide context of fundamental change, will need to continue to shape the privileged relations that have united them since the beginning of European integration."
"The continuance of these relations, which involve 85 States, is extremely important for Parliament, as this group of countries comprises the majority of the developing countries and includes three-quarters of the poorest countries of the world."
"The Union's whole development policy will be on the test bench when we come to define a new convention."
"Since there is a risk that the subject of development policy will be side-lined through failure to recognize the global associations such as refugees, the environment, drugs, crime and the resulting destabilization, as well as security risks, the European Parliament should throw its full political weight behind continuing relations at an appropriate level and with suitable instruments."
"In particular, the Intergovernmental Conference should be urged to give Union development policy its proper place as a separate subject in a revised Union Treaty."
"The two debates on this subject, in Windhoek and Luxembourg, showed that members of the Joint Assembly are well aware of the significance of the question of the future shape of relations between the ACP States and the European Union and are ready to argue for continuing development aid."
"Discussion on the subject was pursued with the presentation of the Commission's Green Paper and necessarily includes general questions of EU development policy and coordination with bilateral development aid from the Member States."
"After the working group on the subject had concluded its deliberations on the situation of refugees in the ACP countries in connection with the policy on humanitarian aid, on 20 March 1996 the Joint Assembly adopted the motion for a resolution on this subject."
"The enormous influx of refugees, and the marked rise in their number, mainly due to events in the Great Lakes region, is a challenge to the international community and highlights the need to improve the legal status of refugees and displaced persons and meet their material and psychological needs, through rehabilitation and repatriation, and personal protection."
"Because of the serious problems of small island States resulting from climate change - many of them are facing threats to their economic and even physical existence - a hearing of experts on this problem was held at the Luxembourg session and it was decided to set up a new working group to draw up a report."
"In view of the appreciable economic benefit but great practical difficulties, the report adopted by the Joint Assembly in Namibia on industrialization of the ACP countries drew attention to ways and means of using human and natural resources in the ACP countries, to achieve added value in the production of industrial goods that would benefit the local population directly by creating jobs, increasing purchasing power and stimulating supply and demand."
"For its part, the Joint Assembly has adopted clear decisions on the subject of internal conflicts and serious violations of human rights in some ACP regions."
"It is important to pursue this path, since development, respect of human rights, democratic principles and the constitutional State are closely interconnected."
"The many conflicts that still persist and the problem of refugees and displaced persons, and I am again referring to the Great Lakes region, where the situation is particularly difficult - as I have personally witnessed - should spur us to press forward the discussions on the right to intervene on humanitarian grounds and the development aid the international community has the duty to provide, in genuine solidarity with all human beings, so as to guarantee them a decent existence, by taking direct, targeted and coordinated action."
"Clear, decisive support is needed for any initiatives to outlaw and remove anti-personnel mines, which are daily placing people's lives and health at risk and threatening the development of the countries concerned, which should be supported by rehabilitation and land-mine clearance."
"I should also like to express my satisfaction at the steady increase in parliamentary representation in the Joint Assembly, thereby consolidating its authority and legitimacy, and confirming the ACP States' growing commitment to the democratic process."
"I also welcome the commitments made under Article 32 of the Fourth Lomé Convention on the democratic legitimacy of this body and, finally, I hope the Joint Assembly will enjoy the greatest possible independence, in terms of separate responsibility for organizing its business, particularly with regard to deciding where to hold its sessions and organizing fact-finding missions and contacts, within the limits of the available budgetary funds."
"At the same time, the European Parliament's calendar should take account of the dates for the Joint Assembly's sessions, which are known well in advance."
"I should like to finish by expressing my hope that the Netherlands presidency will be able, during its term of office, to ensure that Member States of the European Union speed up the ratification procedure, as was called for in Mauritius, so that the Lomé Convention can be signed and the revised agreement ratified."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, naturally I cannot but praise and ratify the full approval already given in the Committee on Cooperation and Development to the excellent report from our colleague, Mrs Baldi. Reading the report, the incorporation of the concept of development into the idea of foreign policy stands out."
"Something like that happened in the world of science a few years ago, adding the letter D for development. Something like that is going on now."
"A European foreign and security policy unaccompanied by intense activity to promote development in the most backward countries is inconceivable."
"Not for nothing is the Community the world's biggest donor, taking its own funds and those of the Member States together."
"So Mrs Baldi's call for the development aid budget to be integrated into the general budget of the European Communities is not unreasonable, but very sensible."
"So is her call for cooperation and coordination between Community action as such and what the Member States are doing, because while they are not necessarily contradictory they are frequently parallel rather than convergent."
"It is also important to mention some points Mrs Baldi has stressed in her document: the work the ACP-EU Joint Assembly is doing for peace - work that we must do together and not separately, as has sometimes happened (and that is a criticism)."
"For example, missions should be rationally planned for the current year, which is something the European side has thought of doing or proposing in the Joint Assembly."
"A six-monthly plan, even an annual plan, for joint travel - subject, of course, to emergencies that may occur - would be a reasonable way to have a presence in countries where conflict exists, could flare up, or is possible."
"It is also satisfactory - and the rapporteur mentioned this - that the democratic representation of the ACP countries has undoubtedly improved and we are on the point of implementing genuine measures to ensure this representation, a reflection of the process of democratization which is happily in progress, not without upsets and setbacks, in many of the ACP countries."
"Of course, these upsets and setbacks include those caused by tragic situations like the one we have analysed this very evening - the Great Lakes - or the new Nigerian tragedy which the illustrious Nigerian Nobel Prizewinner, Wole Soyinka, told us about in the European Parliament a few hours ago."
"There is an interesting mention in the document of the initiative by the ACP Council of Ministers to hold a summit meeting."
"And perhaps this should not be just an ACP summit but a joint summit with the European Union. As I have said, Europe is making a major contribution to development - this is very well illustrated, for example, in the work of the ECHO office assisting refugees and in the next Green Paper, which we await with great interest - and it is certainly worth the effort to make that contribution even greater."
"Mr President, I too, on behalf of the Liberal Group, would like to offer my warmest congratulations to Mrs Baldi on the quality of her report."
"It is indeed of great interest, because it shows very clearly how the Joint Assembly has evolved, especially if we cast our minds back to the state of the Joint Assembly in particular, and European Union policy in general, only a few years ago."
"Through Mrs Baldi's report we can follow a policy undergoing transformation, an evolving policy, gradually adopting a new form to take account of the changes that have happened in the world since the late 1980s."
"In this context, it is important to reassert, as Mrs Baldi does, the need for a very strong commitment by the European Union to a development policy which some would like to see relegated to a much lower priority behind other policies, especially those concerned with opening up towards the East."
"Differentiation - the second aspect of this development policy - is also very strongly emphasized."
"The need to adapt our actions, as best we can, to local situations and differences in level between the various partners is very forcibly brought out, especially in the call for a policy which concentrates more on the needs of the most disadvantaged sectors of population."
"Our group also approves of the emphasis placed by the rapporteur on the need to retain the preferential schemes benefitting the ACP States in respect of a number of products, especially bananas, sugar and cocoa - schemes which are still valuable instruments in the service of development and ecological equilibrium."
"We in the Development Committee have discussed various projects, particularly in relation to cocoa, and have heard some extremely interesting statements by representatives of the Member States."
"Finally, the emphasis on parliamentary representation and increased consideration by the European Union for the requirements of democratization shows that the Union's policy is finally emerging from the stereotyped Third World approach and coming directly to terms with the idea of genuine cooperation."
"Mr President, I, too, support Mrs Baldi's report because, like her, I feel the ACP Joint Assembly continues to be a very important parliamentary instrument linking the northern and southern hemispheres."
"No other body puts representatives of so many countries on an equal footing at all levels, bringing them together to discuss development, democracy and human rights."
"It is, then, something that needs to be maintained and developed, as is also demonstrated by the importance of the initiatives taken by the Joint Assembly in 1996."
"In this respect, I should like, among other things, to stress the value of the mission that was sent to Angola very soon after the last session of the ACP Joint Assembly, and which enabled us to see from the inside the problems Angola is facing and the tragic blocking of the peace process."
"Whatever the fate of relations between the ACP States and the European Union, which we are discussing on the basis of the famous Green Paper that has been much mentioned in this debate, the experience of the ACP Joint Assembly should, in my opinion, be treasured as one to be repeated."
"It would, therefore, be unacceptable if an end were put to a dialogue between North and South that is, quite honestly, one of the few truly positive experiences that European development policy has generated over the past few decades."
"For this reason, I also agree with, and emphasize, the references made to the budget in Mrs Baldi's report."
"Mr President, Mrs Baldi has presented us with a very detailed report reflecting what happened at the two meetings."
"She deserves our thanks."
"I welcome her detailed treatment of the various points, for example how important it was for the NGOs on the ACP side to join us in a discussion process, and that we adopted a clear stance towards Nigeria and that it was right to impose sanctions in that case."
"That was also confirmed this week by the visit of Wole Soyinka, the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize."
"I believe it should be emphasized that the ACP Assembly adopted an unambiguous position with regard to landmines - prohibition. The production and exporting of land-mines are to be outlawed."
"I agree, I believe we should accept that as an obligation and really ensure that no further production of land-mines takes place in our Member States."
"But the other side, the development policy side, is important too."
"Rehabilitation, caring for the victims, are obligations, and in fact I believe that those who produce these mines should be reminded of their duty."
"Another aspect which Mrs Baldi mentions is the free trade area with southern Africa, Article 39."
"I believe that the upshot of the ACP sessions will be that our negotiations with South Africa will be successful."
"The essential point, of course, is the future of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly: the concept of parity, the concept of co-operation as a new form of future external policy, and the structuring of the European Union's foreign policy beyond the content of the Green Paper."
"I should welcome it if the suggestions produced by this Assembly, and the ideas and proposals contained in the new Green Paper, were to contribute - with a view to Maastricht II and the future foreign policy - to our having a separate pillar or section that says we want a non-military foreign policy."
"In reality, we now have a situation in which development aid funds are being cut back."
"We have no power of co-decision over the ACP budget."
"It is right that Mrs Baldi should point this out."
"The Member States must understand - and we have said this before - that these funds are budgeted."
"I believe all this should be combined together to form a non-military part of the budget."
"That is the only way to offer these countries prospects for the future."
"The rapporteur writes - correctly - that the ACP states include two-thirds of the world's poorest countries, and I know of no other assembly that consistently pursues these concepts of parity and dialogue and so helps to shape foreign policy."
"We should retain that."
"After the Green Paper, we must arrange a new form of co-operation with the ACP countries."
"I believe we could also expand it to include a few other poorer countries, and that this forms part of the non-military sector of a European Union foreign policy."
"Mr President, first of all I should like to congratulate Mrs Baldi on the quality of her report, which is not only an interesting and thorough presentation and assessment of the main work of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly in 1996 but also raises much further reaching reflections which might make it possible to strengthen the role and improve the functioning of that Assembly and, generally speaking, deepen and revitalise relationships between the European Union and ACP countries, for which the Joint Assembly is a vital vehicle."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to say that the ACP-EU Joint Assembly has gradually become a more interesting and more effective body."
"Most of this is due to the seriousness and dynamics of the body, led in particular by Lord Plumb, who is here with us, but also due to the quality of the reports which have been presented before the Assembly."
"I think in particular of Mrs Baldi and Mrs Maij-Weggen, who have presented extremely interesting reports on the question of mines or transport in the ACP countries, which both for the Commission and the participating countries have proved to be of great importance and of considerable impact."
"It is the quality of these reports and our commitment to this institution which could bring about more improvements to the Joint Assembly."
"Personally, I like taking part in the Assembly's debates."
"For many ACP countries, it is a forum of outstanding democracy and a place where they can see democracy at work."
"Many times it is a better example than ten books or a lot of rhetoric."
"Mr President, I think that the Baldi report is a very interesting analysis of this matter, and I think that to add anything to it would be superfluous."
"I would just like to thank the European Parliament for the interest and commitment which it has shown in the functioning of this institution which has been decisive for the constant improvements which have been noted."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken at 9 a.m. tomorrow."
"Development cooperation policy"
"The next item is the report (A4-0028/97) by Mr McGowan, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on complementarity between the Community's development cooperation policy and the policies of the Member States (COM(95)0160 - C4-0178/95)."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking my colleagues on the Committee on Development and Cooperation because this report is very much a product of a great deal of work by them."
"I would also particularly like to thank the President of Parliament, who has been under some pressure from the professional offices of Parliament about an important paragraph in the motion for a resolution in the report - paragraph 21 - which outlines the whole range of initiatives that the Development Committee intends to take."
"I was asked to remove them but the President supported me, although he pointed out that, in fact, the Development Committee could take these initiatives without putting them before Parliament."
"But the feeling is that development policy, the complementarity, coordination and whole future of development cooperation is so important that this should be brought before the House."
"I wish to thank the new President for this."
"The report speaks for itself but it is, of course, drawn up against the background that complementarity between the European Union and Member States is now a Treaty obligation."
"It is something we have a responsibility for and it is also something that the guardian of the Treaty - the Commission - has a specific responsibility for, and I may say it has been extremely helpful with its advice."
"The lack of complementarity and coordination between the Union and Member States should not surprise any of us here when we look at the lack of complementarity and coordination and, I have to say, consistency within the European Union itself."
"So often development cooperation policy, trade policy, foreign affairs, environment and agriculture - if I dare mention the name - are pushing off in completely different directions, so the fact is that we in the Union are not very good at coordinating, complementing and being consistent."
"This provides an opportunity for many of the Member States to continue to pay lip-service to the importance of coordination."
"They all say in principle they support it, but the reality is that there is very little coordination about, and I look to the present Dutch presidency to take this more seriously than it has been taken in the past."
"Mr Pronk, the President-in-Office, is one of the most able and experienced Development Ministers in the history of the European Union."
"But I have to say that I am not even convinced that Mr Pronk is totally committed to pursuing a policy of coordination within the European Union and I hope that given his ability and influence we can expect both him and the Council of Ministers to behave better."
"Member States so often use development policy for other purposes: as an arm of foreign affairs, an arm of narrow national interests, an arm of the arms industry, an arm to support the oil industry."
"This, generally, is a reflection of the lack of priority that is given to development cooperation."
"The poorest people in the world are becoming more numerous and poorer because of unemployment and other problems."
"We often say in the European Union that we cannot really continue to afford our own welfare states and social security services."
"In exactly the same way, some Member States say that we cannot continue our responsibilities in the rest of the world."
"The debate on racism brings this to light."
"But we cannot afford, for selfish reasons alone, not to cooperate with people in every country, and particularly those in developing countries."
"It is time for us to take on some of the big issues."
"Through the Development Committee we have taken on the issue of landmines."
"We know that everybody deplores landmines but, of course, they are still produced and still planted in many parts of the world."
"It is now time to take on the whole arms industry and arms trade, because six of the permanent members of the Security Council of the United Nations, which includes Britain and France, account for 85 % of the world's arms trade."
"It is time to take on the multinationals."
"I pay tribute to Richard Howitt, my colleague here, for the work that he is doing in Colombia."
"I wish the Commission would be even stronger in helping us to take on some of the oil companies."
"This really is about self-help practice by the European Parliament."
"We advocate this in developing countries."
"We need a new world order based on an awareness of interdependence, but that means mobilizing support at the grassroots from the public."
"I feel our Member States underestimate the concern that there is amongst some of people we represent, some of the poorest people we represent, some of the youngest people we represent - some of them are here tonight."
"If we do more in our own communities and work more with the elected Members in the Member States, we can achieve a great deal together."
"Mr President, let me start by saying clearly that this debate tonight is about one of the great failures of EU development policy."
"Coordination is just not working."
"Article 130x of the Treaty is not being upheld."
"Mr McGowan is absolutely right in his report when he says that all that we hear about coordination is rhetoric and that coordination is not followed in practice."
"There is an important onus on us tonight in this debate to ensure that we do not add to that rhetoric and that we identify the real barriers and real reasons why coordination is just not taking place."
"In the time available to me I will address just three."
"Firstly, we have to concentrate on how far priorities for development aid are still being determined within the Member States by historic, commercial and political interests."
"We are still talking about tied aid in the late years of this century."
"For Member States the question is not one of how aid can best be coordinated, but one of donor competition: how far they can buy influence by being the biggest donors in particular situations."
"At a time when there is increased pressure on the public purse in so many of our countries, too many officials in Member State governments see the question as one of competition between the development aid budgets in the European Union and the funds they themselves can disburse within the Member States."
"The second barrier concerns the fear in Member States of ceding power to the European Commission."
"We see this through the absurd Comitology committees which operate in Brussels."
"We criticise them frequently for their cost, bureaucracy and secrecy."
"Yet if there is any reason for these committees, it is surely to have a two-way dialogue about coordination of aid."
"But it does not work."
"It is a one-way dialogue."
"The Commission gives the information."
"The Members States do not."
"We see it too in the individual delegations and missions, where we find suspicion and hostility between embassies and between delegations of the European Commission."
"Finally, the barrier is the staffing of the Commission."
"There are only two people in DG VIII who are responsible for operational coordination and only one person in DG I B, and we are looking at a decrease in the number of staff in delegations to individual countries."
"Unless we are prepared to deal with those barriers, there will be no coordination."
"We will not have the necessary concentration on the quality of aid, on the participation of less developed countries themselves."
"Tonight, let us hear what proposal is going to be made to follow up the pilot exercises."
"Are they just going to stand alone or are we actually going to see some action on them?"
"Madam President, first of all I should like to congratulate Mr McGowan warmly on his excellent report."
"This report comes at a very opportune moment because the informal Council for development cooperation is meeting on 28 February and 1 March in Amsterdam and this is precisely one of the most important subjects of his report."
"So it is very appropriate that we are debating this report at this time, and it would be even nicer if my good friend Jan Pronk were also here."
"This is the second time this week that a Dutch minister is obvious by his absence."
"But I shall not criticize Jan Pronk because I know he is an excellent minister for development cooperation and I worked with him for five years in the Dutch Council of Ministers."
"That is already one reason for not criticising him too severely, but he would have been well advised to come here if only to listen to what Mr McGowan had to say."
"I hope that he will nevertheless be informed of the contents of this debate."
"Madam President, although development cooperation has often produced many good results we must admit that it has also given rise to many complaints about its effectiveness."
"Sometimes that is due to bad management in the countries themselves, sometimes it is due to wars and natural disasters, acts of God, but sometimes it is also due to bad coordination of the donors' aid."
"And when the latter is the case, Madam President, we must accept the responsibility and learn how matters can be improved."
"Allow me to give you three examples of strange coordination that I myself have come across in practice during my travels."
"Up until the eighties Zambia received a tremendous amount of development aid just because it was such a pleasant country; so much so that more than half of the national budget came from development aid."
"Everybody knows that is bad for a country."
"It stifles initiative and responsibility and yet together we were unable to reduce it."
"And that is a sign of bad coordination."
"In Mauritania and Senegal I was there when a Dutch agricultural project which was on the border of Mauritania and Senegal had to be passed over to the local population."
"But they did not really want to do that and went to Denmark to see if they would take over the project."
"And even the European Union was apparently unable to call these two countries together and make sure that did not happen."
"And in Nepal I saw a complaint from two NGOs who complained that a leprosy project was being offered on such attractive terms that even the regional government was asking for backhanders."
"You really wondered what it was all about."
"These are only a few examples of bad coordination."
"Where, Madam President, are the major problems?"
"Mr McGowan has mentioned the most important one: since 1994 the Union has had an integrated foreign policy."
"Our commissioner for development cooperation, Mr Pinheiro, also has responsibility in his field for foreign policy, trade and human rights, and that works well."
"But in the Member States these areas are still kept separate."
"And when I look at the differences in the amount of aid, at the differences in guidelines and the differences in the places where aid is given, then I must come to the same conclusions."
"There are four countries that reach the OECD norm of 0.7 %."
"The others fall far short of that figure."
"And as far as guidelines are concerned, as our Socialist colleague has just said, there are major differences between Member States."
"Some view development aid as something given to help really poor countries."
"Others see it as an extension of foreign trade and yet others regard it mainly as a means of keeping the balance of power in place."
"And we all know which countries that applies to."
"And then, Madam President, there is also a third problem when we come to cooperation with multilateral organisations, the IMF, world bank, or whether cooperation with the NGOs, where completely different guidelines are being followed."
"Some countries work with very many NGOs, others with very few."
"The Commission has tried to coordinate matters in some countries."
"It may well be understandable that the Commission has not tried to get all Member States singing from the same hymn sheet."
"No, what happened is that a number of pilot projects were started in Bangladesh, the Ivory Coast, Ethiopia, Costa Rica and Peru and there they decided to try to coordinate them in the country itself."
"Ambassadors met and coordinated the projects."
"That works well until you realise that the messages the Member States are sending out are quite different from what is having to be coordinated round the table."
"Madam President, the time has come for the Member States to sit round the table and try to work out a better system for coordination."
"This is absolutely essential."
"The most important point is that this can make aid more effective and the European Union is the largest donor in the world when it comes to development aid."
"Most developing countries receive more than half of their aid from us."
"In Africa it is as much as 65 %."
"I sincerely hope that Minister Pronk, even if he is not present here today, manages to make a breakthrough on several points in this sphere in the informal Council meeting and I hope that Mr Pinheiro will report to him on what we have said here in this debate."
"If that happens, then the European Council will in my view have done something positive for the Union and for the Member States, but especially for the developing countries."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I warmly congratulate Mr McGowan on his report; I am pleased that the previous speaker, a friend and colleague, has already said what I intended to say."
"Because development cooperation has nothing to do with whether we are political opponents or not."
"Mr McGowan's report has identified very many weaknesses."
"The Member States show very little determination to coordinate their policy on development aid with each other and with the Union."
"I too could fill an evening's programme with slides on my experience of 27 years in developing countries, on the striking difference between the Union's, then the Community's, development cooperation and the bilateral interests of various European Member States."
"The Member States, as I have already said, want their policy on development cooperation to be effective and efficient."
"Now the best effectiveness is achieved by coordination, as you explained so clearly in your report."
"But the Member States do not appear to be prepared to do that."
"The inevitable conclusion is that they are prepared to sacrifice the quality of the aid for their own image in the world, they want to secure their so-called sovereignty and equate foreign policy with foreign interests and foreign relations."
"I find this extremely worrying."
"Reduced effectiveness diminishes the chances of development in the countries concerned and undermines public willingness to help in our countries, which in turn means that the poor countries will suffer again in the future."
"I repeat for the second time: we must put a stop to that state of affairs."
"We have been saying that for the past 30 years. The Union's standing in the world means that the Member States must adhere to European policy guidelines."
"I hope that these policy guidelines will be set in this Parliament."
"The Union needs to be coherent in its foreign policy, as can be seen yet once more in our approach to the Great Lakes region, our fisheries policy, agricultural policy, and particularly in our arms export control."
"Mr McGowan included that one too."
"I hope that the Dutch presidency, that promised to act on coherency in policy, will put this item high up on the agenda."
"I agree with Mrs Maij-Weggen that it is regrettable that Minister Pronk is absent from this debate on Mr McGowan's excellent report."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe Mr McGowan has presented us with an important and essential report on development policy, which could provide an opportunity for a debate on future strategy and prospects."
"I don't think this is an occasion for soap-box oratory."
"Let me start by making two points. In our societies, development policy is a non-starter."
"As Mrs Maij-Weggen just said, only four countries are achieving the self-imposed target of 0.7 % of the gross national product."
"The last Community budget showed a reduction in real terms, and there have been further reductions in the Member States, too."
"Secondly, there is no such thing as a European development policy."
"What we have is 15 individual policies, plus an additional Community policy."
"That is the real situation."
"Recent years have shown no sign of the co-ordination called for in the Maastricht Treaty, and nor does Maastricht II."
"Maastricht II is supposed to introduce institutional reviews, as Article 130 tells us."
"But what is the actual position?"
"It is not even on the agenda yet."
"Mr Pinheiro, can you arrange for this to be added to the agenda?"
"Our governments seem to have no interest in it."
"And then, when I come to look at the budget: in recent years we've seen environment and development, women and development, drifting towards zero."
"NGOs are to get more."
"Although we are prepared to take on more personnel at the Commission, the budget situation requires economies."
"A few high officials will use up most of the money."
"Then we also have an internal structural shift."
"The mega-programme has been adopted by the governments without funds being made available, and those funds have been taken away from development policy."
"So I can't help wondering what the strategy actually is."
"Mrs Maij-Weggen says that the Community is the world's biggest provider of aid. Yes, the net outflow of capital in many countries is much greater than what they are getting, and we can all see that more people are hungry, more people are poor, more people are dying."
"Yes, we do need a non-military foreign policy."
"My last request is for Maastricht II to introduce an institutional reform; Mr Pinheiro, we need a strong minister, a strong commissioner for this non-military development policy to supplement the foreign policy in the military and security sectors that we have with the CFSP."
"Madam President, the Group of the European Radical Alliance completely endorses the terms of the communication from the Commission and Mr McGowan's report."
"For us, this goes without saying: anything which - in conception, in decision, in financing, in action on the ground and in evaluation - allows enhanced additionality between the development policies of the Union and the Member States is welcome as far as we are concerned."
"But perhaps I may be permitted, following on from what Mr Bertens has said, to take this report as an opportunity to dream of a situation where this problem would no longer arise, because the Member States would delegate their powers and resources in the matter of the development cooperation to the European Union."
"I represent a country, France, where people are more enthusiastic about bilateral aid than they are elsewhere - partly for historical reasons, perhaps, but definitely because of economic and diplomatic influences."
"People tell me it would be in the interest of France to maintain and reinforce this bilateral cooperation."
"I can't help wondering what that interest would be, and what century we're living in."
"And I can't help wondering it even more when I attend debates and votes in this House."
"I find France being condemned - just now, an hour ago - for the part its troops are said to be playing in Chad, in the suppression of crime but also of political opposition."
"I hear it said that France is accused of meddling in the internal affairs of a country like the Central African Republic."
"I am led to believe that France, aided and abetted by Belgium, has played a not insignificant role in triggering and exacerbating the crises in Rwanda and Zaire and I also learn that French aid, distributed unconditionally to dictatorships, is fuelling every conceivable kind of chaos and corruption."
"And anyone can learn, as I do, that on the pretext of special bilateral relationships France is very often to be found occupying a neo-colonial position, a charge that is only too well founded and against which France has no defence."
"So where does France's interest lie?"
"My conviction is that it would be in our true interest to put our resources at the service of a European development policy which would suddenly take on a new scale and a new ambition."
"That seems to me to be, over and above the necessary conditionality, the future of our national cooperation policies, and I believe that the Commission would earn much credit by submitting a proposal for the gradual communitization of the resources of national development policies."
"I might add, as a rider to our recent deliberations on racism, that if France really did have special reasons, based on a shared history and a shared culture, to maintain bilateral cooperation with the African States, well, in that case, it might offer better hospitality to immigrants coming from those States."
"Madam President, first of all I should sincerely like to congratulate Mr McGowan on his excellent report on the vital question not only of the complementarity of the co-operation policies but also aspects of co-ordination and coherence."
"To a great extent the Commission shares the analysis made by Mr McGowan of the situation concerning the lack of real progress in application of the Treaty on European union in this field."
"Indeed, despite adoption by the Council, in 1992, of a number of resolutions and conclusions on the complementarity, co-ordination and coherence of Community aids and those of its Member States, the results obtained to date, albeit palpable, are manifestly unsatisfactory."
"The Commission also goes along with the rapporteur's finding that one of the main reasons for the lack of progress is the lack of interest shown by certain Member States towards strengthening this co-ordination."
"The logic of bilateral co-operation is profoundly distinct from the logic of Community co-operation."
"We are increasingly oriented towards programmes, towards integrating strategic development in the various countries, together with the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the United Nations, in other words a strategic logic, whereas bilateral aid is nearly always oriented towards projects and not for programmes or whole sectors."
"That is why complementarity, synergy, co-ordination are words which should be of interest to both sides."
"Unfortunately, for reasons which have already been given by members of the European Parliament, there is still a certain amount of shortsightedness on the part of certain Governments, who refuse to see that synergy and co-ordination help the countries to strengthen their own action."
"Mr Pronk and myself, when we were making preparations for the Dutch presidency, picked out this subject as one of the vital matters in which progress had to be made, despite the difficulties which we knew we would face. That is why we thought of trying to attack this problem through practical cases of lack of co-ordination, lack of coherence and lack of complementarity."
"At the next informal meeting of the Development Ministers which is due to take place at the end of this month, we shall be focusing on this very subject which Mr McGowan has identified in his report."
"Finally, I should like to say that there are certain legitimate reasons why the European Development Fund is not included in the Community's general budget."
"There are good reasons."
"However, I must say that the Commission continues to think that the advantages which this has, be it when devising policies or in assessing them or in applying them largely outweigh the small disadvantages which might exist for some Member States when it comes to the European Development Fund budget."
"I have to insist and ask, in one way or another, that changes be made to this in the scope of the IGC."
"I am sure that, if the European Parliament had to play a fundamental role in discussing the European Development Fund's budgets, some of those aspects of policy co-ordination would play a leading role, not only in reports drafted by some of those members of the European Parliament who are most interested in the subject but by the European Parliament as whole."
"Mr President, I should like to sum up by saying that I hope that this subject will come before us again, because it takes two to tango and if we tango together then we can put political pressure on the other partner by acting repeatedly."
"As far as the Commission is concerned, once again all I have to do is thank the European Parliament for the interest, commitment and support that it has shown in this attempt to improve the co-ordination of our action with other Member States."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m."
"Relief, rehabilitation and development"
"The next item is the report (A4-0021/97) by Mr Fassa, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Co-operation, on the Commission communication to the Council and the European Parliament on linking relief, rehabilitation and development (LRRD) (COM(96)0153 - C4-0265/96)."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the traditional division between humanitarian aid, rehabilitation and development is increasingly seen as artificial, whilst their interconnection is receiving ever greater attention."
"These are the two issues covered by this report and the attached motion for a resolution, which I shall briefly summarize here."
"The first part is devoted to the humanitarian aid of the European Union and, in particular, the role played by ECHO."
"We cannot deny that the past few years have seen a sharp increase in the Community's humanitarian aid."
"Various issues are involved here, but I shall discuss just four of them, the first being the need for coordination."
"A primary aspect of coordination is political and organizational coordination. As was suggested even in the original draft of the report - and, on behalf of my group, I am tabling an amendment in this respect - it is vital that we set up a single agency for this type of problem."
"The second aspect of coordination is what is known as operational coordination, that is, coordination between non-governmental organizations and the Commission's delegations."
"In this regard, we know that agreements have been standardized, and this is a positive step, in that it guarantees stable relations based on clear, known rules."
"However, with so many signatories and the marked differences between them, consideration needs to be given to the possibility of adding annexes to contracts."
"This would make agreements with non-governmental organizations more flexible."
"A second aspect is the question of visibility, and the report looks at its underlying significance, asking, in particular, where we want visibility, at home, in recipient countries or with other donors, and what we want to achieve by it."
"A third aspect is that of fund-raising."
"In this respect, the report suggests collecting money directly from the public."
"Such an initiative would have an important role to play in furthering visibility, since it would increase public awareness of humanitarian issues, without being to the detriment of non-governmental organizations, which could be actively involved in the collection process."
"An amendment to that effect is being tabled."
"A fourth aspect is the setting-up of a European volunteer service in the field of humanitarian aid."
"I feel that the action already taken by the European Union to set up a European civilian service could be integrated here, with the emphasis being placed on development work."
"I come now to the second part of the report, the section on linking relief, rehabilitation and development."
"In April 1996, the Commission produced a document divided into four sections, the first of which covers ways in which relief measures can take better account of development objectives and requirements."
"In this respect, I should like to point out, in particular, that the document stresses the importance of country-specific impact analyses being conducted before relief actions are initiated."
"A second section concerns rehabilitation and post-crisis assistance, where there seems to be a need to expand upon the Commission's very commendable document by involving local civilians."
"A third section concerns development actions and the risk of emergencies."
"The Commission's approach, which focuses on the notions of risk and vulnerability, is highly commendable but, if we are to be sure that account is taken of all the important issues, we need to realize that this is only one side of the coin."
"The only way to ensure that initiatives are really successful is to accord the same importance to the skills and abilities of individuals, and so ensure the involvement of the very people we are seeking to help."
"A fourth and final section covers man-made emergencies."
"Conflict prevention should be an intrinsic element of policy in this field."
"One issue not covered by the Commission document is that of the political dimension of humanitarian aid."
"However, one cannot be blind to the fact that, although they are supposed to be neutral, humanitarian actions sometimes have political consequences."
"The Commission should, therefore, evaluate the implications, case by case, and, if possible, seek to ensure that actions fit in with initiatives on conflict preparedness."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I must first congratulate the rapporteur, who is nevertheless my friend, Raimondo Fassa, for his excellent report, and I must also thank the members of the Foreign Affairs Committee who have favourably received all the suggestions made by this committee."
"These suggestions essentially related to two aspects: first, improved prevention, especially in the form of support for the creation of the International War Crimes Tribunal and secondly the Union's capacity for analysing and detecting conflict situations."
"Regarding the Union's capacity for intervention - which I think is a very important point - this report makes a special plea for the reform of the CFSP and the possibility of continuing diplomatic efforts and military and civilian intervention."
"Pursuing this argument, and here I must take this opportunity to stress the point to Commissioner Pinheiro, the report calls upon the Commission to study the possibility of setting up a European corps consisting of civilian and military units, capable of undertaking operations to keep and re-establish peace."
"At a time of capitulation on the matter of entrusting the southern command of NATO to a European, at a time when discussions on the creation of a European pillar within NATO are becoming more and more difficult, at a time when discussions on the integration of the WEU into the European Union institutions are becoming bogged down, at a time when we can look back on the disaster of Operation Turquoise, at a time when the Union has for four months proved incapable of making up its mind to intervene in the Great Lakes region, at a time when there is no specific proposal on the reform of the European Union's common defence and security pillar, it is not unrealistic to think that the Union might demonstrate a minimum of creative imagination and equip itself with a European intervention corps to handle these operations of maintaining and restoring peace."
"This corps would be made up of military and civilian units specially trained for this kind of situation; troops, doctors, people capable of setting up and running refugee camps; a military corps, in other words, which would not be an agglomeration of national units but would be made up of European troops under a European flag."
"A proposal of this kind, which is financially viable for the European Union, could be put into practice rapidly."
"All that would be needed would be to make an immediate start, undertaking the necessary studies straight away, and if the political will existed a decision could be taken as early as June when the reform of the treaties is under discussion in Amsterdam."
"Madam President, Commissioner, personally and on behalf of the Socialist Group I should like to congratulate Mr Fassa on his report."
"It demonstrates that the conventional distinction made between relief, rehabilitation and development is increasingly artificial, and that we have to strengthen the interrelation between these three types of action."
"Indeed, Community humanitarian aid significantly increased between 1990 and 1995, unfortunately as a consequence of the growing number of crises which arose in those years."
"But we should also bear in mind the fatigue which has begun to show among donors and the economic problems that many Member States are encountering."
"Maintenance of high levels of humanitarian aid, despite all of that, could threaten development in the coming years, something which should be of particular concern to us."
"Therefore we need close co-operation between the Member States and the Commission in order to make the Community's humanitarian aid as effective as possible and it is vital that we define a global strategy - as the rapporteur made a very good case for - which is coherent in terms of its application."
"This co-ordination should be part of the action taken by the third countries, specialised organisations and international agencies and NGOs."
"Mr President, Commissioner, given the stagnation or even the decrease in most aid programmes, the Commission really must create the necessary financial conditions so that, once and for all, we can begin to give priority to the prevention of conflict."
"It is also very important to make European public opinion aware of the importance of development aid in the medium term so that we can show the cause and effects of relationship between poverty and humanitarian crises."
"Another very good idea would be contributing a European voluntary service, at Community level, for future Community action in the fields of development and humanitarian aid."
"We should also pay increasing attention - just as the rapporteur properly pointed out - to the interrelation between short, medium and long term types of aid, through a duly coherent approach."
"Nor should we forget - and the Council unfortunately does so - that there is no between long term means for remedying human suffering than conflict-prevention, and so we must take action as soon as the situation in a country demands it of a preventive nature - diplomatic, economic, media, publicity, etc."
"The measures proposed by the rapporteur, Mr Fassa, which take into consideration all of these aims, deserve my loudest applause, and I sincerely hope that they will meet with due response by the Commissioner and the rest of the Commission."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I do not feel that the role of humanitarian aid should be developed at the expense of long-term development actions."
"For some time now, we have been seeing substantial amounts of funding being transferred from cooperation to humanitarian aid, both within the Member States and in the European Union."
"I feel, quite honestly, that this is an unacceptable situation in which the richer countries of the world are sacrificing their political responsibility and which I feel needs to be challenged."
"Humanitarian aid is, of course, more attractive, or at least appears to be more attractive, to public opinion; it is more pleasing to the heart, has more power to move people and is, therefore, given more coverage in the press and mass media."
"What I feel we ought to be doing instead is to make the European public more aware and convince people that the only way to promote international stability and growth in the poorer countries of the world is through development-cooperation policy and extensive funding for that policy, which implies, in particular, dealing with the lack of economic and political democracy that is a feature of relations between the northern and southern hemispheres."
"I, therefore, support Mr Fassa's report, which makes a number of proposals for improving the links between humanitarian aid, development aid, rehabilitation and economic restructuring."
"The report expresses strong support for the actions of non-governmental solidarity organizations, which are often the first to accept responsibility with their courageous presence in areas of conflict."
"I am also strongly in favour of ECHO, whose operational principles show that only real, effective and on-going coordination of European relief actions will achieve the desired objectives."
"I believe that, in some ways, ECHO is the pièce de résistance of foreign presence in the poorer countries; I believe that we should guarantee ECHO the secure resources it deserves and should ensure that it no longer suffers the uncertainties of budgetary reserve practices that should not pertain in the humanitarian sphere for policies whose aim is to help those in real difficulty."
"It is my opinion that a stern warning should be given concerning the sabotaging by the Council and Member States of the coordination of development-cooperation policies at European level that the Commission had so courageously proposed."
"What we are now seeing is a sort of re-nationalization of European cooperation, which is a backward step."
"It is nothing more than a deliberate political choice by Member States' governments, taken in the name of a neo-colonial policy that should no longer exist and which is having the insane result of Member States taking action in the poorer countries in downright competition and so frustrating each other's efforts."
"If we are to achieve all this, there needs to be a political will that should be restated by this Parliament, and I believe that adoption of the Fassa report - which I hope to see and towards which I shall contribute with my vote - would be a small step in that direction."
"Madam President, it is high time we started using the enormous wealth of knowledge and experience that already exists, instead of constantly setting up new bodies with new personnel who have to start from scratch again."
"I am thinking along such lines as the idea of a voluntary European service for development work."
"NGOs have long experience and this is used for the precise purpose of avoiding sending unqualified workers to developing countries."
"Instead one should seek to involve the local communities."
"There can be no point in sending young unqualified Europeans to developing countries, especially those experiencing catastrophic circumstances, just to help Europe's unemployment figures."
"NGOs also have some experience in country-specific efficiency analysis through their local knowledge and collaboration with the local NGOs."
"So why not ask the NGOs and ECHO to enter into a close working relationship in order to produce these country-specific efficiency analyses?"
"I remember how Oxfam, for instance, a whole year before the Rwanda catastrophe, pointed out time and time again what was likely to happen there."
"There had to be some form of intervention, Oxfam said, but no one listened."
"Nor do I understand why it should be necessary for ECHO and the Commission to advertise themselves, bad advertisements at that, and I would like to know how much EU money or ECHO money is being used on such advertising."
"I take exception to the section on reform of the common external and security policy, and feel, in general, that points 11 and 12 are somewhat jumbled."
"But I am pleased that the proposed changes concerning the role of women and active participation have been included in the report."
"Unfortunately a minute or two is not long enough to thank Mr Fassa for all those areas for which he deserves credit."
"Madam President, rapporteur, the report we are discussing argues for the redesigning of current links between emergency actions, the rehabilitation phase and development processes, so as to make European intervention more effective."
"Our group feels that any such link between emergency aid, rehabilitation and development must necessarily be achieved by strategic planning that embraces all the political, social and technical aspects of development logic and should encourage the harmonization of action being taken by the European Union, individual Member States and the United Nations."
"Strengthening of the CFSP therefore seems to be vital, just as uniting the competent services within a single body, which would guarantee the coordination and timeliness of actions, seems to be a way of marking the shift from words to actions."
"We are now witnessing crises that could certainly be defined as chronic and serious, and the very fact that they are protracted could allow optimal planning of actions, which could be transformed from initial emergency aid into the more specific form of targeted aid."
"We are of the opinion that the Executive's actions should take account of the needs of the weakest population groups, such as women, old people and children, and that they should encourage local markets by promoting the potential of local supply."
"We are, therefore, in favour of the creation of a European body comprising both civilian and military bodies, which would collaborate with WEU to help in resolving crises and restoring peace. We are also convinced of the need for a permanent international tribunal to put a halt to crime and punish the guilty; of the need for stricter controls on exports of armaments; and of the absolute urgency of launching a genuine policy to prevent natural disasters and resolve armed conflicts."
"Madam President, may I begin by expressing my support for the general thrust of this excellent report and the approach adopted by the rapporteur."
"In my contribution I would just like to highlight the main points of the REX committee's opinion."
"First of all, we acknowledge that the Commission makes a valuable and important distinction between the different types of disaster - from pure natural disasters which may nevertheless have structural causes or be endemic in nature to limited natural disasters: floods, earthquakes, etc., and then manmade emergencies involving violent conflicts."
"In the latter often the institutional and administrative framework for development has collapsed, whereas in the former basic institutional and administrative structures remain largely in place, although disrupted or temporarily overwhelmed by the emergency situation."
"That is obviously a very complex situation but, nevertheless, one which requires a flexible response."
"Then, of course there is the need, referred to by the last speaker, to support and encourage local markets as trading structures, and that is a major element in assisting rehabilitation."
"In fact, in many cases it would be the very basis for rehabilitation."
"I would like to stress the importance of those involved in the design of relief rehabilitation and development programmes taking decisions to support interventions which promote the functioning or re-establishment of local markets and national or regional trading structures."
"No discussion of this nature is ever complete without some reference to the role of the arms trade, and when we talk of major humanitarian disasters, very frequently the arms trade is mentioned and we believe, in the REX committee, that it is essential that the European Union should take steps to establish a code of conduct for the arms trade in regions of countries where obvious tensions exist and conflict is either imminent or under way."
"Finally, relating to the link between the document and current European Union practices, the Commission's approach to the links between relief, rehabilitation and development appears somewhat theoretical and involves a number of basic assumptions regarding the capacity of the European Union to implement this fairly ambitious approach."
"I have had a number of very good exchanges with the relevant people in the Commission and the authors of this document and I have told them that I am very glad to see it here and that I think that the document is excellent and goes a long way towards meeting the proposals being made by the European Parliament over the years."
"Nevertheless, my main concern is still whether this document can find an effective follow-up in the day-today implementation of European Union relief, rehabilitation and development aid, and perhaps more attention needs to be paid as to how things are functioning at the moment before going into proposals for the future."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first I must sincerely thank the rapporteur, Mr Fassa, for his work on this report."
"Now, I should like to deal briefly with one or two points."
"What I particularly welcome about this report is that it has dealt with the question of military protection for humanitarian activities."
"This is a problem that confronts us again and again, and in recent times, especially, humanitarian aid organizations have increasingly been the victims of acts of violence."
"I also believe that this is an area in which we can implement a little bit of common foreign policy on behalf of the Union, and so I also welcome the opinion of the Foreign Affairs Committee regarding the Peace Corps."
"I share the previous speaker's view regarding the problems of arms exports."
"But although a number of European countries have very strict rules governing shipments of weapons to areas of conflict, there are always criminal elements that find ways and means of coming by arms and then supplying those arms to crisis areas and elsewhere."
"So negotiations are all very well, but they are not a final answer."
"Another point concerned with aid to disaster areas and sustainable development is, in my view, that where emergency aid is concerned we cannot quibble about any human rights violations - the victims of the disaster come first in this instance."
"But in the case of continuing and continuous development work - development aid - we must indeed pose the human rights question, and I regret to say that there is one point on which I must contradict my esteemed colleague, Robles Piquer: not even a degree of prosperity in a country or improved living conditions can justify human rights being trampled underfoot, and I cannot feel any respect for a statesman who has done that, even though we are supposed to speak no ill of the dead."
"Madam President, the Commission wishes to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Fassa, on his report and is in general very favourable to its conclusions and recommendations."
"The report is a very positive step in the process of formalizing an approach which has been marked throughout its development by continuous consultation with a wide range of interested parties."
"The Commission would like to single out a number of points highlighted by the rapporteur for particular comment and also to provide Members with an update on the way the linking relief rehabilitation and development approach is being applied, as well as to comment on some issues of importance concerning humanitarian aid and ECHO."
"I am convinced that the effectiveness and efficiency of aid efforts cannot but be improved through a proper understanding of the reinforcement of the links between the different phases of relief, rehabilitation and development."
"Equally important, and as highlighted in Mr Fassa's report, is the need to coordinate actions of the Community and the Member States and indeed, beyond this, to ensure that there is good coordination between the Commission and the other major international organizations and agencies."
"Only then can we ensure coherence and promote efficiency."
"Another crucial point is the need for better targeting of aid to the people in need."
"This can be very difficult to achieve, especially in humanitarian crises involving massive refugee flows and insecurity, but it is nevertheless essential both to make the best use of funds and to maintain public support for provision of life-saving aid in the longer term."
"Furthermore, much humanitarian aid has had to be provided in conflict zones, where the civilian population has been increasingly affected, or even the direct target, of violence."
"In such circumstances, the humanitarian community is faced with many basic and yet extremely difficult questions as to the neutrality and impartiality of aid."
"Questions are rightly asked about how manipulation and looting of warring factions can be avoided, how human rights abuses are countered, how aid workers are protected and so on."
"Many of these legitimate concerns lie behind the points raised in the report before us."
"The Commission clearly recognizes the serious difficulties involved in providing humanitarian aid in these situations."
"The awareness of the inherent risks and an on-going analysis of situations prone to crisis, whether due to political or economic reasons, is an important part of this work."
"It is, however, necessary to realize that the problems encountered vary considerably from one crisis situation to another."
"The Commission makes great efforts to coordinate with partners such as NGOs, the Red Cross and UN organizations, to adapt the response in each situation."
"The report brings the issue of conflict prevention to the fore and this is naturally welcomed by the Commission."
"The importance of prevention cannot be overstated; prevention of conflict and promotion of a level of structural stability are central to the linking relief, rehabilitation and development approach and as you are aware the Commission has prepared a Communication on this subject which is currently being discussed in the Council."
"The Commission is also delighted to see that the rapporteur deals specifically with gender and that this issue has also been highlighted in the opinion delivered by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy."
"The gender aspect figured prominently in the Communication on linking relief, rehabilitation and development and in ECHO's work in 1996 and will continue to do so, being an essential part of making our humanitarian assistance equitable and effective."
"Women and men have different vulnerabilities to crisis and often different ways of coping with them."
"Overall, men tend to have more options than women, as they generally have greater control over resources, greater mobility and decision-making power."
"Therefore, we need to work out how this can be accounted for when planning and carrying out humanitarian operations and make sure it is actually implemented in the field of operations."
"This concern also links up with the points raised in Mr Fassa's report on local and regional capacities."
"It is all too easy to destroy fragile and fledgling markets with ill advised or poorly focused programmes."
"The involvement of local personnel and strengthening local institutions to deal with disasters can prevent many of the negative effects of disaster relief which have been observed, where expatriate staff and resources on many occasions have completely overwhelmed and sidelined local efforts."
"This is an area that we are particularly sensitive to in the Commission."
"Indeed it is our aim to encourage the private sector which we view as the powerhouse to fuel growth in the ACP countries."
"It is in this spirit that we believe that better development reduces the need for emergency relief, that better relief contributes to better development and that better rehabilitation eases the transition between the two."
"Progress in implementing the linking relief, rehabilitation and development approach has been marked by a number of milestones."
"Indeed, as linking relief, rehabilitation and development is seen very much as an approach which is widely applicable to a variety of situations, its influence has been pervasive and its progress rapid."
"Those responsible for the development and implementation of programmes have at their disposal a technique which attaches itself to existing programmes, because all that is required is that the programme be developed with linkages in mind and based on coordination, both internal and external."
"The mere fact of considering, at the earliest stages, the future implications of actions taken now helps to focus on improving the efficiency and effectiveness of aid."
"Task forces are probably one of the most tangible and pragmatic ways of witnessing intra-Commission cooperation and coordination in practice."
"They have been set up in those regions where the approach is most advanced."
"The two best examples to date are the task forces that have been in place for some time now for Haiti and the Great Lakes region."
"Others have been in place for longer such as in Liberia."
"Informally, and thanks to the appeal of and the need for this new approach, coordination and interservice cooperation is better than ever before with the advantage that it is now backed by the Commission's Communication and the fruitful debate it has provoked."
"It has been transformed internally within the Commission into a Joint Instruction signed by the Directors-General of all external DGs and the Director of ECHO and sent to all external services and delegations."
"The linking relief, rehabilitation and development is not confined to the Commission."
"Member States are invited to participate fully in the work and the Commission is pleased that the Council has agreed that the Commission and Member States should work together on the preparation of global policy frameworks for certain countries and regions."
"This report has highlighted many important humanitarian aid issues and is a welcome step in the linking relief, rehabilitation and development, where Parliament has always been supportive as well."
"Madam President, I am sorry for speaking at length but this is the kind of report and subject in which much of the substance of our day-to-day action in many of the most difficult areas is at stake."
"Therefore I thought my response deserved to be a bit longer in order to express some of our concerns."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m."
"I declare the sitting closed."
"(The sitting was closed at 8.05 p.m.)"
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Madam President, I refer to the Minutes."
"As regards Amendment No 5 to the Lindholm report. I was recorded as abstaining on that particular vote."
"I had in fact intended to vote 'Yes' but my fingers had the 'curse of Pasty' and I just got it wrong."
"So can I be recorded as having voted for that particular amendment."
"That will be attended to, Mr Hallam."
"Madam president, on item 7, ONP and universal service for telecommunications."
"Yesterday's vote was an extremely difficult one and I fully sympathise with there being the odd mistake, but I would like this corrected."
"It says here that we voted three times on deleting the word 'exclusively' ."
"Now it would appear to be correctly reported in the Minutes, but afterwards it has three times been wrongly incorporated into the directive; I would like to ask through you that your services correct this."
"The Minutes are excellent but the final text is incorrect."
"That is all I wish to see corrected."
"I understand your point, Mr van Velzen, and the necessary corrections will be made."
"Madam President, I am not referring directly to the Minutes, but rather to the verbatim report of proceedings for Wednesday."
"In that report, the inadequate answer given by the Council to my supplementary question to Mr Sjöstedt has been reproduced correctly, and the comment I made later with reference to the Rules of Procedure is also correct."
"However, the actual question that I asked has mysteriously disappeared, and has been replaced by a question that I put to the Irish Council Presidency last year."
"I just wanted to point out that this means that in some mysterious way parts of the verbatim report of proceedings for December have found their way into the verbatim report of proceedings for February, namely Wednesday."
"We shall do everything possible to sort that out."
"Are there any other comments?"
"(Parliament approved the Minutes)"
"Votes"
"I have voted against the McGowan report on complementarity between the Community's development cooperation policy and the policies of the Member States."
"I am a firm supporter of improving development aid but I believe that this should take place at national level."
"The main aim of the report would appear to be to strengthen the EU's combined Foreign and Security policy and to 'contribute to the international recognition of a European identity' which is written in the text of the resolution."
"I come from Sweden, a non aligned country, and I believe that our country can make a significantly greater impact in the world as an independent progressive nation than we can by having to adapt to, what is in practice, a super power controlled CFSP."
"We have voted in favour of the report as we support the aim to coordinate the EU's development aid and to avoid duplication of work."
"On the other hand, we are totally opposed to the complete harmonisation of development aid for EU countries."
"We think it is important that EU Member States continue to operate their own independent aid policies under their own banners."
"The Treaty of Maastricht stipulates that the development policy of the European Union should complement that of the Member States."
"But that complementarity requires coordination between the Union and the Member States."
"And this is where very little happens in practice."
"Mr McGowan's report clearly illustrates this."
"This evil is rightly described as a result of the Member States' lack of political will."
"The report unfortunately fails to make the point that this identified lack of political will is a result of the difference in approach of the Member States."
"In some development policy is part of trade, in others it is part of foreign policy and at the mercy of political interests."
"Think of the French in Africa."
"Such a difference in aims makes coordination far from easy."
"I have therefore no great expectations of the measures proposed in Mr McGowan's report."
"That is regrettable in that the effect of development cooperation will suffer."
"But with the lack of political unity in Europe I think it wiser to take the existing political reality and make maximum use of the opportunities for coordination rather than strive towards the lofty ideal of a coordinated development policy for the Union."
"In the explanatory statement Mr McGowan says that public opinion in the Netherlands accepts a relatively high percentage of GNP being spent on development aid precisely because this gives the Netherlands a strong national profile."
"That is true, but that support cannot be expected for a European policy."
"That is why development should be coordinated within the Union wherever possible but should primarily remain a national policy."
"And more particularly so because development aid is not about enhancing the Union's image in the world on the basis of the amount of money spent on development cooperation, but it is about having the greatest effect in the developing countries."
"These are the reasons why we are abstaining on the McGowan report."
"Fassa report (A4-0021/97)"
"I have voted against the Fassande report on EU humanitarian aid."
"I am in favour of developing humanitarian aid but I cannot vote for the report because it strongly advocates a strengthening of the combined Foreign and Security policy and a further rapprochement between the EU and the WEU."
"We agree with the ambition of coordinating the EU's development aid and making it more effective."
"But we cannot support this in the irrelevant context of phrases such as 'strengthening the Union's combined Foreign policy' and other similar phrases or in the context of requests to the Council to strengthen cooperation with the WEU."
"We think that the EU should be a civil organisation and that the WEU should be dissolved."
"There is absolutely no reason for the EU to establish a military force together with the WEU which shall be responsible for 'peacekeeping' initiatives."
"This proposal must be rejected."
"Clearance of EAGGF accounts"
"The next item is the interim report (A4-0043/97) by Mr Mulder, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the postponement of the discharge to be given to the Commission in respect of the clearance of the accounts of the Guarantee Section of the EAGGF for the 1992 financial year (com(96)0417 - C4-0259/96)."
"Madam President, we have had a European agricultural policy for many years now, and for many years it has been the subject of severe criticism."
"I shall not dwell on the merits of this criticism at this juncture."
"But there is one thing that must be quite clear: where there are regulations, these regulations must be respected, and where there is expenditure it must be according to the rules."
"Over the years this Parliament has raised considerable doubts about the implementation of these financial rules."
"That is why on 17 March 1995 this House adopted a resolution that henceforth there should be a separate discharge for the agricultural expenditure in the Guarantee section of the EAGGF."
"The Court of Auditors also announced that it would produce annually a special report on this expenditure."
"In April of last year Parliament had its first debate under this procedure and the conclusions it reached still make very interesting reading."
"First of all last year's resolution concluded that the personnel services in charge of the control were seriously understaffed."
"Last year's resolution called for the appointment of fifteen additional members of staff."
"One year further on we see that only three new members of staff have been appointed."
"A second important point from last year's resolution is that financial corrections were made which should only be made for technical reasons; political decisions have no place here."
"One year further on we see in the report from the Court of Auditors that the Commission has not adhered to that rule."
"If we now turn to the 1992 expenditure itself we see that from a total expenditure pattern of some ECU 30 billion ECU 800 m had to be reclaimed. And secondly, the Commission granted certain favours to countries which the Court of Auditors says were not justified."
"I want first of all to take the case of the beef storage in Ireland."
"This is quite strange."
"The control services of DG VI realised something was not right and made corrections of 5 %."
"The Commission's financial controller said that was too little, that serious errors had been made, it would have to be 10 %."
"DG VI then confirmed this idea and repeated that it did indeed have to be 10 %."
"Ireland protested, but the technical services of the Commission dug its heels in, but then what did the Commission as a political body do?"
"It rejected the advice from its technical services and decided on 5 %."
"The loss to the Community budget was in the region of ECU 30 million."
"In the case of production aid for cotton to Greece the same kind of comments can be made."
"The loss to the budget from the cotton case was about ECU 30 million."
"In all these cases the Commission fended off criticism from the Court of Auditors by saying that they had given the Member States the benefit of the doubt."
"We disagree with that, Madam President."
"What lessons can be learned from all this?"
"First of all: lack of personnel must not be used to excuse inadequate control."
"Investment in staff pays off abundantly in the future."
"Secondly: a post facto correction of ECU 930 m, and according to the Court of Auditors it will probably be much higher, is just unacceptably high, more than 5 % of the agricultural budget, and has to be brought under control either by better supervision or by better regulations."
"And thirdly: it is inadmissible that the European Commission buys off compliance with regulations by reducing financial corrections for a specific year although no improvements in that budget year were identified."
"Furthermore, there is in our view the major question as to whether the maximum financial correction of 10 % is indeed enough."
"We want an extra financial correction of 25 %."
"Last year this Parliament gave the European Commission the benefit of the doubt."
"We shall not do so this year."
"We are postponing approval of the 1992 agricultural expenditure until the conditions I have laid down are met."
"We shall have to ensure that in future agricultural expenditure is in order and that the Member States, both the public and the governments themselves, do not have the impression that the Commission is improperly implementing this in the future."
"Madam President, on behalf of my group I want to thank Mr Mulder for his report and say that my group accepts it and appreciates his hard work, sincerity and fairness."
"Of course, it is our primary duty, as Members of Parliament, to ensure that fraud or waste does not occur and we have to recognize that there is a natural tendency for Member States to be less careful in dealing with Community resources than with their own direct revenues - that is understandable."
"The rapporteur refers to ECU 800m. That figure can sound pretty horrific to the ordinary citizen."
"But, on the other hand, it is about 2.5 % of agricultural spending."
"So that shows it up in a different light."
"We have to recognize as well that this is not money which was lost but money which may have been lost."
"This is the essential difference we are talking about."
"We know some of it is lost; some of it we do not know about and, if we knew about it, it could be recovered."
"I have also a personal reservation about this 25 % rate."
"We have fines of 2 %, 5 % and 10 % when Member States are guilty of carelessness or a failure which may lead to loss of Community revenue."
"If we lose 25 % of Community revenue, then surely there is something drastically wrong with the Commission in the first place - and with the national administrations."
"If that sort of loss and waste occurs, the scheme should be withdrawn completely."
"I do not accept that the Commission is so blind as to allow routinely for situations where this can happen."
"I have some sympathy with the point Jan Mulder raised concerning the Commission's decision in relation to Ireland."
"I would like to point out - for Terry Wynn's benefit too - that there were no losses identifiable in the Irish situation."
"There was bad administration which may have led to losses."
"If losses occurred and people were found guilty of fraud, then they would have been pursued and the money recovered."
"But that did not occur: there was carelessness, which may have led to a loss of Community resources."
"The Commission services - Mr Fischler's services - proposed that for 1991 they would reduce or defer half of the fine of 10 % and that if things were put in order in Ireland - which of course they were - then that could be forgiven after two years."
"In other words, the decision the Commission made did not affect the resources of the Community in any way."
"What the Commission did was to take a high-profile decision, which got immense media publicity and sent the wrong signals to Parliament that a major concession had been made to Ireland, when, in fact, there was no concession."
"And it sent the wrong signals to the public that you can be guilty and, through political manipulation, get off."
"The fact was that this was a public relations exercise by the Commission and I regret it because it did not benefit the Irish revenue situation."
"Finally, I wish to say that I accept that we have to be tough in pursuit of our interests because the common agricultural policy has fallen into disrepute."
"But it is not only in relation to agriculture in the Community that fraud occurs."
"I heard a news item on the BBC which quoted a British minister as saying that if he could stop fraud in the British social welfare system he would save £6bn annually."
"In every case where there is public administration at local or national level, fraud occurs."
"It is not just here - but that is no reason for us not to be tough on it."
"Madam President, we are faced with one of those situations in which the average European citizen is likely to understand none of what we are saying or, worse still, to misunderstand and have a rather confused idea of how we regulate the Community's administration."
"As we have heard, administrative and bureaucratic disorder involves losses to the Community budget as a result of the appalling arrangements for advances paid in excess or the other accounting sleights of hand."
"We are currently discussing beef meat in Ireland and aid to cotton production in Greece, but there could also be other examples."
"As far as agricultural spending is concerned, it is perhaps really time to simplify matters."
"On several occasions, Commissioner, you have spoken, at the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, of the need to bring up-to-date and simplify the CAP and, I think, the administrative system also."
"But the time has come, above all, to involve the Member States on a global and continuing basis."
"We need to do this to avoid having to chase up, after the event, rather as we are doing with this report, the mistakes that have resulted from misinterpretation or arbitrary interpretation."
"Furthermore, our rapporteur, Mr Mulder, whom I congratulate on his meticulous work, now tells us that we also have grounds for criticizing the Commission, guilty of having yielded to political pressure exerted by the Member States and having managed its own internal services somewhat chaotically to say the least."
"I do not believe this to be an issue for the Committee on Budgetary Control only; it is a problem that brings in other areas of responsibility also."
"It is, certainly, the responsibility of the Committee on Budgetary Control to identify how properly to recover funds that the Member States have improperly, though we hope not deliberately, abstracted."
"We have also to point out that it is still up to the Member States to decide on how 80 % of Community appropriations are to be subdivided."
"We should not therefore wage a war of religion between one state and the next or between the Commission and the Council, even though a minimum of flexibility is needed, is vital to prevent excessively rigid bureaucratic obstacles."
"In my view, at any rate, we need constantly to be checking and monitoring to be sure that these issues are being properly interpreted and it is not left to the Commission, in the end, to foot the bill."
"I am amazed that alongside the bad examples of Greece and Ireland, Italy does not for once appear."
"I think that this inability of the European Union to function properly at an internal bureaucratic and administrative level is then reflected in administrative and managerial chaos at an external level, in relation to Europe's citizens."
"As we speak, Commissioner, once again in Italy, at this very moment, farmers and milk producers are facing the police, they are being charged by the forces of law and order because they need to demonstrate in front of the factories of the big multinationals in an effort to limit the damage caused by the infamous quotas, the surpluses of which they are the victims rather than the perpetrators."
"That too is the product of poor administrative information and poor internal management."
"Madam President, compulsory repayments from advances out of the agricultural guarantee funds are regularly the subject of discussion between the Commission and the Member States."
"There is nothing inherently wrong with that."
"But they should only be about whether the Commission has correctly estimated the amounts which were wrongly paid out."
"Mr Mulder's report shows that the Commission's action was unfortunately also dictated by other criteria."
"A declaration of intent on the part of the Irish government on improving the control system was sufficient for the Commission to lower the 1991 flat rate correction for Irish beef storage from 10 % to 5 %."
"That went against the advice of the financial controller who said that the identified shortcomings were no reason at all for reducing the fine."
"This situation is intolerable."
"The Commission should not reward Member States for promises."
"Compliance with Community regulations should be a matter of course."
"The Mulder report further shows that the Commission has not been consistent in laying down sanctions."
"In 1991 the same kind of infringements were identified in France and Italy as in Ireland."
"These countries did not protest and had to pay the full 10 %."
"In the light of the incorrect use the Commission has made of approving the accounts I support the rapporteur in postponing the discharge decisions."
"First of all it must be clear that it is only the damage suffered by the Community that determines the amount of the flat rate corrections."
"In this it is essential that the criteria for flat rate corrections should be more clearly defined."
"Madam President, the amount of the total financial corrections - ECU 800 m for 1992 - shows that the application of Community regulations still leaves much to be desired."
"This is not only a financial problem but it is also extremely harmful for the reputation of the agricultural sector and the Union."
"That is why I agree with the rapporteur that the services in charge of approving the accounts should be enlarged in order to increase the reliability of the financial corrections."
"That does not detract from the fact that proper financial management is first and foremost the responsibility of the Member States and is impossible without the cooperation of the national supervisory bodies."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Mulder has presented a very well-balanced report here today, and in this report he has, to a certain extent, got to the bottom of the problems facing the Commission when the latter takes its decision with regard to the clearance of the accounts submitted by Member States."
"The Commission has to get back from the Member States any expenditure which has clearly not been made in accordance with Community law."
"The only thing is, ladies and gentlemen, that such black-and-white situations are unfortunately rare."
"In most cases, the Commission has to assess the risk to the EAGGF that arises as a result of insufficient compliance with the regulations, especially those that concern the efficacy of the measures carried out by Member States to control applications for aid."
"Accordingly, it then rejects part of the expenditure, a part which is in proportion to the risk involved."
"The level of expenditure that is to be rejected is considered very carefully, in accordance with fixed guidelines, taking fully into account the arguments of the Member States, and after consulting a body of independent, senior figures."
"The fact that the Commission reclaims money is a strong incentive for Member States to control Community funds in accordance with the rules."
"In many cases, therefore, they improve their control measures as soon as the Commission's auditors inform them of any shortcomings."
"Whenever this has happened, the Commission has always decided in their favour when determining the rate of correction in cases of doubt, because one of the Commission's most important objectives is to motivate the Member States to improve their control systems constantly, rather than to punish them."
"Ladies and gentlemen, as regards the reduction of the correction for Ireland from 10 % to 5 %, I should like to make the following comments. The Commission's auditors found that in 1990 and 1991 in Ireland, there were major shortcomings in the control system for the intervention buying of beef, and therefore, for both these years, a flatrate correction of 10 % was proposed."
"Both Ireland and the arbitration body took the view that controls in 1991 had improved, and that the risk of loss in that year was therefore lower."
"However, at the time the auditors were not convinced of the effectiveness of these improvements, because intervention buying had been suspended with effect from 1993 until the date of the decision on the clearance of accounts."
"No intervention buying took place."
"Therefore the financial controller did not feel able to agree to a reduction in the correction."
"So the Commission, on the grounds of fairness, decided in favour of the Member State, as it always does in cases of doubt, as I said earlier."
"I can tell you, however, that in the mean time, once intervention buying had resumed, inspections were carried out in October/November 1996 and the results of those inspections were entirely to the Commission's satisfaction."
"On the second question, regarding the cotton situation in Greece, this entirely exceptional correction of 25 % represents the maximum possible loss to the Community budget."
"As part of the measures taken to improve control procedures, the Greek authorities carried out ex-post controls at the ginning plants, which showed that the actual losses were very probably not more than 10 %."
"In those circumstances, we could not stick to a correction of 25 %."
"In connection with the comments that have already been made, pointing out that the corrections amount to more than ECU 800 million, and that one might well deduce from that that the EAGGF funds were poorly managed, it is essential to make it clear just how big a percentage this sum represents, measured against the total funds, and also to point out that ECU 415 million, i.e. more than half the total sum, concerns a single case, namely the noncollection of the coresponsibility levy for milk in Italy and Spain."
"If you treat this amount separately, then the remaining sum amounts to only 1.3 % of Guarantee Fund expenditure."
"I do not think that that gives anyone grounds to conclude that the funds are poorly managed."
"The Commission is also prepared to review its guidelines for determining the level of correction, along the lines requested by Parliament, in order to clarify and place greater emphasis on the principles that it is, de facto, already observing."
"This review will be completed by the end of June, and until then we shall keep Parliament informed of our findings."
"At any rate, corrections as high as 25 % should be undertaken only after very careful consideration, because the legal bases on which the Commission acts rarely allow a correction to be undertaken that amounts to more than the actual loss to the Community budget that may possibly have arisen."
"Moreover, corrections cannot be made automatically in all cases in which the Commission requires controls to be improved, but only in those cases where a provision of Community law has not been complied with."
"However, the Commission also considers it desirable to increase the number of accounts clearance staff, and it will endeavour to find the extra positions recommended by Parliament."
"I would just ask you to bear in mind, however, that the sort of staff required for this highly specialized task can seldom be recruited internally, and the number of new jobs is strictly limited."
"Against this background, I hope I can count on your support as we seek to achieve this objective."
"In this connection, I should like to thank Mr Wynn, in particular, for his comments, and finally I should also like to express my thanks to Mr Mulder again, and to the House as a whole, for this constructive report."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"Madam President, our group will be voting in favour of Mr Mulder's report."
"We agree with his conclusions, by the terms of which the discharge to be given to the Commission in respect of the clearance of the 1992 EAGGF accounts will be postponed and made subject to certain conditions."
"We also agree with the analysis contained in Mr Mulder's report, especially regarding the two decisions by the Commission which prompt this postponement."
"And, finally, we agree with the conclusions he draws from that analysis. No revisions should be called for, even if that is difficult to accept in the light of the substantial losses suffered by the Community budget, amounting to nearly a billion ECU."
"The Commission must amend its procedure for the clearance of the accounts so that a reference to any improvement in controls cannot in future result in a retroactive reduction in the flat-rate corrections."
"We also agree with the call for a flat-rate correction of 25 %."
"I should like to take advantage of this vote to emphasize the difference in relation to the 1992 discharges to the Commission and the 1993 discharges on Parliament's budget."
"I hope that the postponement of the discharge for which we are going to vote will not result in a contrary decision and will be followed by genuine results, and that the discharge will be refused until such time as Parliament's demands have been met."
"That, in any case, will be the firm position of the Europe of Nations Group, in order that, in accordance with what the group has always maintained, substantial sums from the Community budget should be appropriated in accordance with the legal rules and there should be genuine control exercised by the Members of the European Parliament to ensure that the interests of the citizens of the various nations of Europe are safeguarded."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Assisting spouses of the self-employed"
"The next item is the report (A4-0005/97) by Mrs Lulling, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights, on the situation of assisting spouses of the self-employed."
"Madam President, those responsible for drawing up our agenda are too often guided by a special scale of values and priorities for reasons that reason knows nothing of."
"So it happens that the report which I have the honour to present on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights - a report which is of interest to at least 10 million assisting spouses in the European Union, and perhaps even twice that number - has been relegated to this sparsely attended Friday morning sitting."
"It is true that we have been in competition with mad cows, the number of which in the European Union is equally unknown."
"It is true, too, that the sad fate of the millions of assisting spouses working in their husbands' businesses, with no legal status, no independent social security, no financial security in the event of divorce, no claim on the assets to which they have contributed - is a less emotive subject than mad cows for those Members who, this week, tabled a motion of censure against the Commission."
"This is 1997."
"In September 1994, the Commission presented a report on the disappointing progress made in implementing the 1986 Directive on the application of the principle of equal treatment for self-employed men and women, including assisting spouses."
"That directive failed to arouse our enthusiasm, because its content could be described as 'decaffeinated' by comparison with the Commission's initial proposal, but it did at least have the virtue of existing. I would not deny the fact that progress has been made in some Member States, but, more than 10 years after the adoption of the directive, the majority of spouses participating in the activities of the selfemployed are forgotten people, invisible workers."
"As the report on the application of the directive - drawn up by the Commission after a delay of at least three years - has not been presented to Parliament, the Committee on Women's Rights has had to compile an own-initiative report on these invisible victims of discrimination, the assisting wives working in millions of family businesses, especially in agriculture, the SMEs, crafts and trade, though not excluding those with professional spouses."
"I felt that no purpose would be served by lamenting the past and the all-too-obvious fact that the 1986 directive has sadly failed in its purpose. I felt it would be better to look to the future, to make specific proposals to add muscle to the 'decaffeinated' directive of 1986 - proposals capable of providing a remedy to the precarious situation affecting these assisting spouses, especially in cases of divorce or the death of the husband."
"We do realize - subsidiarité oblige! - that the amended directive we want can only create a framework within which the Member States will have to take action to achieve the objectives which I shall now summarize: we want assisting spouses to have a legal status, enabling them to choose between the status of employed spouse, partner spouse or collaborating spouse; we want it to be compulsory for assisting spouses to contribute to social security schemes covering illness, invalidity, accident and old age; we recommend tax incentives meaning the inclusion in the business operating expenditure of the remuneration actually paid to the spouse, on the two conditions of course that this is the normal remuneration for services actually rendered and that all the legally required deductions and contributions should be made."
"We also think that measures should be taken to ensure that assisting spouses who have worked for many years in the family enterprise are no longer disadvantaged in terms of inheritance and succession."
"Finally, we want appropriate representation for assisting spouses in the professional organizations and chambers of the sectors concerned."
"In my own country, as regards invalidity insurance and pension schemes, for example, there has been provision since 1988 for compulsory contribution by assisting spouses, but with the possibility of an exemption."
"The reality is that because of this exemption - which is too easy to obtain - out of 2000 craft enterprises where it is obvious that spouses are actively participating in the business, only 164 are affiliated under this rule."
"The situation is equally appalling in trade and in the liberal professions."
"Why is this?"
"Lack of information, fear of the cost of contributions - even though they are tax-deductible - or, quite simply, negligence or lack of interest."
"Legislators, which is what we purport to be, must know that it is often necessary to do people favours despite themselves, especially in cases where they tend to shy away from the expense."
"That is why we have also proposed compulsory registration for assisting spouses, so that they cease to be invisible workers."
"It has been pointed out to me that, in the United Kingdom, this demand would no doubt be blown up out of all proportion by one section of the press as a platform for yet another campaign against Europe."
"I should be happy for that to happen - at least public opinion would be alerted and would know that our Parliament is doing something for these invisible workers."
"I know that the Commission is in the process of organizing round tables with the organizations concerned with a view to debating the needs of assisting spouses."
"I was able to attend the first of these round tables."
"If this process continues, and if the Commission draws the conclusions it should from these round tables and from our report, I for my part can promise it that it will run no risk of a motion of censure."
"If that were not the case, I should see no better reason there - at any rate, no better than the reason we have been discussing this week - to censure a Commission that disregards the fate of tens of millions of citizens of our Union."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the rapporteur, who has taken the trouble to present us with such a well-balanced report, a report which also won a large measure of agreement in the Committee on Women's Rights."
"As the report says, the overwhelming majority of assisting spouses of the self-employed are women who work together with their husbands in agriculture, crafts and commerce, and in the liberal professions."
"In doing so, most women carry out these activities without any formal recognition of their legal status, and many of them play just as important a role as their husbands - particularly if they are involved in running a farm."
"It is very difficult, however, to estimate just how many assisting spouses there are, and the task is rendered even more difficult by the fact that there are no precise criteria."
"Many of them are employed on a full-time basis, so that they appear as normally registered employees and are covered by social security like all other employees."
"Others, however, are not recognized at all, which means that if the partners divorce or separate they encounter substantial difficulties, and women in particular are often left out in the rain without any social security protection."
"Others, again, are partners in the business - in other words there is a whole range of different possibilities."
"The 1986 Directive was intended to provide joint action to improve matters."
"However, it is lacking in precise direction and its vague wording makes it difficult to define a joint status."
"The problem is made worse by the fact that Member States have proved reluctant to transpose the Directive into their national legislation."
"The Member States are refusing to transfer responsibility to the Union, and we have now reached a blockade situation."
"Our great difficulty is that the Social Chapter is not yet part of the Treaty."
"It is therefore particularly important that we should give our attention to ensuring that equality of opportunity is included in the Treaty on European Union, and to the fact that it constitutes an important pillar for women and for citizens' rights in the Union."
"Member States, however, are somewhat disinclined to take action on this matter."
"Therefore we, in the European Parliament, must exert pressure on them to grant more status to these women."
"But where should we start?"
"I believe that this report indicates that the question of compulsory registration for women should not be left up in the air."
"Instead, we must exert pressure in order to ensure that all women are included, and that they can become members of statutory pension and invalidity insurance schemes, so that some progress can be made in this direction."
"And on this point I should like to say that, standing as we do on the threshold of the 21st Century, we should not still be relying on old 19th Century family roles where marriage is regarded as an institution to provide for women, certainly not when we have divorce rates of over 30 %."
"Women must no longer be the worker ants in family businesses, who work themselves into the ground without complaining, and who, while bearing the double burden of work and housework, lose all status and all rights."
"Therefore we need an independent invalidity and pensions insurance, we need independent professional representatives for these women, and they must be given opportunities for further training, and I believe that on the eve of International Women's Day, on March 8, this is a requirement for which the European Parliament should take full responsibility."
"I would therefore ask that this report be approved"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the debate about the rights of assisting wives began about 30 years ago in Austria."
"Today, the legal position is as follows: the assisting wife or the husband can be employed quite normally as employees."
"They are then covered by sickness, accident and pensions insurance."
"If the activity consists merely of internal assistance, then it cannot constitute a working relationship, but the assisting spouse can take out sickness insurance along with the other partner."
"If the marriage ends in divorce, then under § 81 of the Marriage Act, the marital property and marital savings are divided up."
"The only thing is that the wife must have actually made her contribution. Under § 83 (2) of the Marriage Act, this contribution consists of the following: ' running the joint household, caring for and bringing up the joint children, and any other conjugal support' ."
"That may also be a good piece of advice."
"As far as farmers' wives in particular are concerned, the separate paying out of pensions was introduced in 1989 in Austria."
"A farmer's wife can demand, even against her husband's wishes, that 50 % of his pension should be paid directly to her."
"Since 1992 farmers' wives have had their own pensions."
"Since 1 July 1990, farmers' wives also receive benefit for a 'non-working period' of one and a half years following the birth of a child."
"There is also a farmer's wife's weekly allowance, based on the wife's own insurance, which is payable for the statutory maternity leave period, which in Austria is four weeks before and four weeks after the birth of a child."
"With effect from 1 January 1993, a woman who retires receives a supplement for each child, and periods spent bringing up children are also counted as qualifying periods giving rise to pension entitlement for the purposes of calculating her own pension."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we should continue the discussion."
"I should be happy to give all of you the documents describing these legal options."
"We are not discussing fantastic dreams: what we are discussing is a reality and a right that is already being experienced in a Member State of the European Union."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. I totally agree with Mrs Lulling."
"The fact that this report is being taken on a Friday of the Strasbourg part-session is already an indication of the lack of interest in this subject."
"It is a true reflection of the situation of assisting spouses today."
"The assisting spouses are usually described in state registers as 'with no profession' or 'house mother' or 'housewife' ."
"They are often a major unknown factor for social security."
"In reality, however, they are an indispensable aid to their husband."
"The Liberal Group therefore warmly welcomes this own initiative report but would welcome even more enthusiastically the Commission's proposal for amending the existing directive."
"The assisting spouse deserves more than just recognition from her husband and family."
"Circumstances such as divorce, death or invalidity of the spouse can put an unexpected end to this recognition and herald in total misery."
"To the report."
"What I think is particularly important is first of all that we opt for a compulsory system of registration and enrolment with an insurance."
"We have seen from the French system that a voluntary system does not produce the expected reaction."
"Secondly, we need a legal statute which despite being compulsory should be sufficiently flexible, especially with regard to calculating the contributions."
"If we make the granting of a statute too complicated we risk unwittingly creating a category of concealed assisting spouses, and that is certainly not our intention."
"I also support the rapporteur's proposals for greater awareness and encouraging those concerned to register their spouses in a tax incentive scheme."
"I regret to have to say that the Belgian government is barking up the wrong tree on this point and is turning the clock back."
"As of 1 January of this year they have stopped allowing independent workers to set part of their income in the name of their assisting spouse and is therefore killing off this tax incentive."
"The assisting spouse can henceforth only be registered as an employee or business manager, but for many liberal professions this is impossible in view of the deontology of the liberal profession and company legislation."
"There is no longer any question of flexibility."
"But hopefully the new European legislation will persuade the Belgian government to think again because what it is currently doing is very like the Echternach procession."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I hope that we can soon have here a debate on the legislative proposal on assisting spouses."
"I would be interested in hearing the Commission's plans on this score."
"Mr President, what used to be called atypical work has now become typical."
"The instability and precariousness of labour relations, the fruit of the flexibility of the so-called labour market - never seen to be sufficiently flexible by employers - has now been expressed in the significant appearance and increase in the numbers of self-employed persons."
"Whereas in many cases self-employed persons are nothing more than workers who have lost their legal status but retain a real occupational status which is identical to the previous one, in other cases self-employment is a new and different activity replacing what used to be called typical occupational activity."
"This evolution has led to others in the cumulation of discriminations and the situation of assisting spouses of selfemployed persons, usually referred to as the wives of self-employed persons, to which particular attention should be paid."
"We congratulate the rapporteur on doing so in this report."
"Given that we are talking about the assisting spouses of a derived and very heterogenous group of workers, it may be estimated that, despite the lack of definition of professional status and the difficulty in quantifying them, they must be much larger in number than the 3 million referred to in the Commission report on social protection."
"Given that three-quarters of them are women, they could even account, in a single Member State such as Greece, for a quarter of the female population liable to be considered as active."
"As Mrs Lulling emphasises in her report, and I take this opportunity to compliment her on her work, Directive 86/613 is unsatisfactory especially because it fails to define the status and is ineffective vis-à-vis the right to social protection of this group of workers."
"That is why it must be amended and it must be amended this year, 1997."
"The set of proposals made in the report deserve our agreement in principle and can act as a good working basis for a new directive aimed at dealing with situations which must not lead to the enshrinement, by old and new means, of discrimination against women in the world of work, because, in this case, of the virtual lack of visibility"
"We must also support, as a complement to the prerequisites of the directive to be replaced which have not been complied with, the concretisation of initiatives such as debates and round tables giving the interested persons a real chance to take part in defining their needs, status as well as the wording of the new directive."
"Mr President, I pay tribute to the very welcome initiative taken by the Committee on Women's Rights in producing this report in favour of providing decent social protection for assisting spouses."
"Like the rapporteur, I too deplore the years of delay, the time wasted by the European Commission, years that could have been used to good effect for a better exchange of views between the various parties concerned."
"None of us can reasonably deny the need for legislation on this; as to whether the protection scheme set up should be optional or compulsory, I think that question does not arise."
"Experience in Luxembourg has shown that nothing is achieved by inviting voluntary contributions."
"The reason for that failure is blatantly obvious: small- and mediumsized enterprises and the self-employed, in every country of the Union, already bear a crushing weight of taxation and charges of all kinds, which incidentally the big multinationals find it too easy to escape."
"Also, as well as making it obligatory for the Member States to organize social protection for assisting spouses, we have a duty to make it compulsory to provide proper information to the workers concerned and to require the national authorities to manage the money they collect with due care, contrary to the habits adopted by the majority of governments in the States of the Union, whether Left or Right."
"Mr President, the own initiative report which we are now assessing, drafted by Mrs Lulling, whom I must compliment, is a work of enormous difficulty given that it refers to a group of millions of invisible workers, so invisible that statistics officially categorise them as 'inactive' categories."
"They are inactive because they are not registered as unemployed nor are they seeking work because they do not lack a job, but it is neither recognised nor remunerated."
"This situation applies in particular to the wives of self-employed workers who assist them working in fields or in any type of tiny family business which can be found anywhere and which employ, according to studies which have been carried out, millions of people."
"Both Community legislation and national legislations when they, rarely, make express reference to the situation of the spouses of self-employed persons - such as Portuguese legislation - come up against the reality which is quite different from the spirit of the law."
"Women still very often see it as their duty to help their husbands or companions without being paid and they look upon this huge work - which is not included in the calculation of the GDP of any country - as an obligation which their status of spouse requires."
"If we accept this and consider the fact that they are not recognised by law and have no rights whatsoever, we can then understand why we are talking of invisible workers: they work but earn nothing, they work but they have no social rights, even where the law so provides."
"That is why I agree with the proposals made by the rapporteur, as well as the amendments, aimed at withdrawing all of these working people from their clandestinity: compulsory inscription of assisting spouses in social security schemes, making it compulsory for Member States to take not only appropriate legal measures but also to make attempts so that they can be effectively applied, introducing incentives to family businesses to comply with these obligations, all of these are proposals which have to be supported."
"That is why it is vital that the Commission should prepare a new directive on this subject, from the social and financial points of view."
"After all, there are many more workers who are not counted in GDP or entitled to social security."
"I also think that the proposals for greater flexibility in the system and its adaptation to business size are particularly pertinent, as well as the proposal that in many small family businesses social security costs should be deductible from their profit declarations."
"Finally, I would call on self-employed workers associations to regard it as their binding obligation to fight for the social situation of the spouses of their respective partners."
"Again I wish to congratulate the rapporteur and I hope that this proposal, which the European Parliament will undoubtedly approve today, will very shortly be converted into a proposal for a directive by the Commission."
"Mr President, I wish to congratulate the Committee on Women's Rights and the rapporteur in particular on taking the initiative to highlight the situation of the assisting spouse and to put forward proposals to create a statute at long last for a category of the population which is large in number but small in statistics."
"I hope to hear later that the Commission has been inspired by this for its legislative work."
"Mr President, I have been following this matter since long before the 1986 directive and I have always wondered if the statute of the assisting spouse would be as empty and insignificant if this group were to consist mainly of men."
"As far as I am concerned the situation of the assisting spouse is a yardstick par excellence for the continuing discrimination between men and women."
"In my own country, Mr President, that is Belgium, the assisting spouse is the only group of people who are permanently active in a profession without being covered by a compulsory social statute."
"But 97 % of this group is made up of women."
"This situation cannot of course be separated from the still poor representation of women in professional and interprofessional organisations and in the political decision-making process."
"If women are not there at the table their interests are not defended as well as they could be."
"What we need in all Member States of the Union is no more and no less than a statute based on the same automatism as that of the self-employed, farmers and the liberal professions, namely a statute that offers social and legal protection for every risk which is present."
"The other side of the coin is undoubtedly a certain price tag, but where no-one denies that there is a price to be paid for everything for respected self-employed entrepreneurs, all sorts of objections are raised when it comes to the assisting spouses of these entrepreneurs."
"Mr President, I conclude with the thought that the fact that we have to discuss this here in the year 1997 is not only incomprehensible but downright scandalous."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank the Committee on Women's Rights and in particular its rapporteur Mrs Lülling, for their excellent work."
"The report we are debating today is a clear proof of the European Parliament's interest in the promotion of issues such as equal opportunities for and equal treatment of women and men."
"I believe the issue of equal treatment for women involved in the activities of their self-employed husbands is a particularly important one."
"As you know, that issue was addressed at Community level for the first time in 1986, with the adoption of Council Directive 86/613/EEC of 11 December 1986."
"Assessment of the measures undertaken by Member States in that area reveals, as the report too points out most clearly, that a great deal still needs to be done, both in relation to social security and concerning the position and recognition of the role of the spouses of self-employed persons in the family business."
"As Mrs Gröner too stressed, we must not forget that the lack of progress in that area partially reflects the traditional view about the role of wives in family businesses."
"A view which makes no distinction between marital and entrepreneurial coexistence."
"There is indeed a tendency to regard the contribution of wives to family businesses as a self-evident extension of conjugal duties."
"The lack of progress also reflects the difficulties that exist concerning the adaptation of social security systems, and concerning the expenditure incurred by that adaptation for family businesses in which both spouses are working together."
"The Commission is aware of those problems."
"We have funded many studies, which demonstrate the serious lack of social protection for assisting spouses."
"At the same time, however, it is also true that existing possibilities for voluntary insurance or for the acquisition of a separate legal status are not taken up."
"On that point I would like to say that the issue of assisting spouses is included among the objectives of the Fourth Medium-term Action Programme on equal opportunities."
"The Commission has undertaken to carry out a careful assessment of the situation, to include broad consultations with all interested parties."
"Our aim is to examine the possibility of submitting an amended directive that will respond to the real needs in that sector."
"The round-table discussions you welcome in your report and in which you played an energetic part, are the forum for the consideration of the issue."
"But if we are to understand the obstacles in the way of improving the social protection of assisting wives, we need more information about their views and about the attitude of professional organizations."
"For that purpose measures and policies must be implemented which are flexible, owing to the complex nature of those obstacles and also because the social protection of assisting spouses is related to issues such as the recognition of their role in family businesses, as both Mrs KestelijnSierens and Mrs Thyssen stressed very clearly."
"Nowadays, society is undergoing important changes."
"Women want to undertake a more active role in the labour market at all levels, as Mrs Torres-Marques too stressed."
"However, we are encountering difficulties, and mainly lack of funding, as Mr Ribero very clearly emphasized."
"We face problems such as the lack of appropriate services to offer business advice, a lack of suitable professional training, and a failure to recognise the abilities of those involved."
"Besides, agricultural reform and changes of the CAP will radically alter the lives of farmers, and in that context the improvement of women's status in family farming enterprises must be one of our priorities, as Mrs Flemming stressed."
"All those factors must be considered together in the discussions about the self-employed and their assisting spouses."
"Mr President, I would again like to thank Parliament for its support on this issue of equal opportunities, and to congratulate Mrs Lülling once more on her excellent report."
"I am sure our collaboration will continue with the same aims and priorities."
"Nowadays, equality of opportunity between men and women must be emphasized so that we may respond to the demands of our times and develop more effective policies to bring women into the labour market."
"Thank you very much."
"Thank you, Mr Papoutsis."
"The rapporteur, Mrs Lulling, now has the floor."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Commissioner Papoutsis most sincerely for his very positive speech, and I should like to place on record what he has just said, i.e. that the Commission will submit an amended draft directive."
"Since Mr Flynn was unable to be here today, I should like to express the hope that the fine words of Mr Papoutsis will be followed by action on the part of Mr Flynn."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Lulling."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will now be taken."
"Before the vote on Amendment No 4"
"Mr President, I should like to alert this House to the importance of this amendment because in the text of the report we referred to social security contributions based on personal income."
"This in fact is a very ill-chosen expression, because there is no country and no compulsory insurance scheme in which contributions are paid on the basis of personal rather than professional income."
"The amendment clarifies this point."
"I should therefore like this amendment to be adopted, together with the different wording, because it is better than my own, which referred to a ceiling basis for social security."
"The alternative wording refers to a flat-rate basis."
"I think this is an important detail, but if honourable Members fail to agree with the second part, I shall call for a separate vote on the first, because it is never possible to collect contributions on the basis of personal income."
"This is not done anywhere, and I would emphasize that."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Leghold traps"
"The next item is the oral question (B4-0002/97) by Mr Collins, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, to the Commission, on the position of the European Commission on leghold trap legislation."
"Mr Collins has the floor."
"Mr President, this is the on-going saga of leghold traps."
"It is a sorry tale of Commission misdemeanour."
"Members will recall that leghold traps are a particularly vicious way of trapping wild animals for use in the fur industry, a way which causes the animals extraordinary and unnecessary pain."
"Members will also recall that last year's report on leghold traps by Carlos Pimenta, which called for their banning, was supported by a huge majority in this House."
"On 9 December of last year, the Environment Council followed our lead and demanded full implementation by the Commission."
"That was on 9 December."
"On 18 December the Commission flatly rejected that demand."
"So Parliament voted for it last year."
"The Council voted for it in December and on 18 December, the Commission, which is not elected nor accountable to anyone, rejected our demands."
"The Pimenta report calls for humane trapping procedures and was cleverly written so as to avoid conflict with the European Union's commitments under GATT and WTO."
"It even goes so far as to impose a ban on fur from animals caught in leghold traps and to allow for its lifting when agreement has been reached with third countries to stop leghold use."
"This agreement would not even have to be in force for the ban to be lifted."
"It was merely to be agreed."
"The European Parliament managed to strike a blow for the principle while giving third states ample room for manoeuvre."
"Yet we hear now that the Commission is considering proposing a new regulation which seeks to exempt Russia and Canada."
"It has no justification."
"It displays a complete disregard for the democratic voice of Parliament as well as the decision of the Council."
"I have written to President Santer and this morning I received a reply from him."
"I do not accept his reply."
"It is a brave attempt to justify the unjustifiable."
"The Commission must recognize that the question of leghold traps is an issue of animal welfare."
"This is not just about trade."
"The Commission cannot allow principle to be subsumed in a desire to placate trading partners."
"It must have the courage of our democratic principles."
"Our Commissioner and our Commission must stop being the representative of the WTO in Europe and must start being the mouthpiece of the European Community in the WTO."
"They have their priorities the wrong way round."
"That is why the question is raised today, because the General Affairs Council meets next week and the Environment Council meets in March."
"The Commission must realize what a hornet's nest it has stirred up by its decision and I ask it to tell us today how it squares its decision with respect for democratic procedures and principles."
"I would like the Commission to tell this House why legislation it has passed is not being implemented and I would like the Commission to give this House the assurance that it will consult both Parliament and Council before adopting any international agreement on leghold traps."
"Lastly, I demand that the Commission this morning tell us clearly that there are no circumstances and nor will there be any in which it will seek to frame legislation that avoids the need to consult the European Parliament and avoids the need to observe the wishes of the Environment Council."
"I hope the Commission can give us these assurances this morning."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to tell you that President Santer responded by letter on 4 February 1997, to the letter sent to him by Mr Collins on 23 December 1996."
"In his answer, President Santer explained clearly and in detail the Commission's views about the issue."
"The Regulation is fully in force and applies to anything relevant to its orders that takes place within the Community."
"The only difficulties arise in connection with the application of the Regulation's provisions on external trade."
"Let me remind you, however, of the starting point."
"Council Regulation (EEC) No 3254/91 on leghold traps provides two separate options for avoidance by third countries of the trade restrictions imposed by the European Union on fur imports, either by banning the use of leghold traps, or by the use of trapping methods that comply with internationally agreed standards for humane trapping."
"Those options available to third countries demonstrate the intention of legislators, where international standards are concerned, to solve the issue of compatibility between the commercial measures specified in the Regulation and international trade rules."
"Unfortunately, however, as you know, the international standards had not yet been established when the specific order came into force on 1 January 1996."
"That was because of the unsuccessful outcome of the work of the International Standards Organization, work which the European Commission had no chance to influence."
"Consequently, the regulation could not be applied under the conditions and for the purposes laid down in the text."
"For those reasons, in November 1995 the Commission decided to defer the implementation of the regulation for one year and to propose to the Council that Regulation 3254/91 should be amended."
"More especially, the aim was to make it possible to negotiate an international agreement on standards for humane trapping with the main fur exporting countries, i.e. the USA, Canada and the Russian Federation."
"Until recently, the Council supported the approach proposed by the Commission, as is proved more especially by the instructions it gave the Commission in June 1996, instructions relating to the negotiation of an agreement on standards for humane trapping."
"The European Parliament, at the first reading of the proposed amendment of Regulation 3254/91, also backed the negotiation of such an agreement, but at the same time it called for the immediate application of the restrictions stipulated in Regulation 3254/91 and for them to remain in force until the agreement in question had been concluded."
"It is not true that the Commission ignored that call."
"On the contrary, we considered that a ban on fur imports would not contribute to the creation of appropriate conditions for constructive negotiations."
"The value of an international agreement, which would for the first time establish rules for the control of the trade, should not be underestimated."
"As you know, in December 1996 an agreement was initialled on international standards for humane trapping by the European Community, Canada and the Russian Federation."
"The Commission conducted the related negotiations on behalf of the Community, in full compliance with the rules of the Treaty."
"More especially, the Commission confirms that the agreement is on the one hand fully consistent and compatible with the orders of Regulation 3254/91, and on the other hand entirely in accordance with the Council's instructions to the Commission in June 1996."
"The Commission is also convinced that this cohesive, ambitious and legally binding agreement is the best means to ensure the substantive improvement of the level of protection for trapped animals in North America, the Russian Federation and Europe."
"At the same time, the agreement safeguards the legitimate trading interests of the subscribing parties."
"In contrast, the absence of an agreement would probably lead to trade disputes, which could not achieve anything in relation to the protection of animals and, in addition, the absence of an agreement would have fundamental negative economic and social consequences both in the EU and in other interested third countries, mainly for the native populations."
"Furthermore, a trade dispute would undermine the credibility of the Community's trade policy, which is clearly always opposed to the use of unilateral trade measures with extraterritorial applicability."
"For that reason, on 24 January 1997 the Commission submitted to the Council a proposal for a decision on the European Community's approval of the agreement."
"Of course, and always in accordance with the rules of the Treaty, the Council will be asked for its opinion concerning the specific proposal."
"At the same time, the Commission has set in motion the action necessary for the implementation of Regulation 3254/91, as it was asked to by the Environment Council of 9 December."
"In fact, the Official Journal has already published the Commission's regulation on the certificates that importers must hand over to the Community's customs authorities before furs can be imported."
"As for the list of third countries, the Commission's procedure mentioned in Article 5 of Regulation 3254/91 is still in force."
"Finally, and again in accordance with the decisions of the Environment Council of 9 December, the Commission has made contact with the third countries involved."
"The aim of those contacts was to examine the possibility of amending the agreement initialled by Canada and the Russian Federation."
"And I would like to inform you that just a few days ago certain meetings took place, in New Orleans on 14 February and in Ottawa on 17 and 18 February, to convey the Environment Council's requirements to the interested countries."
"Those contacts have not so far borne fruit, and the Commission is now waiting for supplementary instructions from the Council, so that it can take the matter further."
"I would like to assure you that the European Commission not only respects and accepts Parliament's role and parliamentary control but also, as you know, we have repeatedly demonstrated that we try in every way, even beyond the statutory framework established by the Treaties, to cooperate with the European Parliament, especially on issues of this kind which are not only sensitive for economic activity, but mainly also, touch upon the sensitivities of Europe's citizens."
"I therefore also want to assure you now, that the Commission will continue to keep Parliament informed about developments in this context."
"Mr President, I should like to ask the Commissioner a question about what he has just said."
"He referred to the likelihood of bringing this into operation in December."
"Since we are dealing mainly with the northern hemisphere, would he not agree that it is rather silly to have the cutoff date half way through the trapping season?"
"Would it not be more logical to make it this summer?"
"Thank you very much, Mr Kellett-Bowman."
"I do not think that is exactly a point of order. It is rather a question of chronology."
"But Friday's flexibility allows me to give the Commissioner the floor if he wants to reply to Mr Kellett-Bowman's chronological concern."
"Mr President, I would like to assure Mr Kellett-Bowman that the mechanism will become operative as soon as we reach the agreement that will make its implementation acceptable to all the Member States."
"Mr President, as the Commission has got nowhere with these further negotiations, it has manoeuvred itself into an utterly indefensible position on the leghold trap regulation."
"Not only has it defied Parliament but it has also defied the Council of Ministers which is truly breathtaking."
"In the interest of unfettered free trade, the Commission seriously expects the European Union to lie down and effectively chew off its own leg just as 600 000 fur-bearing animals caught in these barbaric legholds do every year in Canada so that fashionable women in Europe can wear fur coats, and the fur trade and the Canadian Government can continue to make millions of dollars."
"These are the traps that the Canadian Government does not agree are cruel."
"It all started with the tuna/dolphin issue when trade won over environmental needs."
"Now the Commission is prepared to sacrifice what some may feel is the soft option - furry animals - both on leghold traps and in the cosmetic industry, in the hope of winning free trade trade-offs."
"Well, it won't do!"
"This WTO business is getting completely out of control and so is the Commission."
"The so-called draft agreement on the leghold trap with Canada and Russia represents not so much a compromise but a suicide note."
"For instance, Article 13 says: ' No party may impose trade-restrictive measures on fur and fur products originating from any other party' ."
"That makes a complete mockery of our legislation!"
"Faced with the stubborn refusal of Canada to stop the use of leghold traps, the Commission, ignoring its mandate from its masters in Europe, has simply said: ' O.K. keep on with your cruelty and we will keep buying your furs - everything is fine!'"
"More than 60 nations world-wide, including of course, the European Union, have banned the use of the leghold trap so there is no unfair domestic advantage to the European Union here."
"Furthermore, Article 20 of GATT contains the perfectly adequate defence of an import ban under measures which are acceptable if they are necessary to protect public morals."
"These public morals need protection."
"Civilized nations cannot put up with sacrificing public decency and environmental imperatives on the altar of free-trade."
"There have to be some limits and the leghold regulation sets down the limit that we want implemented in this particular case."
"We want a little backbone from the Commission."
"Mr President, I am sorry but once again Sir Leon Brittan is hiding behind his colleagues on the Commission, who are not to blame, in that he is not appearing here today to discuss something for which he has sole responsibility."
"The speech by Commissioner Papoutsis - and I hope he does not take this as a personal attack because it was not his speech but Leon Brittan's speech - is a set of lies."
"First of all, the 1991 Regulation is still in effect and it has not been revoked by any legal act approved by the European Parliament or by the Council."
"The Commission has not implemented it and the Commission has actually suspended it by means of a letter by two Directors General."
"This is not admissible in legal terms."
"Secondly, Sir Leon Brittan, the 1996 Regulation - which as has already been said here today was presented by the Commission - was rejected at first reading by the European Parliament which voted against the Commission's proposals."
"The Council of Ministers did not follow this up and it has not approved the common position, as it is so far away from the Commission's position."
"The third lie, Commissioner, is when you said that the agreement reached with Canada was in keeping with the Council's terms of reference."
"Yet the same Council, on 9 December last, specifically said in its decision that the agreement with Canada was not in compliance with the terms of reference which it had awarded."
"Stop lying, Sir Leon Brittan!"
"We can discuss the substance of this."
"What I cannot accept is that you should come here and play with democratically elected parliamentarians whose duty it is to control the legitimacy of the decisionmaking process."
"This is a question of substance and it is also a question of the respect for institutions."
"I am offended by the way in which the Commissioner comes here and lies to us!"
"Finally I should like to put two questions: as Mr Collins said, what is the legal basis which has been given to these agreements with Canada and Russia?"
"Is the Commission trying to replace the co-operation process with a process of simply consulting the European Parliament?"
"What does the Commission really want?"
"Does it want to exclude the European Parliament!"
"And finally where is the money for scientific research, and for finding more humane methods of trapping animals?"
"Mr President, I shall not repeat the sad history of this dossier."
"Ken Collins, Carlos Pimenta have traced it admirably."
"Our group fully agrees with you and yet I must say that in view of the brief reply from the Commissioner it would appear that commercial interests are far more important than animal welfare and democratic principles."
"He said that if we had put it through we would have had serious problems in the field of economic relations and trade interests."
"That is the wrong starting point if there is a 1991 directive which says that animal welfare should take precedence over trade interests, and the Commissioner and the whole of the Commission is ignoring that."
"I consider the role played by the Commission in this straightforward leg trap affair is highly suspect."
"The Commission acted against the will of the European Council of Ministers, against the will of the European Parliament."
"All of us, both the Council of Ministers and the Parliament, wanted an import ban on fur from countries which still allowed the leg trap."
"This Commission decision goes against all earlier agreements; Commissioner, you and your colleagues should have another look at the videos, and they you will see just how cruelly these animals are captured."
"This is not a resolution or an opinion from Parliament against hunting, but it is against a cruel method of capture."
"We hope, now that the Commission is threatening to forget about an import ban and planning to enter into an empty free-wheeling agreement with fur exporting countries, that the European Council of Ministers will act quickly to make an import ban effective for the European Union and correct the ways of the European Commission."
"Mr President, for the past two years this House has been fighting a Commission to bring about an import ban on fur which has been obtained by means of the leg hold trap."
"We reel from one surprise to another."
"First of all the regulation is postponed and now a compromise is proposed that really cannot be understood as a compromise."
"The Commission has managed to threaten to take to court the only country that planned to implement the regulation at the correct time."
"How on earth is that possible?"
"Did the Commission really think that it is cleverer to present this so-called compromise, this agreement, to the Council of General Affairs rather than the Environment Council because the Council of General Affairs may listen more carefully to trade arguments and less to animal welfare?"
"It is quite clear that Commissioner Brittan won a victory here over Commissioner Bjerregaard."
"I want to make several appeals."
"The first is to the President-in-Office of the Council of General Affairs, Mr Van Mierlo, not to accept this point on the agenda of the Council of General Affairs and to pass it on to the Environment Council where it belongs."
"Mr Van Mierlo would be compromising his colleagues and making a mockery of them if he were to accept this."
"The environment ministers, at least an overwhelming majority of them, have indicated that they are unwilling to accept this agreement."
"I also appeal urgently to the Commission to stop going along the road of the least resistance and tackle the environmental debate, the animal welfare debate and the debate on nature in the WTO context."
"For it is quite clear that that is being ignored in the WTO and that if we want to save anything here then this urgent question must be put on the agenda where we must win the day."
"I have received a motion for a resolution tabled under paragraph 5 of Rule 40 of the Rules of Procedure."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following the Commissioner's reply, I should like to say that I very much welcome the fact that Mr Collins has raised this oral question at this particular time."
"Since we have only an incomplete knowledge of the results of the negotiations between the EU, Canada and Russia, on the subject of which many critical voices have been raised, it is high time that the Commission kept Parliament comprehensively informed."
"I am rather surprised at the length of time it take for this House to be to some extent informed about the draft agreement, whereas lobbyists and other groups have the complete texts of agreements made available to them."
"In this respect - and thank you, Mr President, for having already given an indication in this direction - Parliament should use the resolution that we are about to adopt as a means of giving a signal."
"I also support the objectives contained in the motion for a resolution that has been tabled, in which the emphasis is placed on attitudes towards leghold traps."
"Traps that are cruel to animals must be made to disappear, and on a worldwide basis."
"Other traps may be used only if they are not cruel to animals."
"That must be the guiding principle."
"All we need to do in order to proceed further is to refer to Mr Pimenta's report from last year, which tackled the many and various aspects of this problem, in other words, prohibiting traps that are cruel to animals, developing international standards for humane traps, taking into consideration the special role and situation of indigenous peoples, and clarifying the trade-policy aspects."
"At the same time, I should like to warn against the possibility of achieving precisely the opposite effect by acting too ambitiously."
"As a negative example, I would simply refer you to the case of Brent Spar, where incorrect information resulted in a great loss of credibility."
"In my opinion, the activities of the past week, and the heap of paper that landed on Members' desks, was over the top."
"I really don't have anything against lobbyists, but in the interests of the case itself we need a more balanced argument."
"We shall only succeed in getting the countries concerned to alter their behaviour if we can appear credible to their people."
"This applies initially to the indigenous peoples, who are the ones who are directly affected."
"We must also take into consideration the special characteristics of their cultures and, when we have processed the results, we should draw the appropriate conclusions."
"Mr President, in this Parliament, I am one of those who belong to the Working Party on Hunting, and I also represent the protection of animals, because I am convinced that a true huntsman, a true hunter, is also a protector of animals at the same time."
"As such a man, I should like to thank Mr Collins with all my heart, for having brought up the question of these inhumane traps again."
"I have been a Member of this Parliament for 18 years now, and I can tell you that this has been going on throughout the whole of that time, and I regret to have to say that on the Commission's side there have repeatedly been manoeuvres to postpone and obscure the issue, so that it has not been possible for us finally to take a clear decision."
"We have, admittedly, taken some decisions, but then these have not been implemented, for which various excuses have been given."
"Here I should like to place special emphasis on one point in particular: there has been a lot of reference to humane traps."
"Perhaps it is possible to make such traps, but the sort of traps that are currently described as humane, at least in the press, are almost as inhumane as the previous kind."
"The fact that you cover the traps with a bit of rubber makes no difference at all to an animal's legs."
"The tragedy is that the animals, especially in Canada, sometimes have to live in the traps for days, in horrific circumstances."
"I believe, therefore, that we have an absolute duty to make the Commission seriously aware of the fact that now, finally, we want to see actions, not words."
"What I mean is that we should not go to New Orleans, and heaven only knows where else, but that we should finally take action, on our side."
"I know that there is major resistance, but then resistance exists in order to be overcome."
"I would therefore ask the Commission - and I have also just agreed with the Böge motion, because I considered it right to issue it with an ultimatum - to pay attention, because our patience is slowly running out."
"Mr Pimenta has the floor for a personal statement."
"Mr President, half true is as bad as a lie."
"The Council of the Representatives of the Member States rejected in January the list of countries which the Commission wanted because the Commission had included Canada and Russia even with a preamble saying that it was provisional."
"Please Mr Papoutsis it is not your fault."
"You do not know the details."
"Do not try to protect someone that does not deserve protection."
"Mr President, first of all I want to say that I am not trying to protect anybody."
"I am trying to defend the authority and decisions of the European Commission, and as you know, the Commission takes collective decisions and is judged by all the other institutional bodies and subjected to parliamentary control on the basis of those collective decisions."
"As for the list of specific countries, as I told you earlier, the Commission submitted it to the Council."
"The Member States did not agree, and from that standpoint, we are delaying not through any fault of the Commission's, but because of the Council's inability to reach a decision."
"Secondly, as for the Council's instructions you referred to, which were given to the Commission which followed them to the letter, please let me, Mr President, include in Parliament's Minutes the Council's Minutes, which I will hand in to your Secretariat."
"Thank you very much, Mr Commissioner."
"The vote will now be taken."
"I will be supporting the resolution demanding that the Commission implement the wishes of Parliament and ban the import of furs caught by use of the leghold trap."
"It is not acceptable that the dogma of free trade be allowed to override the issue of animal welfare."
"Leghold traps are the cruellest punishment that can be administered to an animal."
"As we saw this week, animals in pain attempt to chew off their own legs to escape the pain."
"The European Union and almost sixty other countries have banned the use of the leghold trap."
"There is absolutely no reason, absolutely no justification, why we should allow in the interests of free trade that the Canadians and Russians import furs into the Union that would be illegal if trapped here."
"The Commission should follow the wishes of Parliament, the Council and, most important, the overwhelming majority of the general public in Europe and ban these cruel imports which merely allow fashionable men and women to exhibit their inhumanity to animals."
"Mr President, I find it remarkable that, in voting against amendment no. 3, certain facts were denied, but I will now address these."
"I will vote against the proposed resolution because I am convinced that an unthinking repetition of the demand for implementation of the enactment provisions for the issuing of an import ban on furs would get in the way of using the route of negotiation in order to achieve a system which, in the long run, would do more for animal welfare, because what we are dealing with here is the trapping of animals in Canada, the USA, Russia and the EU, where millions of animals are constantly being caught by means of traps."
"But we are far from fulfilling the requirements we are laying down in the regulations."
"Leghold traps are banned publicly in the EU, but this does not apply to private land, and they can be bought, with instructions for use, on the European Parliament's doorstep."
"Traps are mostly used to catch pests, and an import ban on skins will not act as any incentive to stop the use of traps for this purpose."
"Through negotiation, however, we can ban all forms of cruel traps, to the benefit of the animals concerned."
"I know that, before the regulations were adopted, an abortive attempt was made to negotiate, but this does not mean that the present negotiations would suffer the same fate."
"The negotiations which the Commission has started with Canada, the USA and Russia are the first international agreement to focus on animal welfare."
"Let us not jeopardize this, destroying the basis for these negotiations, by bringing a WTO action which could go on for years, without in any way promoting animal welfare."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Genetically modified maize"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following oral questions to the Commission:"
"B4-0003/97 by Mrs Breyer and Mr Lannoye, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament, on the marketing of genetically modified maize; -B4-0005/97 by Mr des Places, on behalf of the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations, on the placing on the market of genetically modified maize; -B4-0012/97 by Mr Pasty, on behalf of the Group Union for Europe on genetically modified organisms; -B4-0013/97 by Mrs González Álvarez, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, on the request for a moratorium on the entry of genetically modified maize into the European Union; -B4-0014/97, by Mrs Barthet-Mayer and Mr Kouchner, on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance, on the placing on the market of genetically modified maize; -B4-0015/97, by Mrs Roth-Behrendt, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the placing on the market of genetically modified maize: authorization procedure; -B4-0016/97, by Mrs Grossetête on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, on the placing on the market of genetically modified maize.Mr Lannoye has the floor for a point of order."
"Mr President, on behalf of my group, I should like to ask for the debate to be postponed pursuant to Rule 131 of the Rules of Procedure, paragraphs 1 and 2, and for it to be held on the Monday of the March part-session, 10 March, as the first item on the agenda."
"Why do I ask for this postponement?"
"It was noted just now that Sir Leon Brittan was not here for the important debate that we have just had."
"I note that for the present debate, which is at least equally important if not more so, on genetically modified maize Mr Papoutsis is representing the Commission."
"We have absolutely nothing against Mr Papoutsis personally, but it is clear that Mrs Bjerregaard should have been here."
"Apart from the fact that we are going to hold the debate under somewhat unfavourable conditions, at the end of a Friday morning and with very few Members present, we have a Commissioner who is unfamiliar with the subject -and I intend absolutely no criticism of him personally."
"So, I repeat, pursuant to Rule 131, I ask for a postponement until 10 March, as the first item on the agenda."
"Mr Lannoye, I have looked up Rule 131 and you have the perfect right to make that request."
"But allow me to give you two pieces of advice: first, Mr Lannoye, Friday is a working day as worthy as any other and, therefore, I think it is a sign of respect to all the Members who are here to regard it as such."
"The second point is that no commitment can be made at this time about the agenda in the next part-session. That is a matter which depends entirely and exclusively on the preparation of the agenda."
"What we can do now is decide to adjourn the joint debate."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we will therefore listen to one opinion in favour and one against and then we will put it to the vote."
"Mr Lannoye, you have the floor."
"Mr President, I am no great expert on the Rules of Procedure, but I can read and I note that Rule 131 (1) states that a political group may move that a debate be adjourned to a specific date."
"That is what I have done."
"The 'specific date' is Monday 10 March, as the first item on the agenda for the March part-session."
"This seems to me to be in accordance with the Rules of Procedure."
"I will certainly take up your point and pass it on to the Conference of Presidents which in principle determines the agenda, as you know, and I am sure it will take account of your argument, but the Chair cannot make any commitment now."
"Mr von Habsburg has the floor to speak against Mr Lannoye's proposal."
"Mr President, I should like to say that I am totally opposed to Mr Lannoye's motion, not because it is not justified rhetorically, but because it will simply mean ruining Friday as a working day."
"We were elected to serve our constituents, regardless of whether they are many or few in number."
"Here at least, quality is a substitute for quantity."
"We have often found this to be the case, and I would therefore ask Members to vote against it whatever happens."
"I should like to thank the President for having said the same thing."
"Friday is just as much a working day as any other."
"Thank you very much, Mr von Habsburg."
"The Chair would never want to influence a vote."
"I understood that the reasons Mr Lannoye gave went way beyond the fact that this is Friday."
"So in this case, I - who always advocate dignifying every working day, including Friday - would not want any vote to be influenced from the Chair."
"The Chair must be absolutely neutral when it comes to a vote, up to the point that, in general, it does not even cast its own vote."
"Mrs Pailler has the floor to support Mr Lannoye's proposal."
"Mr President, I think this is a particularly important debate, following the casting of 118 votes in favour of censuring the Commission on a very closely related subject."
"We should therefore like the Commissioners responsible for the matter to be present and we should like there to be enough people here for this debate to be as dignified and serious as it deserves to be."
"Yesterday, Mr Caccavale asked, for completely obscure reasons, although there were plenty of people in the Chamber, for his report to be postponed, and I believe that no one took umbrage at that."
"Well, that was Thursday, and his report was postponed."
"I don't see why we can't have the courage to postpone a subject as important as this to a time when more Members will be present, together with the Commission and perhaps even the Council."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Pailler."
"I shall now put the request to adjourn the joint debate to the vote."
"(Parliament approved the request) Mr Ford has the floor for a point of order."
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"I presume that the list of speakers is closed, so that those Members who did not think it important enough to stay here this morning will not suddenly decide that this is an absolutely fascinating issue when it is on a Monday evening!"
"Can you confirm that the list of speakers is closed?"
"Mr Ford, you are well aware, because you are a very important member of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, that the list will be opened again for the debate so that those Members of Parliament who wish to take part can do so."
"Mr Rübig has the floor on a point of order."
"Mr President, I find it irresponsible that such an important debate should be postponed."
"That is not a point of order Mr Rübig."
"It is a personal opinion - and a very respectable one - but it is not a point of order."
"Parliament has made the decision freely by a vote which is final in a democracy."
"The Presidency is obliged to respect the majority will of Parliament."
"Adjournment of the session"
"Ladies and gentlemen, once again I have had the agreeable duty of chairing these exemplary Friday sittings."
"I hope you all have a relaxing weekend and, once again, let me thank all the services of Parliament for their work and you, ladies and gentlemen, for making it so easy and agreeable to chair this sitting."
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"(The sitting was closed at 11.30 a.m.)"
"Resumption of session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 21 February 1997."
"Communication and statement by the President"
"I have to inform you that last Friday I sent a telegram of condolences to the parents of the little girl, Lubna Benaisa, whose body had been discovered the previous day in the city of Brussels."
"I did so on my own behalf and on behalf of all Members in the sure knowledge that I was expressing the feelings and sadness of the whole Parliament at this further barbarous act perpetrated against those who are most vulnerable."
"May I also say how touched I was at the splendid example of dignity and unity shown both by the Benaisa family and by the entire population of Brussels."
"I should not like such an important occasion as International Women's Day, which was last Saturday, to pass by without some mention in Parliament."
"The celebration of International Women's Day has become incorporated in the political calendar as a major event."
"It is a day for considering the progress made in the building of a fairer society with greater solidarity, a day for setting objectives, for continuing to move towards the full integration of women in all areas of life on an equal footing with men."
"At times such as these, when unemployment figures have reached record levels in some Member States, those principles need to be reiterated; we need to take a stand against exclusion and avoid any backsliding in the timid progress achieved."
"This year the celebration of International Women's Day coincided with a key moment: the Intergovernmental Conference for revision of the Treaties setting up the Union."
"The Conference is taking stock of various positions, already setting the guidelines for the new texts on which the development of the Union will be based in the future."
"The building of Europe has played a leading role in the slow process of breaking down the historical barriers between women and of the labour sector."
"The Treaty needs however to incorporate more global plans forming the basis of an equal opportunities policy and specifically to include some mention of positive measures against discrimination."
"The proposals contained in the text which the Irish Presidency prepared are a very important step in this direction."
"Parliament will see that they are consolidated and incorporated in the new treaty."
"However, we do not need to wait for the results of the Intergovernmental Conference to continue with the building of a legal framework which is better tailored to promoting equality of opportunity."
"To this end great importance must be attached to the development of Community legislation."
"The proposal for a Council Directive on the burden of proof in sex-discrimination cases is the cornerstone of the new system of legal protection."
"I think the Union's institutions should set an example, as pointed out in Mrs Larive's report adopted last autumn; the European civil service is an ideal field for putting into practice an ambitious equal opportunities policy enabling women to be involved in the highest levels of decision making."
"Although the European Parliament is the institution with the highest percentage of women in its higher administrative grades, the figure is barely 20 %."
"Efficient administration cannot allow this inequality."
"It is not, however, merely a question of percentages."
"We need to change attitudes, review the procedure for entry into the European civil service, offer occupational training programmes opening up new horizons for mobility and provide real opportunities for both women and men to pursue a career and have a family."
"Last Friday I met representatives from the European Women's lobby and a delegation from the Joint Committee on Equal Opportunities from our institution, who put to me a series of specific proposals for furthering the building of a society with greater solidarity and a more efficient administration."
"I undertook to work within the framework of my office to achieve those objectives."
"I know I can count on your firm support for that."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, I am naturally very grateful to you for having made this surprising statement and for the fact that you are so well informed about the dossiers that are currently with the Committee on Women's Rights."
"I would like with you to refer back to this 8 March in the knowledge that the statement that would be issued by the Commission and its president presented difficulties in connection with the important dossiers that we have put on the agenda this morning."
"As the chairman of the Committee on Women's Rights I defer to that, and I am grateful to you for having begun this sitting by referring back to 8 March."
"You mentioned a number of things which are still causing a host of serious problems, such as the preparation of the intergovernmental conference and the proposals laid before it by the Irish presidency."
"I do not want to disappoint you, of course, but in the area of women's rights the Dutch presidency is also having a go at sifting out a number of these issues."
"The anti-discrimination paragraph is one case in point."
"Mr President, I am particularly pleased that you are prepared to place your hand on your heart and to concede that in the European institutions, including the European Parliament, there are far too few women in senior posts. And because you have stated that so clearly I assume that over the next two and a half years you will, among other things, take the opportunity to make drastic changes to Parliament's recruitment and promotion procedures, in order that women, too, can be afforded the chance to make a career."
"I hope that in April, in the presence, then, of the Commission and Mr Santer, we shall be able to speak together about women's issues on a broader front."
"I thank you for this statement."
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr Hory, I thank you personally, but I think I must allow those who have asked to speak to do so."
"Mr President, on behalf of our group I have written to you to congratulate you on your stance, and I must point out that all of our French Members were at your reception in Paris and that they have joined with the rest of our group in agreeing with your stance."
"I confirm that to you now."
"This subject was also discussed, I believe, in the Conference of Presidents. When we discuss urgent subjects in this House, we must ensure that we do so in a representative manner."
"You have emphasized - and I will say it myself - that the topical and urgent debate must occupy a more favourable position in the part-session."
"I can only endorse your words, Mr President, and say, on behalf of my group, that we are in full agreement with you on that."
"Mr President, I am pleased that we are all taking the opportunity to speak even though we are making the same points, because it already became clear last Thursday that all groups were unanimous. In the case of my group I expressed the view of all Members who thought that you had upheld the European Parliament's position splendidly in Paris and that your action in no way constituted interference in sovereignty or in the domestic policy of any country - in this case France - but rather that you had stood up for some of the citizens' basic rights on which the European Parliament is obliged to pronounce."
"You fulfilled your obligation and fulfilled it very well, as all chairmen of Groups in this House agree."
"Keep to this course, Mr President, with this prudence and this strength."
"Mr President, I too should like to express my thanks, and my belief that you were right to react immediately because the whole incident really was quite incredible."
"The European Parliament conducted an intensive debate on racism and xenophobia, and then did something that sets it apart from a good many governments: instead of confining itself to formal declarations, it actually expressed unwelcome criticism, directed not just at the Debré draft law but also at the plans announced by the German Interior Minister, Mr Kanther, to introduce visas for children."
"So the European Parliament did what it is supposed to do - a political act."
"The reaction of the French Government in saying first that questions of human rights and fundamental freedoms within the European Union are a matter of internal affairs, as Mr Chirac and Mr Hervé de Charette stated, and secondly that the European Parliament has shown that it is superfluous, is completely unacceptable to us."
"My view is that by adopting this resolution the European Parliament showed that it is anything but superfluous - that it is capable of a political reaction and of doing more than just coining formal phrases."
"I would like to ask you, too, whether there has been any reaction from the French Government."
"Has there been any kind of apology for what the Foreign Minister said?"
"I think an apology is the least that could have been expected."
"Has Mr Chirac commented at all on his remarks?"
"If you have heard of any such developments, I hope you will let us know."
"Thank you very much, Mr Roth."
"I regard the matter as closed and I therefore naturally did not think that any kind of public apology was needed, especially since Mr Hervé de Charette, when addressing the French Assemblée Nationale, expressed his respect for the European Parliament."
"What is more, I shall very probably be meeting Mr de Charette in Rome within the next few weeks to deal, of course, with the most important topics which are of interest to this Parliament and to the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Mr President, I refer to the Minutes of 20 February."
"I have noted an omission in the verbatim report in connection with the resolution on the human rights meeting in Geneva."
"I refer in particular to what was said concerning China. I urged the delegation from the United States Congress which was present in the gallery at the time to speak up for human rights in China in line with our established values."
"I cannot find this in the verbatim report, Mr President, and I hope that a correction can be made."
"Mrs van Bladel, we shall check to see whether part of a speech or of a resolution has in fact been omitted from the Minutes."
"Mr President, I want to return for a moment to the question raised by Mr Hory, though unlike him I do not want to initiate a Franco-French debate, which would be inappropriate. I wanted to ask you whether this incident might serve as a basis for a number of positive conclusions regarding the holding of our topical and urgent debates."
"Those debates were instituted in 1979, at a time when this Parliament did not yet hold all the powers it holds today, especially the legislative powers, when it was trying to establish itself as a kind of forum."
"As a result of the way in which our proceedings have developed, these topical and urgent debates have now been put back to a period of the part-session such as to cast doubt on the representativity of the House and even the object of certain resolutions that are adopted, as you have said yourself. Even apart from that problem, there are numerous questions about the admissibility of texts and particularly the admissibility of amendments, especially last-minute amendments."
"It is customary, for example, not to raise in a topical and urgent debate a question that has been debated by Parliament in connection with the preparation of a report."
"The holding of the Intergovernmental Conference raises a serious question about relations between our Parliament and the national parliaments."
"Is it reasonable that questions that have been debated but not yet settled by the national parliaments can be settled by the device of an urgent resolution, which in fact means with no prior report?"
"That, Mr President, is the kind of question, a troubling one in every way, which must be asked in the wake of this incident, and I should be very grateful if you would refer the matter to the Bureau and the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities, so that we can have a procedure for topical and urgent debates which will not give rise to this kind of controversy and will not involve you in another incident of this kind."
"Thank you very much, Mr Nordmann, but I would remind you that any Group is entitled to raise this question with the Conference of Presidents if it thinks that is what is needed."
"In any event, I shall inform the Conference of Presidents of what you said and they will consider it as they think necessary."
"Mr President, on 17 February a letter arrived at my office in The Hague which read as follows: ' By order of the President I hereby forward to you the text of a motion of censure on the Commission tabled by 63 Members pursuant to Article 34 of the Rules of Procedure.'"
"This letter, Mr President, thus had to do with the motion of censure on the Commission that we were due to vote on in Strasbourg that same week."
"My problem is not with the letter itself, but rather with the way in which it was sent to me."
"It was sent to the Netherlands by courier from Brussels at midday on Friday, and I assume that it was sent to the homes of all of the other Members as well."
"In my case it arrived when I was already in Strasbourg."
"My question is this: what was the point of the procedure?"
"Secondly, how much did the procedure cost? To send a letter to 626 Members by courier, when we all have fax machines at our offices in both Brussels and Strasbourg, is a bit of a waste of money, surely."
"Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, I am very pleased to answer your question."
"The letter was not sent to the 626 Members, but to those for whom Parliament did not have a fax number."
"All Members - and there are many of them - who have provided the administration with their fax number received a fax to the same effect."
"Mr President, you mentioned just now the unanimous support of all the groups for the position you adopted during your visit to Paris."
"I must ask you to note that this unanimity cannot include the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations."
"You did indeed do what a president of the European Parliament logically must do, and reflected the will of the majority."
"Nevertheless, I would remind all those who make ringing declarations on the importance of Parliament's activities that this famous - and umpteenth - resolution on racism and xenophobia was adopted on that memorable Thursday afternoon by 106 votes to 101, and that in actual fact, by expressing its opinion as it does on Thursday afternoons about a more and more varied and less and less carefully considered range of subjects, the European Parliament undermines its own credibility."
"What the French Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Hervé de Charette, said merely echoed what might be thought by any objective observer of the European Parliament who studies the content of its resolutions."
"The fact is that Parliament sees fit to express an opinion on any subject at all."
"It did so that afternoon, despite the fact that a national parliament, which is the expression of State sovereignty, the incarnation of democratic legitimation, the representative of an entire national population, was debating that issue."
"It did so although it had no jurisdiction in the matter."
"The position expressed, you should know, reflects the point of view of a great many European citizens."
"I believe, Mr President, that we should learn another lesson from this incident, as well as the one pointed out by Mr Nordmann, which I endorse. We should ensure that texts that appear on Thursday afternoon's agenda are carefully prepared and concern Parliament's areas of responsibility."
"In following the procedure you know about, especially on the occasion of the visit here by the French Head of State, Parliament will have encouraged several countries, including France, to refuse to extend the powers of a Parliament that does not deserve them."
"Mr Fabre-Aubrespy, I am not going to comment on the substance of your speech, which I respect as I would any other."
"I must, however, call your attention to the fact that there is no provision in our Rules of Procedure authorizing Parliament, or anyone else, to declare texts inadmissible in substance."
"It is the political groups that must ensure that these texts are introduced, or voted upon, in a manner consistent with the dignity of Parliament or with the criteria that each group finds appropriate."
"Unlike other parliaments, which - legitimately - confine their agendas to items introduced there by governments, our Parliament has a different tradition and the Presidency cannot limit amendments, whatever they may be!"
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, I would like first of all to congratulate you on your wonderful statement with regard to the celebration of International Women's Day."
"In that context I would like once again to draw the attention of the House to the ongoing plight of Roisín McAliskey, a prisoner held in a British gaol, Holloway Prison; who is held in Category A status; whose status has been reduced slightly in the last number of days; but who is seven months pregnant and does not have full access to proper, 24-hour medical care."
"As well as that, there are still no arrangements to ensure the safe delivery of her unborn child."
"I ask this House - we pleaded last time and we plead once again - to show its support on humanitarian grounds; not to make any judgement on whether Miss McAliskey is guilty or innocent, but purely on humanitarian grounds to call on the British and German Governments to give her full access to proper medical treatment and to ensure that her child can be born in normal circumstances, without her being shackled to prison officers, and that she will be allowed to keep her child after the birth."
"I would point out that the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs is dealing with the matter you mentioned and will be submitting appropriate proposals to the House."
"Thank you very much for that, Mr Provan."
"Mr President, I should like to speak on Item 16 of the Minutes, ' Genetically modified maize' ."
"During our last part-session, the various oral questions relating to this subject were put back to a later date, specifically the present part-session, according to the Members present, at any event."
"I note that the Minutes give no reason for the postponement of that report."
"The Members felt that the Commission was not represented by a sufficiently knowledgeable person - neither Mr Fischler nor Mrs Bonino nor Mrs Bjerregaard saw fit to attend that debate, and yet it was a very important debate on an essential question, a question that may become more serious in future years and, who knows, give rise at some stage to a repetition of the mad cow crisis."
"I therefore believe it to be essential, Mr President, for the Minutes to show why a postponement of this debate was requested."
"That is not necessary in principle, Mr Berthu, but we will check. The reason will appear in the verbatim report, in the speeches made by the various honourable Members, which will clearly show the reasoning of those who proposed the postponement."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Order of business"
"The next item is the order of business."
"The final version of the agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents pursuant to Rule 95 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed; the following amendments have been proposed or incorporated:"
"Monday: I suggest, in agreement with the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment, that we reverse the order of the two reports by that Committee."
"That is that we deal first with Mr Van Velzen's report on the Green Paper on Living and Working in the Information Society then move on to Mrs Waddington's report on the Commission's White Paper on Education and Training - Teaching and Learning."
"Are there any comments?"
"(The order of business was adopted)"
"Tuesday: The Green Group has asked for the joint debate on the six oral questions to the Commission on geneticallymodified maize, which was postponed last Friday, 21 February, to be added to the agenda either for Tuesday evening or for Thursday afternoon."
"I would mention that the Conference of Presidents has decided to include this topic in the April part-session."
"I call upon Mrs Breyer."
"Mr President, we asked for this to be postponed last time because the Commissioner with overall responsibility, Mrs Bjerregaard, thought it unnecessary to be present for this important item on the agenda."
"As you know, there has been a great deal of controversy about the approval of genetically modified maize, and some alarming studies have now been produced which confirm that there is a grave health and ecological risk."
"Because of that risk, both Austria and Luxembourg adopted regulations in mid-February to ban imports."
"We were unanimous that it cannot be right for just two countries to protect their populations; we must debate the matter here in Parliament and clarify our position on these disregarded studies and the authorization of this product. Even within the Commission there were those who asserted that this decision was taken on the basis of an economic debate, on the basis of the interests of the genetic engineering industry and the USA, and that the question of health risks had been pushed into the background."
"So we regard it as a matter of urgency for this debate to be held before the end of this month."
"Why?"
"If those products come onto the market now, there could be problems if we conclude, in April for example, that the granting of the application to market them was inadmissible, because by that time the products would already be on the market in every European Member State except Luxembourg and Austria."
"So I would ask you once again to arrange for a roll-call vote on our request, so that this extremely important matter can be debated during the present week."
"Mr President, I do not know whether the interpretation into Greek conveyed exactly what you said, but I have noted a particular point several times because it creates confusion: it is not the Conference of Presidents that makes decisions."
"The Conference of Presidents can only propose a decision to Parliament."
"There is a difference."
"It is Parliament that decides."
"I should like to ask that the point should be noted, to avoid misunderstandings."
"I put the green Group's request to the vote."
"(Parliament rejected the request)"
"Wednesday and Thursday (unaltered)"
"Friday:"
"Mr President, I notice there is an item on the agenda relating to the organization of the common market in rice."
"To my knowledge, although it was in the working document, it was never discussed in the Conference of Presidents."
"Frankly, my group is not in favour of placing it on the agenda for this week."
"We would prefer that it was deferred until April."
"So I would ask you to put that to the House, because I think other group leaders will confirm that there was no agreement on the matter in the Conference of Presidents."
"The other item concerns Wednesday evening."
"You will see that one of the last reports on Wednesday evening is the Linkohr report."
"This is a second reading."
"If it is not taken on Wednesday - as you know, things can sometimes crop up - can we be assured that it will be dealt with first thing on Thursday morning, since it must be voted on by lunchtime Thursday?"
"As regards the last point, Mrs Green, it is no problem to continue the debate on Thursday morning if it does not end on Wednesday."
"That does not entail any change in the agenda."
"As for the first point you mentioned, it is no trouble to put to the House the request you are making on behalf of your Group to delete from Friday's agenda Item 42, oral question to the Commission on the serious crisis in the rice sector tabled by Mr Fraga Estévez, Mr Colino Salamanca, Mr Fantuzzi and others on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"Mr President, I want to say that we agree to the request made by the spokesman for the Socialist Group."
"I have consulted some of those who signed the oral question and they fully agree that it should be debated in the April part-session."
"I put to the vote the Socialist Group's request to postpone until April the debate on the oral question on the crisis in the rice sector."
"(Parliament agreed to the request)"
"Mr President, I should like to take advantage of this unanimous vote, which has altered Friday's agenda in a sensible way, to ask you and the Conference of Presidents to review a situation that has remained unchanged at the last three or four part-sessions, whereby agricultural topics have regularly been taken on Fridays, often as the last item on the agenda."
"Apparently, that decision was a deliberate one, so as to encourage better attendance on Fridays."
"Given that this objective does not seem to me to have been achieved, I would ask you - and I believe that I am speaking for many of my colleagues in the Committee on Agriculture - to restore agricultural items to more popular days of the week, in order to ensure that such items receive the attention they deserve, starting with this serious problem of rice."
"Thank you very much, Mr Santini."
"I think that all the members of the Conference of Presidents are here, will have got your message and will take acount of it as they deem appropriate in their decision making."
"(Parliament approved the Agenda thus amended)"
"Future of Schengen"
"The next item is the debate on the report by Mrs van Lancker (A4-0014/97) on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs on the functioning and future of Schengen."
"Mr President, I can imagine that if Mr Fabre-Aubrespy was still here he would be likely to say that this Parliament has no business discussing Schengen. In my opinion, however, this report on Schengen comes at a particularly crucial time."
"At a time, that is to say, when the future of Schengen and the importance of bringing Schengen back to where it belongs, namely to the Treaty, are being discussed in the framework of the IGC."
"Schengen has always been presented as a testing ground for a future regulation. However, that European regulation cannot be more than a refined copy of the model, even though improvements need to be made on very many points."
"The fact, ladies and gentlemen, that in the absence of a European consensus the Schengen countries are putting in place their own measures to guarantee the right of the free movement of persons and the right of security of their residents is, in my view, a good thing."
"The criticism of this Parliament is targeted, specifically, at the way in which those goals are being pursued."
"Firstly, Schengen has strayed very greatly from its original goal: of the creation, that is to say, of a large European area in which people can move freely."
"In practice, the governments are imposing more and more conditions on the free movement of persons."
"For nearly two years, ladies and gentlemen, the French government has insisted on maintaining its internal border checks."
"Moreover, the arguments for that are all good ones: GIA terrorists could slip in through Belgium, Holland makes provision for drug-takers, and, tomorrow, Italy will no longer to able to keep the lid on illegal immigration."
"Obviously, national sovereignty still counts for more than international cooperation."
"But other Member States, too, are using Schengen as a pretext for policy measures which are often repressive, particularly with regard to undesirable aliens, migrants and refugees."
"According to the Schengen annual report, the Schengen information system has been used principally as a database on undesirable aliens."
"Refugees are increasingly being refused entry at the external frontiers and airports."
"And Schengen itself is erecting a second barrier around the territory it covers, without any guarantee that the right of refugees to request asylum and to nonrefoulement can be honoured."
"With Schengen one is embracing a perilous notion. The notion, that is to say, that anti-immigration policy equates with a higher level of security."
"Even so, this Parliament has said time and again that organized international crime cannot be combated merely by keeping a tight check at the frontiers."
"At the same time, police cooperation, which is essential in the battle against crime, is pitifully inadequate."
"The police are making hardly any use of Schengen. Only the minor bilateral arrangements in the border regions are beginning to bring a few small successes with the cooperation of France - where Schengen is not functioning at all - despite the cynical reality."
"In the meantime, the Schengen labyrinth is ensuring that daily practice is generating a dangerous grey area of personal contacts between police forces over which there is absolutely no democratic and judicial control. Schengen must therefore shift its priorities as a matter of urgency."
"Secondly, this Parliament has frequently complained about the lack of parliamentary and judicial control."
"This report makes clear yet again that most national parliaments have scant information and are prevented from exercising control over their ministers for Schengen affairs by statutory obstacles."
"Judicial supervision of Schengen is minimal because the European Court of Justice has no competence at all; disputes arising from interpretation of the meaning of Schengen clauses are resolved by national judges and by the Executive Committee."
"Frequently that leads to a huge level of discord."
"That apart, the whole business of international exchange and international police cooperation without international judicial and parliamentary control is a threat to democracy."
"That is why the European Parliament, in this report, is again calling for the communitization of Schengen matters, so that, ultimately, the Commission can acquire the right of initiative on questions relating to the free movement of persons and the internal security of Europe's residents and the European Court and the European Parliament can finally be allowed to play their proper roles."
"It is clear that the Irish proposals on Schengen matters, and still less the Dutch proposals, do not match our requirements."
"Indeed, the free movement of persons, as depicted in those proposals, is smothered by the whole reasoning of the preceding measures, and I can rightly say, I think, that in them the free movement of persons is relegated to the tomorrow that never comes."
"The roles of the European Parliament and the Court of Justice are neither developed fully nor actually torpedoed."
"I think that nationalization of this policy is on the agenda more than ever at this IGC, with the proposals as they now stand, and that is something that this Parliament must never allow to happen."
"Coming as it does now, this Schengen report is very important, because it insists, once again, that proper democratic and judicial control over the highly important matters of the security of the citizens and the free movement of persons can be achieved only through regulation by the European people themselves."
"I hope, therefore, that Parliament will feel able to give the report a big vote of approval."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Van Lanker."
"I should like to say a word of welcome to Mr Fischbach, Minister of Justice of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and formerly one of our colleagues, who has taken the trouble to come here to attend this debate."
"Mr President, Mr Fischbach, ladies and gentlemen, in the remarks she has just made Mrs van Lancker used a key sentence regarding the debate on freedom of movement in the European Union when she said that this debate is taking place more and more on the basis of renationalization, a dangerous renationalization to my mind because - as was also made clear in Mrs van Lancker's report - a debate is being triggered in the Union which resembles two trains approaching each other on the same track."
"We do have in the European Union, on the basis of Community law, free movement of services, capital and goods; but we do not have freedom of movement for individuals."
"On the one hand we seem to have created a Union in which we can move cows around wherever we like and in whatever condition we like, without being checked, where we can transfer money - as much as we like, for as long as we like and as often as we like and where we like; where we can transport any kind of service - take the example of the building industry - often outside the law, without being prosecuted for it. And yet a decent citizen, a Member of the European Parliament, say, wanting to travel from Germany through Luxembourg to France to come and do his job here, has to be checked every time because the French Government says it must watch its borders to ensure that no Dutch drug dealers get into the country - and that is what happens not just to the honest citizens who sit in the European Parliament but to many other people too."
"There is no escaping the impression that we have a European Union in which we can do anything we like with money, with goods and with services, but in which citizens are denied freedom of movement on the flimsiest of pretexts. Most of those pretexts are something to do with the fact that governments - and I am prepared to say so quite provocatively - are no longer able to get to grips with their problems of internal policy, whether economic or social, so that they arrange their border controls as a theatrical production in order to calm their own populations, saying in effect, ' Everything's under control on the crime front provided we have enough policemen at the borders.'"
"Just how dim do the governments of the Member States really think their own citizens are?"
"Do they really think that by disregarding Schengen they will persuade drug dealers to turn up at the border between Luxembourg and Belgium with their suitcases and wait politely to be asked if they have anything to declare?"
"Mrs van Lancker also mentions, rightly, the fact that the Schengen Information System is to be abused and employed as a defence mechanism against illegal immigration, which cannot be brought under control, incidentally, because there are still not enough people in the European Union who say frankly that we are a continent of immigration and that is why we have rules on immigration."
"Unless we ensure that the Schengen framework applies throughout the Community, then we shall experience something - I address this observation to you, Mr Fischbach, as Chairman of the Schengen Executive Committee - which the Council might like but we in Parliament would not - a situation where freedom of movement in the European Union is implemented not on the basis of Community law, which is where it should be implemented, but on the basis of inter-governmental co-operation outside Community law, at the level of bilateral treaties, the end result of which would be that the Council would say, yes, we do have freedom of movement, but we don't have it where it legally belongs."
"That is why it is indispensable for this Parliament to say today that we want freedom of movement."
"We have a very favourable attitude to the constructive elements of the Schengen Agreements, but we want a guarantee that these arrangements will have a basis in Community law with parliamentary control."
"When, on 14 June 1985, the founding countries of the Schengen area signed the agreement that bears that name, they certainly had in mind Montesquieu's words 'political freedom for a citizen is that peace of mind that comes from the opinion each man has of his own safety' ."
"When this agreement came into force in March 1995, that same philosophy was supposed to prevail."
"But certain countries soon found a few imperfections in the system."
"The Netherlands referred to their difficulties connected with passenger control at Amsterdam-Schipol airport."
"France, in turn, invoked the safeguard clause contained in Article 2 of the Convention, partly because of the failings of the Schengen Information System and the slackness regarding migration flows, and partly because of the weakness or even recklessness of certain Member States with regard to drugs."
"Today, these problems remain, though in diluted form."
"On reading Mrs van Lancker's report you could sometimes get the impression - without too much exaggeration - that the Schengen area amounts to a prison universe, that personal freedoms are under threat and that the right to freedom of movement which is a foundation of our Union no longer exists."
"That impression is incorrect."
"On the contrary, in order to breathe life into the spirit of Schengen, we need to reinforce it with essential accompanying measures, in order to construct a Europe where security and freedom go hand in hand."
"We must not forget that the Schengen Agreements, imperfect though they are, have enabled the citizens of the signatory States to understand the true meaning of the freedom of movement required by the Treaty, still a dead letter but living in the spirit of Schengen."
"That is why my group will be unable to vote for this report, without certain amendments, although I do share some of the rapporteur's concerns."
"I am thinking of the need for better co-ordination between the various bodies that will determine the success of Schengen - Europol, SIRENE, SIS - and the conformity of the handling of the databases with the conventions of the Council of Europe."
"Mr President, there is a lot of criticism that can be made of the Schengen Agreement and its execution."
"There is talk again of secret agendas and unverifiable actions by the governments; no parliamentary control, no proper judicial control, and so forth."
"Schengen must therefore be only a transitional thing. In the future we must integrate it into the European Union."
"Moreover, in the coming revision of the Maastricht Treaty we must communitize as many as possible of the matters that fall now within the ambit of Schengen."
"That means giving competence to the European Parliament - including it, that is to say - and also giving competence to the Court of Justice in this field."
"To that end the Schengen secretariat must be brought under the European Union's wing."
"My next point has to do with the Netherlands-France drugs war, as it has been aptly called."
"I think that France must now bring an end to vigilance on its northern border, as the main tenet of the Schengen Agreement so demands."
"The Dutch, on the other hand, must do more to meet foreign criticism of Dutch drugs policy."
"Rapprochement leading to European harmonization on drugs policy is what is needed."
"France must do more to help addicts and the Netherlands must do more to combat drug production and the trade in drugs. Those countries must tackle the problem together with the other Member States."
"Following the vote on the amendments we like the general tenor of Mrs Van Lancker's report and we shall therefore vote for it."
"We compliment her on her excellent work."
"Mr President, first I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on the report she is presenting here today."
"The report makes a clear, thorough and critical analysis of the functioning and future of Schengen."
"The freedom of movement of persons is one of the four freedoms to be achieved within the framework of the Treaty on European Union."
"The Schengen Agreements are dated and should be replaced by Community legislation, so that judicial control is in the hands of the Court of Justice of the European Communities and democratic control is in the hands of the European Parliament."
"As regards the functioning of the Schengen Agreements, we regret the emergence of new types of discrimination: on the one hand between citizens of the Union on grounds of nationality and on the other with regard to the citizens of third countries legally resident in the Union."
"The implementation of the Agreements also warrants some criticism, since it has led to the adoption of a series of police and legal measures based on a tightening of security and to an immigration limitation and law enforcement policy."
"The abolition of frontiers should not lead to systematic controls in frontier areas or to the hermetic sealing of the external borders."
"Finally I should like to voice my concern about the fact that the Schengen information system is used chiefly as a data bank for undesirable aliens, including foreigners with no previous criminal record or who are without means."
"In short, we must continue to move towards the freedom of movement of persons, turning the Schengen Agreements into a Community policy, avoiding any kind of discrimination against citizens of non-member countries legally resident in the Union and without turning Europe into a veritable fortress."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the governments involved like to see Schengen as a success story."
"Last year we were proudly presented with a first annual report - the only source, incidentally, from which the public can find out anything at all about the way Schengen operates!"
"That report was mainly concerned with such things as the hit rates for the Schengen Information System with its 3.7 million data sets."
"It was concerned with the high density of controls at the outer borders and with the so-called compensatory measures at the internal borders."
"It was - as Mrs van Lancker has already said - really a report on co-ordinated defence against refugees."
"The opening of the internal borders was the sugar coating designed to conceal the taste of the new barriers at the external borders of Schengen, and to legitimize the fact that new Schengen frontiers have been created within the European Union."
"This opening of the borders is really only a pretty fiction, if that, because what has really happened is that the borders have been shifted inwards a bit."
"Perhaps we are not checked as often as we used to be, but try asking black people or people of Asian origin."
"Their very appearance makes them suspect!"
"The undemocratic way in which Schengen came about and the undemocratic way in which it operates have often been criticized in this Parliament."
"Despite that, an unchanged co-operation agreement has now been concluded with Norway and Iceland, obliging those countries to accept Schengen without any ifs or buts, but depriving them of any right of co-determination or right of representation on the Executive Committee."
"This is a two-class system, and as far as I am concerned it is also the model of a European heartland which I really do not want!"
"What is now being proposed for the Intergovernmental Conference, which is that Schengen should be adopted, is not at all the communitization that we are demanding - in other words the merging of Schengen with the European Union."
"Instead, Schengen is to be taken over unchanged in its existing undemocratic form."
"We reject that vigorously, because it will also undermine the guarantee of the continuance of the Treaty."
"I hope this principle will be maintained."
"Then we will enthusiastically support Mrs van Lancker's report!"
"Mr President, I can't help feeling that this report is just another way of asking a familiar question: what kind of Europe do we want?"
"Do we want a Europe of governments or a Europe of citizens?"
"Our governments tell us they want to bring Europe closer to the citizen."
"In fact, though, it's the same old story - all show and no substance."
"European citizenship is still an objective, not a reality."
"The free movement of persons is a constitutional basis for that citizenship, pursuant to Article 7a of the Treaty. Now that ten million German marks or pounds sterling can cross the continent in a few milliseconds, the obstacles placed in the way of the free movement of human beings are becoming completely intolerable."
"With Schengen, we're getting bogged down in intergovernmental matters, we are ratifying an inequality, a form of discrimination as between the citizens of the Union and, even more so, towards citizens of third countries."
"There is a lack of democratic control, a lack of legal control, a lack of solidarity and a surfeit of hypocrisy."
"Because, let's not beat about the bush, my own country signed - that's hardly the word, it proclaimed - Schengen and immediately withdrew from it, because of a bomb in Paris or because it disagreed with the policy of one of the Union governments on marijuana."
"Where this subject is concerned, it will probably be up to the IGC to find a solution, given that the structure is a temporary one which should be integrated into the third pillar, which should be communitized."
"Not only that, but the Council's unanimity rule should be revoked on any question relating to the movement of persons, so that Europe can finally become a Europe of Europeans."
"Mr President, Mrs van Lancker's report on the functioning and future of Schengen is the result of an own-initiative manoeuvre by the European Parliament in a field in which it has no powers."
"First, because the Schengen Agreements are external to the Union."
"Secondly because in so far as it might concern the third pillar, this House has not received a request for consultation from the Council presidency, pursuant to Article K6."
"So what we have here is one of those cases of interference by the European Parliament which, if anything, are harmful to its image, the more so in that the arguments put forward in the motion for a resolution seem to us to be very far removed from the feelings of the public and of most of the governments involved in the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Let's take one example."
"One might legitimately wonder whether the Schengen Agreements, which have often been described as an experimental laboratory, can be extended to the whole of the Union."
"But the way to answer that question is to start by learning the lessons of the experiment."
"Otherwise, what would be the purpose of the laboratory?"
"Well, there are at least two inescapable lessons which the European Parliament is failing to learn, though fortunately the governments of the Member States seem rather more aware of them."
"First, it is totally inappropriate to suggest that all personal checks at the internal borders should be abolished - incidentally, we deplore the fact that the European Parliament sees fit, once again, to condemn the French Government for its anti-drug controls at the Belgium-Luxembourg border although those controls are perfectly legitimate and perfectly lawful."
"Secondly, the list of accompanying measures provided for by the Schengen Agreements should be reinforced, not truncated as the European Parliament suggests and as Mrs van Lancker has once again demanded, especially when criticizing the data on undesirable aliens contained in the SIS, the Schengen Information System."
"These accompanying measures should be reinforced, Mr President."
"For example, we should ensure the efficient functioning of the system for declarations of entry into the territory, which applies to nationals of third countries when they cross an internal border of the Schengen area."
"Turning a blind eye to such essential security problems is no way for the European Parliament to gain the sympathy of the citizens of the Member States."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after all this criticism I am going to take up the cudgels on behalf of the Schengen Agreements."
"The Schengen process is functioning in Europe, which is more than you can say of most institutions."
"It has brought specific advances in freedom of movement, meaning that the citizen has acquired the opportunity to experience Europe."
"Many citizens can now travel straight through from Finland to Portugal without stopping, even though there may well still be room for improvement in certain details."
"So this is a positive result, and, incidentally, one that makes it clear that something can be achieved through flexibility in Europe by allowing some to move forward rather more rapidly than might have been the original common intention."
"That is a clearly positive signal for Europe."
"When Mr Schulz complains that any beef steer can wander across borders unobserved and unchecked, but he himself has to show his passport, the perfectly reasonable explanation for that is that Mr Schulz is clearly not a beef steer and so must expect to be checked from time to time."
"Apart from the abolition of the internal borders, Schengen also of course includes improving the security of the external borders - and not just as a defence against crime, especially organized crime, but also as a defence against a second problem which weighs heavy on many European States, the problem of illegal immigration."
"Here again, Schengen has brought progress."
"The Schengen Information System gives us, for the first time, efficient co-operation between police forces, and it may become apparent that such co-operation has more to offer than checks at the internal borders."
"Overall, therefore, we are in favour of this process and we want to see it continue."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mrs Van Lancker on her excellent work."
"It has clearly raised a number of points which today's debate might help to clarify."
"I think we must start by acknowledging one thing: with every day that passes, we are dealing a mortal blow to the European people's confidence in Europe, since we promised them that these obsolete and ridiculous internal borders would be abolished as from 1 January 1993."
"I believe that although Schengen is a step forward, it is not enough in itself, given that it results from an intergovernmental agreement and not an initiative from the European institutions."
"Schengen must obviously be extended to the whole Community. I do wonder, however, whether behind all the hairsplitting and quibbling by colleagues on all sides over the various accompanying measures - which is in fact a pretext for not pressing ahead with the idea of applying Schengen throughout the Community - there is not ultimately a lack of political will to proceed with European integration, particularly as regards the third pillar."
"It is crucial above all, in my opinion, to abide by the principle laid down in the European treaties and in the Schengen Agreement: Europe as an area of freedom and democracy, under the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice and with democratic control over the processing of data."
"That is why we are calling for guarantees for our citizens - it is clear that the tightening of security must not be used as a pretext to restrict their freedom!"
"Mr President, I find the report submitted by Mrs Van Lancker to be very interesting in every respect, especially as she ventures to highlight the serious problems arising from the Schengen Agreement."
"I am for example referring to the lack of democratic parliamentary control over the Schengen Agreement and the lack of openness in Schengen - important sections concerning the application of the agreement are still, as emphasised under item 11, classified as secret."
"Furthermore, Mrs Van Lancker points out that the Schengen Agreement is part of the more restrictive and brutal refugee policy currently being developed in Western Europe and that Schengen is above all about control; if one reads the actual text of the agreement, several of the paragraphs are not about freedom or flexibility but deal with various methods of control."
"For us in the Nordic countries who are opposed to membership of the Schengen Agreement this is an important argument."
"It is good that they have been acknowledged by Parliament as we are often accused of scaremongering when highlighting these facts."
"The Scandinavian countries are currently in negotiations on joining the Schengen Agreement."
"However, for the last ten years, the Nordic countries have had a Passport Union in operation which is would be replaced by the Schengen Agreement."
"The report emphasises how well this Union operates."
"For Scandinavians it represents a passport freedom which cannot be compared to that of the Schengen Agreement as it is combined with the right to control domestic borders, a situation which is entirely incompatible with the Schengen Agreement."
"Today it is proposed to abolish the Nordic Passport Union and replace it with the less workable Schengen Agreement."
"In the long run, this would jeopardise the passport union between the Scandinavian countries since Iceland and Norway, not being members of the EU, could be excluded at any time from the Schengen Agreement should they not agree to particular decisions."
"In addition, should the Schengen Agreement become supranational, a constitutional amendment would be required in Norway, for which at the present time there is not a sufficient majority."
"In addition, we must consider the probable outcome of referendums on the results arising from the Intergovernmental Conference, which I believe will produce a negative response from the Scandinavian countries."
"Accordingly, I am of the opinion that the negotiated agreement should be put on hold and not be put into effect while the negotiations of the Intergovernmental Conference are in progress."
"Mr President, the attempt to arrive at a Union policy and at totally free movement of persons by using Schengen as a testing-ground is something that I have never been able to support."
"It has always struck me as a utopian concept prompted by an optimistic view of humanity."
"Certainly, I can see the additional benefit of an intergovernmental Schengen with unanimity in decision-making as a prerequisite."
"In such a framework one could get to grips with the 'free movement of persons' experiment in a credible manner and work further towards police cooperation in Europe."
"I do not share the view expressed by Mrs Van Lancker in her report that Schengen must quickly be communitized."
"Nor do I agree with the manner in which she lambasts the functioning of Schengen."
"The report is rather critical of the flanking measures which, as far as the Council is concerned, are prerequisites for the free movement of persons within the Schengen framework."
"I am very pleased that the Schengen testing ground for policy, as I have called it, has induced the realization that these measures are essential."
"Because what sense is there in having free movement of persons if the security of those persons cannot be guaranteed as a consequence?"
"To imagine that a huge free internal area can be established without there being any need to worry about the consequences smacks of naivety."
"Obviously, the political goal has become so revered that the risks, the risk of diminished security, for instance, are being accepted into the bargain."
"The report of the Committee of Inquiry into transit fraud in the movement of goods that is to be debated this week is a good case in point in my view. You throw open the borders but fail to take adequate account of the consequences and, because of that, you do not put in place the measures that are need to forestall the problems."
"I can give provisional support to an inter-governmental Schengen that will work towards the free movement of persons and a high level of security for the citizens in a realistic manner."
"However, the Van Lancker report is an entirely different kettle of fish, and the future vision of Schengen that it presents is something that I cannot possibly support."
"I do not think I am a cow either, as Mr Nassauer pointed out about my colleague, Mr Schulz."
"I think it is something which unites us not only with the socialists but with everyone in this hemicycle, but that is not why I am pleased not to be checked."
"However, when I see labels entitling my luggage to travel through airports, whilst I on the other hand, have to show my identity card or my passport, I do feel a little perplexed."
"Evidently, as has been mentioned here, Schengen is a step forward towards freedom of movement and we are not going to deny that."
"But it is such a cautious step and above all so unclear that some of us are concerned about it."
"We have moved forward it is true, but how?"
"With exclusively intergovernmental agreements which it is difficult for the European Parliament to check and for the national parliaments to control in view of their extra-national nature."
"We are anxious to know whether we are to continue like this or, as has been said so often, whether we are to have a Community legal basis which will help us to take those matters forward."
"The report therefore seems to me to be opportune and I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on the content."
"Flexibility has been mentioned here."
"Flexibility to move forward."
"We might discuss that, but in principle we should be in agreement."
"So to move forward, but how?"
"I think we need to move towards greater democracy, more rights, more freedoms and, above all, without agreements between the Governments placing too much emphasis on certain problems, for example immigration."
"I know it is a problem, but we cannot work simply by stressing only the security or frontiers aspect to press for 'solutions' which are to say the least not very transparent."
"Yes to doing the right thing by the citizens; yes to fulfilling the promise we made - and I include myself in the 'we' as one of those with an interest in seeing this European Union progress; yes to the promise we made for a free and open European Union in which we can travel; yes to being able to call upon the Court of Justice of the Union to uphold that; yes to as flexible a Union as is desired, but one which is moving forward, not towards a scenario in which - as seems to be the case in the CIS - we should have little to offer with the States nevertheless rapidly reaching agreement saying 'don't worry, at least as regards security, your security, we shall reach agreement; yes indeed, just don't tell us how' , but rather towards a scenario of greater democracy."
"Mr President, mobility is exactly what the Schengen Agreement is about, something which ought to be of general interest to the majority in this assembly."
"People expect to be able to move freely across internal national borders."
"But you cannot ask citizens to accept the resulting inadequate safety and security measures or an increased inflow of narcotics from a neighbouring country."
"Mobility should benefit the people not criminals."
"That is why compensatory measures are required."
"Where would we be today in the development of mobility without the driving force that Schengen constitutes?"
"The Scandinavian countries should participate, as suggested, preserving the Nordic Passport Union."
"As far as Norway and Iceland are concerned, practical solutions must also be found in the future."
"Following the difficulties at the committee stage, Rapporteur Van Lancker has shown a willingness to negotiate."
"However, misunderstandings are not unusual in a matter like this, for example the purpose of Schengen being to prevent general immigration when in fact it is illegal immigration which is being curbed, something which most parties would otherwise approve."
"It is in people's interest to push for mobility and this involves a number of measures and actions."
"The revisions of the treaty now also make it possible to incorporate gradually the terms of the Schengen Agreement as the Commission has already constructively proposed."
"This would also increase the level of control for the people."
"If Parliament decides to oppose the security measures, we risk becoming a stumbling block to the idea of mobility, an impossible position for Parliament."
"Parliament should adopt an unambiguously positive attitude towards the Schengen collaboration."
"Mr President, Mr Fischbach, making Europe into one large single market with no internal borders, simply from the commercial and economic standpoint, is a grave error."
"We have seen that in the Renault Vilvoorde affair, where the lack of European social rules became apparent to anyone."
"The same thing is happening with internal security."
"To open the borders for free movement without giving any thought to the essential corollary of public safety is scandalous."
"How do you expect our citizens to support the European plan if they form the impression that Europe is not doing enough to protect them against crime?"
"It was to fill this gap and compensate for the shortcomings of the Community institutions that the intergovernmental structure of Schengen was created."
"And Schengen has thus become a laboratory where it is possible to test, on the ground, those actions and structures which should subsequently be integrated into the framework of the Treaty on European Union, if only to institute that Parliamentary control and those legal guarantees which, for the present, are lacking."
"So I see Schengen as a positive initiative, which is certainly not being used to bully the citizen, as the van Lancker report implies, but is in fact offering him a guarantee of his personal safety."
"Police activity against criminals, thieves, the Mafia, drug pushers, illegal immigrants, must not be reduced - it must be increased and integrated into the European structures."
"Because only then, Mr President, Mr Fischbach, will we gain the support of the peoples of Europe."
"Mr President, for me, Schengen is an instrument which effectively combines security with freedom of movement."
"Anyone who only wants freedom of movement has obviously failed to understand Schengen as an instrument of security for the citizens of Europe."
"Anyone who says no to police checks, no to the inclusion of undesirables in the Schengen Information System or no to the ruling on third countries has not understood Schengen."
"Similarly, anyone who dismisses Schengen as an instrument to counter immigration has also failed to understand it."
"What we need is a security instrument, and that is what Schengen offers."
"Anyone who assembles an antiSchengen package in the form of a motion like this or a report like this must ultimately expect these proposals - which are directed against public security - to be rejected."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted with today's report on the functioning and future of the Schengen Agreements, and I wish in particular to compliment the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs and its rapporteur, Mrs Van Lancker."
"This draft report highlights the special nature of the Schengen Agreements, which on the one hand are a contribution to achieving the goal of abolishing checks on persons at our internal frontiers - in accordance with Article 7a of the Treaty - but on the other are taking shape outside the context of the European Union."
"Attention is drawn to this point both in your assessment of the present functioning of the Schengen Agreements and your comments on the future."
"The Commission's position on Schengen is well known."
"From the outset, the Commission has looked favourably on the Schengen initiative as a testing ground for, or a forerunner of, the European Union, albeit designed to be replaced gradually by Union instruments."
"In this context, at my initiative, the Commission put forward three legislative proposals in July 1995 aimed at achieving this objective throughout the Union."
"In view of the Union's slow progress towards this goal, and given that even if all the proposals were to be adopted quickly, there would still be no guarantee of their immediate implementation, the importance of Schengen has not only been confirmed, but has in fact increased."
"Indeed, Schengen and its extension are the only means of allowing our citizens to benefit, as of now, from the right to freedom of movement and security."
"However, this does not mean that Schengen is the best of all possible solutions or that it is perfect in all respects."
"The report brings to light various shortcomings."
"I share many of your concerns, first and foremost as regards the lack of transparency."
"But I do not share all your concerns, as I shall make clear in a moment."
"On the subject of transparency, I can tell you that, as the Commission's representative on the Schengen Executive Committee, I insisted before the committee that the public should be given more information on Schengen."
"As a result of what I said, the Executive Committee decided to send the European Parliament the first annual report on the implementation of the Schengen Agreements."
"Personally, I attach the greatest importance to providing our citizens with information on their rights, and to the fact that they will not lend their support to the building of Europe until we present them with a single market which allows ample freedom of movement for goods, services and capital, but also for our citizens themselves. This, as has been pointed out, is still inadequate."
"It is vital to inform our citizens, as proved by the recent 'Citizens of Europe' information campaign carried out at Community level."
"I believe that a similar initiative to inform our citizens should be undertaken on Schengen, for example to tell citizens of third countries who are resident in the Schengen states what rights the Agreements give them, in particular the right to travel - carrying their residence permits and under certain conditions - without the need for a visa."
"The second major concern highlighted in your report, and one which I share, relates to democratic and judicial control over Schengen."
"Schengen is not entirely outside democratic and judicial control, given the role played by the national parliaments and the courts of the Member States concerned."
"It would seem logical, however, since Schengen is one means of ensuring the entry into force of Article 7a, for the European institutions - especially the European Parliament and the Court of Justice - to be able to operate in this field."
"Let us now move on from these considerations concerning the institutional inadequacies of Schengen to your views on the future of Schengen, which I broadly share."
"Firstly, the abolishing of internal border checks on persons is an objective of the Union, and should therefore preferably be achieved by means of the Union's decision-making procedures and legal instruments, which are gradually to replace those of Schengen."
"We must therefore continue our efforts to gain approval for the proposals we have presented to the Council on this subject."
"As regards the second priority for the future which is singled out in your report, only if this approach proved unproductive should an alternative solution be considered, namely the integration of Schengen into the Treaty on European Union."
"Here too, I share your views."
"It would be acceptable to integrate Schengen into the Treaty on European Union only if it contributed added value in institutional terms."
"This means that the integration of the Schengen acts into the Treaty would have to take place alongside the granting of competences to the European Union institutions."
"Mr President, Mr Nassauer has just been kind enough to refer to me."
"I should like to repeat once again what he said."
"I had mentioned the fact that cattle can travel unsupervised in the European Union, while I have to produce my passport."
"Mr Nassauer saw fit to observe that all this means is that the border guards take note of the fact that I am not a beef steer!"
"My thanks for the compliment."
"At the same time, Mr Nassauer pointed out that he is apparently one of those who can travel unchecked from Finland to Portugal."
"If I have to show my passport because I am not a beef steer, I should like to know what the border guards think Mr Nassauer is to excuse him from showing his passport!"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12.00 noon."
"The information society"
"The next item is the debate on the report by Mr Wim van Velzen (A4-0045/97), on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Commission's Green Paper on Living and Working in the Information Society: People First (COM(96)0389 - C4-0522/96)."
"Mr President, the great European projects always have the same failing in that the social dimension seems constantly to lag behind."
"Take European integration, the internal market, EMU or, now, the information society: the social issues always come low on the agenda."
"After all the attention given to the electronic highway, the focusing of attention on the social aspects brought a breathing space."
"However, my acquaintance with the Commission's Green Paper has given me mixed feelings."
"Not so far as the sub-title 'People First' is concerned, given that it suggests lots of things that ought to please me. To read it, however, is to be disappointed."
"The 'people' are considered principally as workers, and the reports by the forum on the information society and the high level group, which could have projected a very full picture, are largely ignored. In actual fact, a large section of the report is taken up just by employment and training, and that is all right as far as it goes."
"There is interesting information, for example, about the speed with which knowledge becomes obsolete and about modifications in organization. But in the final analysis I feel that the whole thing is viewed too much as an automatic process and that too few critical questions are asked, for example, about the driving back of the hierarchy and the broadening of organization and the repercussions of that with regard to the decline of the less skilled and less specialized work of which we in Europe have a tremendous need."
"I have the impression also that the report suffers from over-optimism."
"It 'should' all turn out well if we introduce the information and communications technologies quickly and if we 'liberalize' as much as possible."
"In my view that does not make sense, and I can point to a report drawn up by the Commission not so long ago that declared, in fact, that expectations about employment could be positive after the year 2000 when there should be positive growth in new ICT sector jobs."
"But in the year 2000 it is obvious that very many traditional jobs will be destroyed, more than a hundred thousand of them."
"On account of the optimism, which is quite understandable, insufficient attention is paid, in my opinion, to what I will call the flanking policy."
"If you start from the understanding that many more people will be unemployed, and, certainly, there will be the 20 million that are permanently with us, then an instrument that would shorten working time and make more use of the capacity in the tertiary sector would offer an exceptionally interesting strategy. Unfortunately, this is totally ignored in the Green Paper."
"Furthermore, absolutely no attention is paid to what I will call the insider-outsider problem."
"Discussion about the information society is focused only on people who have work, and thus all those people who are not in work, who are unemployed, or retired or not involved in the employment process for some other reason, are left out in the cold."
"The way is therefore opened up to a dual society if nothing else."
"I found the blinkered attitude regarding education particularly painful."
"When I look at what is said about education I note that attention is paid only to people who themselves want to adapt to the ICTs rather than to something other than that: the application of new technologies to help solve actual problems of society such as unemployment, poverty, environmental pollution and the divisions in our society."
"Education is more than vocational training."
"Education is also the passport to a culture, the vehicle via which people are introduced to our culture."
"That aspect is completely ignored in the Green Paper."
"What is therefore necessary as regards the action programme that will be formulated here after the adoption and processing of my report is that in all circumstances it should have balance."
"The Commission must avoid placing all the emphasis on employment. Coordination and societal factors must also receive attention."
"At the moment the Commission is suffering, in my opinion, from serious over-heating."
"Amidst the enormous flood of reports it is almost impossible to see what the Commission's vision is, because in various ways those reports contradict each other."
"The action plan for new legislation must be less diffident."
"The Commission must not block new developments; it must stop putting a brake on them all the time."
"It must grant the time for them."
"And there are new areas of weakness to prepare for, in connection with teleworking, the security and health of the population and the protection of employees, in which the Commission can set out the ground rules via directives."
"The Commission must shake off its timidity and clearly mark out the rights and the responsibilities of the European authorities, and it must become more active than is now the case in the field of legislation."
"Mr President, I am addressing the House on behalf of Mrs Soltwedel-Schäfer, who is unfortunately unable to attend."
"When we look at this document we can only say that it is the opposite of what is desirable - a flexibility derived from principles."
"What happens here is that the principles are formulated first - as Mr Van Velzen has just pointed out - and then the opposite course is pursued."
"Above a firmament of bright ideas and good intentions we then have a substructure, a basis of practically oriented historical materialism of the cynical variety, and the only thing left to politicians is to push ahead with adapting man to the new technology."
"There is a fundamental philosophy here, which says: living means functioning, living means working, living means participation in capitalist competition."
"So really only private entrepreneurs are living."
"There is also the implied promise that the information society will open up these delights to more people, but I think Wim van Velzen was right here when he put the question another way, from the standpoint of the socially disadvantaged."
"I think it needs to be put even more radically - as a question of power and supremacy relationships and the new opportunities for social and political emancipation, a question which is linked to the new technology and the new organizational concepts it has produced."
"If we picture the information society, without any advance preparation, impacting on our present hour-glass society, where insecurity and the downward differentiation of wages are affecting more and more groups in society, then we get the effect of a huge new proletariat which has to be entertained by 'tititainment' , as they say nowadays, a petit bourgeoisie of passive users and a new nomenklatura who hold the power and are the masters of the game."
"Secondly, in a situation where communication is taking on totally new dimensions as a result of the creation of virtual realities and communities, we have the two sides of one coin, the culture industry, bringing passivity to the masses in the guise of activity, and the secret services, centralizing relevant information and screening information as a way of activating the elite, and this is made worse rather than better by the information society."
"We in this House have very often criticized the Commission's piecemeal tactics in the past."
"Here we see something of those tactics surviving."
"Mr Bangemann has already promised this House that he will do better."
"There is to be a framework directive."
"The report by the high-level group of experts suggests that the possibility exists of a more comprehensive approach."
"The action plan we have been promised will, we hope, mark the end of this onesided procedure."
"The role of government, too, requires discussion: is it to function as a residual parameter or is it to become a leader of innovation?"
"We need greater clarification of what might be fair methods of standardization, whereby it would not be just to those economic groups which exert the most pressure that are able to impose their interests as general standards."
"We need to overcome the previous lack of synchronization between technological, entrepreneurial and regulatory development, which time and again has thrown away opportunities for planning, and, if I may just add, ceterum censeo : the overdue socio-ecological reconstruction of Europe's societies must not be put off any longer."
"Even the possible transition to the information society cannot offer the slightest excuse for doing so."
"Mr President, a European policy which hopes to claim by right that it wants to put man at the centre of the information society must see man in all his many different roles and interests."
"It is about man as an employee, and it is also about man as a citizen."
"In the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, the Green Paper takes too little account of the latter aspect."
"As the draftsman of the opinion, therefore, I must emphasize the following requirements to be met by any future policy for the creation of the information society. The applications of information and communications technologies which make things easier for the citizen in his everyday life, in his dealings with the authorities and in his democratic involvement, must be enhanced, and more must be done to promote them."
"Unfortunately, there is too little evidence of this in the documents available to date."
"Unfortunately, too, we cannot help noticing that public services, such as legal information services, are lagging behind the private ones, and that entertainment pays better than useful information for the citizen."
"A second central requirement of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights is that the information society should be provided with a stable legal framework and that a higher degree of legal security should be guaranteed for all participants."
