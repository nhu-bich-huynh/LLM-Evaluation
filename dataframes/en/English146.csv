"Text"
"Is the Commission aware of the study by the German Federal Environment Agency, according to which energy-saving light bulbs pose a risk of causing poisoning, because of the mercury contained in them, if they break in the domestic environment?"
"What conclusions does the Commission draw from this study?"
"Is the Commission prepared to reconsider its decision to withdraw conventional light bulbs from the market?"
"Is the Commission prepared to suspend the ban on conventional light bulbs, at least for private households?"
"Madam President, Mrs Koch-Mehrin, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is aware of the report from the German Federal Environment Agency and has, of course, once again carefully investigated the facts."
"The background to the situation is as follows."
"As a result of a decision by the European Council in 2007 and subsequent resolutions by the European Parliament and the Energy Council - in other words, after wide-ranging consultation with Parliament and the Member States - the Commission submitted its proposal for an ecodesign regulation in 2009."
"This included the gradual changeover from conventional light bulbs to energy-saving bulbs which make more efficient use of electricity."
"We believe that in the European lighting and light bulb market, it will be possible to achieve a total saving of 40 billion kilowatt hours, which corresponds to electricity costs of between EUR 5 billion and EUR 10 billion."
"The directive includes a number of safety measures, with the focus being on mercury and maximum limits."
"These were lowered significantly once again in September last year in order to further reduce the potential risks to the public."
"The findings in the study commissioned by the German Federal Environment Agency have led us to ask the Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks to issue another statement."
"After reviewing the entire body of scientific literature, the committee has come to the conclusion that broken compact fluorescent bulbs are very unlikely to present any risk to human health."
"However, there is one problem in this area."
"The studies are based on trials involving adults."
"Of course, it is obvious that children need to be considered separately, which is why we are working together with the German Federal Environment Agency to produce the appropriate results for children as quickly as possible."
"We are monitoring the situation very carefully."
"I am in contact with the aforementioned agency so that we can carry out a rapid, joint evaluation of any additional tests it organises."
"Our overall conclusion is that, because of the need for confidence among everyone involved, we will continue with the gradual implementation of the regulation."
"However, we will be happy to report to Parliament again if findings emerge which could give rise to a different evaluation."
"This is the situation at the moment."
"(DE) Madam President, Mr Oettinger, it is good that you have commissioned the Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks to look at this issue again."
"I am pleased about this."
"However, the question remains: How can we explain to the citizens of Europe that they have to allow something into their houses under EU regulations which represents a health hazard for their children?"
"You have children and you know how it is."
"Things often get broken."
"Mr Leichtfried from Austria and I are very concerned about this."
"How can we make it clear that this is something dangerous?"
"We do not seem to be able to learn from past mistakes."
"However, you were not responsible for the original decision, so you can show a willingness to learn without losing face."
"You could have said that we will withdraw this ban, at least for private households."
"Would you be prepared to reconsider your decision?"
"Madam President, in answer to the question, I would like to point out that bulbs will be available on the market immediately after the changeover which will not present any potential risk."
"The question relates to CFL, or compact fluorescent lamps."
"For this reason, we need to consider increasing our public relations activities on the ecodesign directive so that we can inform citizens about LED lights and new-generation halogen bulbs."
"These will allow us to achieve both things: our environmental and energy-saving goals under the terms of the regulation, on the one hand, and the prevention of any possible risks, on the other."
"I am happy to look into this again in more depth."
"Subject: Victims' rights packages"
"Improving support for victims of crime is an important part of the Stockholm Programme."
"In particular, the issues surrounding assistance for the victims of cross-border crime in Europe are of real concern to EU Citizens."
"There are few practical procedures in place that offer support or advice to victims and families that have been caught up in the aftermath of crime and serious injury abroad."
"I am helping a constituent whose son was a victim of a violent attack whilst on holiday in Crete."
"There is a real need for EU action in this area to fulfil the promise of a citizens' Europe."
"Commissioner Reding has announced a package of measures in relation to the protection of victims of criminal offences."
"In light of this, when does the Commission intend to propose this package for victims of criminal offences?"
"Could the Commission give more information as to what this legislative proposal will include?"
"Could the Commission give some detail on the non-legislative measures that are to be included in the package?"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, more than 30 million people across Europe are reported to be victims of crime every year."
"It is important that we ensure that victims have access to their rights and receive the support and protection they need."
"This is a strategic priority for the Commission."
"Let me take this opportunity to highlight the courage of Mrs Hughes, who is campaigning for stronger victims' rights across Europe."
"I think that her determination should serve as an inspiration to us all to strengthen victims' rights and to reinforce citizens' trust in our judicial systems."
"We need this stronger mutual trust to ensure that the victim's needs are recognised and protected, not only at home, but also cross-border."
"We need to ensure, too, that victims are not forgotten by our judicial and legal systems."
"That is why the Commission will propose a comprehensive package on victims in May."
"This will address the quality of treatment that victims receive in the aftermath of a crime and during the criminal proceedings."
"It will ensure that victims receive the same minimum standards of treatment in all EU Member States, irrespective of their nationality or country of origin."
"Our proposals aim to promote a change in attitudes towards victims, to do more to ensure their recovery, and to minimise the risk of their being further harmed by repeat victimisation during the proceedings."
"In very concrete terms, what will the package consist of?"
"Firstly, a horizontal directive on the standing of victims in criminal proceedings, which will, for example, clearly establish the following enforceable rights: easily accessible victim support services in all Member States; the right to interpretation during interviews; a minimising of contact between the offender and the victim during proceedings, with any new courts to be designed so as to provide separate waiting areas; and the right in all Member States to request a review of the prosecution."
"Secondly, I will also propose a regulation on the mutual recognition of civil-law protection measures to ensure that any victim who is at risk, and who benefits from a protection measure taken against a potential offender in one Member State, can continue to benefit from such a measure when they move or travel to another Member State."
"That instrument will be complemented by another instrument on the mutual recognition of criminal-law protection measures."
"We also intend to introduce a wide range of non-legislative measures to ensure that the new legislation works effectively, and we will propose a road map on the strengthening of victims' rights to ensure that these rights remain high on the political agenda in the years to come."
"As you know, we visited your office last week with Maggie Hughes, one of the many thousands of brave victims of crime."
"I have to say that, speaking to your staff, we are very excited that this could potentially be a package of measures that restores trust and added value for citizens who need help when they are victims of crime."
"What Maggie Hughes and many other victims of crime have said to us is that they like the measures that you propose but that they want to see a concentration of help."
"For example, if there is a victim support office, it should be easily accessible and we should have individuals who help in the hospital, in the police cell and with the court system."
"This is what our citizens are asking for and, up until now, they have not received."
"So really this is a plea to you to make this the kind of potentially great proposal that it can be."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - I absolutely agree."
"I, too, have felt that victims have been somewhat absent."
"With regard to procedural rights, we have focused strongly on people who get into trouble because they may have committed a crime: we have been concerned to see that their rights are looked after, as we should be in our rights-based society."
"Very often, however, victims are victimised a second time when they come to court, and nobody cares."
"It is a very unfair situation, amounting to a negation of rights."
"That is why I hope this victim package will change not only laws but also mentalities, and that everywhere in our courts, our police stations and our hospitals - as the honourable Member rightly urged - people will have a special care for victims and will know that they should not be treated just like anyone else."
"It is of the utmost importance that this should also apply cross-border, to people in a Member State other than their country of origin."
"So I rely on Parliament to help the Commission produce the best legislation possible, and also - with regard to the codecision aspects of the package - to be swift so that it can be put forward for agreement with the Council."
"Part two"
"Subject: Commission proposals on a common consolidated corporate tax base"
"Can the Commission give an explanation of the current situation with regard to the Commission proposals on a common consolidated corporate tax base?"
"Member of the Commission. - The Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB) is an important initiative in removing obstacles to the single market, and was identified in the Annual Growth Survey as a growth-enhancing initiative to be frontloaded."
"Indeed, it will tackle some major fiscal impediments to companies' competitiveness."
"At the moment, the lack of common corporate tax rules and the divergence of national tax systems often lead to over-taxation and double taxation."
"Moreover, businesses are faced with heavy administrative burdens and high tax compliance costs."
"This situation creates disincentives to investment in the EU and runs counter to the priorities set in the Europe 2020 strategy."
"Significant progress has been made so far on the technical preparation of the CCCTB proposal."
"It is now time to offer companies a single set of rules to make it easier and cheaper to do business in the single market."
"The CCCTB is scheduled for adoption by the College of Commissioners on 16 March 2011."
"I am convinced that the final proposal will greatly contribute to a better environment for businesses, growth and jobs in the EU."
"Thank you, Commissioner, for your answer."
"Just three short questions and I hope you will be in a position to answer them."
"Do you envisage CCCTB as being voluntary?"
"Secondly, do you envisage any circumstances in which domestic courts might lose their jurisdiction in tax matters if whatever decision they take impacts on yields in another Member State?"
"And finally, I expect at this stage some formula has been arrived at for the apportionment of tax that is payable in the different Member States."
"Has any impact analysis been done by the Commission on winners and losers, and by that, I mean winners and losers in financial terms, under whatever formula you have already come up with?"
"Member of the Commission. - I will be very brief on the question of whether CCCTB will be voluntary or mandatory."
"The answer is yes, it will be voluntary: the proposal provides for a voluntary option for companies to apply CCCTB rules."
"Concerning the role of domestic courts, the CCCTB proposal provides for rules for dispute settlement, and the role of domestic courts will not be undermined as a result of the proposal."
"The proposal provides for an apportionment formula with an equal division between sales, labour and assets, and the labour factor will be divided into two components: payroll and number of employees."
"Yes, we made an impact assessment, and that impact assessment will be published together with our proposal."
"I am fully convinced that the proposal will be for the benefit of European businesses including, I believe, Irish businesses."
"Colleagues, I realise that there are some Members who have come into the Chamber since we started Question Time and will not be aware of the huge time constraint we have been under in order to try to make progress."
"The aim is to answer as many questions as possible."
"I therefore said at the beginning that I will not take any supplementaries, except from those Members who have put questions."
"Let me say at the moment that my aim is - and this depends, to some extent, on the length of Commission replies - to take the following questions before 20:45, that is, the questions from Mrs Jensen, Mr Papanikolaou, Mr Posselt and Mrs Ţicău."
"That is the plan."
"Subject: VAT exemption for agricultural products in Romania"
"Danish firms which have invested in agriculture in Romania have been informed that, in future, they may not charge VAT on goods sold to intermediaries."
"However, farmers will still be able to charge VAT on goods sold to end users (i.e. bakers, other farmers, etc.)."
"Apparently, the proposal for the VAT exemption of sales to intermediaries was sent from the Romanian Government to DG TAXUD."
"Has the Commission approved the exemption from VAT of the sale of agricultural products to intermediaries?"
"If so, why?"
"Does the Commission consider that such a system will result in a change in trade patterns for agricultural products in Romania?"
"Does the Commission consider that it will create a distortion of competition on the internal market if financial incentives are given to farmers to sell their products to certain customers?"
"Will the Commission ensure that common VAT regulations apply to all agricultural producers in Romania?"
"Member of the Commission. - Because of the VAT fraud situation in relation to certain agricultural products, the Commission is in contact with Romania in order to determine the most appropriate way forward in dealing with this problem."
"One of the possible solutions to deal with the so-called carousel fraud in this sector would be to apply the reverse charge mechanism."
"Under this arrangement, which is not an exemption scheme, supplies remain taxed but the person liable for the payment of the VAT to the tax administration is no longer the supplier but the recipient taxpayer."
"The fact that the recipient is liable to pay the tax instead of the supplier is the only modification to the standard regime, according to which a taxpayer supplying goods to another taxpayer collects the VAT and pays it to the State while the recipient taxpayer can deduct this amount via his VAT declaration."
"Both under the standard and the reverse charge regimes, should the recipient be a final consumer, he will not be able to deduct VAT and will bear it entirely."
"Therefore, VAT still remains neutral for taxpayers and there would be no distortion of competition."
"Because the recipient can simultaneously pay and deduct the very same amount in his VAT return, this modification has the merit of removing the need for an effective payment of the VAT to the tax administration."
"Therefore, it avoids fraud arrangements that are based on non-payment of the VAT by the supplier followed by deduction of the VAT by the customer, who is in possession of a valid invoice."
"A downside of this system is the fact that it could create other risks of fraud, since all VAT would be collected at the last stage in the supply chain."
"Therefore, such a system should, in the Commission's view, preferably be limited to agricultural products which are normally sold to intermediaries - taxable persons - and not destined for supply to final consumers."
"In any case, as this arrangement would deviate from the normal VAT rules set out in the VAT Directive, Romania would have to be granted a derogation by the Council on the basis of that directive; the Commission is still examining the issue."
"(DA) Thank you Commissioner."
"I am not sure that I understood all of the details, but I can, of course, look at them more closely later."
"However, this new system, which I understand has been established to prevent fraud, may pose a particular problem for producers from another country who have invested in Romania and who therefore have VAT expenditure in a different country that cannot be offset against VAT income in Romania because they have no VAT income."
"Has the Commission considered how we could solve this problem for producers from another EU country that have undertakings in both Romania and other EU countries, so that they are not prevented from being able to offset their input VAT against their VAT income?"
"Thank you."
"Member of the Commission. - I would just like to say that the reverse charge mechanism is not a new mechanism and is applicable in several Member States."
"For example, it is also applicable in the emission trading system in some Member States."
"It is true that the reverse system charge actually implies collection of VAT at the end of the supply chain instead of collecting it throughout the supply chain."
"When we look at the requests from the Member States to apply a reverse charge mechanism, we look, of course, at all the details, and the issue of the distortion of the internal market is also taken into account."
"That is why Commission proposals are not made automatically but through a study, on the basis of which we submit a proposal to the Council."
"With regard to Romania, we have already been working for more than half a year - or even longer - in order to find a solution as to how to address VAT fraud in agriculture in this particular country."
"I have been in here since the beginning of Question Time, which was supposed to start at 19:30."
"There are a lot of people in my country, which gets a new government tomorrow, who are interested in the question which I have put to Commissioner Rehn."
"I ask you, please, even we have to sit for an extra few minutes, that my question be allowed and that the Commissioner be allowed to respond to it."
"Members have already left this Chamber because I have told them I could not deal with their question or I could not deal with supplementary questions."
"It has been a difficult afternoon."
"It continues to be a difficult evening."
"I have indicated those questions I want to take up to the time of 20:45."
"We will see how we can do, but really I am doing my best to be fair to all concerned and indeed to the Commissioners who are waiting to participate."
"Subject: Statement by the head of the OECD on the possible restructuring of eurozone Member State debt and Commission's standpoint"
"On Thursday, 27 January 2011, speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, the head of the OECD, Angel Gurria, asserted that 'one country may need restructuring, that is Greece'."
"It should be pointed out that this is the first public statement on the question of restructuring a eurozone member's debt by the head of an influential international organisation that cooperates closely with the EU on a range of political, economic and social issues."
"What is the Commission's standpoint on this specific question, particularly in the light of the statement by the head of the OECD?"
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, the Commission, together with the ECB and the IMF, recently concluded the third review of the Economic Assessment Programme for Greece."
"Our joint overall assessment is twofold and I will outline it briefly."
"Firstly, the programme has made further progress towards its objectives; and secondly, there remain considerable challenges to be overcome in order to secure fiscal sustainability, restore competitiveness and ensure a viable banking sector."
"While there have been delays in some areas, the underlying fiscal and other reforms necessary to deliver the programme's medium-term objectives are now being put in place."
"However, major reforms still need to be designed and implemented in order to build the critical mass necessary to secure fiscal sustainability and economic recovery."
"The challenging efforts of consolidation will be supported by a bold privatisation programme, as indicated by Prime Minister Papandreou."
"The government has expressed its commitment to substantially scaling up its privatisation programme with a view to realising EUR 50 billion in proceeds from privatisation by 2015."
"This has the potential to cut the debt ratio by more than 20 percentage points of GDP over the next five years."
"Furthermore, determination in implementing the privatisation programme will increase economic efficiency and support higher investment and exports."
"For all these reasons, the government's full commitment to this process of privatisation, and not least its determination to tackle privileges and vested interests, will indeed be critical to realising the ambitious objectives and thus utilising the potential for substantial improvement in the market sentiment vis-à-vis Greece."
"The Commission therefore encourages Greece to show resolve in its privatisation programme."
"This relates to a comment made by the OECD Secretary-General: this year, 2011, is the decisive year for Greece in terms of restoring the credibility of its economic policies and that is a prerequisite if it is to regain market access in the course of next year."
"To this end, the authorities should achieve, or even surpass, the fiscal target for this year and articulate a robust medium-term budgetary strategy."
"In addition, Greece should achieve a decisive breakthrough in structural reforms over the coming weeks and months."
"Determined implementation of the programme should strengthen credibility and the confidence of citizens and investors alike."
"To conclude, through the combination of these policy measures - i.e. meeting the fiscal targets and implementing the privatisation programme - and the EU measures of extending the loan maturities and revisiting the pricing policy in the light of debt sustainability, concerns about debt restructuring can, and will, be addressed."
"(EL) Madam President, Commissioner, last year, we jointly signed a memorandum with Greece making provision for repayment of the loan granted over three-and-a-half years."
"Today, you personally proposed in your statement that it be extended to seven years, which obviously means that a computational error was made."
"At the same time, Moody's has downgraded Greece's credit rating to the same level as Angola; this was unwarranted and is unacceptable."
"At the end of the day, Commissioner, we are all wondering what will ultimately suffice in order for Greece to get back on its feet: a simple extension?"
"A reduction in interest rates, as you also mentioned?"
"Renegotiation of the terms of the memorandum?"
"Eurobonds?"
"The European growth bond?"
"All of the above?"
"Or perhaps something else?"
"Perhaps more austerity measures in Greece?"
"What, Commissioner?"
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, the essential thing, and the necessary condition, is to stick to the targets of fiscal consolidation and implement structural reforms with full determination, in line with the memorandum."
"Moreover, as I said in my previous reply, it is essential for Greece to embark on a very ambitious programme of privatisation which will help reduce the debt burden."
"It is also very important, in the context of the comprehensive strategy to be decided this March in the European Union, that the Member States look at the issue of debt sustainability."
"I can only encourage the Member States to decide to extend the loan maturities of loans to Greece as well as to revisit the pricing policy for these loans."
"This is an absolute farce and this is a point of order."
"Question Time, we were told, was to be from 19:30 to 20:30."
"You, or somebody, decided that the previous debate would be allowed to trespass on Question Time."
"It is one of the few avenues for people to ask questions of a Commissioner."
"We have a crisis in Ireland; my colleagues Gay Mitchell, Pat the Cope Gallagher and myself have tabled questions."
"Who decided?"
"I want to know now - and this is a legitimate question - who decided that what should be a twenty-minute session, and we are only eight minutes into it, should be reduced to an eight or nine-minute session."
"Who decided that, Madam President?"
"Mr Higgins, I was actually about to make a statement before I gave the floor to the Commissioner for what will be the last question because, believe you me, I am as angry as you."
"I do not like sitting here in these circumstances, having to disappoint a large number of Members and having to keep a number of Members of the Commission waiting."
"The people I would like you to target are your Group leaders and I say that again loud and clear: it is the Group leaders who set the agenda and leave us in a situation, almost every plenary week, where we do no have enough time to deal properly with Question Time to the Commission, or indeed, when it has taken place, to the Council."
"It is unsatisfactory; I have made my views known before."
"I would ask each and every Member who cares about it to contact their Group leaders and tell them what they think, because I am stuck with the agenda as I find it when I take over the chair and I do not enjoy it."
"But who decided that Commissioner Šemeta could have three questions and Commissioner Rehn could only have one question?"
"Mr Higgins' was the second question to Commissioner Rehn and mine the third question."
"How did one Commissioner get a number of questions and another only one question?"
"I do not understand that."
"We have done two and now I am giving Mr Šemeta the question that is actually addressed to Commissioner De Gucht."
"That is why."
"I have to go through a certain order and I am sorry for that."
"I am sorry for the three of you, but I would suggest to you that, as Commissioner Rehn is, I know, a very sympathetic commissioner, I am sure that as he leaves the Chamber, he will be prepared to talk to the three of you."
"That is the only solution I can offer and I know that it is not satisfactory."
"Having read the three questions, 23 from Higgins, 24 from Mitchell and 25 from Gallagher, I can only assume that the Commissioner would have grouped those three together and therefore can we not, or have you the right to, trespass on the next debate?"
"Because at all times, it is Question Time that suffers."
"So if we can trespass, maybe the Commissioners will be good enough to give us some more of their time after 9 o'clock."
"Mr Gallagher, I cannot trespass on the beginning of the next session."
"I have already indicated to Mr Posselt that I will take his question and to Mrs Ţicău that I would take her question, and indeed the question from the three of you would have been the last one if we had been going quicker, but we are not."
"It is difficult for me now to take even Mr Posselt's question."
"That is the reality."
"I am really sorry and, as I said, I am angry but this is the situation we have been put in."
"You have seen what has happened all day with the agenda and it is not satisfactory."
"So I would like, if I may, to move, as I said, to the question put to Commissioner De Gucht and to be answered by Mr Šemeta, and I say with much regret that that will be the last question this evening."
"Subject: External trade and the Eastern Partnership"
"What is the Commission's assessment of the development of trade between the EU and Eastern Partnership countries, and what is the role of the Black Sea strategy and the countries of the Southern Caucasus in this?"
"Member of the Commission. - The global financial and economic crisis has negatively impacted on bilateral trade between the EU and the eastern partner countries."
"Overall, trade between the EU and six eastern partner countries declined between 2008 and 2010 by 20%."
"It must be recalled that the Eastern Partnership started being implemented when the financial crisis was in full swing."
"Its launching summit took place on 7 May 2009."
"In this early period, working structures were created and some first meetings of the multilateral platforms were being held."
"The Eastern Partnership was simply too young to soften the negative effects of the financial and economic crisis."
"As for the role of the Black Sea Synergy on trade with the EU, it can be said that it has been negligible as the Black Sea Synergy initiative is a regional cooperation framework, not a trade arrangement."
"The South Caucasus countries, individually or as a group, have not played any particular role in the development of trade between the EU and the Eastern Partnership countries."
"Preparations for future negotiations of a bilateral, deep and comprehensive free trade area are ongoing with Georgia and Armenia, while the trade provisions of the partnership and cooperation agreement with Azerbaijan are currently being upgraded."
"(DE) Thank you, Mr Šemeta, for your very precise answer."
"I will be very brief."
"Do you think that there are opportunities for increasing trade with the countries of the Southern Caucasus, among other things, by reducing the tension between them, and, in particular, with regard to the external energy policy?"
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, as I said in my reply, we are working on the issue of a deep and comprehensive free trade area, and we presented key recommendations to those countries on what they had to do in order to start negotiations on such agreements."
"Such agreements would, of course, constitute considerable progress, and if those countries do their homework - and at least some of them are really trying seriously to do it - then the prospects for intensifying trade will be much better."
"Madam President, I waited until you had finished the questions before I made an interruption because I knew you were stuck for time, but I, like my other colleagues, would like to put on the record of the House that this is a further diminishing of a key resource for Members - especially for backbench Members of this House."
"I think that it is wrong that you were put in the position whereby you were forced to cut us back, but likewise, I do not believe it is all the leaders' fault either, because the running of the schedule on the day is for whoever is in the Chair."
"Obviously, whoever was in the Chair before you allowed things to run out of kilter slightly, which put you in an embarrassing position."
"Maybe we could come to an agreement and you, with the Bureau and with the Vice-Presidents, could agree that this section, Question Time, is sacrosanct and that that will not be changed."
"If a debate needs to stop and resume after Question Time finishes, so be it."
"I will be putting that to my own Group leader, and I hope others will do the same, but I would also ask you to bring it up with the Bureau."
"I will be bringing it up with the group leaders because, I am sorry to say, that is where the problem lies: in the Conference of Presidents when they set the agenda."
"It is a question of too much material being put on the agenda before we get to Question Time."
"You are right."
"There needs to be some sort of line drawn to make sure that this period of time when Members can hold the Commission or the Council to account is honoured."
"I agree with you and I will be tapping away at my computer first thing tomorrow morning, I assure you."
"(RO) You said earlier that we would get to the question I submitted to Commissioner De Gucht."
"Unfortunately, I understand that the Commissioner has left and I have stayed here in the Chamber waiting to receive the reply."
"I believe that no procedure has even been followed and I do not understand what has happened."
"Mrs Ţicău, I wanted to take your question but I also said that the time constraint was that we had to stop at quarter to the hour and we reached that before we reached your question."
"That is the simple answer."
"I am sorry."
"As I say, I am not happy with the position that we have been put in, but there is nothing more I could have done tonight to try to get through more questions."
"I did not allow supplementaries in an attempt to achieve more for you, but I am sorry I have not been able to reach your question."
"Questions which have not been answered for lack of time will receive written answers (see Annex)."
"That concludes Question Time."
"(The sitting was suspended at 20:50 and resumed at 21:05)"
"Industrial policy for the globalised era (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Lange, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Industry, on an industrial policy for the globalised era."
"Madam President, Mr Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, this report presents the position of the European Parliament very clearly."
"I would like thank the shadow rapporteurs who have contributed to the report and the rapporteurs for the opinion of the relevant committees."
"Together, we have succeeded in conveying a clear message, Mr Tajani, which is that we want to move industrial policy closer to the centre of the political arena, for good reason."
"Industrial policy will help us, firstly, to create good quality, future-proof jobs in Europe and, secondly, to secure investment in Europe."
"Our competitors all over the world are making good use of industrial policy, for example, in the United States, China, Brazil and India."
"Thirdly, we are faced with challenges relating to sustainability, both in terms of the climate and the economic and social foundations of our society."
"Against this background, it is important for us to put industrial policy at the centre of the political arena."
"On the one hand, this means that we expect industrial policy to be integrated in such a way, Mr Tajani, that it becomes the focal point of legislative initiatives within the European Union."
"We do not want to see environmental, trade and competition policies being drawn up first and only subsequently being coordinated with the interests of European industry."
"On the contrary, we must define the other areas of policy on the basis of the strategic interests of a sustainable industrial policy."
"Secondly, Mr Tajani, we need better coordination between the industrial policies in the different Member States."
"Therefore, I would like to ask you, and we have included this in the report, to make use of Article 173(2) of the Treaty of Lisbon, in order to coordinate industrial policy in the Member States more effectively, so that we really are all moving in the same direction."
"We must, of course, focus on a number of specific areas."
"On the horizontal level, we need to look, in particular, at innovation policy throughout the entire value-added chain."
"We must succeed in supporting the entire economic chain, from fundamental research through to the market launch of products, and in bringing the best solutions for our society onto the market."
"We also need to pay more attention to resources."
"Simply saying that this is important is not enough."
"We need to introduce practical legislation which will significantly increase resource productivity."
"In industry, labour is responsible for 20% of costs and resources for 40%."
"That is a starting point for action on raw materials."
"The mobile phones that we all use contain rare earths and metals, which are seldom recycled."
"The recycling rate for mobile phones is only 1.5%."
"That is a starting point for creating jobs and increasing the competitiveness of European industry."
"I would like to make one last point in this context."
"Innovation and resource productivity will not happen by themselves."
"They depend on the employees who are involved."
"For this reason, a sensible industrial policy must also take into consideration the skills and the involvement of employees."
"If we can bring this about, then I am confident that we will have future-proof jobs in European industry."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Lange, for the work he has done."
"I know it is not easy in a Chamber organised like this one, with so many parliamentary groups, to succeed in arriving at a synthesis that will allow the debate on industrial policy to be wound up positively."
"I would therefore like to thank you for the work you have done because, if we truly want to put action to promote the real economy at the heart of our political action in favour of the social and market economy, we - the Commission, Parliament and the Council - must work together."
"I agree with your appeal for greater cohesion by the Member States, but there is an encouraging sign from the Council, which has, in fact, supported the Commission's position."
"In addition, in the countries where it has been possible to present the industrial policy document, there has been some willingness - albeit to varying degrees in the different countries - to take part in joint action under the governance of the industrial policy."
"As the Union does not want to impose decisions on the individual Member States, this is an attempt to coordinate their policies."
"This appears to me to be a move in the direction of your request, but it also confirms that Europe needs its own industry in order to address the immediate challenges of finding a way out of the crisis."
"We cannot think of overcoming our current difficulties - a situation that is being made worse by the ongoing crisis in the Mediterranean region - without solid action to promote our industrial and business policies, because they are the only ones that can enable us to develop and create new jobs."
"The report you have prepared, Mr Lange, rightly emphasises the economic, environmental and social challenges we face: in short, the sustainability of our industrial policy."
"It places sustainability on the same level as competitiveness, because these two dimensions are closely connected."
"Indeed, I am convinced that in today's world, these two aspects cannot exist without each other."
"To achieve this, we must also equip ourselves with modern, competitive industry that makes a clean break with the old method of industrial policy making."
"What does having modern industry mean?"
"It means having industry that is efficient in resource use, energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, which implies an economy aiming at becoming a green economy, via the route of a greener economy."
"This industry must also be accountable, tackling difficulties on the basis of constant and fruitful dialogue with the social partners."
"I believe a strong signal needs to be sent out that the 2010 industrial model cannot be one based on State aid and that, to be competitive in the era of global challenges, European industry cannot afford not to focus on innovation and research."
"That is why, before issuing the industrial policy document, the Commission presented its document on innovation policy, which I think is absolutely fundamental to the development of a genuine industrial policy and also helps identify paths to follow in the sector of raw materials research and innovation."
"It is not a coincidence that one of the innovation partnerships mentioned by the Commission is precisely about raw materials, researching ways to recycle and replace raw materials."
"It is therefore clear - not least because we will talk later about rare earths in the following debate - that innovation, raw materials and industrial policy are all part of a single strategy, and, to my mind, the revision of the Small Business Act also forms part of the same strategy."
"By putting this series of political and legislative acts into practice, therefore, the Commission is demonstrating that there is a will to implement political action in favour of industry and business."
"With regard to governance and industrial policy, I think the process is well under way, as I was saying before, both within the Commission and in the Member States."
"Within the Commission, as you know, President Barroso called on me at the beginning of the mandate to chair the group of Commissioners on industrial policy."
"I have called two group meetings so far, one before the communication was adopted to discuss political priorities, and the second to discuss the practical implementation of the communication, with particular reference to the competitiveness test and the standardisation strategy."
"I consider the group of Commissioners to be a special tool designed to provide political guidance and ensure that initiatives are consistent in terms of industrial policy."
"As regards the Member States, I believe the reaction has been positive."
"As I was saying, on 10 December 2010 with the Hungarian Presidency, we launched the first cooperation exercises on access to credit for small and medium-sized enterprises, which will be followed by other, similar exercises, in close cooperation with the Member States."
"We will continue to give you the necessary details for ongoing collaboration between Parliament and the Commission."
"Before I finish, Madam President, please allow me to say a word about the importance of supporting entrepreneurship among women."
"It is no coincidence that today is 8 March, and I have always said that we need more women entrepreneurs, but once they have decided to commit themselves, we must also be in a position at least to give them good advice."
"That is what we have decided to do by including an ad hoc action during the revision of the Small Business Act."
"The Network of Female Entrepreneurship Ambassadors that we have already launched will continue to exist, but we want to go beyond awareness raising."
"We want women entrepreneurs to be able to receive good advice from experts, and to this end, we are about to launch a consultation exercise in the very short term to support certain initiatives aimed at providing mentors for new female entrepreneurs who would like one."
"These people can give them concrete advice on starting up and then managing a business."
"The aim is to roll out this initiative in at least 10 Member States and then expand it to the rest of the 27."
"Commissioner, thank you for that small insight into women in business."
"I suppose it is not entirely a coincidence, given that today, 8 March, is International Women's Day, but, in any case, we welcome your initiatives in this regard."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, industrial policy is a key element for growth and employment in our regions and countries."
"At a time of severe economic crisis, therefore, we welcome the Commission's initiative to provide Europe with a common medium- to long-term approach, and we fully support Mr Lange's outstanding report for at least three reasons."
"The first is that the report takes an approach to the subject of industrial development that does not break down industrial and business interests into market sectors, but puts them together according to common objectives."
"The second reason is that it underlines the importance of regional structures through more effective support for clusters, innovation networks, knowledge transfer, research, and the improvement of skills and infrastructure development."
"The third reason - and I am finishing - is that it highlights the role and function of small and medium-sized enterprises, which are looking to Europe to find a way out of this crisis, which is liable to seriously jeopardise their future."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the economic and financial crisis has led many people to rediscover the central importance of industry."
"Despite your efforts, Mr Vice-President, the Commission has still not always realised that."
"A great many acts, of which the documents on the Europe 2020 strategy or certain free-trade agreements that have recently been approved or are under discussion will not be the last, are still biased towards the service economy and the strengthening and development of services, particularly in the financial, banking and insurance sectors."
"In contrast, the real economy is giving us opposite signals, as you have said."
"Production and exports are rising and we are witnessing a reversal of the trend for relocations."
"We must encourage these signals, since no great economy in the world can escape the central importance of industry."
"Hence, we need to complete the internal market and to speed up the implementation of strong initiatives in support of innovation and research, technology transfer, product traceability, protection of intellectual property and promotion of European production, not to mention effective rules against dumping and for true reciprocity in bilateral negotiations."
"This report is a step in that direction, and I am very grateful to Mr Lange and all those who have worked on it."
"Madam President, is there still a genuine ambition in the face of the deindustrialisation of the European Union?"
"We know that economies cannot prosper without heavy industry and that industry cannot exist without factories."
"We are all gathered together in this House to stand up for Europe's industrial jobs."
"There is no conceivable future for industry without confidence in scientific and technical progress."
"Therefore, at a time when Europe should be beginning extensive work to identify the Arianes and the Airbuses of 2050, the Commission has to realise that, with the crisis, the rules put in place are no longer suited to today's economy."
"The issues of free trade and free and undistorted competition have become dogmas."
"We cannot be the only economic area in the world to unilaterally apply free trade principles while having no idea of what our main competitors are doing."
"I therefore regret the fact, Commissioner, that there is a certain amount of nervousness when it comes to issues associated with strengthening the European Union's anti-dumping arsenal and to applying the general principle of reciprocity in trade with third countries."
"The worst situation is one where the European market is too open in the face of competing markets which are too closed."
"Furthermore, in the context of the fight against climate change, I would like it, Commissioner, if we could implement tools in addition to greenhouse gas emission allowance trading, such as the carbon inclusion mechanism at our borders."
"In this way, we could re-establish a balance so as to make relocations to third countries less attractive for our companies."
"We should improve the help available to our SMEs and reduce their costs; we should strengthen European patents and the fight against counterfeiting with 'made in' origin marking."
"Likewise, if Europe cannot access raw materials, we will no longer be able to talk about an innovative industrial policy."
"Our concern relates to education, training and research, as well as a culture of innovation and science, which must hold pride of place once more within the European Union."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I join all my fellow Members who have spoken in noting that we are at last talking about a common industrial policy again, and I hope action and also specific decisions will be forthcoming again soon."
"I am grateful for the Lange report, the excellent work done by our fellow Member, and Vice-President Tajani's communication."
"This decision means some important things, the first of which is that the revitalisation and recovery of Europe's economy and the resilience of employment, as has been said, depend partly, and perhaps especially, on the recovery of the whole manufacturing sector, both the more advanced and the more traditional parts of it, and on the support it is given."
"That is because it is still possible to push the boundaries in manufacturing, something that was not so obvious until a short time ago."
"Secondly, the recovery of industry in Europe also means that our competitiveness is not only in play in the financial or tertiary sector, but here as well, and it is not too late for us to take up the challenge to make Europe competitive in industry vis-à-vis the rest of the world."
"The third point, as has been said, is that the new industrial policy focuses on factors rather than sectors; it focuses on factors and instruments that can genuinely promote new companies and a new capacity for resilience and modernisation."
"I feel it is important to highlight once again these new factors on which we need to act: credit - we are calling for new initiatives in addition to those already announced by the Commissioner on the subject of credit - raw materials, energy prices, innovation, research, the need to enhance the capacity for the technological transfer of the results of research and innovation within companies in Europe, in new products and new ways of organising production."
"We must make good use of a highly unique industrial fabric in Europe, particularly in certain countries, which is that of small and medium-sized enterprises, the quality of enterprises and of their products, and the unique nature of European industry."
"I think we should rediscover these manufacturing traditions and manufacturing roots in many countries in order to innovate and change them."
"Lastly, there is the question of location, which is very important."
"European policies are successful if they find a region able to tackle them."
"We therefore thank Mr Lange and look forward to an excellent collaboration with the Commission in order to arrive at concrete results very soon."
"Madam President, Mr Tajani, thank you very much for your strong commitment to a European industrial policy."
"I have been looking over at Mr Lange and thinking that there has been a lot of commotion about an own-initiative report."
"A total of 500 amendments and 50 compromise proposals have been tabled with the aim of making industry in Europe a world leader again."
"We can only achieve this by means of an integrated and sustainable policy."
"We need to ensure that research and innovation are at the heart of our strategy."
"Therefore, we must put in place a regulatory framework which will support innovation and sustainability at the same time."
"The major challenge faced by your report was finding the right balance between environmental goals and economic competitiveness, while also avoiding protectionism."
"I am looking at Mrs Grossetête, because the French always want to introduce a touch of protectionism."
"At the same time, we need to support small and medium-sized businesses, promote the European patent and prevent knowledge theft, particularly with regard to China."
"We also want to see fewer regulations being imposed on European industry as a result of red tape."
"This means that we need to focus on reducing the amount of bureaucracy."
"Mr Lange, you have succeeded in covering this quite well in your report, so I would like to thank you for your hard work."
"However, this report can only represent the first step."
"We need to link the concept of industrial policy, which people in many Member States find it hard to discuss and which the Germans, in particular, have always been unwilling to talk about, with the competitiveness pact, which will be presented to the Heads of State or Government over the next few weeks in order to safeguard the euro area."
"If we do not manage to do this, then we will have a problem."
"We must coordinate areas such as cohesion, industry, trade, research and innovation, but also social issues, the climate and the environment."
"The current example of E10 in Germany demonstrates that this is not happening."
"This is all about adding bioethanol to petrol."
"The EU has put in place an important strategy, set itself the 20-20-20 targets, and we have said to the Member States that they must implement it."
"The Member States, and Germany in particular, were part of the decision-making process and supported everything that was decided."
"However, when it came to putting it into practice at home, they suddenly cut back the tax incentives and the consumers stopped cooperating."
"If we fail to convince consumers, as was the case in Germany with E10, then we will not be able to implement climate policy in combination with industrial policy."
"We need to have the consumers on our side."
"That is the central message."
"For this reason, I wish the industrial policy project every success."
"Madam President, the importance of Mr Lange's report has been somewhat over-emphasised as a result of the enthusiasm of many of the Members who have taken part in the discussion."
"The report covers almost everything and, in some places, contains contradictory information."
"Nevertheless, I believe that this report represents important progress."
"In the past, it was often the case that only the French or those on the left-wing who were in favour of strong state control spoke up in support of industrial policy."
"It was a taboo subject for everyone else."
"Now we are in the new position of having reached a basic consensus about the fact that we must have an industrial policy in Europe and that it must be a joint policy at a European level."
"I think that this is a significant step forward and I am grateful to Mr Tajani for highlighting this so clearly."
"We cannot go on as we did before and Mrs Grossetête is absolutely right about that."
"We cannot treat industrial policy as something which emerges almost by chance at the end of our free trade policy."
"We need to turn things back the right way up, but not on the basis of illusions of state control and not with the idea that the state must take a regulatory role and intervene directly in business."
"The state must create a sensible framework which promotes innovation and, in particular, environmental innovation, and which will allow progress to be made in these areas by exploiting competition."
"However, we do not want to see strong state control or protectionism."
"In future, we will only be able to ensure that European industry is in a strong position if we take seriously the task of environmental innovation on a central level."
"Therefore, I would like to say in conclusion, Mr Tajani, that I am very grateful to you for explaining that sustainability and competitiveness are not opposites, but must be put on the same footing and coordinated with one another."
"Madam President, the debate on industry is very important for Europe at the present time."
"The competitiveness of European firms depends on the continuing economic stability of Europe."
"We are all surely aware of these arguments, but on the other hand, we are constantly trying to take on commitments, be they in the form of extreme requirements for environmental protection or mandatory tax obligations to ensure financial stability."
"It is certainly important to assess the impact of industrial output on the environment in a stringent manner, but we must not indirectly burden industry with regulations that are almost overstated."
"This may lead to a situation where, in a globalised world, European industrial production is more weighed down by political decisions than is the case elsewhere"
"I consider the most important thing in the report to be the emphasis on the importance of supporting science, and research and innovation."
"Europe has long ceased to be a leader in the area of innovation."
"It is of fundamental importance to support innovative projects."
"I very much agree that there is a need to rework financial support procedures for innovative projects."
"Our aim should be to simplify the administration and, at the same time, to change the overall approach as well."
"It is essential to take account of the commercialisation of research and the financing of European funds."
"Madam President, it is time to defend the European Union's industries in every one of its countries."
"That requires a change in the positions that have been taken to date, in which the European Commission did not have the least concern for striking a balance between the need to defend a prosperous industry, specifically manufacturing industries, and international trade."
"Industrial production is fundamental to sustainable growth and employment in Europe, which necessitates another EU and external trade policy that defends our industries, including those that guarantee jobs in countries and regions where unemployment is already very high."
"To this end, it is essential to give full attention to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and to research and development; to take into account regional development, and the specific characteristics of each country and industrial sector; and to improve workers' qualifications and training."
"However, there are many contradictory positions in the report we are debating."
"While, on the one hand, it advocates defending industry and SMEs, on the other, it includes proposals calling for the liberalisation of international trade, on free competition, on the deepening of the internal market, and on public/private partnerships."
"However, such proposals do not defend our industries like they should, as the European reality has already demonstrated."
"We have therefore tabled some proposals to remove these most damaging aspects; we hope that they will be adopted tomorrow."
"We advocate industries that are efficient in terms of using resources that are less dependent on carbon, that value jobs with rights, and that guarantee equal rights for women in terms of access to jobs, to promotion, to wages, and to participation in management and administrative bodies."
"In order to guarantee all this, it is essential that there be an EU framework, and in that sense, the European Commission has an important role to play in terms of industrial policy, of external trade, of financial policy, and of research, science and innovation that supports SMEs, as well as in terms of commitment to training and reskilling workers, and to the dignity of those who work."
"Madam President, first of all, I, too, should like to congratulate Mr Lange on his very detailed report on industrial policy."
"Commissioner, the economic crisis has shown us that countries with an industrial base not only survive; they also prosper."
"Look at Germany, look at China, look at Spain."
"Spain is holding up under the economic crisis because it has an industrial base."
"My country, Greece, had an industrial base, Commissioner, but we have managed to wipe it out, for various reasons."
"I would like to focus on a very topical problem faced by Greek industry this week."
"Mr Trichet made a statement about a possible rise in the European Central Bank base rate within the next month."
"This caused a surge in the 3-month Euribor interbank rate, to which thousands of business loans in Greece are linked."
"In a single day, the Euribor registered its biggest increase since September 2008, causing massive problems to Greek businesses, which are already suffering under the recession."
"On the same day, however, the Europe director of the International Monetary Fund stated that the European Union's monetary policy will hold up and does not need to be tightened."
"We are not saying that Mr Trichet should not raise interest rates."
"However, there could be a smooth transition, to avoid this explosion in loans that we are seeing."
"Do you think you could intervene, Commissioner?"
"(HU) Madam President, I am pleased to note that there are several mentions in the report on industrial policy of the key importance small and medium-sized enterprises have with regard to European industry, European employees, and the present and future of us all."
"From now on, the facilitation of the operation of SMEs should be a priority in all documents and all subjects."
"These small companies create the majority of jobs, and have the highest capacity to reinvent themselves and take the greatest role in innovation and preventing the European economy from falling even further behind."
"Quite importantly, they pay the largest share of taxes into our budgets, meaning that it is largely they who sustain bureaucratic administrations."
"In return, bureaucracy, together with bankocracy, has created a legal institutional and economic environment which intends to make the operation of SMEs impossible."
"This short-sighted practice, which serves the profit-mongering of multinational companies, cannot go on any longer."
"The report is correct in stating that speculation on the financial markets must be prevented, but at this point, we need to do more than that."
"Express penalties should be imposed on those banks that do not facilitate the supply of funds to SMEs through their credit policies."
"The report also makes a passing reference to the fact that in the new Member States, industry is losing ground, and that the EU must find the means to halt unfair practices by large companies."
"We must state openly that over the past years, multinational companies of the old Member States, with the assistance of EU bureaucracy, bought out and ruined the majority of the manufacturing industries of the new Member States, and then bankrupted the companies operating there and took over their markets."
"The result is millions of people without a job and a future outlook, profits easily acquired in the east, and sizeable tax revenues in the west."
"Also, with the assistance of bureaucracy, much of the technology accumulated in Europe has unfortunately been transferred to China."
"(ES) Madam President, Commissioner, I would also like to start by thanking Mr Lange for his efforts in bringing together so many differing opinions and visions, a situation that is quite common in Parliament."
"I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs from the various political groups."
"In fact, this report tries to answer a question that has already been under consideration for a long time: do European industries have any future in a global world?"
"I think the answer is yes."
"Yes, because European Union countries are proving that they do."
"Yes, because there are also specific European industrial sectors that are proving that they do."
"All of this has to do with a number of aspects: some are related to the job market, because we need a flexible job market, not a rigid one; others are related to productivity, financial policies and tax incentives."
"However, allow me to highlight three that are now closely linked to the European Union itself."
"Firstly, the culture of innovation and entrepreneurship."
"These are two key issues."
"Enterprise and innovation are key elements of the future of any industry in Europe."
"Particular attention should be paid to young entrepreneurs."
"Secondly, strengthening the internal market and making sure it is competitive and, internally, based on free competition."
"Therefore, the subsidies still being given to transport, energy, and publicly owned businesses should be reduced so as to ensure free competition within the European internal market."
"Thirdly, respecting the conditions of competition within the international framework: when it comes to environmental policies and product sourcing, it is vital to compete on equal terms."
"We do not want protectionism within the European Union, nor do we want protectionism when our industry competes with third countries and third regions."
"(SV) Madam President, several of us participating in this debate have started by saying 'at last'."
"That probably says something about the status of industrial policy in the social debate and in politics for rather a long time."
"However, now industrial policy is back in any case - I think that is clear from this report, too."
"The service sector will continue to be important, but it is also becoming clear that it is highly dependent for its development on us having strong industrial production and a strong industrial sector."
"These two things go hand in hand."
"Thus, industrial policy is central to one of the most important political issues: work for everyone, full employment."
"However, if modern industrial policy stopped there, nothing would have happened over the last 25 years."
"Modern industrial policy is so much more than that."
"Today, it also involves playing a part in the major transition - the radical switch to environment and climate sustainability - and not posing a barrier to it, but actually contributing to this transition."
"This is currently an element in the competitiveness of industry - that is clear when you look at the investments that are being made in a number of our competitor countries."
"Access to raw materials is part of this - a requirement for industry therefore, but, at the same time, also part of the transition."
"It concerns everything from energy efficiency to resource management and recycling, for example, in the form of what we refer to as urban mining."
"Another key issue for a modern and sustainable industry is recurrent training programmes."
"We will not, and we must not, compete on the basis of low wages and poor working conditions, but on the basis of qualified and skilled people who work, and who want to work, in industry."
"(BG) Madam President, Commissioner Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, Europe can, and must, adopt a new path today, by creating a new integrated industrial policy."
"A crucial role in this will be played by the integration of all the factors in the European Union influencing industry."
"I will mention just some of them."
"Firstly, guaranteeing sustainable, long-term deliveries of key raw materials for developing Europe's high-tech sectors."
"In this context, I urge increased cooperation with third countries with an abundance of raw materials."
"Secondly, an economy based on innovation and the free movement of knowledge."
"I urge for the key link to be strengthened between education, vocational training and professional life."
"Europe produces the most PhD holders in the world, but fails to successfully convert their skills and knowledge into really practical market solutions."
"We must build European innovation centres where cooperation will be actively fostered between knowledge and the needs of the market."
"Thirdly, the transition to a low carbon economy is a key step."
"The high-tech edge Europe has will enable us to enjoy to the full the potential and benefits of the 'green' economy in the future."
"All these elements require a new level of cooperation between Member States and European institutions."
"Madam President, I would like to congratulate Mr Lange on an excellent report, and a substantive one, to make us think about the trends for industrial policy."
"As we come out of the biggest recession for the last 60 years, we really have to galvanise our industries to be competitive in global markets - backing small firms, boosting enterprise, and supporting all those who want to create jobs."
"So the linkage between innovation skills and sustainability is evident."
"Not necessarily by using funds - we can do this by strengthening the internal market, trade promotion and providing a supportive framework for innovation."
"Lastly, one element missing for me is the digital agenda."
"Everyone in Europe, every business, should have the right to have access to the best IT, mobile and broadband at super speeds."
"Were you aware, Commissioner, that South Korea fixed the aim last week to have, by the end of next year, Internet speeds plugged into every home that will be 200 times faster than those in the average household in the US?"
"As was said by one senior IT executive, for Europe's competitiveness, one has to realise that it is much better enhanced by investing in IT compared to physical infrastructure."
"(CS) Madam President, I would like to make just three comments."
"The first concerns the fact that Europe must aim for a pioneering spirit, so that technological priorities come first in some areas, in order to achieve not just comparative advantages, but also absolute advantages, because average quality products command average prices."
"Secondly, I would like to say that it is important to aim for two-way mediation between large and small systems, because concentrating on large systems will not bring the desired results."
"General Motors is an example of failure which cost US taxpayers USD 57.6 billion."
"The third issue is that industrial policy should not depend solely on the so-called political and economic élites, but should be based on a great stream of small innovations from below, in other words, large technological breakthroughs depend on a great number of small innovations which come from work collectives."
"(IT) Madam President, Vice-President Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, the title of this report already contains the keyword, in that it refers to an industrial policy."
"Over the last few years, if not decades, in Europe, we have witnessed a growing lack of political interest in this field, due to an exaggerated laissez-faire attitude towards the markets, in the belief that the whole system would regulate itself without interference."
"Political intervention means establishing rules to aid the presence of our companies in the market, and I am pleased to note that this report makes particular reference to small and medium-sized enterprises and the manufacturing sector, which has been abandoned all too often in the past."
"The proposed instruments of administrative simplification and easier access to credit are a step in the right direction."
"I would also like to highlight the part concerning fair competition with third countries, because in the past, we have been too permissive in this area, and entire basic sectors, such as the Tuscan textile sector, for instance - and I am quite sure of this because I am from Prato - have been brought to their knees by unfair competition that should certainly have been stopped and prevented at source."
"(DE) Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Lange and the shadow rapporteurs for their hard work."
"They have been successful in transforming the discovery which we all made during the crisis, namely, that industry is obviously more important than many people thought, into a report, and in ensuring that industrial policy is moved nearer to the top of the European Parliament's agenda."
"The fact that this debate is being held in the evening may be a disadvantage."
"This subject is so important that we need to talk about it at other times as well."
"As some Members have already said, industrial policy is not about the state intervening, but about it establishing the right framework."
"The state does not need to decide on the content of industrial policy or to distinguish between good and bad industry."
"Instead, it must create the opportunities for industry to develop within a framework."
"We must focus on those areas where we can really help in terms of innovation and research."
"I think it is very helpful that Mr Tajani has provided us with information which makes it clear that the question of competitiveness is of the utmost importance in many areas of European policy."
"In future, it will be very useful to use this as a criterion and to consider whether our political decisions will always, frequently or just often enough help or harm the development of industry in Europe."
"I would like us not only to have a report and a topic for further debate, but also to change the way we act after this and to take this subject seriously, because industry is important."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(DE) Madam President, I have a question for Mr Reul."
"This morning, we celebrated the 100th anniversary of International Women's Day."
"Against this background, I would like to ask you what opportunities you think are available for women in the industrial policy of the future."
"What chances do women have in industry, because I believe that we urgently need their contribution?"
"Which skills and qualifications would women be best advised to acquire in order to work in industry?"
"(DE) Madam President, I think they have excellent opportunities and, if necessary, I will deal with this issue myself."
"(ES) Madam President, the crisis has certainly highlighted the importance of industry as the driving force of the economy."
"Commissioner, we welcome the fact that the Commission has understood this, and has taken back industrial policy for the Union."
"Our rapporteur, whom I wish to congratulate on his excellent work, has already explained how we interpret the transition to an industrial policy that is smart, resource-efficient, and sustainable from an environmental and social viewpoint."
"Of what he said, I would just like to emphasise one aspect that I consider to be crucial: human capital."
"Assuming that every job should be 'green', it is vital for European workers to have the appropriate skills, not only to improve the competitiveness of our industry, but also so that no worker is left by the wayside."
"We have a strong foundation: young Europeans have never been so well prepared, and yet we lack engineers, we lack young entrepreneurs, and we lack innovative policies for managing human resources."
"We should therefore encourage synergies between those universities with a strong entrepreneurial culture and companies that are truly driven by knowledge."
"With regard to training, we need to adjust work skills to the demands of the new economy and to do so in a way that is economically accessible for workers and businesses."
"Also, industry should place greater emphasis on organisational innovation, understood as a more flexible and dynamic sharing of risks and responsibilities within companies."
"Only then will it be able to incorporate and capitalise on the talent and knowledge of its workers."
"Finally, allow me to say a word as a member of a group that has opposed the launching of an enhanced cooperation on the EU patent, because we think it affects the internal market, territorial cohesion and legal certainty."
"The Court of Justice of the European Union has supported this position in Opinion 1/09 published on 8 March 2011, which concludes that the draft agreement establishing a European and Community Patents Court is not compatible with the provisions of the Treaty."
"(FI) Madam President, Commissioner, first of all, I wish to congratulate the rapporteur for an excellent and very important report."
"This is actually largely a matter of how we can bring competitiveness to European industrial policy and, on the other hand, how we can respond to the structural change that has come about through job cuts in basic industry in certain areas."
"I believe that industrial policy is part of the change."
"We need to see this change and we also have to be able to adapt to it."
"We have to look forward in industrial policy and create a sustainable one based on our own European strengths and our regional resources."
"An example of this is the bioenergy sector, where there is a good deal of potential in Europe, I believe."
"Regional structures will allow us to support a sustainable industrial policy in Europe, and because of this, we need to stress the importance even more of innovative clusters and broad cooperation between actors, educational institutions and companies."
"When speaking about a European industrial policy, it is, of course, very important to include the SME sector - small and mediumsized enterprises."
"We need to be able to reduce red tape for SMEs, as has been said here on many an occasion, and do everything we can to support opportunities for SME entrepreneurship, both now and in the future."
"(FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the report highlights, at last, industry's key role in the Union's future and confirms the need for a European industrial policy."
"It implicitly recognises the Lisbon strategy fiasco by rightly asking for 3% of the Union's gross domestic product to be dedicated to research and development and by proposing, above all, that the private sector be heavily utilised."
"Unfortunately, it still has a vision of competitiveness that is focused on a deadly cut in labour costs, when we actually need to develop competitiveness based on training, capital savings, energy and raw materials."
"The report also implicitly admits the failure of the financial markets to channel savings into investments that will create wealth."
"Resolving this problem requires social control of credit or credit requisition for the benefit of employment, research and development, and wealth creation."
"We need European and national public financial centres to guarantee industrial financing."
"Our Parliament cannot simply take action to ensure that the large European industrial groups do better."
"Our main objective must be to provide more and better quality industrial jobs in the Union."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe has never had to rethink its industrial policy as much as it needs to now, and it must also reconsider certain decisions made in the recent past."
"This flagship initiative linked to the Europe 2020 strategy has therefore been both useful and timely, and for this I am grateful to the Commission and to Commissioner Tajani in particular."
"I also thank the rapporteur, Mr Lange, for the work he has done and my colleague Mrs Grossetête, who, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), made a significant contribution towards reinforcing the positions put forward by the Commissioner."
"For my part, I decided to make my contribution with amendments illustrating the role of small and medium-sized enterprises, which are considered by everyone to be the anchor chain of Europe's basic industry, the part that knows best how to stand firm at times of crisis and how to innovate while keeping prices competitive."
"I believe the role played by thousands of small and medium-sized European entrepreneurs needs to be supported with solutions to the difficulties and constraints that they have pointed out on several occasions: I am referring to better access to credit, the possibility of more transparent and less costly participation in public calls for tender and, above all, administrative simplification across the board, which everyone regards as the real revolution that this continent now needs."
"I am pleased that the Commission has highlighted the subject of efficient and responsible raw material use, and I also consider it important that we are going to discuss rare earths soon. The attention devoted to the subject of intellectual property protection is significant."
"I can finally see a route marked out that I hope will soon lead us to set standards and guarantees that are valid throughout the European Union."
"That means offering hope, especially to young people, through the answers that Europeans themselves often suggest."
"(FR) Madam President, I would like to thank Bernd Lange for his excellent work."
"Tomorrow, his collaborative method will be crowned with success."
"Moreover, Commissioner, this is an opportunity for the Commission, which provided us with a rather disappointing communication."
"As someone who hails from a large region heavily hit by the crisis, when it had already been affected by industrial restructuring, I have listened to the message of the unions, which have constantly challenged us."
"We need an industrial policy, all of whose components work towards the same goal: constructing a strategy that is based on sustainable, employment-centred growth that is built around the optimisation of skills and which shows that social and technological innovations are compatible with each other."
"That is the key to European competitiveness and not the use of the workforce as an adjustment variable, as the Commission proposed in the European semester."
"The best move the Commission could make is to rapidly integrate the Posting of Workers Directive into the work programme and to begin fiscal harmonisation starting with corporate taxation."
"Furthermore, this policy should take shape not only at national and European level, but also at local level in the context of an effective cohesion policy."
"Our choice is a regulated financial market, and we share the desire to consolidate the single market, but not at the expense of an inequitable labour market which is subject to social dumping."
"Today, Madam President, we are debating an ambitious industrial policy, and this morning, we voted on a tax on financial transactions, and on Eurobonds."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we must use these means to finance it."
"(PT) Madam President, Commissioner, I should like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Lange, and the shadow rapporteurs on the work they did, Mrs Grossetête in particular."
"Europe is currently finding its competitiveness in global markets decreased."
"As such, Europe needs to find ways of strengthening its industrial base to face up to new challenges."
"This report's very goal is tabling proposals to relaunch European industry."
"An integrated and sustainable industrial policy must be based on scientific research, on innovation, on increased resource efficiency, on a commodities strategy, on reinforcing SMEs, and on developing regional networks."
"In particular, it is essential for energy efficiency and the introduction of information and communication technologies to constitute the basis of this new industrial revolution, so as to increase competitiveness, economic growth and employment."
"I particularly welcome the emphasis given in the report to traditional European industry, which is essential to our economy."
"Measures such as the introduction of new technologies and increased reinforcement of scientific research and innovation in sectors such as the manufacturing industry are of crucial importance."
"This is the only way that we will be able to return Europe to global leadership, which is so necessary for Europe's competitiveness and economic growth."
"(NL) Madam President, first of all, I would like to congratulate my fellow Member, Mr Bernd Lange, on an excellent report and on the fantastic cooperation on his part."
"Industrial policy is making a comeback."
"It is not, however, making a solo comeback, because it is not alone."
"Together with two other flagships, two other strategies, this strategy stands at the heart of the European agenda for jobs and a healthy economy."
"Most of all, though, it is a strategy, not just for the present, but for the future, too, a viable future."
"Industrial policy should be considered together with all the other strategies, concerning the Union of Innovation, raw materials and the efficient use of natural resources."
"These three form the core."
"It must be a holistic approach, where different policy areas work closely together."
"However, are they really different policy areas, given that industry - as you, yourself, Commissioner, have said - is not the enemy, but the ally of sustainability?"
"Industrial policy cannot function without an integrated market."
"The internal market is still too fragmented and requires completion."
"The whole industry, especially small innovative companies, stand to benefit from that."
"Producers are allowed to offer their opinions, but they must also accept responsibility, and that means ultimate responsibility for the product."
"The aim is to promote clean production and sustainable products, because I believe that this, ultimately, is the future of Europe."
"It will help us create cradle-to-cradle industry and encourage intelligent use of raw materials and a healthy economy."
"Industrial policy has been neglected and left to the market for too long."
"It is time that we set an example again, both for others and for ourselves."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, I should like to thank you for the attention given to industrial matters and to pay tribute to the tremendous work accomplished by my fellow Member, Mrs Grossetête, on behalf of our political group."
"Industry accounts for 60 million jobs plus two extra jobs in related services for each job in industry, that is to say, 180 million jobs in total."
"It accounts for three quarters of our exports, namely 5.5 million enterprises."
"What must we do?"
"We have to act and to protect ourselves."
"Self-protection is not protectionism; we must therefore have an industrial policy."
"Some say: agriculture in South America, industry in China and services in Europe."
"Ladies and gentlemen, if we do not manufacture more cars, more planes, more ships, more trains, more satellites, more medicines, more nuclear power stations, we will be ruined!"
"As for services, we will have them because we will have an industrial policy."
"I would therefore like to make three proposals."
"The first relates to industry standards."
"Whenever we set industry standards, we must have impact studies to ensure that our products are manufactured in accordance with these standards on EU territory."
"The second concerns education and research."
"We must have the best engineering schools in the world and we must support them."
"We must reconcile the public with science."
"As regards research, we are going to review the Seventh Framework Programme."
"We have EUR 30 billion to spend in 2011, 2012 and 2013."
"Let us allocate a portion of these envelopes to industry as a matter of priority."
"The third is funding."
"We could create a European Industrial Investment Fund."
"I have a suggestion to make."
"We owe EUR 37 billion to the pensions of EU staff; let us put this fund into a pension fund, which would be a long-term savings vehicle."
"I share the view on monetary policies."
"Let us be very cautious about exiting the crisis."
"Let us ensure that we do not have interest rates that are too high, which would result in a strong euro and put a brake on industrial exports."
"(NL) Madam President, Commissioner, the manufacturing industry remains important, even in the knowledge-based economy of today and tomorrow."
"Maintaining high-value production in Europe remains essential and, at the same time, it is a mainstay of the knowledge and learning of many people in our countries and of the continued development of our competitiveness."
"This report rightly sets industry high on the European agenda and that is important for both large industry and small and medium-sized enterprises."
"In Europe, we can boast excellence in many fields."
"I am thinking of the energy, space travel and automotive industries, which are all doing splendidly at the moment."
"Then I am also thinking of the automotive industry's supply chain, which is essential for Europe."
"Just look how clever and clean the EU 2020 strategy is!"
"However, I do have one concern, and that is globalisation."
"We have rightly established The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund and we will soon have the European patent."
"Nevertheless, Commissioner Tajani has put the issue of the necessity of a worldwide level playing field on the agenda."
"It is great that Chinese companies are investing in Europe, but we should have a level playing field there."
"If it is, indeed, the case that large government funds are being invested in this, then something is wrong."
"Returning to protectionism is not one of our goals - as Mr Audy has just said - but this is about ensuring the necessary transparency in key sectors, such as the ICT and other key European sectors."
"This is not a European veto."
"We are not saying 'these are the shareholders, those are the supervisors', but it is really important that we, representing Europe, look into this properly."
"It would not be out of place to start a debate on this, in response to Mr Lange's excellent report."
"It will continue."
"Commissioner Tajani, I wish to invite you to join in that debate."
"(NL) Madam President, with the Lange report, you, Commissioner, will tomorrow most likely see Parliament standing fairly united on the importance of industrial policy."
"For you, as Commissioner, that must be a real shot in the arm."
"There is considerable consensus amongst the various groups that industrial policy in Europe has a future and that it should be supported."
"That is the extent of that consensus, however, because, if we were to try to establish what kind of industrial policy we mean and which of its elements should be retained in the future, then we would all disagree."
"You yourself have referred to the fact that we need an industry which uses less energy and fewer materials."
"I am with you on that, as far as short-term objectives are concerned."
"Regarding the long-term objectives, we need to make a much bigger leap."
"As you know, Commissioner, management means looking ahead."
"We must have the courage to say that, by 2050, we will have an energy supply system which is wholly based on renewable and sustainable energy and we have to start preparing industry for that now."
"Secondly, material management."
"We must, indeed, ensure that these mobile phones are more effectively recycled over the next few years, but in the future, we have to ensure that we manufacture mobile phones which are completely embedded in a cradle-to-cradle-concept, so that all the essential components of that mobile phone are systematically recovered and used to produce new mobile phones."
"It is that kind of overall policy that needs to be developed by 2050 and I expect the Commission to take decisions now that will ensure that industry has a clear framework to work towards."
"(IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think the text of the Lange report is balanced and its main merit is that it centres its examination on certain crucial factors, in particular, the revival of the European industrial policy and the shift in focus from financial activities to the real economy."
"It should be noted, however, that those services linked directly or indirectly to companies are an integral part of them."
"I have a few criticisms and proposals to make."
"With regard to paragraph 89 on enhanced cooperation on the European patent, I believe, Mr Tajani, that the single European patent is essential and indispensable, especially for us Italians."
"The deadlock that has been created through enhanced cooperation can, in my view, only be broken by taking the European patent forward just in English, because using three languages would create an unheard-of precedent."
"My second consideration is the lack of any innovative financing proposals."
"The text often mentions the need to move swiftly towards the building of trans-European infrastructures, which are crucial for the continent's development, but it says little about how to finance those networks."
"Earlier today we adopted an own-initiative report analysing in depth the system of project bonds in a public/private partnership system, which would thus offer guarantees on securities issued by the companies that are set up to build and run such infrastructures;"
"Mr Audy has just quoted some examples."
"There is no reference to the link between the European Union's industrial policy and strategic policies for the Union such as Galileo, ITER and others."
"There needs to be a greater link between research and innovation."
"Mr Tajani, I believe the challenge facing us is of vital importance for maintaining the social context."
"In fact, the slight recovery that we have seen cannot reabsorb the number of people made redundant over the last three years."
"It is, unfortunately, necessary to act in time and quickly."
"(FR) Madam President, the excellent report by Mr Lange has three positive features."
"Firstly, it proposes an integrated industrial strategy for the European Union; that is to say, a strategy at once continental and cooperative, which differs in all respects from the narrowly national and non-cooperative policies in operation in Europe for the last 15 years."
"Secondly, this industrial strategy is financed, which is in marked contrast to the 2000 Lisbon strategy."
"If it were not financed, it would remain empty words."
"The main source of this funding is EU project bonds, Eurobonds and euro projects."
"In voting this morning, we faced up to that."
"Thirdly, this strategy protects our industries."
"This report is for opening up Europe; it is against giving it away."
"It is for exchanges founded on reciprocity and balance."
"Several articles focus on these issues."
"This is absolutely crucial because, in this area, we appear naive and weak."
"(HU) Madam President, Commissioner, during the crisis, we could see for ourselves how important the role of industry is in our economy."
"Unfortunately, our relevant policies are still often based on the idea that markets must regulate themselves."
"In this respect, the Europe 2020 strategy is a pioneering initiative, the first to acknowledge the need for a new approach."
"European industry must retain its leading position in key areas, and must not be allowed to lag behind events."
"We must treat the new structure of the financial sector and the coordination of the fiscal macro-economy as priorities, because only through their reform can we ensure the success of our industrial policy."
"We need a new, comprehensive regulatory framework which can steer the financial system back to productive investments."
"An industrial base that is competitive on a global scale and a knowledge-based industry focused on production must be at the heart of our industrial policy."
"To this end, however, we will need the entire innovation chain."
"In this case, we should not only talk about technological innovation, but about the innovation of product design and quality as well."
"Furthermore, we must encourage synergies within the sector."
"These include the link between energy policy and industrial policy."
"Energy supply is an essential factor, and the new, growing markets lie in renewable energy sources, which may consequently result in the creation of new jobs."
"Reliable access to raw materials is also crucial, and faces us with an increasingly serious challenge."
"In addition to securing already existing resources, we must also be able to realise our recycling efforts."
"We must also do everything in our power to strengthen SMEs, as they are key actors in European industrial production."
"We must encourage their highest possible participation in public procurement and must provide them with access to favourable bank loans."
"Madam President, first of all, I would like to congratulate Mr Lange on the completion of this important report."
"It is very important during these times of economic austerity that the European institutions are pushing for a strong cohesive industrial policy to maintain jobs in Europe and to encourage renewed competitiveness."
"Vice-President Tajani has stated that industry is at the heart of Europe and is indispensable for finding solutions to the challenges of our society today and in the future."
"The S&D Group position is that industry plays a key role for jobs in Europe."
"This is why we must enhance efforts to maintain a strong industrial base in Europe."
"I am specifically concerned about developing the necessary infrastructure where it does not exist."
"Finally, I am glad to see that the final report strongly advocates the significance of raw materials in the industrial sector of the future."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I offer my congratulations to Commissioner Tajani on the work that has been done and also to the rapporteurs."
"I am in favour of this important report, which represents Parliament's contribution to the debate on Europe's industrial policy."
"There are many positive points in it, which I strongly support."
"First of all, I think every possible effort must be made to reaffirm the key role of European industry on the world stage and to offer particular support to small and medium-sized enterprises, which form a vital pillar in the internal market."
"In addition, I fully agree with what the report says about the urgent need to introduce European provisions regarding origin marking in order to make companies more competitive and to enable European consumers at last to make informed choices about products normally associated with a reputation for quality."
"Unfortunately, it is well known that some states have been opposed to this specific point in the Council since 2005."
"We must, however, try to break this deadlock, based on the strongly favourable position adopted by Parliament on several occasions, and this is important during the legislative process of a number of EU acts."
"The voice of the European public cannot be ignored again, especially when it is based on such solid foundations: it is a question of making our policies more democratic."
"Another important point is surely the one concerning young entrepreneurs - whom you, Commissioner, referred to more than once in your report - because I believe they are truly the future of our industrial policy."
"I still have doubts about certain aspects, such as the explicit reference to new legislation on resource efficiency, the creation of task forces at national level to manage restructuring operations, and especially enhanced cooperation on the European patent."
"(ET) Madam President, I would first like to thank the rapporteur."
"Europe needs a new approach to industrial policy and the funding of programmes related to it."
"In addition to the structural reforms in the European Union's financial perspective, the emphasis should be on innovative financing measures."
"I am not only talking about Eurobonds or project bonds, but about completely novel approaches to industrial policy, science and the funding of innovation."
"We must take innovative small businesses and help them grow."
"We must find new ways to help companies to share risks and combine various instruments, including on a pan-European basis"
"Estonia has experience, for example, with revolving funds, which guarantee risk, rather than giving out grants and direct assistance."
"In the innovation cycle, these funds have facilitated a considerable increase in such funding for businesses."
"Grants are important, but what is more important, in the basic research phase, is to find new ways to use public money more effectively."
"(RO) Madam President, the EU's industrial policy must create an adequate framework for boosting the industrial sector's contribution to EU GDP."
"It must also improve the European Union's competitiveness and create jobs across the whole Union."
"Industrial strategy must identify the strategic areas in which we will invest, as well as the necessary raw material sources."
"I call on the Commission and Member States to ensure that these priorities are supported by the future financial perspective, the annual budgets and EU sector policies."
"Energy consumption is an industrial production indicator."
"We need an eco-efficient industrial policy, providing production capacity across the EU in a sustainable manner and reducing the Union's energy dependency."
"The Union's competitiveness depends largely on its capacity for innovation, research and development and on the link between innovation and the production process."
"Public funding must be increased for research and development in order to mobilise private investment, while simplifying procedures and cutting red tape are a prerequisite for industry's increased involvement."
"(HU) Madam President, the economic crisis has demonstrated that the service sectors are far more vulnerable than industrial policy, and Europe must therefore once again focus on the latter."
"I therefore very much welcome both the attitude of Commissioner Tajani and the report of our colleague, Mr Bernd Lange, on this subject."
"It has been a pleasure working on this report."
"Every one of the participants wanted to add something to it."
"We were not arguing about what the difficulties were, but rather about how we could accelerate this process."
"It is imperative that we understand that the European Union must play a leading role in setting its own goals, and also in pulling the Member States along on this road."
"The European Union must coordinate, lead and hold the Member States to account for what they have achieved in this area."
"Industrial policy provides Europe with the opportunity to gain a competitive advantage in manufacturing industries, biotechnology, nanotechnology, the chemical industry, or even in fields related to the aerospace industry."
"We must understand that in the industrial policy of the 21st century, the intensity of knowledge and the efficiency of material use are increasing."
"At the same time, we must strengthen vertical relationships, from education to research to market opportunities."
"Supplier relations, including small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as horizontal relations, must be established."
"We believe that social dialogue cannot be circumvented."
"(ES) Madam President, this report on industrial policy, on which we will vote tomorrow, includes a point that will not be supported by the Spanish Members because it welcomes enhanced cooperation as an appropriate legal instrument for the establishment of a single EU patent."
"It is not only the Spanish Members, but also others from different Member States who, firstly, call into question the legality of enhanced cooperation as an appropriate legal instrument in this case, and, secondly, condemn the failure to observe the rule of unanimity, which should be applied to all issues relating to the rules governing languages."
"However, my reason for asking to speak, Madam President, was to draw Parliament's attention to Opinion 1/09 published today by the Court of Justice of the European Union, which states that the European and Community Patent Court, as is currently being proposed, is not compatible with the Treaties."
"The clear position expressed by Court of Justice is a considerable obstacle to this enhanced cooperation, and I hope this decision will encourage other Members to join us in order to defend the equality of all Member States and the rigorous application of EU primary law."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the report on the industrial policy is thorough, examines all the weaknesses in the system, and points us in the direction of respect for the principles of the social market economy."
"Realistically, however, we have to accept that Europe has not had its own industrial policy so far."
"In fact, productivity in the manufacturing sector in Europe is going through difficult times, while emerging countries are not only growing but also investing heavily in research and technology."
"To make industry and employment grow in Europe, we need to deploy special measures in addition to the current rules, even to the extent of reviewing the distribution of competences between the Member States and the Union."
"Redistribution policies and systems also need to be reviewed in line with a new cultural approach to industrial relations, with the company profit-sharing model at the focus of our reflections."
"The Europe 2020 strategy sets out goals that the European Union cannot afford to miss and, if it is to achieve all the targets set, Europe must overcome the challenge of industrial growth by strengthening training and research in support of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for this very important report."
"It is good to see that industry is back on Europe's agenda."
"I think that what we need is a balanced European economy."
"I speak mainly on agriculture and food policy, but I was moved to participate in this debate because I think talking about industry and agriculture and services is really important."
"Europe needs a balance of all three and not to recognise that would be very foolish."
"I want, in particular, to draw attention to paragraph 112, which talks about free trade being the cornerstone of Europe's economic growth, but also talks about fair global competition and, in particular, urges that, when we come to do bilateral trade agreements or multilateral agreements, we must take account of the principles of sustainable development, social and environmental concerns and relevant standards in those agreements."
"Those of us on the agriculture side would say the very same."
"So I think this is an important report on all fronts."
"(PL) Madam President, one of the decisive factors affecting industrial growth in the European Union is the trend towards a 'green economy'."
"This is good news."
"However, the way in which the current EU regulations operate is blind and arbitrary, resulting in the opposite effect, or, in other words, limiting our progress towards this goal."
"The European copper industry has become an example of such an adverse impact."
"There can be no question about the fact that both the Climate and Energy Package and the benchmarks directive will cause a drop in the production of copper, which, as we all know, is a metal which is in great demand for innovative and energy-efficient technologies, particularly in relation to electricity transmission and heat transfer in heat exchangers."
"I would like to ask the Commissioner whether it is not time - while we still have time - at least to revise certain aspects of these regulations, and to stop these destructive measures?"
"(IT) Madam President, Commissioner Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, the deep international economic crisis has hit industry especially hard."
"The idea that the markets should regulate themselves has been proved wrong."
"Europe has lacked the ability to give a unified response or to perform an economic analysis."
"Europe therefore needs to equip itself with a solid, competitive and diversified industrial base."
"Europe's new industrial policy must be able to look to the future by taking a global approach to its own policies aimed at reaffirming the core importance of industry, especially manufacturing, which must continue to be the driving force of our economy and to prompt new intelligent, sustainable and inclusive modes of growth."
"I endorse and congratulate Mr Lange on his report, which examines all these factors and provides some interesting food for thought."
"(SK) Madam President, the global economy has been going through major changes for a long time now."
"In addition to traditional industrial zones, powerful new industrial centres are growing."
"A strong competitive environment is developing, in which we will have to try harder and harder to maintain meaningful employment for our citizens."
"In this competition with other industrial centres, we are disadvantaged by two serious drawbacks."
"The first comprises the enormous differences in the legal environment which regulates ways of doing business, dispute resolution or the enforcement of obligations, and these differences prevent a broader opening up of cross-border business through the jurisdictions of the Member States."
"This is related to the second drawback - the excessive bureaucracy, which not only consumes the money generated by industry while producing no added value, but even harasses those on whose labour it lives, by means of all kinds of statements, regulations and guidelines."
"Commissioner, none of the rapidly developing countries have the kind of administrative juggernaut that we have in Europe."
"Madam President, honourable Members, I believe the fact that so many MEPs are present for an evening sitting shows just how important industrial policy is for all of us, and, since there is consensual agreement, how right it is to put industrial policy and enterprise policy - basically the real economy, which is also the internal market, innovation, competition and social policy - at the heart of our political action to end the crisis and to create development and jobs."
"I say this because we must not believe - and I think I have been clear both in the course of my speech and in the report on industrial policy that I presented to the Commission - that enterprise and industry are merely economic capital, because they are also human capital, the region, the local community in which they operate."
"As I also said during my hearing before Parliament prior to my appointment as Industry Commissioner, this is my vision - a broader vision - which stems from a concept that is part of the Treaty of Lisbon, namely, the social market economy."
"The ultimate aim of all our actions, both in terms of economic policy and in terms of the real economy, is social policy."
"Our objective is not to enrich entrepreneurs or investors, although the enrichment of investors is one instrument for responding to the citizens of the European Union."
"We now have to apply and defend the choices we have made and are making - which are contained in the Europe 2020 document - with a strong effort to apply the political choices that we have made."
"I am not concealing from you, nor from myself, the dangers that still exist."
"Speculators are still active, and I do not rule out the possibility that they may still try to have one last throw of the dice."
"It must be very clear that we are on the side of the real economy."
"Speculation that enriches only those who perform a transaction is very different from the action of a business or industry that creates prosperity for many citizens."
"However, we must remain vigilant, and work and apply our industrial policy."
"Consequently, the Commission's industrial policy document contains a series of competitiveness tests that will be used to monitor the application of a serious industrial policy, which will allow our entrepreneurial system to take up the challenge in the globalised era."
"Nor am I avoiding the question asked by Mr van Nistelrooij: I believe that the game must always be played on a level field and according to the same rules."
"Madam President, when Anderlecht plays Liège, the rules must be the same whether it plays at home or away, and the same principle must also apply to our industrial system."
"When our industries play in Europe, they must see the same rules applied as when they play outside the European Union."
"I believe that this is a good rule for defending not only the market, competition and growth, but also the rights of workers in the European Union."
"Yet when it comes to defending the European industrial system, I believe that it is right to support the principle contained in the document that we are discussing in favour of origin marking."
"I consider that Parliament is once more giving a strong signal in harmony with the European Commission."
"There are doubtless many other things that need to be done to reduce the bureaucratic burden on companies and industry."
"As the revised Small Business Act states, we have to reduce the time taken to set up a business and we have to cut red tape, which can be excessive and which crushes the will to do business."
"We have to help young people to become entrepreneurs, and we need to do a great deal of work in connection with training."
"I therefore believe in the importance of clusters, where schools, universities, SMEs, large companies, research and innovation work together to enhance the competitiveness of our entrepreneurial system."
"We already have 2 000 clusters in Europe, and I believe that this pilot scheme must be rolled out."
"With regard to access to credit, a great deal has been done, but we can do more."
"I am very pleased to hear that the Managing Director of the London Stock Exchange - the United Kingdom is one of the countries where much has been done to help services, banks and finance - will take full part in the credit access forum organised by the European Commission to show that the world of finance, or part of the world of finance, wants to participate in the growth and development of SMEs and our industrial system."
"This signal from London - and it is not the only signal to have come from the United Kingdom - makes me hopeful that this trend will be reversed."
"We need this to happen in Europe in order to help the real economy."
"With regard to raw materials - a topic that has arisen in several debates - I am absolutely convinced that we must continue along the road taken."
"The European Commission has issued a document and there will be a debate, as a result of which we are now working on part of the raw materials issue."
"As I said in my first speech, I am totally in favour of conducting research into raw materials recycling."
"We can also work on finding substitutes for rare raw materials."
"Therefore, in an activity also linked to our innovation policy, one of the innovation partnerships envisaged by the European Commission relates precisely to innovation in the raw materials sector."
"I repeat, recycling and substitution are areas which I believe we should continue to explore in order to provide our industry with specific responses, including international policy initiatives, as I have said on many occasions."
"Following the agreement with the African Union and after opening a debate with the Russian Federation on the issue of raw materials, I shall travel to Latin America at the beginning of June to discuss the raw materials issue with Brazil, Argentina and Chile."
"Europe must give industry and the SME sector a specific response in this respect."
"Therefore, we must continue to work on implementing the Small Business Act."
"There is a great deal to do; we have asked all the Member States to appoint an SME ambassador, as the European Commission has done."
"The signals being received are positive; some countries have already appointed an ambassador, or have indicated their intention to do so, and in a broader context, too, because we must not separate large-scale industry from SMEs."
"The growth of the real economy is linked to the internal market, industrial policy and SME policy."
"Since the role of the unions has been mentioned several times, I will conclude by saying that, for the first time, an Industry Commissioner has met representatives of industry, SMEs and the unions to discuss restructuring policy."
"A new season of debate has begun, one that will see workers' and employers' representatives sitting together round a table in meetings organised by the European Commission, to promote economic growth and the greater good of all EU citizens."
"Commissioner, I have taken due note of your allusion and reference to the Belgian football championship, but I hope that I do not have to take them as some kind of prediction."
"Madam President, Mr Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for your many inspiring contributions."
"Mr Tajani, the four key messages which bring us together are clear."
"Firstly, we want to ensure that industrial policy lies at the heart of EU policy."
"Secondly, we want to link together sustainability and competitiveness and develop them further."
"Thirdly, we must not take a dogmatic approach, because this area cannot be regulated by the market alone or by the state alone."
"We need practical, sensible measures."
"Fourthly, this is just the beginning and not the end of the discussion on modernising industrial policy in the European Union."
"We are extending a hand to you, Mr Tajani, but we are also aware that we must take you at your word."
"We are expecting concrete legislative proposals and also concrete measures to provide financial support, particularly in the field of research."
"Mr Tajani, if we are successful, and if the hand that we are extending to you and the statement that you have made are compatible, perhaps we will find ourselves in a situation similar to that at the end of the wonderful film 'Casablanca', when Humphrey Bogart says to the police captain: 'I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship!'"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11:30 on Wednesday, 9 March 2011."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"The internalisation of trade and supranational corporations are some of the many aspects of globalisation."
"When discussing the EU's industrial policy, we must answer the following question: what kind of industry does Europe need - a corporate, branch-driven industry, characterised by large-scale mass production, or small-scale regional industry, or maybe even national industry?"
"Large, supranational corporations, which can sometimes be richer than some countries, accumulate huge profits, and also taxes, including VAT, in one location, most frequently their place of origin."
"Apart from employment, the countries in which production takes place are left with only expenses."
"Fiat, for example, is a supranational corporation which generates revenues equal to 4% of Poland's GDP in statistical terms, but its profits and the majority of its tax revenues go towards another budget."
"On top of this, the company has recently transferred the production of its Panda cars to Italy, for political and national reasons, since it can certainly not be for economic reasons."
"A conflict of interests is apparent here."
"The social situation is deteriorating in Poland, but improving in Italy."
"Supranational corporations have already ravaged Poland, buying up industrial firms for 10% of their value after the end of the People's Republic of Poland."
"The mistakes made by liberal doctrinaires, including Balcerowicz, resulted in the borders of Poland being opened up to global competition from wealthy corporations."
"This quickly resulted in the destruction of our industry, the closing down of competitive plants and scientific infrastructure - and huge unemployment."
"This is now affecting the old EU Member States, after something of a delay."
"A sound industrial policy is needed, but not economic nationalism."
"Securing Europe's supply of rare earth elements (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on:"
"the oral question to the Commission on 'Securing Europe's supply of rare earth elements', by Mr Tsoukalas, Mr Rübig, Mr Caspary and Mrs Schnieber-Jastram, on behalf of the PPE Group - B7-0017/2011),"
"the oral question to the Commission on 'Securing Europe's supply of rare earth elements', by Mrs Ek, Mr Panayotov, Mrs Hall, Mrs de Sarnez, Mr Rinaldi, Mrs Schaake and Mr Theurer, on behalf of the ALDE Group - B7-0020/2011), and"
"the oral question to the Commission on 'A raw materials strategy for Europe' by Mr Szymański, on behalf of the ECR Group - B7-0207/2011)."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen."
"Rare earth elements are critical to hundreds of high-tech applications and key to the development of green technologies."
"EU industry depends totally on REE imports from China, which holds a monopoly over 97% of world production and has 36% of global economic reserves."
"China has strong scientific research in the field and has achieved a palpable competitive advantage in producing alloys and end products."
"At the same time, EU industry lacks both access to raw materials and the know-how for processing them."
"Although rare earth elements are not as rare as their name suggests, experts estimate that it takes around 10 to 15 years to reorganise a viable production line."
"The European Union is developing a medium-term strategy for raw materials; however, the problem of rare earth elements is much more immediate."
"Increased domestic needs in China and its efforts to limit the environmental impact have already resulted in very strict limitations on exports, at a time when global demand is increasing."
"China has set lower export limits for the first half of 2011, down 35% compared with last year, but stricter limits are expected in the second half."
"The shortfall is expected to make itself keenly felt over the next six months, with increases in the prices of rare earth elements and disruptions to production lines."
"Experts estimate that there will be a global shortfall of 40 000 tonnes of rare earth elements in 2014."
"The questions to the Commission are direct and urgent:"
"What short-term measures is the Commission proposing to take, along with its partners, to establish alternative sources of rare earth elements?"
"What is the state of play in our talks with China and our international partners on the subject?"
"author. - Madam President, I sometimes wonder if Europe's response in the face of every challenge is to freeze in fear of China and call for trade sanctions and state intervention."
"A successful EU raw materials strategy must be aimed at encouraging free trade."
"It should contain sustainable and resource-efficient management, innovation and access to raw materials for European companies."
"It should not involve stockpiling raw materials with taxpayers' money."
"Europe is increasingly dependent on a small number of key resources and is falling behind in the race to secure alternative sources, but it is private companies, not politicians, who can determine the need to build up stockpiles."
"If it is an efficient use of resources, they will do so."
"What we need instead is a comprehensive raw materials strategy that involves all aspects of access to rare earths."
"This includes trade, research and innovation, recycling and development of transport and infrastructure to enable development of domestic sources."
"We need better management of raw materials supply within Europe and effective measures to encourage recycling and reducing waste."
"Europe is rich in natural resources and is also strategically placed with its proximity to the resource-rich Barents region."
"With minerals, metals and forests, northern Europe has the potential to respond significantly to EU raw material needs in a sustainable way."
"We also need to encourage innovation and research into alternative solutions and find ways around materials that European companies find too expensive."
"The EU strategy must be based on free trade and must ensure that both developed and developing countries can benefit from the sustainable supply of raw materials."
"We should also use the aid-for-trade mechanism."
"Europe needs actions aimed at innovation and eliminating trade barriers in third countries, not a policy of stockpiling rare and critical raw materials and undermining democracy abroad."
"We need suggestions from the Commission regarding raw materials and rare earth elements."
"We are still looking for these suggestions."
"Madam President, access to rare earth elements will determine the position and competitiveness of European industry."
"If we do not ensure the availability of these materials, we will do away with the most technologically advanced sectors of our economy."
"No areas of our policy must therefore be neglected."
"We must skilfully use the resources we already have and which have been abandoned unnecessarily."
"We must use trade policy instruments to ensure effective prevention of free trade violations."
"We cannot therefore limit ourselves to using only the expensive and still very limited possibilities open to us for recovering materials from used appliances."
"There are several questions at least which should be put to the European Commission in the context of the communication on raw materials."
"Firstly, has the Commission assessed the impact of China's protectionist raw materials policy on European industry?"
"Secondly, what role can recycling play in comparison to the opportunities provided by trade policy and own resources?"
"What is the ratio between these three possibilities?"
"Thirdly, does the Commission have at its disposal an assessment of the costs involved in increasing the share of recycling in the European raw materials policy?"
"Madam President, honourable Members, as you know, at the beginning of February, the Commission approved the updating of the EU strategy on raw materials, which is based on three pillars."
"The first concerns the supply of raw materials from outside the European Union through agreements with the African Union."
"We have put the raw materials issue on the agenda of our meetings with the Russian Federation."
"Moreover, as I said during the previous debate, in June, I will travel to Brazil, Argentina and Chile to initiate diplomatic action with those Latin American countries as well."
"Then I will talk about the relationship with China."
"The second pillar is about ensuring a more sustainable supply within the EU."
"This is why we have updated the implementing rules of Natura 2000, in agreement with Commissioner Potočnik."
"We want to ensure that they are interpreted in a way that will not harm extraction activities but, at the same time, we want to ensure that the environment is still respected."
"The third pillar concerns recycling and the efficient use of resources."
"I would repeat what I said during the previous debate: as part of our innovation policy, we are planning a series of innovation partnerships in various sectors, one of these being the raw materials sector."
"One of the innovation partnerships will concentrate, in particular, on activities that we can carry out in the raw materials recycling and substitution sector."
"The new communication emphasises, in particular, the situation concerning the supply of rare earths and other essential raw materials."
"There is no doubt that the reduction in the rare earth export quota decided by China significantly limits the global supply."
"We are assessing the situation in order to identify the most suitable multilateral instruments, including the World Trade Organisation and our bilateral relations with China."
"At the WTO, we have initiated a dispute settlement procedure against China regarding access to the nine principal raw materials in 2009."
"The examination of the case is at an advanced stage, and the conclusions will, of course, be very important for our discussions concerning the initiation of a WTO procedure on rare earths."
"At bilateral level, the Commission has taken up the issue with the Chinese Government on several occasions, from both a political and a technical point of view."
"At the end of 2010, a working party was set up between the EU and China to facilitate the dialogue on issues relating to rare earths and other raw materials."
"The EU will conduct, within the scope of strategic partnerships and of dialogues on future policies, an active raw materials diplomacy with the aim of guaranteeing access to these materials, and to essential materials in particular."
"One example, as I said, is the initiation of a bilateral dialogue in the context of the 2011-2013 Joint Africa-EU strategy, which includes a section specifically dedicated to raw materials."
"I have already told you about our relations with Russia and Latin America."
"Within the EU, the Commission is supporting the exploration of essential raw material deposits, and this objective is promoted in particular by the ProMine 2009-2013 project, which comes under the Seventh Framework Programme."
"As for recycling, it presents huge technological challenges, particularly since the quantity of raw materials contained in many products is infinitely small."
"Our strategy is intended to promote recycling through measures aimed at improving the implementation and application of EU waste management legislation."
"Furthermore, we shall continue to encourage research and innovation in the recycling and substitution sector, as has already been done under the Seventh Framework Programme for financing projects concerning the substitution of rare earths."
"In this context, the Commission is examining the possibility of launching an innovation partnership in the field of raw materials and hopes to present a specific proposal within the next few months."
"We have also begun a cooperation exercise with the United States in the field of innovation, and we are examining the possibility of cooperating with Japan as well."
"Naturally, we shall continue to keep a close eye on the problem of essential raw materials in order to define the priority measures required, and we believe that security of raw material supplies is essentially the responsibility of companies."
"However, we are prepared to discuss, in close cooperation with the Member States, the costs, potential benefits and added value of a raw material stockpiling programme."
"This is what we are doing, but naturally, I am always ready to listen to any suggestions from Parliament in order to ensure that the Commission continues to work actively on a matter that is crucial for the competitiveness of our European entrepreneurial system."
"Madam President, Mr Tajani, thank you very much indeed for your initiative."
"Raw materials will help to ensure that we have a healthy industrial sector in future and, therefore, it is important for us to conclude bilateral agreements with China and many other countries, and not just in the field of trade policy."
"For example, we should also be focusing on investment protection agreements, because we can sign long-term contracts in this area which will protect the return on investments in the new mines that we urgently need."
"In other words, long-term contracts will provide protection for our investments so that the new mines, which will be competing with existing ones, can receive the financial support that they require."
"In the context of the World Trade Organisation's (WTO) follow-up conference to the Doha round, we can also investigate the situation of the Singapore issues."
"We have already put together a good package of measures in Singapore and we need to take this forward, perhaps even in parallel with the current Doha negotiations."
"We need to find out whether there has been a breach of anti-dumping regulations with regard to the prices which industry in China pays in some cases for raw materials for processing and the surcharges imposed on European industry."
"Work on clarifying this is already in progress."
"However, this is not just about rare earth elements (REEs), but also about magnesite, for example, which is the most important raw material for fireproof products and which is essential for the production of steel, glass, cement and other materials."
"We should be considering possible substitute products which can be used in the future and perhaps establishing our own research programme for these products."
"I also welcome Mrs Hedegaard's proposal for a carbon footprint tax, which would allow additional VAT to be charged on products manufactured with high levels of CO2 emissions that are transported over long distances."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I believe this debate shows how important it is for the raw materials strategy to have a long-term and broad impact."
"Rare earth elements are, of course, rare on the market, but not in the ground."
"There are a number of reasons for this."
"They have quite simply not been of sufficient economic interest to quarry in all of the places where we know they are present."
"There have also been environmental and working environment disputes."
"The EU ought to invest a great deal in research and development. It ought to invest in resource efficiency and, in particular, in recycling, as has been said here throughout the evening."
"This, of course, requires everything from intelligent, simple and smart collection strategies to ecodesigns which make it easy to take batteries out of devices that are to be recycled."
"However, we also need to move away from our colonial impulses in our cooperation with other countries in other parts of the world."
"That is something that we have not managed to do particularly well yet."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, you have already provided some information, Commissioner, but I would like more details."
"Firstly, the WTO."
"What exactly are we doing at the WTO concerning the initiative that was already taken in 2009 but which, as far as I know, concerned magnesium and bauxite?"
"Do we have a procedure at the WTO regarding rare earths?"
"Is such a procedure possible and do we initiate it alone, or can we initiate it together with the United States and Japan, as I think would be desirable?"
"Secondly, you have said that we need to increase supplies from other deposits, including European ones."
"Is there a role for Greenland?"
"What is the precise thinking in this respect?"
"Thirdly, the recovery of rare earths from recycling."
"Are we moving towards a set of European rules on so-called urban mining?"
"Will there be a directive or a regulation?"
"What is planned in this respect?"
"Fourthly, with regard to studies and investigation, the development of investigations, will we have some specific provisions in the Eighth Framework Programme also?"
"Furthermore, with regard to the stockpiling system, will we have common European rules on stockpiling in this case, too?"
"Finally, to what extent is the issue being dealt with bilaterally with China as part of the high-level economic and commercial dialogue and in the negotiations under way on the new partnership and cooperation agreement with that country?"
"Madam President, in the short and medium term, our dependency on the import of rare earth elements (REEs) from China certainly presents a problem."
"I cannot see that Europe has a strategic weakness and it must not remain dependent."
"To put it more bluntly, in some ways, the Chinese are doing us a favour by making it entirely obvious to us that we need to escape from our current position of dependency."
"Therefore, we must not make the additional mistake of creating antagonism between Europe and China."
"There are opportunities for cooperation in this area."
"However, when we look towards Asia, we should also take Japan into consideration."
"Over the last year, Japan has been in a more difficult position with regard to access to REEs than Europe has."
"Japan has also reacted more quickly and more effectively."
"The Japanese Government has spent USD 1 billion on research into the substitution and recycling of REEs."
"How much are we making available as part of the Seventh Framework Programme?"
"It goes without saying that we need trade policy."
"We must also develop our own reserves, where they are available."
"However, in my opinion, the strategic focus of our policy on REEs must be innovation, raw material efficiency and technological leadership."
"We need mandatory targets for raw material efficiency."
"We also need specific, concrete plans for recycling REEs."
"The Commission's communication makes no direct mention of recycling."
"This is no longer a solution for the future, but one which we need now."
"Many companies have already been doing this for some time, including Rhodia, BASF, Osram and many others."
"Substitution is another key factor."
"Even China is now beginning to invest in substitutes for REEs, because it is obvious that it cannot continue using these substances at its current rate, even to meet its own requirements."
"We must be quick to make the most of the opportunities offered by the current situation and we must not complain that these opportunities are open to us."
"Madam President, rare earth elements are of decisive importance for hundreds of technological solutions."
"They are therefore an essential factor in continued technological progress and greater innovation in the European Union."
"The fact that they are used so widely means that demand has increased, while opportunities for increasing the amounts extracted are growing rarer."
"At present, 124 000 tonnes of rare earth elements are extracted annually worldwide, and demand for them will grow by as much as 50% by 2012."
"Around 97% of the global supply is extracted in China, which is crucially important, since China has been reducing extraction and exports since 2006."
"In August, it announced that it would be reducing exports by over 50% and creating strategic reserves."
"What is more, many companies extracting rare earth elements in other parts of the world are, in fact, Chinese-owned."
"The take-over of a rare earth elements mine by a Chinese mining company was recently blocked in Australia."
"This is a very serious problem relating to the monopoly on the extraction of these raw materials."
"We must do everything in our power to prevent any risks in connection with this key economic sector, which guarantees Europe's growth and future."
"Madam President, Mr Tajani, only last autumn, the European Parliament specifically welcomed the fact that the Heads of State or Government of the European Union had explicitly recognised, in a statement from the Madrid Summit, the sovereign right of states to manage their own natural resources and to control their use."
"The statement also included a specific reference to the importance of sustainability criteria."
"The summit was attended by Latin American countries, but the same laws apply to China and other states."
"The extraction of rare earth elements (REEs) has led to serious environmental damage in China, as was the case in the past in the USA and elsewhere."
"This must not continue."
"We need an international agreement."
"China and other potential producers need our expertise and technology transfer in order to ensure that their mining processes are environmentally friendly and that their miners can work in much greater safety."
"China is also interested in investing in high-tech production facilities for processing REEs, because it does not just want to be a supplier of raw materials."
"The Commission should therefore play the role of mediator here."
"A modern raw materials policy must be characterised by partnership."
"At the same time, you must put the emphasis on developing improved recycling and substitution technologies, because in future, the metals found in REEs will become even rarer: too rare simply to use them once."
"(DE) Madam President, Mr Tajani, you have made some more announcements today, Mr Tajani, about what the Commission intends to do over the next few months regarding supplies of raw materials."
"In 2007, the Commission also made an announcement and presented its raw materials strategy."
"My problem is that the announcements we have heard over recent days and the announcements we have heard over recent weeks are very similar to those made in 2007."
"However, I have the impression that very little has happened since then."
"Little has happened at least when it comes to us asserting our own interests."
"It seems to me that many other states are promoting their interests very aggressively."
"This is known as the 'colonial reflex'."
"I see this happening not in the countries of the European Union, but specifically in China, which is using the issue of raw materials, and of rare earth elements (REEs) in particular, to maintain its monopoly and put other countries at a disadvantage."
"I increasingly often ask myself, Mr Tajani, who should be responsible for ensuring that something actually happens."
"Is it your Directorate-General?"
"Is it you?"
"Is it the Directorate-General for Trade?"
"Is it Mr De Gucht?"
"Is it the other commissioners?"
"Who really has overall responsibility?"
"What concrete steps must be taken?"
"Whose actions should we be measuring and when, in order to ensure that measures are actually put in place by the European Union?"
"I would be very grateful if you could investigate this issue, because we are all aware that the Chinese are continuing to play an active role and are imposing export restrictions and duties, which present our companies with huge problems."
"Has the Commission finally drawn up a list of all the products where the Chinese currently have a competitive advantage because of their export restrictions?"
"Is the Commission intending to take anti-dumping measures, where appropriate, in order to remove competitive disadvantages for our companies?"
"I would be very grateful if you could turn your attention to these issues."
"(RO) Madam President, rare earth elements are vital for the production of monitors and mobile phones, as well for manufacturing high-performance permanent magnets used in wind turbines or electric vehicles, car catalytic converters, PCBs and fibre optics."
"They are therefore vital to new clean energies as well."
"Although these elements are traded globally, the market for certain raw materials and rare earth elements is not very transparent and the volumes traded are small."
"The European Union is dependent almost entirely on rare earth element imports, with 97% of their global production being concentrated in China."
"The demand for raw materials will be boosted by the growth of the emerging economies and by the rapid spread of new technologies."
"The processes for mining, refining and recycling rare earth elements have severe consequences for the environment if they are not managed properly."
"The European Union should focus its efforts on streamlining the processes for using and recycling rare earth elements and on research targeted at replacing critical raw materials with other less critical materials."
"Commissioner, we call for the list of raw materials to be updated regularly."
"(FR) Madam President, the observations conveyed by the oral questions on which this debate is based are simply a further indication of the scarcity of resources and, in particular, of the increasing scarcity of certain essential minerals."
"Moreover, they tell us about the vulnerability of States that import compared to States that hold a monopoly."
"The reaction of the European Union must be two-pronged: on the one hand, to ensure that we are not taken hostage by defending our situation in all relevant forums (WTO, G20, United Nations), while, on the other hand, acting within the framework of the Lisbon strategy in order to reduce our dependence on rare earth elements."
"Our watchwords must be effective recycling of materials already used and the promotion of research and development programmes into alternative products."
"Finally, through our partnerships with developing countries, the EU must help prevent the looting of the rare earth elements belonging to those countries."
"(Applause)"
"(ES) Madam President, Commissioner, the situation is clear: the EU needs to secure its supply of rare earth elements, but we face increasingly tough competition in this market."
"To be sure, China controls 95% of global production, and its continued cuts in export quotas have placed this issue at the heart of the G20 agenda."
"We are therefore debating a critical issue for the whole European economy, one that must, of course, be addressed through cooperation with countries that have reserves, but also, and above all, through research, development and innovation."
"It has already been said that investing in research and development is vital if we are to tackle the technological challenges involved in finding more efficient extraction techniques, searching for alternative raw materials to reduce dependence and recycling, which is something of the utmost importance, as the so-called 'urban mines' could be an important source of raw materials for the European Union."
"We therefore congratulate the Commissioner on his commitments to this issue, and we will be keeping a close eye on all the steps that the Commission takes in this regard."
"Madam President, I must say that I am very concerned about some of the aspects I have listened to here in Parliament recently - tonight, the shortage of rare earth elements; last night, the 80% deficiency in protein; a few weeks ago, sugar beet factories being closed down and now we have a deficiency in sugar."
"I think it is time the European Union started putting itself first and particularly trying to promote its industries."
"Obviously, where rare earth elements are concerned, I welcome the Commissioner's commitment to look at innovation in terms of getting substitution, etc. (and also recycling), but, above all, to look at new technologies."
"I attended a seminar a few weeks ago in Brussels which described new technology developed to get rare elements from the seabed."
"At the end of the day, we have to look to be self-sufficient."
"It is good for the Commissioner to go to Brazil and to talk to China, but if diplomacy fails and they do not give us what we want, where do we go?"
"If we do not have a strong economy, we will be irrelevant politically."
"(LT) Madam President, the issue of raw materials is inseparable from the European Union's growth and economic progress."
"We can therefore congratulate the Commission for the raw materials strategy."
"Nevertheless, the potential shortage of raw materials in the future should not only make us focus on solving the issue of access to raw materials."
"I agree that this may be a very good opportunity to turn the European Union economy towards a model based on using resources more efficiently."
"A reduction in the use of raw materials and much greater concentration on the efficient processing of raw materials are probably the quickest route to reducing the Union's import needs."
"Proper investment in new processing technologies and the creation of substitute raw materials would facilitate a significant reduction in dependence on imported rare earth elements."
"This could ensure a leading role for Europe in this area and would make a major contribution to the implementation of the goals set out in the Europe 2020 strategy."
"(PT) Madam President, this debate on the difficulty of accessing commodities, such as rare earth elements, is intrinsically linked to the current state of development of the world economy and the systemic crisis in which we are immersed."
"The crisis which was announced as being financial is, in reality, a much larger, global crisis."
"It is a crisis that is also rooted in the confrontation between economic growth as it is understood by capitalism and a planet Earth that is generous but finite."
"The roots of a system, capitalism, which subordinates everything to the dynamic of profit and accumulation, also lie in this inability to understand nature and its limits; but nature does, in fact, have limits."
"The move toward a world that is polycentric from the economic and political points of view opens the way for increased competition for resources: it awakens and feeds conflicts."
"The foreign-exchange and trade wars that we have been witnessing are worrying symptoms, but not isolated ones."
"Other wars are queuing up as threats to the present and future, and it is also about all these things that we are talking when we are debating what has been brought before us today."
"Madam President, Commissioner, when my grandmother was born, she was one of the two billion living on earth; when I was born, I was one of the five billion on earth; and when my granddaughter is born, she will be one of the nine billion living on earth."
"So extensive technologies must be replaced by intensive technologies for all resources, including rare materials."
"Therefore, I would like to remember somebody who, a hundred years ago, received a Nobel Prize for chemistry for the separation and purification of radium and polonium: Maria Skłodowska, who is known as Madame Curie."
"We need Madame Curies, we need scientists, we need breakthrough technologies."
"I would therefore like to ask you, Commissioner, to do your utmost to ensure that chemistry remains a place for young talent in Europe."
"(NL) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, yes, we could import raw materials, but we should be conserving them, instead."
"Perhaps we could even start producing them ourselves."
"I welcome your initiative for a new partnership, one which includes substitution in its remit, but I think that the other members have already mentioned this and they are right: we have to try to conserve raw materials here in Europe."
"That is very important."
"We need to increase collection."
"We need to switch to other business models, in order to recover rare earth elements for recycling wherever possible."
"We can do this through innovation and, to that end, we need greater efficiency."
"However, I have one very important concern: are you going to ensure that, if those rare earth elements become even rarer, they will be reserved for the most important applications?"
"Are you going to ensure that, should these metals become even rarer, the applications we all need the most, those that are the most urgent, will ultimately be enabled to continue?"
"For example, are you going to ensure that, instead of ending up as part of a McThis or McThat, these metals are allocated to windmills?"
"Will you look at that issue as well?"
"That seems to me to be very important."
"(PL) Madam President, for reasons of competitiveness, market players are predisposed towards investments which give a rapid return, or, in other words, investments in plants whose products reach consumers directly."
"Investments in prospecting for raw materials, particularly in mineral deposits, involve a long and expensive process with a long wait for returns."
"It is therefore only the largest investors which can afford them."
"They are mainly monopolists and can set their own conditions, as was the case with the rare earth elements."
"It has now turned out that Europe's growth is limited due to a lack of lanthanides, in particular, samarium and neodymium, which are needed for the production of high-energy permanent magnets and which are used in wind energy and to power electric vehicles."
"It is time for the European Union to pay attention to the security of raw materials, in the same way as it pays attention to energy security."
"This relates not only to rare earth elements, but also to other rare raw materials and materials used as catalysts, for example, rhenium and the platinum metals, tungsten, molybdenum, lithium, selenium and so on. Thank you."
"Madam President, honourable Members, I would like to thank Parliament because, with this debate, it is giving power to the action that the European Commission - and the Barroso II Commission in particular - is taking to resolve the sensitive issue of rare materials."
"As Mr Scholz emphasised, since the Madrid meeting, the European Commission has begun to take determined action."
"In other words, it has not just made announcements; it has taken specific measures."
"When I say specific measures, I mean the preparation of a list of 14 rare raw materials on which action is needed - a list which, unfortunately, I fear will have to be extended."
"In addition, the first agreement with the African Union has involved several months of work and has culminated in an agreement within the African Union/European Union action plan, which sees Africa directly involved in a joint effort with the European Union and with the Commission."
"That effort concerns both what we can do within the EU to analyse our needs and an analysis of the real possibilities of extraction work in Africa, the possible implementation of a geological service and the plan to create trans-African network infrastructure to support the mines from which it will be possible to expand the extraction industry."
"The agreement with the Russian Federation to put raw material agreements on the agenda is another definite result - not just an announcement - and two meetings have been held."
"In the same way, the European Commission document on raw materials is not merely an announcement, but a Commission-approved text that outlines a clear and precise strategy, as I told you, which is based on three specific pillars on which we intend to continue to work."
"The decision to create an innovation partnership linked to an action that will see the private sector - and, I hope, also Parliament and the other institutions - participating in innovation and research with the aim of identifying robust recycling and substitution measures yielding real results is not just an announcement, but a specific measure on the part of the European Commission."
"It is a request that has been approved by the College and which is therefore part of the Commission's innovation strategy."
"With regard to the WTO, naturally, we shall continue to work to resolve the issue by diplomatic means."
"The trip to Latin America is another specific measure, not just another announcement, because visits connected with such sensitive issues require dedicated preparation that must subsequently produce real results."
"Naturally, I shall inform Parliament about what has been done."
"With regard to certain locations in Europe where it is possible to check whether raw materials are present in the subsoil - I am thinking of Greenland, the Barents Sea and other locations in northern Europe - we need to check whether extraction activities are possible and whether they are economically viable."
"However, we are ready to support any initiatives aimed at carrying out possible investigations."
"Next week, a political debate, but one that includes technical aspects too, will be held at the European Parliament building in Brussels."
"It will focus on the opportunities that exist in the Barents Sea, and I will be present in order to discuss with some Swedish ministers and some experts whether those opportunities are economically viable or not, and whether they are viable from an environmental point of view - another area where we need to see whether it is right and appropriate to carry out investigations."
"With regard to the WTO, I am responsible for the industrial part of the raw materials issue."
"Commissioner De Gucht is responsible for the commercial part."
"He has already said very clearly that he intends to defend the interests of the EU."
"Indeed, and I also say this for the benefit of those who are interested, including Mr Caspary, who I believe asked the question - if he wishes, I will forward it to him by tomorrow morning - paragraph 5(2) of the document in the raw materials communication mentions possible anti-dumping measures and commercial action."
"However, with regard to the action at the WTO, for which Commissioner De Gucht is responsible - as I have said during my speech - we have initiated a procedure with Mexico and the United States regarding nine raw materials, which do not include rare earths."
"The examination is already at an advanced stage of completion."
"Hence, the conclusions will also be crucial in terms of indicating the steps the Commission should subsequently take with regard to rare earths."
"We are evaluating the situation precisely in order to identify the most suitable instruments in this area."
"However, with regard to the recycling of rare earth elements, and the question asked by Mr Rinaldi during his speech, I can answer by explaining the recycling measures that we as the European Commission intend to take."
"Current legislation covers 40% of the waste produced in the EU."
"The Commission has proposed to expand significantly on Commissioner Potočnik's proposal, which is not my proposal, regarding the targets for recycling electrical and electronic waste containing rare earths."
"Other measures are also planned in order to improve the action concerning products and to facilitate their end-of-life recycling."
"Legislation is already being drafted, and Commissioner Potočnik intends to continue to work along these lines."
"With regard to industrial policy relating to rare earths and raw materials, it is my intention to continue to move forward and not to make promises, because I am not accustomed to making them - I am accustomed to honouring the commitments I make, particularly those I make before Parliament, as I have done ever since I obtained a vote of confidence from the committees to which I presented myself."
"I intend to continue to move forward and to honour all the commitments I have made, without making announcements, but by trying to provide specific responses to the needs of European companies and citizens, including in this sensitive area of industrial supplies."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Rare earths are a key element of the European economy."
"Following the European Commission communication on the raw materials initiative, we have to strive to ensure that an ambitious common strategy is defined quickly for this sector."
"We really must prevent Europe from becoming totally dependent on the current monopoly enjoyed by China, which today produces 97% of these metals and are indispensable for high-tech industries."
"It is therefore necessary not only to re-evaluate the extraction potential within Europe, but also to recover these precious elements from waste by means of more effective recycling."
"In this respect, the European Union must urgently invest more resources in technological research, aimed, in particular, at an easier and more economical form of extraction of rare earths from electronic waste."
"One need only think, for example, that up to 350 grams of gold could be extracted from one tonne of mobile phones, if they are recycled correctly."
"The road to guaranteeing a sustainable supply of these elements is still long and cannot develop without greater cooperation with resource-rich countries through strategic partnerships and ongoing relations."
"Finally, I would like to see timely measures adopted to deal with the increase in the prices of these materials, which are of strategic importance for European industry."
"We have recently started to become increasingly aware of the fact that rare earth elements are of decisive importance for technological applications and of fundamental importance for the development of environmentally-friendly technologies such as wind turbines, hybrid vehicles, etc. It should be noted that their extraction is extremely complicated."
"EU industry is entirely dependent on imports of rare earth elements from China, which has a virtual monopoly in this area, since it controls 97% of global production."
"China possesses 36% of confirmed global reserves of rare earth elements and 59% of estimated total reserves and, at the same time, is endeavouring to conclude bilateral agreements in order to secure proven reserves throughout the world."
"EU industry lacks access both to rare earth elements as raw materials, and to the expert scientific and industrial knowledge needed to process them."
"Furthermore, while global demand for rare earth elements is still growing, China has announced drastic cuts to its exports, as vividly described by a group of Japanese experts during a very interesting presentation they made when visiting the European Parliament in February 2011."
"In connection with the unquestionable need for exploitation of rare earth elements by industry in the EU Member States and the need for research into them, I would call for dialogue with the People's Republic of China on increasing exports of these raw materials and for our efforts to be focused on searching for alternative sources for their extraction."
"Possibility of using gas from alternative sources in Europe (debate)"
"The next item is the Commission statement on the possibility of using gas from alternative sources in Europe."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this agenda item addresses an issue which will certainly be an important concern of ours in the months to come: What will the gas market look like during the next few decades?"
"The question is what role gas will play in the near future in heat generation, conversion to electricity, industry and as a fuel for transport and, therefore, in our energy timetable leading up to 2050, where it will be of huge importance."
"We also need to consider how the transport routes should be developed, including pipelines, infrastructure and terminals."
"Other issues include investment costs and the forecasts concerning the gas price in the energy mix."
"The European gas market currently has a volume of around 520 billion cubic metres per year."
"Part of this comes from our own deposits in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, but more than 60% of our gas supplies are imported from third countries and this figure will soon reach over 80%."
"For this reason, new deposits, such as gas in rocks, will be a useful supplement to existing deposits and will therefore reduce our dependency on imports."
"There is currently a boom in sales of tight gas and shale gas from the USA."
"Ten years ago, no one would have believed how quickly and how dramatically the production of gas from rocks, which is extracted using water pressure and chemical agents, would transform the market."
"Until a few years ago, the USA was an importer of gas."
"Now it is an exporter, even given its own growing demand for gas."
"Therefore, the gas market, which has always been a continental market, is, for the first time, on the way to becoming a global market, with gas from the USA being supplied to liquid natural gas (LNG) terminals in Europe."
"I am not drawing any conclusions from this development at the moment."
"The issue of avoiding increasing dependency, the open market and world trade all speak out in favour of it."
"It is also in the interest of some Member States."
"However, on the other hand, it is important to make it clear that we have environmental regulations governing running water and groundwater and the extraction of raw materials from the earth."
"We also have legislation concerning hydrocarbon resources which aims to allow non-discriminatory access to the environment and also to protect it."
"In addition, there are health and safety regulations for EU citizens."
"All of these things have to be taken into consideration."
"There is potential for research and, where appropriate, for extraction, firstly in Poland and then also in the United Kingdom and Germany."
"In Germany, however, there is also the issue of acceptance."
"It will not be possible to extract this gas without the acceptance of the people in the regions and the local residents."
"The Commission is monitoring the process and is also prepared to issue expert reports."
"I believe that we will not have a clear idea of the proportion of our own gas from rocks on the European market for three to five years."
"We must follow up these developments without prejudging them."
"However, it has to be said that even if we make use of these deposits, they will only ever supplement existing sources of gas."
"This means that imports of conventional gas from third countries such as Norway, Russia and Algeria, or by sea from Qatar and other states, will definitely continue to play a central role in meeting the needs of the European gas market in the decades to come."
"Infrastructure such as new, secure pipelines and additional LNG terminals will remain important."
"I think there is the possibility for us to extract our own gas to supplement imports, but this will definitely not be able to replace imported gas."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I am pleased that the European Parliament has managed to initiate a debate on the possibility of exploiting gas from non-conventional energy sources, such as shale gas, tight gas and coalbed methane."
"In view of the Energy Council's recent conclusions on energy and the broad public debate, I believe that shale gas may, in the long term, become one of the ways in which energy sources can be diversified."
"The European Union should not preach to the converted; instead, it should take a closer look at the United States, for example, to see how the extraction of shale gas has already revolutionised the energy market there."
"Assuming that this will have even greater consequences for the global market in the future, obtaining shale gas should also be a priority for Europe, in particular, because resources of the gas exceed conventional gas reserves in the European Union fourfold, according to the Second Strategic Energy Review."
"Commissioner, the European Union should carry out initial analyses of the extraction of shale gas in Europe."
"The potential for shale gas has already been noted in Germany, France, Romania, Bulgaria, the Netherlands, Sweden, Poland and Great Britain, among others."
"If possible, financial support should be provided for research programmes, which would allow safe and economically viable technologies for extracting gas from non-conventional energy sources to be developed."
"I will permit myself to ask two questions."
"Firstly, is the Commission taking steps to carry out initial analyses of the possibility of exploiting gas from alternative sources in Europe, and is it preparing technical and economic feasibility studies of such extraction in the context of work on the energy infrastructure priorities between now and 2020?"
"My second question is as follows; has the Commission made any provision in the planned 2014-2020 financial perspective for support for geological research with a view to estimating the potential of existing deposits and the possibility of extracting shale gas in Europe, which will accelerate technological development in the field?"
"Madam President, as the Member States' economies and industry recover, there will be an ever-increasing demand for gas."
"Meanwhile, the rapid depletion of our own natural gas resources may make the Union even more dependent on third country suppliers and weaken our industry's competitiveness."
"Gas from alternative sources may be an effective way out, fundamentally redrawing Europe's gas supply map and redistributing economic levers."
"However, it is necessary to take action immediately and we could take advantage of the experience already gained by other countries."
"Recently, there has been much discussion about the potential of shale gas, and today, Commissioner, you also indicated that this was noted in the conclusions of the European Council of 4 February."
"I believe that the European Union really must establish concrete plans as a matter of urgency and begin to research possible deposits of such gases and their use."
"Of course, as you mentioned, shale gas must not and cannot be the only way of reducing energy dependence."
"However, if the predictions of European Union geologists are confirmed, then gas reserves may be found not just in Poland and Germany, but possibly also in other countries."
"In future, this would help reduce the influence of third countries on the European Union's economy and its competitiveness."
"Unfortunately, in this area, we lag at least a decade behind the United States, where the ever-increasing quantities of shale gas being obtained have completely transformed the gas market."
"I believe that efforts in this area need to be intensified and concrete measures need to be adopted to use these sources in the economy."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I fully understand the enthusiasm arising from the presence of shale gas in European subsoils and the desire for energy independence is highly commendable."
"That said, I think that this optimism should be considerably tempered, first in the United States, where shale gas is indeed widely used."
"Several States are moving towards a moratorium and the Independent Panel of Experts (IPE) has been commissioned to carry out an impact assessment, which will take more than two years, to analyse the environmental consequences of this exploitation."
"Secondly, at a time when we are trying to substantially reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, it would appear to be totally inconsistent with EU policies for an impact assessment of the purely climatic impact in terms of greenhouse gases of the exploitation of these deposits not to be carried out before any in-depth research were undertaken."
"Thirdly, Commissioner, you said that we must comply with environmental standards."
"We take note of and welcome that."
"Nevertheless, in countries where exploration licences are granted - and I am thinking in particular of my own country - it is clear today that environmental law has been totally forgotten; it is not applied and we are in breach of the law."
"The Aarhus Convention is not applied, people have not been warned, there is no public inquiry, there is no impact assessment, and there is concealment of the dangerous chemicals that are used."
"Therefore, it is absolutely unacceptable to continue in this way and the real issue, Commissioner, is whether the exploitation of shale gas on such dense terrain as European terrain, which is totally dissimilar to American terrain, is not incompatible with our laws to protect the environment and people's access to information."
"I am interested to hear your answers."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I fully endorse what Mrs Lepage has said and I would ask the following question: is it an opportunity or a predictable ecological disaster?"
"We are nonetheless 10 years behind the United States in terms of exploitation."
"What can we see?"
"We can see that the groundwater has been contaminated by the chemicals that have permeated this hydraulic fracturing."
"We can also see air pollution."
"We can now see that there are volatile organic compounds (VOC) and even ozone has appeared because of all the substances released into the air."
"We can see that the health consequences affect not only people living in the vicinity but also cattle and, of course, the users of the phreatic nappes, because they can no longer drink the water they contain."
"Last week, the New York Times reported that, as well as polluting the groundwater with hydrocarbons and biocides, the contamination also emits radioactive elements."
"In France, as Mrs Lepage pointed out, eight licences were signed without any debate, without any consultation, without any impact assessment."
"And you talk of social acceptability?"
"There is genuine rebellion."
"The latest demonstrations in the département of Ardèche were attended by more than 20 thousand people precisely because they care about their land."
"And you say, 'It is an economic opportunity'."
"But whom does this gas benefit?"
"Are we talking about cui bono?"
"Is it about choosing gas for the needs of industry to the detriment of the reserves of water in the phreatic nappes?"
"The New York moratorium is a good illustration of the problem."
"We are therefore simply requesting that the licences be revoked."
"For explorations to take place while we have no guarantee of compliance with the Groundwater Framework Directive, the Air Quality Framework Directive or the Aarhus Convention is out of the question."
"We therefore await your responses and we will refuse, in Europe, in France and in the countries involved, to allow these non-conventional forms of gas to be exploited in the absence of these guarantees."
"Madam President, the successful commercialisation of non-conventional gas has turned the United States into an exporter of this fuel, with a potential which exceeds that of Russia."
"The situation on the markets has also changed."
"Long-term, fixed contracts and price mechanisms based on oil prices have been replaced by much more flexible agreements, and the spot market is starting to play an increasingly important role."
"Both individual consumers and industry are benefiting from this, since we are all paying lower bills."
"Europe cannot afford to waste this potential and an opportunity of this kind, particularly since the EU's emphasis on moving away from coal means that gas is increasing in importance in the European economies."
"This opportunity to diversify gas sources and increase the share of own resources, and thus reduce our dependency on imports, has now emerged in countries including Poland, France and Germany."
"Work on obtaining gas from non-conventional deposits is at an advanced stage in all of these countries."
"Let us remember that this sector does not expect us to provide it with money or special preferential operating conditions."
"It is a sector which is already investing hundreds of millions of euro in Europe, and it needs only one thing: for barriers not to be put in its way, and for it to be treated equally."
"The European Conservatives and Reformists in this House also expect this of the European Commission."
"Let us hope that we - Europe - do not waste this opportunity."
"Madam President, compared to traditional gas sources, extraction from non-traditional sources today accounts for only around 5% of total gas production globally."
"The non-traditional sources have a lower concentration of the raw material than the traditional deposits."
"In addition to coal methane or gas trapped in less permeable rocks or gas hydrates, the most promising source appears to be shale gas."
"The best experience with the extraction of this gas has been in North America, where extraction from non-traditional sources accounted for up to 42% of total production in 2007."
"According to the estimate of the International Energy Agency, there may be up to 991 billion cubic metres of non-traditional gas reserves in Europe."
"They are probably located mainly in Poland, Germany, Hungary, Romania, Sweden and Great Britain."
"In 2007-2010, Poland issued almost 60 licences for shale gas prospecting and extraction."
"The holders of these licences include major global energy concerns."
"It is therefore clear from what has been said that these new non-traditional gas sources are also becoming an interesting alternative for the exploitation of new horizontal extraction technologies."
"(DE) Madam President, Mr Oettinger, when we look at the fluctuations in prices on the energy markets over the last few weeks, we can see that not only the political risks presented by many countries, but also the financial markets and many other influencing factors make it impossible to develop a secure strategy for the future."
"Therefore, we need to cut the energy cake into as many pieces as possible and it is clear that gas will continue to play a significant role in this respect in future."
"Of course, we must focus on the efficient use of gas."
"We need more efficiency not only in our production processes, but also in our consumption."
"We must ensure that the charges resulting from CO2 emissions are paid by the consumer and not by the producers because otherwise, international competition will be distorted. It should be of no significance to us whether the gas which produces CO2 is used inside or outside Europe."
"Europe is the region with the greatest buying power."
"If we import products with a high proportion of CO2 or transport them within Europe, this must not affect our competitiveness."
"We also need to consider the importance of pipelines in future."
"A pipeline is rather like a marriage."
"Both partners have to be joined together for a long period in order to achieve a win-win situation."
"(DE) Madam President, I was pleased to hear, Mr Oettinger, that you did not go along with the growing trend for 'shale gas euphoria', but instead advised taking a more sensible approach."
"This area is, of course, promising to a certain extent, because it could result in a reduction in our dependency on gas imports."
"In fact, we are already benefiting from this."
"You have referred to the fact that prices are falling because of the large supplies of unconventional gas coming from the USA."
"However, as you have said, we need to create an atmosphere of trust if we want this subject to be investigated in an impartial way."
"The Commission is proposing to review the regulatory framework."
"I was surprised to hear your spokesperson saying recently that there would definitely be loopholes in the regulations."
"However, in contrast to the USA, the Commission has omitted to do a number of things."
"The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is undertaking a major study."
"I would like to know why we are not doing something similar or, at least, waiting to find out the results of the study before we take any further steps."
"We currently need a political moratorium on shale gas activities until we can answer the questions which many citizens are asking, because they have realised that action has been taken too quickly in the USA."
"Problems are occurring there which are more significant than people initially wanted to believe and the USA now finds itself in the sort of difficulties that we definitely want to avoid."
"Therefore, I am calling on you, as the Member of the Commission responsible for this area, not to persist in doing what you have planned, but to carry out more in-depth investigations, as the Americans are, in order to create an atmosphere of trust."
"(PL) Madam President, deposits of alternative gas, in particular, shale gas, have allowed the United States to achieve full gas independence over the past 10 years."
"Thanks to these deposits, the United States has gone from being a gas importer to a gas exporter, and use of these deposits has also resulted in tangible environmental benefits, for example, by limiting the amount of coal mined and the resulting coal damage."
"Scientists are forecasting that a similar scenario could occur in the European Union."
"Exploitation of non-conventional gas deposits in Europe is the best alternative given Parliament's high expectations with regard to reducing CO2 emissions, and thus reducing coal mining."
"What is more, we have recently seen a marked rise in the price of gas obtained from conventional sources."
"The situation in the Middle East is also having a definite impact."
"The possible exploitation of deposits will therefore enable a real reduction in the costs of generating energy, since it is an alternative to imports which are growing ever more expensive."
"The extraction of non-conventional gas also makes it possible to reduce unemployment, as seen in the United States, where experience has shown that such extraction pays off."
"In the US state of Pennsylvania alone, around 200 000 people have found work extracting and processing non-conventional gas, and the local economy gains over USD 8 billion every year from taxes, orders placed by extraction companies and concession fees."
"Let us therefore not lag behind, and let us take concrete measures to benefit from this huge opportunity and potential."
"(PL) Madam President, it is to be welcomed that we have succeeded in provoking discussion on a subject which has been somewhat neglected in the European Union, namely, obtaining gas from alternative deposits."
"As the Commissioner has already said, the geological conditions for the existence of such gas potentially exist in many countries."
"Amounts in Poland are estimated at 1 000-3 000 billion m3, with annual exploitation of around 14 billion m3."
"Europe cannot afford to neglect this issue, if only in view of what has happened on the American market."
"After all, gas as a fuel will remain a key source of energy for a long time to come, as emerges from the Second Strategic Energy Review, for example."
"At the same time, this report reveals that Europe is dependent on supplies from third countries."
"In view of the current conflicts in North Africa, for example, which are causing repercussions on the fuels market, we should therefore ask questions about whether such alternative sources may be found in Europe itself."
"It goes without saying that the question will arise of what environmental impact such undertakings will have."
"I think that we should earmark a large sum of money for research into environmentally-friendly methods for extracting gas from alternative sources, such as shale beds."
"It would appear that Europe could be a leader in this field, too."
"If we wish to meet our environmental goals, we must, on the one hand, acquire new sources of gas and, on the other, specify the technology and method of exploitation in such a way as to prevent far-reaching environmental damage. Thank you very much."
"(RO) Madam President, it is already well known that global hydrocarbon reserves are close to running out."
"This will be reflected in higher extraction costs, which means exorbitant prices."
"Gas produced from alternative sources would have an important role to play in the European energy market."
"Europe could use it to diversify its energy sources, thereby reducing dependency on third countries."
"One of the options available may be to exploit Europe's gas reserves in an unconventional manner."
"Three oil companies have already obtained a licence to do this in Romania."
"Gas hydrates, also known as 'flammable ice', are in great abundance in the Black Sea."
"If it is exploited locally, this asset will reduce the EU's dependency on Russian pipelines."
"The biogas market is also one of best developed in Europe."
"Countries like Romania have the potential to produce biogas, but investment in technology is still required to exploit it."
"(RO) Madam President, on 4 February, the European Council recommended that Member States explore the resources of shale and oil shale gas in Europe."
"However, exploiting unconventional gas sources poses significant environmental and social risks."
"No exploitation of shale gas must be carried out without an impact study which will present the associated risks and the measures required to protect the resident population and owners, in view of the environmental risks."
"Commissioner, the European Union's energy security policy is based on the diversification of energy supply sources and routes."
"Reducing dependency on Russian gas can also be achieved through implementing projects such as the Nabucco pipeline, a key priority for the European Union, along with other smaller projects, such as the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline, the Turkey-Greece-Italy Interconnector or the Azerbaijan-Georgia-Romania Interconnector, which highlight the particular importance of the Black Sea to the Union's energy security."
"(PL) Madam President, I would like to thank Commissioner Oettinger for his statement to the Polish press, in which he said that shale gas represents an opportunity for the European Union, and that, since we do not wish to be dependent on imports, the use of shale gas lies in the European Union's interests."
"However after listening to the Commissioner today, I would like to encourage him to show greater enthusiasm when talking about shale gas, which could prove to be a hidden treasure."
"I understand all his misgivings about environmental protection, which are obviously based on past experience."
"I would, however, encourage the Commission to be more active in supporting this prospecting, and to use the time you mentioned - you said that the first results may be available in five years' time - to help all those searching for shale gas to ensure that the methods used are not detrimental to the natural environment."
"This should primarily be the task of the Commission."
"I would like to encourage the Commissioner to try harder, for the sake of the shale gas which is to be found in Europe."
"(PT) Madam President, fossil fuels currently provide the vast majority of the world's primary energy needs: more than 80% of the whole, with oil at 34%, coal at 26% and natural gas at 21%."
"As we know, these resources have been exploited at rates far higher than their natural rates of replacement, meaning that their inexorable exhaustion is looming on the horizon."
"The situation of natural gas is comparable to that of oil, except that it is less widely distributed, and it is harder to transport and store."
"We therefore urgently need to diversify our energy sources."
"There are no miraculous solutions and it is necessary for the still available reserves of fossil fuels to be managed very carefully, wisely and sparingly."
"However, whatever alternatives may be found for energy supply, it is almost certain that overall energy consumption will have to decrease in relation to current levels, which is not necessarily a very bad thing."
"It is for this scenario that we must prepare ourselves, starting now."
"Madam President, in the field of energy, where the Union is facing high import dependency, much has been done to reduce the constant risks associated with our vulnerability, the most recent and clear example of which was the approval of the regulation on the security of gas supply."
"No option on our agenda should be neglected in order to reduce our energy import dependency."
"This is why I, together with other colleagues, presented Written Declaration No 67 on the possibility of exploiting alternative sources of gas in the European Union."
"I would like to share three facts with you on this matter."
"First, renewables represent an increasing part of our energy mix which is positioning gas as the major backup fuel."
"Second, the US has proven the existence of technological know-how and the economic viability of these unconventional sources, and third, the Union has a great potential in unconventional sources of gas."
"In terms of energy dependency, we are not in the position to miss any opportunity."
"Madam President, it was good to see the Commissioner in Ljubljana at the opening of ACER."
"I think it is good news for our colleagues."
"Shale gas is an opportunity to be a part of the solution."
"Therefore, before we can exploit it, we politicians have to do everything we can in order not to destroy public acceptance, but rather to build it."
"One difference certainly exists compared to the United States."
"Europe's population density is much higher than in the US. Therefore, I think we have to ask the Commission to make an impact assessment."
"We were thinking of introducing a pilot project and putting aside a bit of money, under the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, to run this and to finance the impact assessment from EU funds."
"I think if we want to build on this technology, which could be part of the solution, we need public acceptance."
"Madam President, firstly, I must say that I find myself in agreement with the Commissioner and compliment him on his balanced presentation."
"Security of energy supply has to be the sine qua non of European energy policy as we go forward."
"Obviously and ideally, we would have this from renewable sources and we have our policies in that regard, but otherwise, we have to look for it from other sources."
"We cannot continue to be dependent on Russia - you saw what they did in Georgia a few years ago - and on regimes like Gaddafi's at the present time, with the effect this has on prices."
"We look to ourselves, and if we have alternatives - which we have here through shale gas - we must exploit those to the full."
"There are those who are concerned about the environment, but the European Union's record on the environment is second to none."
"Ask any farmer in Europe and they will tell you how concerned we are about the environment and the measures we take to protect it."
"The same can apply here, but we have to look at every means of getting gas from alternative suppliers and - if I might say this tongue in cheek - we can have great gas in so doing."
"Madam President, let us try to forecast where the gas market is going."
"Today, we have presented our communication about the Energy Efficiency Plan which involves a focus on saving energy, using it more efficiently and not wasting it, along with the security of the energy supply."
"Secondly, we also have a growing requirement for energy within the European Union."
"Just one example of this is mobility."
"In Germany, there are 520 diesel-engined vehicles for every 1 000 people."
"In the new Member States, the figure is below 200."
"These two figures will converge, but they will move up rather than down towards the level in Poland."
"Thirdly, our own deposits of gas are shrinking."
"The amounts have fallen significantly in the United Kingdom during the last decade and will do the same in the Netherlands over the next decade, which means increasing dependency."
"In addition, a lot of our hopes are, of course, pinned on gas."
"Why is this?"
"Although it is a fossil fuel, it is far more environmentally friendly when it comes to CO2 emissions than coal or oil and much more flexible than nuclear power and coal."
"For this reason, gas is essential in order to ensure that electricity can increasingly be generated from renewable energy sources."
"If we look at the subject of the base load, it is currently around 8 000 hours per year, while the figure for wind power, depending on the situation, is between 2 000 and 5 000 hours and for solar energy between only 600 and 2 000 hours."
"This makes it clear that we need gas."
"If we want renewable energy, then gas is its logical partner, however difficult that may be for many people to accept."
"I am therefore working on the basis of an annual requirement of 600 billion cubic metres in Europe, rather than 300 billion. This will result in a dependency level of 80%."
"For this reason, we must first diversify and modernise our transport routes, so that they meet the latest technical requirements."
"We must also eliminate islands, develop our storage capacity and diversify our sources."
"This means that, alongside Russia, Norway, Algeria, Qatar and Libya, we should also obtain gas from the Caspian region."
"Gas from this area can be brought into the European gas market via the Turkey-Greece-Italy Interconnector (ITGI), the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) and Nabucco."
"In the interests of diversification, I do not exclude the possibility of using gas from rocks in the Member States."
"This process is only just beginning."
"However, there is the question of whether we need regulatory intervention from Europe."
"Why might this be the case?"
"Let us assume that Poland hands out licences arbitrarily and this puts the groundwater or the soil in Poland at risk."
"This would be unlikely to have any major impact outside Poland's borders."
"We need to look at the following question, if we do not want to take ourselves too seriously."
"Do we not trust the government in Warsaw to ensure that there is clean water and clean soil for the sake of the health of its citizens and to protect ownership rights?"
"I trust every democratically elected government in Europe which is accountable to a parliament and to the public to do this."
"Therefore, if we are serious about subsidiarity, we need to consider why a borehole in Poland should be controlled, authorised or rejected by Brussels and not by Warsaw."
"I have fundamental confidence in the national governments."
"I do not distrust them."
"Nevertheless, I am happy to discuss the subject of common regulations."
"We must investigate whether the European regulatory framework is sufficiently comprehensive and whether environmental law, soil conservation law, groundwater regulations, health and safety at work for the employees involved and people in the area and ownership rights will all be guaranteed."
"I do not know, but I suspect that what my spokesperson said is right."
"There is room for improvement in the European regulations."
"That is true in all areas."
"It applies to the quotas for women and it also applies here."
"For this reason, we will investigate the possibilities for improvement."
"We will also ask the Member States to give us a common, coordinated list of authorisation requirements."
"All this has been happening without any definite conclusions being drawn."
"The USA is similar to Europe in some ways, but not in others."
"It has a quite different population density and, therefore, subjects such as local residents, health and safety and groundwater play a quite different role than in densely populated areas in central Europe, such as Poland, Germany or France."
"We will commission an expert report which will involve investigating what the risks are on the basis of typical applications for test boreholes within the EU and whether the legislative framework in the European Union is up to the job, whether the legal regulations in the Member States are adequate, and whether, and if so where, we need to introduce improvements at an EU level."
"I advise everyone not to bring emotion into this subject."
"In reply to the French Member of this House who said that their interests were not being protected, I would say that in France, my interest in seeing the highest possible levels of safety for nuclear power plants is much more important than trial boreholes for shale gas, at least at the moment."
"I would like to make one last point which is off the record."
"I am very grateful to you for coming here so late in the day and for staying to take part in the debate."
"I regret the fact that a whole series of Members, and I was a Member of this House for a long time, which is why I can say this, have taken the floor and then left the Chamber."
"I do not think that there are any important events going on elsewhere."
"I believe that it is not fair to me or to you to take the floor and then to leave."
"This sort of behaviour is not good for Parliament's reputation."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Gas extracted using non-traditional technologies may play a special part in the EU's energy market in the future."
"The reason for this is that the exploitation of alternative gas sources in the EU would significantly mitigate Europe's increasing gas imports and the gas supply exposure of Central and Eastern European countries."
"Additionally, a consideration we must not ignore is the fact that the spreading of new gas sources within the EU could contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in a cost-effective manner."
"In the United States, the new technology has already revolutionised the gas market over the past few years."
"As a result of the use of alternative gas sources, which currently constitute more than half of the US production, gas prices have dropped significantly and the country no longer has to rely on import sources."
"In Europe, the world's largest gas market, the exploitation of alternative gas sources is still in its infancy."
"Despite the success in the US, the results of the European pilot investments launched so far fell short of expectations."
"In addition to different geological conditions, investors are also faced with higher regulatory and environmental risks in Europe."
"In order to translate the American success to the EU, it would be important for Europe to have an appropriate strategy for alternative gas sources."
"A comprehensive assessment at European level would be required in order to clearly identify the opportunities lying in alternative gas sources, as well as the related risks."
"This, because Europe cannot afford the luxury of renouncing the option of alternative gas production that could be exploited within the EU in an age where the traditional gas sources of the North Sea are being depleted."
"Gas supply security will depend, in future, not only on the EU's relations with third-country gas producers, but also on the development of gas production in the EU."
"Investing in technological development in the area of extracting natural gas from alternative sources could make a vital contribution in the future to reducing dependency on gas imports."
"I think that the potential existence and extraction of shale gas in Europe must not be ignored and I expect the Commission to prepare a technical and economic study on the feasibility of extraction."
"There are various sources of funding available in Europe which can support Member States in making the necessary investment in infrastructure, production and in measures aimed at achieving energy efficiency at regional and local level."
"These include, in particular, loans and guarantees from the European Investment Bank, or finances available via regional, structural or cohesion funds."
"Based on these financing instruments and within the budget outlook for 2014-2020, the Commission must also identify a financing solution for exploiting gas from alternative sources, which could have a far-reaching impact on the European gas and energy market."

"Opening of the sitting"
"Welcome to the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we are making an early start today because we have an important debate."
"Request for waiver of parliamentary immunity: see Minutes"

"Documents received: see Minutes"
"Southern Neighbourhood, and Libya in particular, including humanitarian aspects (debate)"
"Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. - Mr President, honourable Members, thank you for the opportunity to discuss with this House the circumstances in our Southern Neighbourhood and, of course, with particular reference, as the President has said, to the situation in Libya."
"Let me begin by stating the obvious which is that the Southern Neighbourhood is changing fast and across the region, people are standing up for that core human aspiration: to be able to shape their own lives, economically and politically."
"They call for political participation with dignity, accountability, they call for justice and they call for jobs."
"I believe we have to respond to those calls."
"I believe they are just and I believe that we need to make sure that we act quickly."
"A crucial aspect of what is going on is that the demand is coming from within."
"In my visits to Tunisia and Egypt, I heard many, many times: this is our country; this is our revolution."
"We want to do things our way but we want to engage with you and we need help."
"Those principles, I believe, should guide the actions that we take: these democratic transitions must belong to the people; they must be home-grown."
"They will determine what happens next."
"But we have to be ready to offer the support, ready with creativity and determination and to do so on a scale that matches the historic nature of the changes we are seeing."
"In a fluid situation like this, we have to have our actions rooted in our core values and our core interests."
"We have every reason to back the changes under way."
"Tunisians, Egyptians, Libyans and others are demanding respect for those values that actually are at the heart of the European ideal."
"The emergence of the democratic societies will help to sustain security and provide shared prosperity in our neighbourhood and that is why we have moved between us, the Commission and myself, to produce a joint paper for the European Council that meets on Friday which includes measures that we hope will contribute to that: more European Union financial support available from within the institutions, but also by mobilising the European Investment Bank - and I pay tribute to Parliament for moving so swiftly to recognise the need to assist the Investment Bank with its mandate to be able to put that support at the disposal of people - and that has been extremely successful."
"We need your help to do more for the EIB and also for the EBRD, both of whom have been talking with me about the capacity that they have to alter their mandates and be able to put new support at the disposal of this neighbourhood - not, I hasten to add, at the expense of the work that they currently do, but in addition."
"With the European Investment Bank, we know that we can mobilise a further EUR 1 billion."
"Just so you can appreciate the amount that that will give, the current work of the Investment Bank in Egypt is EUR 488 million."
"This would be able to allow them to double the investment at least and that would enable some of the big infrastructure projects which are clearly needed and wanted by the people to be set in place."
"We also want to see, through the paper, support with the training and exchange of students."
"These are young populations."
"One of the common factors across the Southern Neighbourhood is that it is a young society; those young people, some of them highly educated, some of them wanting further opportunities in education and training - we should respond to them as well, and we will be inviting Member States to consider that and I invite the Parliament to do so as well."
"The emergence of a vibrant civil society: meeting with civil society in Tunisia, I met with people who had never been in the same room before because it had not been allowed."
"Their willingness and desire to establish themselves more fully as NGOs, as organisations able to work on issues of concern in their society and to hold their government to account, that is an extremely important part, as you know so well, of the development of this society."
"From that stems more inclusive governance: the ability of people to feel that they have a stake and a say in the governance of their society."
"Of course, too, food security, a huge and growing issue in the region; further trade openings; the ability to get greater market access and mobility partnerships - all of these are included in the overall package that will be put to the European Council."
"I stress again, as I have done before, we want to see this as an incentive-based approach enabling people to move quickly, but also to differentiate."
"These countries are all different and they are at pains to say, 'Please do not put us all together and see us as the same."
"We are different countries; we wish our societies to develop as differently as yours have."
"Yes, there are similarities but our distinctive difference is something we wish to ensure that you respect and you work with'. We want to take an approach which says that we give more for more; that those partners, those countries who want to go further and faster with reforms, should be able to count on greater support from the European Union."
"In the coming days and weeks, as we have already been doing, we will be discussing with our international partners how we can coordinate so that we do not overlap and so that we are able to respond more quickly."
"On 23 February, I held a senior officials' meeting with officials from the institutions, the World Bank, the Investment Bank, the EBRD, the IMF, but also senior officials from China, Russia, from Australia, from Korea, from the 27 Member States, from the United States and from Arab countries."
"The purpose of that meeting was not to decide what we would do to these countries but to be ready to be able to offer support quickly."
"Honourable Members know that one of the criticisms which can be made about us is that sometimes we take a long time to respond."
"I want us to be ready and my conversations with, particularly, the Arab League and with the countries concerned have been aimed at making it really clear that my purpose is to make sure we are ready to be able to respond and that that response is coordinated and effective and uses the best that we have available, not only in Europe, but across the world."
"After the Foreign Ministers meet tomorrow, and the European Council meets on Friday, the NATO meeting I will attend tomorrow and then the informal Foreign Ministers' meeting over the weekend in Hungary, I will then fly to Cairo to meet with Amr Moussa, the Arab League and to debrief all of them on what has happened in our discussions and also to meet a new Egyptian Foreign Minister whom I have already spoken to. But, colleagues, I know there is a specific desire to talk about Libya so, having given that backdrop of the work we are doing, let me move on to the issues that concern us all in Libya."
"I see two immediate priorities: first of all, to address the humanitarian crisis and assist with the evacuation, and second to make sure the violence stops and that those who perpetrate that violence are held to account."
"On the humanitarian aid side, we have moved quickly."
"The Commission has increased its assistance to EUR 30 million; my colleague, Commissioner Kristalina Georgieva, went to the Tunisian-Libyan border last week to look at what was happening and to make sure that our engagement was working well."
"We have also, of course, been in touch with the UN on a constant basis to coordinate our activities and Member States have allocated important resources to tackle what is an immense challenge posed by the continuous flow of people, including through FRONTEX."
"On the evacuation of EU citizens, the External Action Service has been instrumental in making sure that we have a rapid exchange of information and most effective use of our resources."
"Together with the Presidency, I activated the EU Civil Protection Mechanism on 23 February to help facilitate the evacuation of EU citizens."
"Getting information in real time, as honourable Members know, is a challenge, but we needed to make the right choices and so at my request, Agostino Miozzo, the EEAS Managing Director for Crisis Response, travelled to Tripoli on Sunday and Monday to get an assessment of what is happening on the ground."
"He met with officials, he met with ambassadors, in a situation which he described to me as calm but extremely tense."
"Our European ambassadors welcomed the chance to talk in detail and to feed directly into our work their analysis of what is happening on the ground which, combined with contacts that we are making everywhere, helps us to establish a clearer picture of the situation."
"Of course, we focused a lot of our efforts initially on the evacuation of European citizens and we have to show solidarity with Tunisia, which is bearing the brunt of the evacuation of so many people, especially Egyptians who are ending up on the Tunisian border and need to be brought to Egypt."
"Honourable Members know that there are about one million Egyptians in Libya, and about one and a half to two million people from the African countries that surround Libya who are currently there, and we know from what we heard is happening in Tripoli that there are about two to three thousand African people at the airport who are waiting to see how they are going to leave."
"We have to be ready though to step up our support for the Libyan people."
"As I have said, this is a very fluid situation and we have to read it very carefully."
"I have asked my services, therefore, on a prudent planning basis, to look at a possible CSDP engagement; that engagement would be to support current evacuation and humanitarian efforts."
"As always with any CSDP options, this needs to be very carefully analysed and we will need proper answers on questions of mandate, resources and objectives."
"That work, I can tell you, is ongoing this week."
"Dealing effectively with the humanitarian crisis is fundamental, ending the violence is a prerequisite to everything else."
"That is why I am pleased that the international community as a whole, through the UN Security Council, has made its position clear: that the violence is unacceptable; it must stop and people should be held to account."
"I am glad that agreement was found in New York on the European demand to include a referral to the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court."
"This was a European initiative and they have already started preliminary investigations into alleged war crimes."
"Not surprisingly, we are working very closely with our partners: with the UN, with NATO, with the USA, with Turkey, with the Arab League and with many, many other countries with whom we are in daily contact."
"We have, as you would expect me to say, our own responsibility."
"We immediately suspended the negotiations of the EU-Libya framework agreement, together with all cooperation of a technical nature."
"(Applause)"
"We started preparatory work on restrictive measures ahead of the UN Security Council."
"In addition to the UN sanctions, we adopted on 28 February further restrictive measures: we have an embargo on equipment which could be used for internal repression and autonomous designations under the travel restrictions and assets freeze."
"We are now in the process of adding several entities controlled by Gaddafi and his closest associates to that list."
"Honourable Members, we will remain at the forefront of the international efforts to restore peace and stability in Libya."
"Once we get an end to the violence, we have to work to support the emergence of a new Libya with democratically chosen leaders and where people's rights are respected."
"In line with what I have said from the very beginning, we will not be dictating outcomes but supporting pluralism, accountability, deep democracy and shared prosperity."
"By their nature, crises are a test of our policies, our resources and our abilities to respond in real time and the events in the Southern Neighbourhood represent an enormous challenge for the European Union."
"I believe, as Vice-President of the Commission, that how we respond will define this Commission for years to come."
"So I look to the European Parliament and I need your support, because it is only our collective effort that is going to help to bring the European Union together, to confirm a strong position."
"We cannot afford to think small; we cannot afford to let inflexibility get in our way."
"We can and we have to respond in a strategic and united way."
"But I believe that if we do, we can make a real difference, supporting the people in the region who are asking for our support, but supporting them as they shape their own future."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, the European Union finds itself torn between two frustrations in the Libyan crisis, between what is desirable - the earliest possible disappearance of a criminal regime that is determined to die killing - and what is achievable."
"If we are honest, Mr President, we must acknowledge that the European Union, despite all its efforts, has not lived up to public expectations."
"This is not a criticism, Baroness Ashton, but rather a question of powers."
"We have acted promptly and we have acted well, within the scope of our powers, with the European Union fully endorsing Resolution 1970 of the United Nations Security Council."
"However, we are not a military union."
"We are aspiring to be a political union, and we are still only an embryonic player on the international stage."
"This is why, Mr President, whilst we are holding this debate, whilst the United Nations Human Rights Council is meeting today, and whilst the Council of Ministers for Defence, the Foreign Affairs Council and the European Council are meeting tomorrow, people are still dying in Libya."
"It is against this backdrop that we must think about what it is that we can do."
"Can we stand aside whilst innocent civilians are massacred?"
"Can we remain impassive to the 'Somalisation' of Libya, whilst the United Nations Security Council reaches another slow motion decision?"
"The European Union must send a message that is loud and clear, and has a single message: 'the Gaddafi regime must end right now'."
"This message must be accompanied by a set of measures that ratchet up the pressure."
"First and foremost, Mr President, the no-fly zone, the neutralising of Mr Gaddafi's communications - and I believe we should congratulate the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe for bringing representatives of the Libyan opposition to the European Parliament - and, of course, international coordination, most particularly with the African Union and also with the Arab League."
"This, Mr President, is what the public is expecting of us, and you will have the full support of our political group to achieve it, Baroness Ashton."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you, Baroness Ashton, for your words and the brilliant and self-contained manner in which you set out your position, as well as your analysis of the situation in our Southern Neighbourhood and in Libya."
"We are facing an enormous challenge."
"We are experiencing a truly historic change in the political balance of the world, in particular, in our immediate neighbourhood."
"We have to deal with widely differing developments."
"We cannot speak of a uniform process."
"The uniform process is revolution, but it is very specific to each country and very varied between them."
"It is different in Morocco from in Tunisia, in Algeria from in Egypt, and Libya is a special case which we are discussing intensively."
"Gaddafi is a criminal."
"He is a murderer who belongs before an international criminal court."
"We probably all agree that this man will not escape his punishment one way or another."
"The best thing would be for the Libyan people to be able to resolve this problem themselves and for them to then do so."
"We are faced with a major challenge that requires a clear head."
"We have to make a choice, including in what we say here."
"On the one hand, our emotion tells us that this criminal must be stopped, that the fratricide in his own country must be stopped, and that we should not exclude any necessary measures to achieve that, including any military ones."
"That is what our consciences say to us."
"On the other hand, however, we all know how international politics works and that a wrong decision in this area can have wide-ranging and long-term consequences."
"Of course, it is easy to say that we will intervene quickly, but even the implementation of a no-fly zone requires us to take the decision to put warplanes in the air and destroy the Libyan air force on the ground."
"These are acts of war, implemented by NATO, which could perhaps solve a problem in Libya only to give rise to a number of problems throughout the wider region."
"I therefore advise, urgently, that everything that we do be done within the framework of international law and, specifically, on the basis of a resolution from the United Nations Security Council and - this is the major common denominator - with the involvement of the Arab League and the African Union."
"We are including this in the resolution, which is a sensible thing to do."
"If we want to intervene in Libya, the only sensible option for this to happen is on the basis of a resolution of the Security Council and with the involvement of Arab states."
"It is therefore worth me repeating that we should not exclude anything but we should also not satisfy short-term feelings rashly and with trite words that feel instinctively right but that - and I want to reiterate this - could be dangerous in the long term."
"That would be dangerous."
"In the European Council - and I turn to you, Mr Buzek, at this point, as you will be representing Parliament at the meeting of the European Council over the coming days - the question of whether we need a Marshall Plan for the whole region has been raised."
"My response would be yes, we do need a kind of Marshall Plan for the whole region."
"I would like to remind everyone, though, what the Marshall Plan meant for Europe."
"It meant that George Marshall proposed to the United States of America that a percentage of the total economic output of the United States be devoted to Europe."
"The results of this are well known - today, it calls itself the European Union, and it has levels of prosperity and democratic development and a peace dividend that this continent has never experienced before."
"I would also observe, however, that the same governments that are discussing this will believe even 1% of the total economic output to be too high a price for the European Union."
"You cannot make these trite demands and then do nothing!"
"If we want stability to be brought to our Southern Neighbourhood, we will have to provide a good deal of funding."
"This is because there is one thing that the people there need, and that is the prospect of being able to live in peace, democracy and prosperity, in other words, the prospect of also obtaining for themselves what we have."
"That must be the goal of all the efforts that we undertake over the forthcoming days, weeks and months, including here in the European Parliament."
"After all, all the fine words and nice resolutions that we adopt together deliver precisely nothing for the people of our Southern Neighbourhood - it is tangible acts that they need."
"For that reason, the common goal for all of us must be the establishment of a free trade zone aimed at economic parity between North Africa and the European Union."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I think what we need now, Mrs Ashton, is a very clear message and statement from you and from the European Council on Libya."
"I think three things are necessary in this message."
"People are still being killed, so what we are saying is not neutral: what we are saying can help on the ground."
"Firstly, we have to recognise - or at least to start the process to recognise - the National Interim Council as the representative of the Libyan people."
"I think someone who is killing his own people in huge numbers has lost all legitimacy."
"We therefore have to start the process of recognition because that can help the opposition to win this battle against Gaddafi politically."
"The second thing we have to do - and the second message you have to give - is that we have to step up all kinds of help."
"The opposition needs medicine, food, telephone lines, which are all things that we can provide."
"Thirdly, we have to paralyse the killing power of Gaddafi as quickly as possible."
"There is a clear consensus in Libyan society: there should be no direct military intervention in Libya."
"It is a Libyan revolution and it has to remain a Libyan revolution."
"What they need is a no-fly zone."
"The European Union - the Council and you - must ask the UN as soon as possible to adopt a resolution on this, creating a no-fly zone and stopping the bombing of cities which are in the hands of the opposition."
"Those are the three clear messages we need, and we need them now."
"We do not need them in one week or two weeks; we need them today, tomorrow and certainly on Friday when the European Council will make its first political statement on this issue."
"Those are the three key elements that are necessary today."
"(FR) Mr President, I would like to use this speech to make a rather broad point, because what is happening is, of course, historic, and I believe it is essential."
"I firmly believe that what is happening today in Libya, Tunisia and Egypt is an unprecedented opportunity to create the conditions necessary for a peaceful resolution of a conflict that has been going on now for decades between Israel and Palestine."
"I urge Israel to be bold enough today to take the political steps to launch a peace process quickly with the Palestinian State."
"The opportunity to show that the democratic process under way in that region is a gift from history that can rid the region and the world of a conflict that has caused so much pain, so many misunderstandings, and so many tragedies, must be seized with both hands."
"This message must be sent today to that region."
"Mr President, Baroness Ashton, you said a moment ago, Baroness Ashton, that we must respect peoples and their desire for freedom."
"Let us be frank."
"For years, we have failed to do that."
"We were party to the dictatorships - we, the European Union and all the Member States."
"So you have now ceased negotiating with Colonel Gaddafi?"
"Mazel tov!"
"Are you serious?"
"Do you really think you could have carried on?"
"For years, this European Union, these Member States and Mr Berlusconi negotiated the return, for example, of refugees to Libya."
"Was nobody interested in how those refugees were treated by Colonel Gaddafi?"
"(Applause)"
"We should, after all, engage in a little self-criticism where this matter is concerned."
"Today, a nation has risen up."
"It has representatives."
"When the people of Poland rose up, no one asked if Solidarność had been democratically elected;"
"Solidarność was recognised straight away, it was helped."
"I call for you to recognise this interim government, because it is the only force that can bring about democracy."
"Yes, we need to keep a cool head, Mr Schulz, but we also need to choose which side we are on."
"Two things are needed."
"Firstly, Colonel Gaddafi must not win, because if he wins, it will destroy any hope of democracy in many regions and it will be a victory for the dictators!"
"Therefore, our policy must be geared towards saying: Colonel Gaddafi must lose, and the Libyans must emerge victorious against Colonel Gaddafi."
"Secondly, the Libyans do not want any foreign military intervention, that is true."
"Yet they are saying: 'We want a no-fly zone'."
"The African Union is talking about a no-fly zone."
"The Arab League is talking about a no-fly zone."
"Therefore, it is not NATO."
"The agreement to impose a no-fly zone is primarily intended to create a new balance of power in political terms, to isolate Colonel Gaddafi from the UN, and to say that we will go through either the Security Council or the General Assembly, which voted 100% in favour of excluding Libya from the Human Rights Council."
"This means that Colonel Gaddafi is completely isolated."
"It says to him: 'You have no future, you have no chance!'"
"The military exclusion zone is, first and foremost, a political act."
"How can it be achieved?"
"There are countless ideas."
"Clearly, no one is going to bomb Libya, but an aeroplane taking off could, for example, be brought down."
"Colonel Gaddafi has to be shown that he will not be allowed to bomb Libyan towns."
"There are options."
"This is a political act that we must carry out."
"(Applause)"
"I really do believe that if we take the bull by the horns and recognise this interim government, we will get the European Union, the United Nations and the Arab League moving."
"Let us speed up the isolation of Colonel Gaddafi, and then I believe that his days as a dictator in Libya will be numbered."
"Now, there is also the issue of humanitarian aid."
"Doctors are needed, and there needs to be a way of transporting the wounded out of Libya."
"Some ports are open, and all the humanitarian aid should come via the east of Libya."
"Lastly, food aid and military aid are needed, too."
"This is the choice before us: if Colonel Gaddafi is to lose, the others need to win."
"Let us ensure that what happened in Bosnia is not repeated."
"An embargo was imposed on the Bosnians and on the Serbs."
"Everyone was in agreement."
"No, it is one side against the other here."
"We want a military embargo, an arms embargo against Colonel Gaddafi."
"We want to give the people of Libya the opportunity to liberate themselves with weapons, because this is the situation - this is what Colonel Gaddafi wanted."
"I would like to end on the subject of refugees and humanitarian aid."
"Let us use all the instruments at the EU's disposal to temporarily accommodate the refugees and ensure that they are recognised by the United Nations Human Rights Council."
"There are thousands of refugees who are recognised as such by the UNHCR in the camps."
"We should let them come to Europe!"
"If we do that, we will be making a very powerful humanitarian and political gesture, and we will be acting in such a way as to ensure that Europe is recognised at last, that Europe's values are recognised, because we are taking action to uphold those values and to ensure freedom in Libya, Tunisia and Egypt."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, this is an extraordinary debate."
"I agree with almost everything that Daniel Cohn-Bendit has said today, which makes me a bit worried."
"As I have always said, Gaddafi remains the Fidel Castro of Africa, although not even Castro would have resorted to such savage violence as we have seen recently from the Gaddafi regime and his sociopathic sons against civilian protestors."
"Last January, I drew attention to the fact that Gaddafi used to be a huge sponsor of terrorism."
"Now, of course, he stands accused of terrorising his own people."
"Gaddafi spent a lot of money and time courting the West, trying to make us think he was a changed man."
"That has not happened, of course."
"With vast oil revenues at his disposal, he was able to dispense largesse in return for political acquiescence throughout Europe and Africa, not least in my own country, the United Kingdom, particularly under the previous government."
"Our first priority now is to help bring an end to the senseless violence in Libya."
"I was amongst the first in this House to call for a no-fly zone."
"I thank France and the United Kingdom for pursuing this vigorously over the entire country to stop Gaddafi bombing his own people and flying in mercenaries, mainly from Algeria and sub-Saharan Africa."
"I believe that the Security Council - particularly with the Russian and Chinese veto at stake - may not sanction this issue of a no-fly zone."
"We should now seriously consider recognising the Transitional National Council in Benghazi as the legitimate Libyan Government, so that it could invite military assistance in without the need for recourse to a UN resolution."
"This would prevent further civilian massacres and give the pro-democracy rebels a real chance."
"Fortunately, most EU citizens in Libya were safely evacuated - and this was done efficiently - but it was clear to me that most EU Member States were only interested in helping their own nationals."
"The Maastricht Treaty provisions that allow EU citizens, wherever they are, to seek consular protection from any Member State in times of urgent need appeared to have been totally forgotten during the evacuation process."
"Mr President, we cannot understand the uprising in Libya without understanding the revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt."
"Precisely because this uprising in Libya is part of an historic, revolutionary and popular process which will bring democracy to the southern Mediterranean and to the whole of the Arab world, Europe's position, and the changes in its position, regarding the way in which it has been acting in Libya are of paramount importance."
"The days of Gaddafi's regime are numbered because it is a dictatorship, and the people have ceased to fear it."
"It cannot survive when its neighbours are in the process of transition to democracy, and also because it is isolated within the international community."
"However, when considering this change in the European position, something needs to be said about the past, as the European Union was one of the pillars of support for the old regime."
"The resolution does not say so, but the weapons with which the Libyan people are being repressed are largely European weapons and bombs."
"I therefore want to make myself very clear."
"The left is in favour of freezing assets, of the arms embargo, of fostering a relationship with the uprising, and of all humanitarian aid measures, but I would also like to make it clear that we are against any form of military intervention, including the measure that might open the door to such intervention: the no-fly zone."
"This has been spoken of clearly here."
"We have experience: we know how military interventions are started, and we know that once started they never stop."
"Mr President, a true Libyan drama is playing out before European eyes on our southern border, as Gaddafi's regime of terror is not only holding its ground; it is very much on the attack against renegade regions of the country."
"Meanwhile, murder is the order of the day in the capital, Tripoli, and countless Libyan citizens are disappearing without trace."
"This is a tragic situation that underscores the opinion of an experienced traveller to Libya that the only effective means is probably armed intervention."
"Mr President, I can, however, understand Western reluctance to use this ultimate means."
"I have considerably less understanding, though, for the delay and procrastination in establishing a no-fly zone over Libya."
"After all, inactivity in this regard has a high price, namely, prolonging the major suffering of the Libyan people."
"The European Union can and must help lay the foundation for a post-Gaddafi Libya and for better prospects for the future for this tribal State."
"First, let us break Gaddafi's air force and leave the 'Brother Leader', as he likes to call himself, paralysed."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the leniency and the powerlessness we have demonstrated for a very long time now should not give way to a desire for chaotic intervention, the adverse effects of which would be immediately obvious."
"For once, I can say that, broadly speaking, I approved of Mr Schulz's cautious speech."
"Indeed, I believe that the abundant good intentions of this House, the desire for humanitarian intervention, and the interference in others' affairs, have truly adverse effects."
"You want the dictators to leave their countries, and you are right."
"Yet if you really want them to go, you have to give them a way out."
"You cannot start by denying them a visa to leave their own country, nor can you promise them a life spent in prison as their only prospect for the future."
"If and when you do that - and this is a fact, Mr Cohn-Bendit - you will give them no other option but to fight until the last drop of blood has been shed by their people."
"That is a fact!"
"Traditional international law therefore had a considerable advantage over everything we are hearing today, and it is a real pity that it has been overlooked and, above all, that it has been overlooked by those who heaped praise on these dictators not so long ago."
"I was not the one who invited Mr Ben Ali to this House and who listened respectfully to his speech."
"It was all of you, ladies and gentlemen, and we heard very few protests then!"
"Mr President, at its beginning, the uprising in Libya had the same motivations and characteristics as events in Tunisia and Egypt."
"The Gaddafi regime undertook an unprecedented lethal repression using air force, helicopter gunships and ruthless mercenaries shooting to kill unarmed civilians. The massacre caused defections in the army, the government and the diplomatic service."
"The people in Benghazi and elsewhere took arms from the defecting army, and the uprising is now an armed conflict, unequal in terms of power."
"Gaddafi has lost any legitimacy to lead, having committed crimes against humanity, against his own people."
"The protracted conflict is causing a great humanitarian disaster inside and along the Libyan borders."
"It risks creating migratory flows towards the EU, in particular, the southern Member States."
"It also raises the world price of oil to levels dangerous for the world economy."
"It is therefore imperative that the conflict ends immediately, but Gaddafi must not prevail."
"The no-fly zone must be implemented urgently and we should use all other possible means to assist the pro-democratic Libyans to defeat the forces who, through bribery, intimidation and tribal manipulation, are still supporting Gaddafi."
"We can imagine what it will mean if Gaddafi succeeds."
"We will be witnessing a situation worse than that of Rwanda, to the shame of all humanity."
"Resolute action is needed now."
"Mr President, the European Parliament seconds the United Nations in their unanimous message to the Libyan dictator: step down, stop the bloodshed, face justice."
"In the face of Gaddafi's retaliation against his people, the EU must exercise the responsibility to protect by helping to enforce a no-fly zone, as envisaged by the Arab League, the OIC and the African Union, and the other measures decided on by the Security Council, with all means available, including CSDP assets - please note, Mrs Ashton - namely, to enforce the arms embargo."
"The EU must do more to assist all those trying to escape or who are stranded in Libya by supporting UNHCR and humanitarian organisations on the ground and by helping to resettle refugees who cannot be repatriated, such as Somalis, Eritreans and Ethiopians."
"A burden-sharing action plan to resettle refugees, a common asylum system, temporary protection measures - all should urgently be enacted by the European Union in compliance with the solidarity clause and the principle of non-refoulement, and as part of a coherent and long-term strategy to deal with the impact of political transition in the north of Africa, addressing the root causes of migration."
"The EU must revise the ENP South, must prioritise support for capacity and institution-building to sustain the rule of law, human rights, including women's rights, and to prepare genuine elections."
"The EU must immediately establish relations with emerging political forces in Libya, namely the Interim Transitional Council, to encourage democratic transition and to ensure that democracy delivers the freedoms, the development and the dignity that the Libyan people are showing us they aspire to."
"(DE) Mr President, this debate here in the European Parliament makes one thing clear, and that is that we are not neutral when it comes to this conflict."
"We are on the side of the democratic revolution."
"Gaddafi must go and Europe must play an active role in bringing that about."
"There is a sharing of the workload here at the international level."
"We are discussing a no-fly zone, something for which - as Mr Schulz correctly identified - the backing of the UN Security Council is required."
"What do we do if Moscow and Beijing do not grant their assent?"
"Well, then we would have to close this loophole in international law."
"We would have to take on the responsibility of protecting the unarmed population regardless, with the aid of the Arab League and the African Union, but also with the aid of an active role on the part of the European Union."
"Military implementation would then be the responsibility of NATO and its partners, but politically and economically, the European Union would continue to also have the key role to play, long after, in such a scenario, NATO and the United Nations had finished playing their major roles."
"There is one thing that I would like to say quite clearly, and that is that I was very pleased, Mr Schulz, to hear you say that we need a free trade zone."
"This is because, if we do not allow these people's products into the EU, they will continue to come across the Mediterranean in coracles and in their masses to overwhelm Lampedusa."
"We certainly do not want that."
"Let us, therefore, create the free trade zone, let us allow the products into the EU, so that the people there also have an economic future in their democratised countries."
"(PL) Mr President, developments in Libya are the latest in a series of events in North Africa and the Middle East."
"The provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon allow the European Union to make use of the External Action Service, but hitherto, the service has been sluggish in its approach to events in the region."
"I have twice appealed at least for a mission to be sent there."
"It is to be welcomed that in the case of Libya, such a mission has been sent."
"Its objective is to evaluate humanitarian efforts, but specific political action is also needed."
"According to the UN, 1 000 people have already died in Libya, and according to human rights organisations, the figure may be as high as 6 000."
"The turbulence in the region is translating into a rise in crude oil prices in world markets, something which is very apparent to everyone who lives in the European Union."
"It is in our vital interest that at the next summit, the Union adopt a definite position, taking action which is correlated with the efforts of United States diplomacy. Thank you very much."
"Mr President, the momentous events in North Africa may have profound consequences for good or bad for the future prosperity and peace of western civilisation, but we are watching the outcome of a process that began 40 years ago."
"The West has been held to ransom by oil-producing states, and we have transferred billions upon billions of dollars to corrupt and despotic regimes."
"Without oil, Colonel Gaddafi would have been nothing more than a local tinpot dictator."
"We have to hope that countries like Libya produce democratic and liberal regimes - for their sakes and for our own - but we cannot rely on this. What western countries must do is concentrate funds and scientific research to find an alternative to oil."
"If there is one lesson in this crisis that we have to learn above all others, it is that western civilisations must not be dependent on others for their vital energy supplies."
"(DE) Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to offer my sincere thanks to the High Representative for the account she has given us and for her efforts over recent weeks, which could have put Europe on the map just a little bit if we continue to approach this issue with the necessary courage and take the necessary steps."
"Despite the differences, the events in North Africa are highly comparable with those of 1989."
"The people are calling for freedom and better living conditions."
"Alongside humanitarian aid, which we have to provide now, we must offer the people of North Africa our assistance, if they want it, in developing democracy there."
"Democracy, however, will only survive if these people are helped to achieve better living conditions at the same time."
"We have heard talk, in this connection, of a Marshall Plan and of a free trade zone - all of which is necessary, as it could be positive for us in a tremendously dramatic and historic sense for democracy, freedom and better living conditions to establish themselves in these countries."
"We therefore must not treat this as run-of-the-mill and we must act quickly."
"In order to prevent the murderer Gaddafi from reasserting himself, we need to hearten people and show them that we are on their side."
"It is therefore important that relations be established with the Interim Council."
"We must act as contacts in order to make it clear, in this way, that we are setting other elements in motion."
"We must help bring about the total isolation of Gaddafi so that he is separated from his own people and so that no future is possible with Gaddafi, so that the people break away from him."
"This must also include us preventing Gaddafi from bombing his own people."
"This means that a no-fly zone - or whatever else - is necessary in order to provide protection and encouragement in order to ensure that those who are fighting for their freedom are not demoralised."
"Furthermore, since we can do this together with the Arab League, in recognition of the United Nations charter, there would not need to be a UN resolution if Russia were involved. We must, then, help the people there so that they are able to fight their way to freedom in this conflict and so that a sustained civil war with this murderer does not arise."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(PT) Mr President, I just want to check whether I heard Mr Brok correctly: did you say that a military solution, or a decision of a military nature, does not, in his opinion, require a United Nations decision?"
"If that is indeed what you said, I have to say that I disagree with you a thousand times over."
"(DE) Mr President, I specifically said that that would have to take place in cooperation with the Arab League and with Arab countries."
"Secondly, it is desirable for legitimacy to be gained by means of a United Nations resolution."
"However, if this should be vetoed by one of the Permanent Members of the Security Council, there are plenty of examples of how the United Nations charter can be used appropriately."
"We cannot allow a veto by one of the Permanent Members to block us from preventing Gaddafi from murdering his own people."
"Mr President, the recent events of historical importance in our Southern Neighbourhood call for a resetting of our policies there, but we have to start with the lessons to be learnt."
"Firstly, we must learn that relying on authoritarian leaders or imposing our model of life is wrong."
"We must leave those people to build their democracy in their way and under their conditions."
"Secondly, we must understand that the national fragmentation of our aid-for-development policy that sometimes allows the promotion of national geopolitical agendas deprives us and the countries in the area of the benefits of security through development."
"Thirdly, our lack of vision and political will in addressing the regional security challenges, mainly the Israeli-Palestinian issue, leads us towards ever worse crises."
"On Libya, amongst other countries, we must remember that not all those fighting a dictator are democrats and change per se is not always for the better."
"We can therefore speak about dialogue, engagement, humanitarian assistance, but recognition might be too early, and recourse to military means should be ruled out or, at any rate, be subject to United Nations approval and Arab League cooperation."
"Otherwise, we could be led into an adventure, the results of which may be difficult to cope with."
"(FR) Mr President, Baroness Ashton, this time, Europe must be present at the meeting."
"Friday's summit will have to recognise unequivocally and unreservedly the legitimacy of the National Council, the demands of which are simple."
"Firstly, the humanitarian emergency."
"A civil war is taking place in Libya."
"We must increase our efforts to send food, medicines and doctors tenfold, and we must offer our support to the thousands of refugees thronging Tunisia and Egypt."
"However, Europe cannot just settle for a humanitarian response."
"The European Council must face up to its responsibilities and carry forward, as part of a decision taken at the UN involving the Arab League and the African Union, the project to impose a no-fly zone so as to prevent Colonel Gaddafi's air force from massacring his people."
"Lastly, I would like to say something to the leaders who are playing on all these fears: the migrants fleeing Libya want only one thing, and that is to return to their country."
"As for those who are today risking their lives for freedom and democracy, what they want is to live and work in a free country of which they can be proud, and so when the time comes for reconstruction, it will be their economic development that the European Union will have to strive for with determination and courage."
"Mr President, we all agree that Mr Gaddafi was a murderer, and I agree with Mr Schulz."
"I just wonder why, over the past years, our EU leaders have been trying to charm him."
"Here I have a picture of Mr Van Rompuy, recently arrived in office and already in the wrong company; and here we have Mr Verhofstadt receiving the dictator with military honour, which he certainly likes."
"Here, Mr Cohn-Bendit, we have Mr Berlusconi."
"We know that Mr Berlusconi likes kissing, but he is kissing entirely the wrong person."
"Also, Mrs Ashton, I have here Tony Blair, your former boss, kissing the dictator."
"My point is this: I agree that you have to meet people nastier than yourself, but you do not have to kiss them."
"You do not have to hug them."
"You do not have to charm them."
"You have been feeding the monster that people are now fighting, and that is why they are getting killed."
"So I say to all these EU leaders who have kissed and hugged Gaddafi: shame on you!"
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, he was the right man at the right time."
"Mr Cohn-Bendit said: Mr Gaddafi is a criminal and he made agreements with Mr Berlusconi."
"I say, Mr Gaddafi is a criminal, he made agreements with the European Commission led by Mr Prodi, with the Italian Government of Mr D'Alema, with Mr Blair's Labour Government and with a hundred other governments besides."
"Mr Gaddafi is a criminal who, for more than 20 years, has led a State that is still of strategic and crucial importance for the interests of half the world."
"We must have the good sense to admit this, otherwise how do we have a hand in the Marshall Plan alluded to by Mr Schultz?"
"The Marshall Plan indeed existed, the Americans gave us the money, but as they did so, they demanded that the European governments drove the communists out of politics in their countries; they dictated the conditions to us."
"What are the conditions we intend to dictate to the countries of the southern shore of the Mediterranean in order to commit ourselves to a Marshall Plan?"
"Do we intend to replace the dictators of recent years with other dictators in order to help our own interests or does our Marshall Plan aim to nurture the development of strong, healthy institutions that echo the spirit which is alive and well within civil society and which we have seen come to life in recent days in these countries?"
"This is the real question we must ask ourselves and the proposals we must put to the Council, including the no-fly zone and patrols of the Libyan coastline, which is the duty of European ships in the Gulf of Sidra, not American ones."
"This must be the appropriate response for Europe at this time."
"(ES) Mr President, Baroness Ashton, I believe that this debate makes it clear that the entire European Parliament is aware that this transformational crisis in North Africa is no longer a test of European foreign policy, but is now a test of the very viability of Europe having an external policy."
"This is why it is absolutely crucial for the European Union to be able to address the international community with a single and recognisable message."
"I would like to take advantage of my minute here to add my voice to those who have stressed the importance of the humanitarian dimension in this transformational crisis."
"This will enable Europe to act to mitigate the effects on the humanitarian front, above all, in terms of displaced people, and of potential asylum seekers and refugees fleeing from the area of conflict to the nearest border, which is the border with the European Union."
"This is why I want to stress the urgent need for the European Union to complete its still-outstanding asylum package; to review Directive 2001/55/EC on measures to protect displaced people in humanitarian emergencies and cope with the unforeseen mass influx of migrants; to be able to prioritise the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union and the European Asylum Support Office, which are the tools at its disposal; and, above all, to fill the human rights clause of its foreign policy with true meaning, making it not just a verbose clause, but a condition for the very existence of the European Union's foreign policy."
"Mr President, yesterday, many members of our House met the representatives of the Interim Council of Libya, whose message was absolutely clear: they need international support and aid and they need it very quickly."
"Therefore, the first thing we must do, as many colleagues have already said, is start to establish relations with the Interim Council in order to legitimise their activities."
"We have to recognise them."
"Secondly, we all know, and many colleagues have said this, that people are still being killed every minute by Gaddafi's air forces in Libya and we must therefore, as a European Union, be ready and act fast, together with the United Nations and the Arab League, to establish the no-fly zone."
"My last point concerns humanitarian issues."
"These people need simple elementary things such as food, water and medical supplies, and they also need technical assistance."
"Even the military on the side of the opposition need technical assistance so they can connect online with each other."
"(PL) Mr President, fortunately, it is not true that in recent years, the whole of Europe and all the world's politicians have kissed Gaddafi, as Mr Eppink says is the case."
"As long as 25 years ago, Ronald Reagan was in no doubt about Gaddafi."
"We have needed 25 years to reach the same conclusion today."
"Those kisses, of course, were not entirely without foundation."
"They were justified with the word 'stability'."
"Today, in place of the word 'stability' we have to write 'democracy'."
"This is an opportunity which we have to take, and we have to take it now."
"In a few days, a summit is to be held."
"We expect it to produce results."
"We cannot afford to lose another 25 years."
"Our problem is not that we do not understand the times."
"We often say the right things here."
"Our problem is that we are slow to act."
"Our problem is that what we do is not effective."
"This is, perhaps, our most important opportunity concerning all of our neighbours, including Lukashenko."
"It is important that we manage to react in time, or in 25 years, we will be looking at photos with kisses again. Thank you."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we all want to help the people of North Africa to achieve their legitimate objectives."
"The people on the ground will choose the way forward, but we must be ready, if they ask us for help, with immediate humanitarian aid."
"It is therefore a good thing that ECHO, the Humanitarian Aid department of the European Commission, is already on the ground in Tunisia and Egypt."
"However, we are currently experiencing a real stress test in relation to the capacities and skills of the EU and its Member States, given that we have to do everything at once: fly our own citizens out, supply the basic needs of refugees from the neighbouring States and transport them home, deal with the refugees arriving in the EU by sea, and counter the illegitimate claim to power of a dictator."
"What are the specific steps needed to de-legitimise Gaddafi?"
"The first is that we must jointly pull our ambassadors out of Tripoli."
"The second is that we must recognise the Transitional National Council as the legitimate body with which we deal in Libya and reach agreement with it over the provision of humanitarian aid."
"The third step is that our Member States in the Security Council should jointly table a motion to establish a no-fly zone which can be voted on within a short space of time."
"The fourth step is that, if the Security Council is blocked by a veto, we should support the development of regional international law."
"In other words, if the African Union, the Arab League and the EU all agree, we should find a joint way within the region to implement the no-fly zone by suitable means."
"Of course, over the medium term, we must discuss how we could generate the opportunities for development in these countries, for example, via a free trade zone, so that people can find a future in their own homelands."
"(FR) Mr President, I wish to lend my support to the resolution on the situation in Libya tabled by our Parliament."
"Indeed, it provides food for thought for the European institutions."
"It explains clearly and determinedly the way in which we can help to overcome the difficulties at a time when the situation in Libya is becoming worse each day."
"I, for my part, would like to emphasise two issues: firstly, in the short term, our priority is, in fact, to protect the civilians, whether they be displaced persons fleeing the fighting or Libyans caught in the fire of Colonel Gaddafi's attacks on his own people."
"Any and all resources must be invested in emergency humanitarian aid, not least to help the neighbouring countries that are most affected by the need to provide refuge for people: Tunisia, Egypt and Niger."
"Secondly, we have a medium- and long-term responsibility: to seize the historic opportunity being given to us, in favour of these uprisings, to support the democratic transition process and to look further into the future in order to reform the common European asylum and immigration policies on the basis of a truly balanced partnership that deals a final blow to the use of countries in the Mediterranean region as Europe's policemen."
"Mr President, ever since I was appointed as Vice-President for Democracy and Human Rights, I have tried to use my voice to speak for those who cannot speak."
"As it happens, today in the Chamber we have guests from the Interim Transitional National Council of Libya who met the Vice-President/High Representative last night but who cannot take part in the debate."
"In my view, and I think in the view of many in this Chamber, the European Union must recognise the Interim Transitional National Council of Libya before the weekend, whatever else it may do, and I have seen some of the ideas Mrs Ashton will bring forward."
"The defeat of Gaddafi is not only vital for Libya: it is vital for the millions of Arabs elsewhere in the Arab world who are struggling for freedom."
"If we recognise the interim council officially, it allows humanitarian and other needs, as well as the strategic necessities of the time, to go to that interim council."
"The EU must be unequivocal in support of democracy wherever it begins to flower."
"(FR) Mr President, Baroness Ashton, in these dramatic hours when Libya's future is at stake, humanitarian aid is important but it is not enough."
"The European Union must adopt a clear position with regard to a no-fly zone so as to put a stop to the fierce repression of the people."
"We understand the hesitation and the risks, but this issue goes beyond Libya."
"It affects the political future of that entire region and the political future of Europe."
"The European Union must also urgently recognise the National Council as the legitimate authority of Libya."
"We have an opportunity to send a strong message to all the peoples fighting for their freedom: 'Europe is behind you, because your struggle is our struggle, too'."
"The neighbourhood policy must also be reoriented towards assisting the democratic transition, supporting the economy, and strengthening relations with the other countries and organisations in the region."
"Lastly, we must urgently help these countries to manage their migratory flows."
"The scenes of people fleeing are proof that this is just as much a South-South issue as it is a North-South one."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Baroness Ashton, the time has come to make a choice: either Europe sends a clear message of support and mobilisation to help these peoples, or it builds a wall so as to turn itself into an illusory, selfish fortress."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the spirit of this debate enables me, Baroness Ashton, to remind you that the Union for the Mediterranean's Parliamentary Assembly concluded its meeting last week in Rome."
"It set out several paths that the Commission would do well to return to, in particular, in terms of its suggestions on how to support the democratic transition processes in progress."
"Hence, I urge you and I urge the Commission to follow the developments in Tunisia intently."
"This country is objectively a driving force for democracy and is setting a benchmark for the entire region."
"Regarding Libya, we need to be fully aware that having decreed it part of the international community, the severance of relations with Mr Gaddafi's regime will have consequences, particularly given that his regime is showing greater resistance than those of Mr Ben Alì and Mr Mubarak."
"This means that we must act on four fronts right now - and political timescales are decisive - with credibility, sincerity and consistency."
"We must come up with a suitable European financial plan."
"I understand the evocative note struck by many, but we need an Ashton Plan rather than a Marshall Plan."
"We also need a European immigration and asylum policy, a deterrent policy including the closure of airspace, and full support for the opponents of Mr Gaddafi's regime."
"Baroness Ashton, it is up to you and your foreign policy ties with the Council to make these points count in the coming days, but also to avoid Europe's foreign policy being caught unawares again by the events that are changing the Mediterranean."
"(RO) Mr President, a few days ago, the Gaddafi regime sent a letter to the United Nations Security Council in which it expressed its surprise at the sanctions adopted on 26 February, alleging that only - in Gaddafi's words - 'moderate' force was resorted to against some 'subversive acts'."
"This is a clear sign of a dictator who knows that he has lost the game and is no longer able to recognise the gravity of the acts he is committing."
"This plays down in an incredibly cynical manner the brutality which has taken place in Libya during the last three weeks."
"On the other hand, the reaction from the Gaddafi regime clearly shows us that it is not at all indifferent to the sanctions which have been adopted so far."
"This is why I believe that we must apply the toughest possible sanctions, under a UN mandate of course."
"However, I believe that we need to go beyond the no-fly zones by providing support to those who need to defeat Gaddafi, while also showing solidarity with our southern Member States which will receive a wave of refugees."
"This is also obviously going to happen."
"(MT) Mr President, the events taking place in the Arab world, and in all the countries in the Arab world, are a beautiful dream that is coming true."
"However, so as to prevent this dream from becoming a nightmare, we have to play our part and ensure that these peoples not only rid themselves of their dictators, but eradicate dictatorships too."
"This requires that they undergo a transition phase, which calls for massive assistance from our end."
"It is true that we have all forged relationships with these countries and their regime."
"However, once we witnessed the shocking violence being carried out, we spoke out with one voice, against the violence and against the regime that is inflicting it."
"The next step is to quash this violence, not only using words, but through our actions."
"Every day that passes and which brings violence with it is another day where we will have allowed murder to take place and blood to be shed."
"We must strengthen the European Union's humanitarian presence."
"This is already being done, and Cathy Ashton is doing a good job, but we must increase our humanitarian aid, both towards the Libyan people, as well as those who are fleeing the regime towards Tunisia and Egypt."
"Moreover, if this influx makes its way towards Europe, then we must be prepared."
"It is all very well to claim that we should open our doors to Libyan refugees, yet it still remains to be seen whether we will all shoulder the responsibility if the situation arises."
"(DE) Mr President, Baroness Ashton, you have repeatedly had to put up with critical comments from this place."
"I would like to take today's debate as an opportunity to clearly state that the European Union and, in particular, you personally and your staff, has and have acted quickly, well and efficiently throughout this crisis."
"That has also brought Europe a step closer to the role that we envisage together as co-founders of a global world."
"It is right and important to observe that the circumstances are different in each country, particularly in Libya."
"In Libya's case, the European Union has taken a timely political stand against genocide and in favour of civil society."
"The pressure on the Gaddafi regime has rightly been escalated in conjunction with NATO, the United Nations and others."
"Clearly, military action, too, cannot be ruled out where undertaken within the framework of conventions under international law."
"Moreover, humanitarian aid - meaning food, medical supplies, a roof over people's heads - must be provided for those forced to flee the war zone."
"However, we also need to consider what happens on the first day of the post-Gaddafi era."
"In this regard, I would like to refer, once more, to the Union for the Mediterranean Assembly in Rome, which has proposed some important positive steps - firstly, personal security for the citizens; secondly, political security - which includes close cooperation with the interim government; and, thirdly, economic security."
"We must do everything in our power to ensure that economic life in these countries can return to normal and that the people find work."
"(PL) Mr President, Mrs Ashton, I think we also have to look at these events in North Africa and Libya as being part of a kind of historical process."
"Not that long ago, we were all witnesses of the murders in the Balkans - unfortunately, to a certain extent, we participated in this - and of a situation in which people in Europe were killing each other."
"Today, we must make every effort to avoid a repetition of that scenario."
"Therefore, I hope that at the forthcoming European Union summit, we will show the determination needed to react quickly, and I think that such things as a no-fly zone or a de facto severance of diplomatic relations with the Gaddafi regime and with Gaddafi himself as a criminal are essential."
"I think we also need to look at what happened in 1989 in Poland and other countries."
"There is an opportunity here, because today, those young people demonstrating on the streets of Libya and other African countries really do want democracy."
"We must help them achieve this."
"Mr President, I was encouraged by your opening statement, Mrs Ashton, especially when you mentioned that our actions must be rooted in the EU core values, because spontaneous protests in North Africa have shown that undemocratic rulers cannot provide genuine stability."
"We have to realise that attempts to domesticate brutal dictators like Gaddafi have failed, causing much embarrassment."
"People in Libya are fighting for the same values we share and we need to clearly take their side."
"The same value-based approach applies to our future policies towards states like Iran, Belarus, Cuba, China and Russia."
"What we have to do in two days' time is to back a no-fly zone, immediately recognise the Interim National Council, and address the social and economic causes of these revolutions."
"I think we cannot do without a long-term Marshall-type plan."
"(BG) Mr President, Lady Ashton, in 1999, in order to avoid unrest in the opposition city of Benghazi, Gaddafi needed scapegoats on whom he could pin the responsibility for the children infected with AIDS as a result of poor Libyan healthcare."
"He found six Bulgarian medics and a Palestinian doctor to serve this purpose, who spent long, harrowing years in Libyan prisons."
"However, Gaddafi's manipulation of this situation failed in his own country, which is proven by the fact that Benghazi was actually now where the revolution started."
"The nurses, who were victims of Gaddafi's dictatorship, became a clear symbol of European solidarity."
"This European solidarity is expected today from Libya's citizens themselves and from the young people of Libya."
"It is expected from those who do not see the Arab world facing a dilemma of 'either dictatorship or Islamism' and who prove every day, including with their blood, that there is also a place for democracy in this world."
"This is why today, when we are debating the future of Libya, we Europeans must be impartial in our assessments, definite in our actions and, most importantly of all, united in our decisions."
"We must give our support to principles, freedom and democracy in this world."
"(ES) Mr President, there are thousands of refugees and thousands of displaced people."
"The solution to this emergency is evacuation."
"What is needed is transport."
"As Mr Guterres said, these people do not want to come to the European Union; they want to go back home."
"There are 2 million immigrants, 1 million Egyptians and 80 000 Bangladeshis."
"We must focus on the weakest of the weak: Eritreans, Somalis, the sub-Saharan Africans mistaken for mercenaries and Palestinians."
"The United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) says it needs USD 160 million over three months for water, medicines, food and transport."
"We expect a resounding response from the Union on Friday."
"Gaddafi cannot escape international criminal justice: mass attacks on his people constitute crimes against humanity."
"Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo is already taking action."
"Mr President, the European Parliament must be involved."
"We are also a democratic instrument for applying pressure and informing the free world."
"We need a mandate from this Chamber for a delegation of Parliament in the UNHCR, Red Cross and Red Crescent refugee camps."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the ever-growing and increasingly widespread uprisings that we are currently seeing in the Mediterranean certainly show a strong desire for democratic participation, above all, from young people, who are being pushed on by Facebook and Twitter towards a different world that is more responsive to their aspirations."
"Nevertheless, the regions which overlook the Mediterranean represent very different worlds and are now, more than ever, made to suffer under the bloody violence of dictators with whom, it must be said, pretty much all world leaders have carried on relations at some point."
"I have a few issues I should like to raise: a humanitarian emergency, protecting the dignity of refugees and, at the same time, remembering that this crisis could quickly turn into a public health emergency; excessive concentrations of displaced persons without adequate healthcare; putting a stop to violence; the hypothesis of a no-fly zone to work out; a new and different kind of solidarity - Mr President and Baroness Ashton - for a Mediterranean policy that genuinely protects the significant group of people who are standing firm in the Mediterranean; changes to Frontex and, why not, let us remind the Council (which is not here today) that there are two directives to protect seasonal workers and intracorporate transfers of third-country nationals, which could also provide a response - including in employment terms - to these exceptional demands that we really have to tackle more effectively."
"The catch-the-eye procedure begins now."
"I should like to warn you straight away that I have 19 requests for the floor but I cannot meet them all;"
"I shall only be able to accept five or six requests."
"I mean no offence to the other Members, but the debate ran on a lot, we had a very lengthy introductory report from Baroness Ashton and we cannot influence the next debate."
"Please excuse me therefore."
"I will give the floor to those who signed up first, obviously giving all the groups a fair representation."
"(FR) Mr President, Baroness Ashton, you emphasised - and we are all aware of this - the urgent need to take action in response to the Libyan crisis."
"You rightly pointed out what the European Union has done and has done rather well in humanitarian terms and in terms of the evacuation of European citizens."
"Indeed, I think that the European Union would have gained from publicising these actions and making them much more visible, because people too often have the impression that the Member States alone carry out these operations, whereas you have pointed out that European mechanisms have worked here."
"On a political and military level now, a reminder of the need for a no-fly zone is certainly necessary, if not just politically, then also militarily."
"It will take more than that, however, because - let us not forget - no-fly zones did not prevent atrocities on the ground in Bosnia and Kosovo, even when, in the case of overflying, they were applied very rigorously."
"While we await the UN Security Council's decisions, we have European common security and defence policy instruments."
"We can implement them for the purposes of maritime surveillance, monitoring the embargo and delivering humanitarian aid."
"Europe has to make its voice heard on this point, and you have the instruments with which to act."
"Mr President, I agree with everyone in this debate who calls on the European Union to engage, to act and to exercise the responsibility to protect."
"I also welcome High Representative Ashton sending a mission into Libya with less incident than, for example, one of our Member States."
"But all those who talk tough in this debate, were you also talking tough during 42 years of a brutal military dictatorship?"
"Did you protest when 1 200 prisoners were murdered in cold blood over a decade ago?"
"Or against Gaddafi's historic litany of torture, enforced disappearance and extrajudicial execution?"
"Did you complain when the European Commission started negotiations for a framework agreement with Libya and which were on course to be happily completed this year?"
"Tough sanctions against departing dictators at a time of crisis look good to European public opinion, but tough standards before a time of crisis look even better for the people we say we are trying to help."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as some have said, Baroness Ashton, you have shown great courage by taking the bull by the horns in this case, but I think there are a number of basic steps to be taken."
"Meanwhile, you have spoken about bringing the guilty parties to justice."
"Let us call them by their real name: we need to bring Mr Gaddafi to justice."
"You also spoke about violence."
"Instead, I think it is right to say that genocide is taking over in these territories, yet again."
"We cannot continue to bury our heads in the sand."
"I think the first thing we need to do is to recognise the Libyan National Council, a transitional council."
"We must have an interlocutor; we cannot carry on speaking only of sharply reduced humanitarian aid."
"There is no doubt that we must all speak up for a no-fly zone."
"We cannot continue accepting the vetoes of China and Russia, countries that are run by dictators."
"China censors the Internet while Russia kills journalists such as Anna Politkovskaya."
"I think that right now, the first thing to do is to begin setting out our stall and recognise the Libyan National Council."
"(DE) Mr President, I would just like to deal briefly once again with the issue of the Southern Neighbourhood Policy"
"and the proposals made by the Commission and Mrs Ashton yesterday."
"I think what we are lacking is a realisation of what is still going on, for example, concerning our relations with Saudi Arabia and the negotiations with Syria."
"How will you change them?"
"How will they be changed?"
"Will you continue with the status quo on these negotiations with Syria, and what will you do with Saudi Arabia?"
"How will we interact with these countries?"
"What I see as lacking in your proposal - which I think on the whole is good - is a process for how we will establish criteria for upgrading relations."
"How will you do the 'we will pay more': based on what criteria and verified by whom?"
"I think we need a process like an enlargement process, with a Commission to set criteria and a Commission to verify them."
"(PT) Mr President, we are in solidarity with the Arab peoples in their struggle for freedom, democracy and social progress in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya, bearing in mind the specific circumstances of each of these countries."
"However, we cannot forget the support that that EU governments and leaders gave to the dictators, selling them weapons which they are now using to kill their people."
"Likewise, we cannot accept any foreign military intervention or interference in the struggles of these countries' peoples."
"We know how foreign interference begins, but we never know how it is going to end, as the examples of Iraq, Afghanistan and so many other places have demonstrated."
"The political, economic and social choices of the peoples of these countries in the immediate future need to be respected, and they need to be given all the humanitarian aid that they seek, without preconditions or any interference."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, of course we must recognise the serious errors of the West."
"We in Italy have made the mistake of thinking of Mr Gaddafi as 'our son of a bitch', as President Roosevelt would have said, while instead, he was simply one of the many sons of ... that rule over their people and now even fire on them or make other people fire on them."
"How on earth has no one in Parliament mentioned the responsibility of the African Heads of State or Government, who, until yesterday morning, thought of him as a brother, pampered him, sent him to the United Nations as a representative leader for the defence of human rights, even leading him to declare himself the king of kings amongst African countries, or have I got the wrong person?"
"Now, Europe is making another mistake: it pretends to ignore an obvious danger, as a great flood of Somalis, Eritreans and others flee Libya's borders."
"We need to tackle this with real energy."
"We should use a Marshall Plan involving the network of small and medium-sized enterprises to help these people, not send weapons."
"Before giving the floor to Baroness Ashton for her reply, I should like to let you know that two representatives of the Libyan Transitional National Council are here in the visitors' gallery, Dr El-Welfali and Dr Al-Eisawi, whom we welcome."
"The strength of the applause is symptomatic of Parliament's backing and solidarity, and of the strong support shown in the debate for freedom and democracy in Libya."
"Thank you and good luck."
"We are right behind you."
"Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. - Mr President, honourable Members, thank you very much for what has been an important and, I think, very significant debate in this Parliament."
"The common theme, of course, is the desire to see change in Libya that puts the wishes of the people at the forefront of the energy of the European Union and the international community."
"I think Mr Schulz said it first, but it was repeated very often: we need to be very clear-headed about what we do and very determined on what we should do."
"We have to make sure, first of all, that the humanitarian aid and support goes in and gets to the right places."
"We are in touch with Médecins sans frontières and the ICRC all the way through the country from Benghazi to Tripoli."
"But I know from my discussions that there are areas where it is exceptionally difficult to get aid and medicines into the country because of the fighting that is going on and because people cannot get through."
"This is something that Mrs Georgieva, as Commissioner for humanitarian aid, is working on, and Mrs Amos in the UN is also coordinating efforts from there."
"The good news is that in some places, we are getting messages that they are coping well and support is getting through, but there is, of course, much to do."
"I have also listened to what honourable Members have said about the issues of refugees."
"We have worked hard with Member States to try and support getting people home."
"For a lot of refugees who arrived at the Tunisian border, their home was Egypt, and some Member States have been working closely with the Tunisians to provide transport by sea or by plane to get people back home, and also to watch over those who will be heading back to Africa."
"But there is much more to do."
"My belief is that, if we can make the country more stable, people can stay at home - which is where they want to be."
"So one of the challenges for the EU - and I am very open about this - is that by providing stability in our southern neighbourhood, we enable people to stay where they wish to stay, with economic prosperity and democracy, rather than feeling that they have to flee because of violence, lack of opportunity or other issues."
"Then there is this whole question of a no-fly zone and the role of military options."
"I indicated the work on what we described as prudent planning that has been going on with the Political and Security Committee (COPS) and which continued last night."
"Those discussions are referred to in our discussions with the United Nations, which I have also indicated are ongoing, and NATO, where I will attend a meeting tomorrow."
"Of course they are done in conjunction with our partners."
"The Arab League will discuss a no-fly zone on Saturday."
"But what I am also very mindful of is something that the Secretary-General of the Arab League said to my delegation visiting him yesterday: we have to define what we need, because a no-fly zone by definition means different things to different people."
"Ensuring that whatever is done can be done properly is something I think this House would be very keen to see."
"We have to be sure that whatever options are taken, they are taken with the full knowledge of what we are doing and with the support of the people who are going to be affected by that."
"In that context, I refer again to the need for our continued discussions and dialogues with the African Union and with the Arab League."
"We could have a big debate - and perhaps we should - about a subject that I started to write about in the press, which is isolationism versus engagement."
"It is a real challenge, and what I would say to the gentleman who held up the photos is, of course, if you are the President of the European Council and you go as President to the African Summit which is held in Libya, you will find that there is a picture of the President with Gaddafi."
"Of course."
"There are pictures of many people."
"There was a picture shown in the same group of our esteemed ALDE Group leader."
"There are pictures that you can take on many occasions where those of us who are given positions of responsibility have to engage with people who we probably would not wish to."
"So I think it is unfair to show a picture of Herman Van Rompuy performing his responsibilities as President of the European Council on behalf of all of us in the host country with the person who was hosting the event."
"Whether we would prefer the African Union to have held its summit somewhere else is another question; whether, indeed, we would have made some remarks to them on many occasions that perhaps they should."
"But in the end, we go to meet the African Union largely where the African Union suggests."
"We may not like that, and it is a genuine debate."
"I think we have to engage in that at some point, because my general principle is that engagement is better than isolation."
"Isolation is effective in some circumstances, but engagement is better."
"Having said that, as I have also made clear, we may have brought Gaddafi out of the cold."
"It is now time to send him back into the cold, fully and properly."
"This is also very important: to have an assessment of what we engage and how we engage and be prepared to review that and stand up and say: we have done this for a set of reasons we think are right, whichever country it is; that we believe engagement in these circumstances is better, but there are circumstances when that is not appropriate and circumstances where, even if that is what we did, it is not appropriate now."
"But let us be honest, let us not throw down challenges with photographs or other things, where people did this and people did that."
"People mainly do their very best in circumstances that are very difficult, and I think we should take pride in the President of the Council trying to be the representative of the Member States."
"I want to just also say something about labels."
"We hear a lot about a Marshall Plan: somebody even called it an Ashton Plan."
"No, let us have a Libyan Plan, or an Egyptian Plan, or a Tunisian Plan, owned by the people of those countries in which we engage and offer our support."
"I do not want to make a plan that we arrive at and about which we say: guess what, we have come to bring you our plan for your country."
"No, let us not do that."
"Let us actually be the people who offer the support to ensure that their plan is able to be everything that we would want it to be to support democracy."
"There are people in this House who have years of experience, who have come through revolution and change and who have a huge amount to offer."
"I firmly hope - and I have said this in these countries - that they will call upon (if they feel it would be valuable) those people who have lived it and who not only know what worked but also can tell them what did not work."
"Perhaps the things to avoid can be just as important as the things to do."
"I agree that we need to review what the EU does, what tools we have available to us, whether we have enough, whether we need to think again about what we are able to do."
"Because you are right, I operate within a mandate that I am given, and I can only operate in that mandate."
"That mandate allows me to do some things, but it mainly requires me to gather together the institutions and the 27 countries in a concerted and joint effort."
"One final thing about publicity and listening."
"I have done more press, I think, than anybody else in the world on all of this."
"I have been wall to wall on the airwaves."
"We were the first out on the resignation of Mubarak, and I have done a huge amount of press."
"But I have also done far more without the press in the room."
"Again, that is what I think is important, because more than anything, we need to listen."
"We are all visiting these countries, and they have so many visitors from across the world, and that is great - though I think sometimes we need to give them space and time to be able to work together to plan and then have an even more informed conversation with us."
"But we also need to listen, and if there is anything I urge upon all of us it is to take the time to really listen - I will say this to Member States as well - to what people on the ground are saying, to go to Tahrir Square as I did, to talk to the young people in Egypt, to talk to civil society in Tunisia and to engage with the people of Libya wherever we can: to discuss what they want for their future and do everything we possibly can to back them."
"Mr President, perhaps Baroness Ashton could comment on this."
"There has been practical unanimity in the House that recognition of the Interim Transitional National Council, currently based in Benghazi, by the European Union would be an extremely important political signal which would allow humanitarian and other strategic aid into the country."
"She has not replied on that point."
"Many speakers have raised it."
"Perhaps she could just tell us what her views are and whether she could convey the message to the Council on Friday."
"Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. - Mr President, I did not reply to it;"
"I heard it, and I am very well aware of it."
"There are two reasons that I did not reply."
"One is that I have assumed the President of the European Parliament, who will be speaking at the European Council, will convey - as he always does - what Parliament has said and what it has agreed in its resolutions."
"I think that is an appropriate way forward for this Parliament to be properly represented."
"The second is because it will be for the Member States to determine."
"So it was not a failure to recognise;"
"I met, indeed, with a gentleman last night."
"Simply, I was trying to honour Parliament by recognising the role of the President."
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the light of what Mr McMillan-Scott has said, I cannot work out whether the proposal to recognise the Libyan Transitional National Council will be among the proposals that you and the Commission will be making to the Council."
"I have gathered that you are happy for Parliament to talk about it, but will the Commission and Baroness Ashton propose it at the Council meeting on the 11th amongst its proposals or its own-initiative proposals?"
"That is our question."
"Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. - Mr President, I can only do what, within my mandate, I am allowed to do."
"My personal opinions do not count in this."
"Honourable Members have to understand that."
"I have met with the Council and I have heard what Parliament has said."
"The President of Parliament will report."
"As Mr Cohn-Bendit says, it is very important, but I cannot stand here today and say 'I will therefore recommend'."
"We have to go forward with what Parliament agrees when it passes its resolution, and I have seen what it is suggesting."
"We then report to the President of the European Council for the conclusions of the European Council - which rest within his hands - for the Foreign Affairs Council to meet and discuss and for Parliament, through its President, to put this forward."
"Then, the European Council will take a decision."
"I am not trying to avoid the issue."
"I am simply saying that you have to pull all those things together and then make a decision."
"I mean no disrespect to the Transitional Council, but again, we have to do this properly and make sure that we do what we are confident and comfortable with."
"I am giving the floor to Mr Cohn-Bendit for the last speech, after which we shall finish."
"I should merely like to remind Baroness Ashton - though I am sure she knows - that she also gets her mandate from Parliament as Vice-President of the European Commission, and not therefore from the Council alone."
"Mr President, I would like to say to Baroness Ashton - and I can say this in English - that it is also written in her mandate that she has to make proposals to the Member States."
"It is in her mandate, so we want her to take her mandate seriously."
"After a debate in the Parliament and after a resolution that you will read, Baroness Ashton, you know that there will be an overwhelming majority to take this seriously and to make this proposal to the Council."
"If not, there will be a big crisis between you and the European Parliament."
"Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. - Mr President, I do not accept this big crisis idea."
"I have been very clear with you, Mr Cohn-Bendit, about exactly what my mandate is."
"The recognition of a government is the recognition that is given by the European Council."
"The mandate of the High Representative is to come forward with the ideas that are put to her, to discuss those with the institutions beforehand, and to put forward, on Friday to the European Council, the views that are being expressed."
"It is for the Member States to take the decision."
"I will go from this to discuss with the President of the European Council - whose representative is here - and I will discuss this with the President of the Commission."
"We will also take the views, through the institutions, ready for Friday and the Foreign Affairs Council which meets tomorrow."
"I am not avoiding that, but it is absolutely right and proper that Member States take the decision on recognising a government."
"I hear very loudly what Parliament says."
"Let this not be a crisis."
"I am not avoiding anything."
"I am simply telling you that the way we should do this is to do it properly, for the benefit of these people and the people of Libya."
"I have received six motions for resolutions tabled in accordance with Rule 110(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 10 March 2011."
"in writing. - It is unfortunate that Europe has drawn few lessons from its past."
"The Union's delayed response to Libya is proof that Europe to date maintains an incoherent and fragmented approach towards the Southern Mediterranean."
"If Europe holds onto this mindset, there is the possibility that a humanitarian crisis of this magnitude will reoccur."
"Europe must act on two fronts:"
"1) Political and humanitarian response: To ensure that the legitimate aspirations of the Libyan people are achieved through home-grown democracy, whereby the regime steps aside to allow the people of the region to actively bring about the country's transition to democracy;"
"2) Migratory flows: Presently, the eventuality of large flows of migration from the region is a secondary concern, yet it must be addressed."
"The Union has, in the past, acknowledged it, but failed to put any concerted and comprehensive plan into motion."
"This is why I call for the creation of a Marshall-type Plan, one which will include an integrated immigration policy, based on the principles of solidarity and burden-sharing, whereby all Member States acknowledge that no single country will alone be able to tackle the great and complex difficulties brought about by large migratory flows, particularly in the case of smaller Member States."
"The uprisings in the Maghreb have already had their impacts in Europe - in the form of boats packed with refugees, falling share prices and price shocks at filling stations, with the EU naively having anticipated only the last of these, at most."
"Taking the higher prices for crude oil in combination with a strong euro and the rate increase by the European Central Bank, there is little hope of fuel oil prices falling."
"This shows us, once again, how dependent we are on crude oil supplies and that we must press forward on alternatives."
"The rebels' calls for a no-fly zone pose us a dilemma."
"It requires the United Nations to sanction this direct interference in the sovereignty of a State and, as a consequence, the destruction of its anti-aircraft capabilities - as the experts are warning."
"The States of the EU must not only consider this but also the consequences of open civil war."
"Furthermore, what would the EU's position be should Gaddafi change course?"
"It is clear that a dictator cannot be cowed merely by aggressive posturing."
"Gaddafi has shown how it is possible to ride roughshod over the West and the rest of the dictators are watching on with interest."
"The EU must now reveal its foreign policy muscles and take clear steps towards de-escalation and the democratisation of Libya."
"Muammar Gaddafi's departure is a matter of urgency today."
"Yet there is everything else, too, and what matter are the people."
"We focus on the dictators, but we often overlook the people, who are the first to suffer the consequences."
"The process of liberating the Libyan people cannot be undertaken without a genuine political transition within the country."
"However, a democratic transition will never succeed without real opposition leaders."
"At the moment, that opposition is very weak."
"Giving it greater visibility is a first necessary step towards creating momentum."
"On the other hand, a strong regional strategy is also necessary."
"On the refugee issue alone, the neighbouring countries cannot reach an agreement so as to prevent the influx of refugees from being held up at the borders."
"The result: health conditions are worsening, which is fuelling intracommunity tensions."
"If this humanitarian crisis is not tackled, we risk being faced with a situation that quickly spirals out of control."
"in writing. - I congratulate my colleague, Ana Gomes, on her resolution."
"However, I am disappointed by the lack of support from the PPE for an agreement urging the EU to prepare a plan and equip itself to cope with the aftermath of the Libyan crisis, particularly concerning migration policy and relocation."
"We do not even have a plan A, let alone a plan B."
"To date, a small island Member State close to Libya has helped in all the ways it could: Malta."
"Thirteen thousand people of 89 different nationalities were evacuated by Malta's own boats and its own airlines, putting both at great risk."
"The Maltese did this not because of any EU legislation and certainly not because of Frontex."
"Instead, they acted on humanitarian grounds and waived visa requirements."
"It was a principle of solidarity."
"Whether or not we are facing an immigration influx of biblical proportions, we cannot tell."
"For sure it will be large and very significant for Malta."
"The Maltese people ask not for an application of the Dublin II or Frontex regulations."
"They demand solidarity and a relocation policy based on the principle of burden-sharing."
"It is very disappointing and incomprehensible to see the PPE shirking this responsibility."
"in writing. - The events in Libya and in the southern neighbourhood of the EU are a rebuttal of past policies and a test for future policies."
"The status quo approach was the prevalent choice for almost 40 years."
"This policy gave Europe the benefits of stability and safe access to energy."
"But it ignored the societies of North Africa and of the Arab world."
"We know this because these societies re-emerged dramatically and took everybody by surprise."
"A major policy shift is required towards active support for the fledgling civil societies in the Arab countries."
"But this should not be an excuse for rushed decisions that would shatter our neighbourhood policy."
"The European Neighbourhood Policy should stay in place as a policy."
"It should not be replaced by uncoordinated measures."
"The idea was mooted that financial resources should be taken away from the European programmes of the Eastern Partnership and reallocated to the South."
"This would send a negative signal towards the societies in our eastern neighbourhood."
"Moreover, this reallocation has no rational basis."
"The per capita spending in the South and the East is not unbalanced."
"It is roughly equal."
"The problem is not how much we spend but how we spend."
"Amendment of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union with regard to a stability mechanism for Member States whose currency is the euro (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Brok and Mr Gualtieri, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the amendment of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union with regard to a stability mechanism for Member States whose currency is the euro (00033/2010 - C7-0014/2011 - 2010/0821/NLE))."
"Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, the euro is a major success story."
"It is one of the most stable currencies in the world and has outperformed the dollar on the markets."
"We can see that the economic figures coming out of the United States are far worse than those for Europe."
"Yet, given that we do not have uniform conditions, we still see that individual parts of the euro area, individual Member States, are having difficulties and we have to respond to that."
"It is the case that a failure of the euro could be extraordinarily costly for all of us in this globalised system, and I want to spell out that my country - which sometimes depicts itself as if it had to make major sacrifices - is the main beneficiary or joint main beneficiary of the euro."
"We are thus not performing self-sacrifice here."
"Instead, we are also acting in the common interest of all the States - large and small, rich and poor - and we need to appear to be unified."
"We must also make clear that we need to present a unified front in order to be credible."
"We cannot allow a credit ratings agency such as Moody's to downgrade a county by three levels overnight."
"When that happens, we get in trouble once again thanks to pressure from the United States."
"Here, too, we need to have the ability to present ourselves more strongly as unified."
"I am therefore pleased that we are attempting, in three ways, to create the conditions to make us credible."
"These are: tightening up the Stability and Growth pact, with greater options for intervention; bolstering the role of the Commission; and an early warning system, the European semester, as part of which it is to be observed at an early stage whether, and to what extent, budgetary discipline can and is to be followed through by the Member States."
"All of this reinforces our abilities so that we do not find ourselves in a situation like the present one again, and this will enable us to achieve credibility on a durable basis."
"Secondly, we cannot overcome this crisis with budgetary discipline alone."
"We will only emerge from this debt trap through a combination of budgetary discipline and growth."
"For that reason, efforts to promote growth and competitiveness make sense."
"I am pleased that the proposals that have been made in this area are slowly being modified so that they are not based on a purely intergovernmental approach but increasingly also integrated into the Community method where the European Union has the relevant competences."
"The result of this is that many of the concerns that we in this House rightly had about a particular proposal are slowly being resolved."
"Yet these two factors - competitiveness and budgetary discipline - go hand in hand."
"My third point relates to the revision of the Treaty that we have paved the way for and on which the European Council can only decide on 24 March if we have given our opinion by that point."
"An amendment of Article 136(3) of the Treaty has been proposed."
"Mr Gualtieri and I, as well as the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, are of the opinion that it would be better to amend Article 136(1), rewording it in order to better meet our demands."
"We also know, however, that this approach could possibly be harder to implement as, for reasons of politics and time, the simplified procedure should be our aim and no referendums should be held."
"If, for the reasons stated, this is not possible, we should at least ensure that the Council undertakes obligations that make clear that the intergovernmental approach in this case does not mean that permanent new structures are created in the European Union but that it will continue, as in the past, to only be used as a method where ground-breaking is required."
"These conditions must thus be adhered to in order to create the conditions for there to be the possibility of link-up in the event of transfer to the Community method and in order to carry out an improvement of this kind in such a way that we can act in a communal way in the long term."
"That means that we also see the weakness of the intergovernmental approach."
"An intergovernmental approach means no, or hardly any, parliamentary legitimacy and results in a complete inability to act in many areas due to the requirement for unanimity."
"That means that the Community solution - the 'Monnet method' - is also always more legitimate and gives rise to a greater ability to act."
"We should not forget that in this debate."
"The European Parliament wants to create the conditions so that, in the measures taken in the various fields, we revert to the approach of using Community institutions."
"In this regard, it is not especially the European Parliament that is at issue as, when it comes to an intergovernmental approach, we have, at most, a right to be consulted."
"What is at issue is a greater involvement on the part of the Commission, which does the groundwork, performs an evaluation and tables proposals."
"The Commission should also propose a regulation governing such matters in order to incorporate them into Community law."
"I hope that the European Council is ready - and I welcome Mr Corbett, as representative of the European Council - to create the necessary conditions in the talks with us by 24 March and to give Parliament the assurance that this approach can be used in such a way that the necessary steps can be designed in a sensible way and so that we can bear our responsibility together."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it would not be an exaggeration to say that this is an historic time in the process of Europe-building."
"The economic crisis has made it clear that the single currency needs real European economic governance and, for the first time, significant and innovative steps are being taken in this direction."
"At the same time, we are seeing a dangerous trend of giving this new governance an intergovernmental flavour, which not only risks threatening the institutional structure of the European Union, but also making the new mechanisms ineffective."
"Hence, the permanent stability mechanism is an issue of symbolic and central importance."
"Indeed, on the one hand, the establishment of a permanent stability mechanism represents a decisive and important step forwards."
"Parliament supports this decision, although it is important to stress that it must not rule out the possibility of using extraordinary solidarity mechanisms, such as those based on Article 122, which are currently in use."
"On the other hand, if the establishment of a permanent mechanism is therefore positive, the European Council has chosen to create a purely intergovernmental mechanism, thereby denying in a unique manner the European institutions any role, including in the procedure leading up to its establishment."
"Amongst other things, this could stir up disputes during the ratification process about the appropriateness of a simplified procedure, given that it is hardly in doubt that cutting back the competences of the European Union would require an ordinary revision procedure."
"Furthermore, since the treaty states two clear things; that the monetary policy of the Member States whose currency is the euro is an exclusive competence of the European Union, and that the Member States must coordinate their economic policy within the framework of the Union, as the treaty states, a mechanism that operates completely outside the European Union's institutional structure would scarcely be compatible with these principles and would therefore result in a reduction of the European Union's powers, which would not be compatible with a simplified revision procedure."
"This problem could also be raised by a number of national parliaments during the ratification procedure which, as we know, will be a complicated and risky process."
"Likewise for this reason, Parliament would have preferred a different, more institutionally appropriate and less politically risky procedure, such as Article 352, either alone or in combination with Article 136."
"The report sets all this out in black and white, but we preferred to concentrate on the substance rather than on procedures so as to reach a realistic yet determined approach."
"The central point is that the permanent stability fund will be created by the Member States because that is what they decided, but it may also lay the foundations for a new structure lying outside the EU institutions or it might be an intergovernmental wagon within a European Union train, travelling down the tracks of European law."
"Parliament wants to make a contribution because we are following the latter of these two paths."
"Hence, we asked in our report for two conditions to be respected: the proposal for an amendment must be redrafted so that the establishment of the mechanism's distribution is somehow placed within an EU procedure, or that the EU institutions are heavily involved in the practical implementation of the mechanism and, above all, in defining the conditionality measures."
"What principles and rules should be established for providing assistance?"
"Who shall establish them and how?"
"For this, we need a regulation with an ordinary legislative procedure and we are waiting to consult with the European Council and the Member States on these issues."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, honourable Members, in today's interconnected world, no country can remain unaffected by what is happening to its neighbours."
"Just look at the events in North Africa and just look at the debate which has just been concluded in this House, and I think that what is true in politics is definitely true in economics as well."
"The crisis has shown just how great the risk of contagion is - particularly for the countries in the euro area - when one Member State finds itself in serious economic difficulty and how quickly this spreads to the rest of the countries."
"Last year, we showed our determination to do whatever it takes to defend the single currency."
"Temporary instruments like the European Financial Stability Facility and the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism have proved their worth, but the time has come for a permanent solution."
"So as a complement to our reinforced system of economic governance, which was launched this January with the first Annual Growth Survey, we need to set up a robust institutional and financial mechanism to deal with possible future crises."
"That is why the Commission supports a limited change to Article 136 of the Treaty."
"I know that some of you are disappointed with this approach."
"I have to say, the Commission shares your disappointment."
"Like both rapporteurs, Mr Brok and Mr Gualtieri, - who I very much thank for their excellent cooperation on these files - and, I am sure, most of Parliament, we would have preferred the Union to be fully in charge of this permanent mechanism."
"But we understand why members of the euro area opted for an intergovernmental mechanism at this stage."
"Rest assured, however, that the Commission will be fully involved in work to set up the future stability mechanism with the finance ministers of the euro area and we stand ready to bring our expertise to the management of the stability fund if required, just as we did for Greece and just as we did for Ireland."
"At the same time, the Commission will be vigilant in ensuring that the EU's competences are not affected in any way."
"In particular, although European Heads of State or Government agreed that Article 122, the legal basis for the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism, should no longer be used to maintain financial stability in the euro area as a whole, President Barroso did not - as you know - associate himself with this declaration."
"Therefore, we are not speaking about the European Council conclusions, but the statement of the Heads of State or Government, in this respect."
"The Commission considers it to be a purely political declaration that does not affect the EU's competences."
"The Commission will also take whatever measures are necessary, both legislative and otherwise, to ensure that this new mechanism operates in full harmony with the EU's responsibility for coordination and surveillance of economic and financial policies in all Member States."
"Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I agree, of course, with what Mr Brok said."
"I should just like to draw attention to two points: the important thing today is to have legal certainty."
"In other words, there should be no ongoing debate regarding the legal bases of action that may be taken at European level, whether it be intergovernmental or Community action; our preference, of course, is for Community action."
"Why do we need this legal certainty?"
"Because Europe and the euro area are under constant pressure from the markets."
"We cannot destroy the markets but we can try to bring them under control."
"To do so, we must eliminate uncertainty, the decisions that are put off each day, and we must stop constantly wondering whether or not we can take decisions."
"It is therefore a matter of urgency, Commissioner, for you to heed Parliament's requests and for us to quickly amend the Treaty so as to guarantee this legal certainty, which is necessary in order to respond effectively to the difficult economic circumstances we are facing."
"Mr President, we all agree that there needs to be a permanent financial mechanism for euro area countries."
"The mechanism's function is to mobilise financing under strict conditions for the benefit of euro area Member States that are experiencing severe financial problems, so as to safeguard the stability of the euro."
"The issue is that although everybody is in favour of this concept, it is, however, not defined anywhere in the Council's proposal."
"We have a proposal that explains why and by whom this mechanism is to be financed, but it does not specify who will benefit from it."
"The Parliament is doing what the Council failed to do: it clearly lays out who the beneficiaries are, and specifies that it must apply to all Member States, and not just the euro area as a whole."
"What happens if a small country finds itself in a crisis but is not large enough to impact negatively upon the strength of the euro?"
"As it stands, the draft proposal of the Council does not provide any legal guarantees that a country would have access to this mechanism in this case."
"Small Member States will be contributing to this fund without being able to access it in the event of a financial crisis."
"This is unacceptable and it would infringe the principle of solidarity that the European Union embodies."
"It is like paying into an insurance policy which never pays out."
"That is why I welcome the report, which clearly states that no euro area Member State that contributes to this fund can be left out for reasons related to size."
"Secondly, there is the question of interest rates, which should not be calculated at punishing rates, as is happening in Ireland and Greece."
"The Council must therefore examine this issue in light of paragraph 14 and heed the Commission's programmes in this regard, such as the Balance of Payments facility and Macro-Financial Assistance."
"The fact that only an intergovernmental approach is being adopted on such an important subject is worrying."
"The Commission needs to become involved in order to draw up regulations which govern, implement and monitor this mechanism."
"This is why I am very pleased with the work carried out by the Parliament on this proposal and I believe that it is important that the Council accepts them as they are and as they have been agreed upon within the two parliamentary committees."
"Mr President, the first point that I think needs to be stressed here follows on from what my colleague, Mr Brok, said about the involvement of the EU institutions and what Parliament is requesting from the Council with this report: namely, that the EU institutions and the Community method be involved in resolving this issue of the permanent stability mechanism of the stability fund."
"The report calls specifically for this involvement, while respecting the role of the Commission."
"This is essential for Parliament, and I believe that it is essential for this mechanism."
"The second point, and it is one that is very important for us, is that the stability fund is only one of the factors."
"Economic governance and, potentially, EU matters are other factors in resolving the financial and economic crisis that is currently plaguing some of the euro area Member States, and therefore, the Council should be aware that the fund does not solve everything by itself, and that it must be integrated into economic governance mechanisms and into the Europe 2020 growth strategy."
"Having said that, I would like to highlight three very important paragraphs of the report: paragraph 6, which involves all Member States regardless of their size; paragraph 12, which states that access to the fund cannot be denied to any state based on its small size; and paragraph 14, which I believe to be the most important, as it establishes, on the one hand, that interest rates must be offered on favourable terms, so that there is not a repeat of what is currently happening with Greece and Ireland, whose problems are not being solved by aid from the EU or International Monetary Fund."
"It is vital that there be favourable conditions and a back-to-back approach without margins on borrowing costs, so that the financial crises in the most fragile Member States can be resolved."
"Mr President, I would like to underline the importance of the consultation that Parliament must issue."
"This is the first reform of the Treaty of Lisbon since it was adopted and came into force."
"This is a step towards building the economic governance of the Union, and it is probably the first example of how possible future reforms of the Treaty will incorporate some of the elements of this economic governance."
"Parliament, in my opinion, must do what is needed, which is to establish this mechanism, to help to put this financial stability mechanism into action, while, at the same time, ensuring that what is needed is done in the best and most desirable way."
"We need a mechanism that is stable, which means it will be able to prevent and discourage speculation and have the capacity to respond as and when needed."
"It should be a mechanism that is secure, with the legal basis that today's temporary mechanism does not have, and it should have sufficient economic scale."
"I am, therefore, in favour of the simplified procedure, although it is preferable that this be an exceptional step; that reforms take a different form; that Union elements be incorporated into intergovernmentability, with a fundamental role for the Commission; and, finally, that Parliament have a say in accountability."
"Lastly, following the adoption of our report by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, we hope that the Council will be sensitive to our request, because we believe it will strengthen this permanent stability mechanism and therefore contribute to the economic governance of the Union."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, the Prime Minister has told us that we should do whatever needs to be done to stabilise the euro but, in fact, this is only the minimum that is required to be done."
"The Liberal Group here sees it as only the first step in a series of measures which will lead eventually to the construction of a coherent, credible economic government."
"The key is clearly that the mechanism is crafted so that it can, in future, be fully incorporated into the Union system."
"It is important that the Commission is to be on the board of mechanism and, above all, that the rules for the operation of the mechanism, including the terms of the strict conditionality, are prescribed by a regulation proposed by the Commission and codecided by Parliament and the Council."
"This is the first substantial change to the Treaty of Maastricht on economic and monetary union."
"It is critical that we get it right."
"I trust Mr Brok and Mr Gualtieri to negotiate further on behalf of Parliament before 24 March."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"Mr President, I would like to ask the speaker this: in his view, what mandate does the EU and the Commission have for economic government?"
"Would the speaker not agree that, in the absence of a mandate, the party which he represents is neither liberal nor democratic?"
"Mr President, I would say to the Earl of Dartmouth that the mandate for the construction of an economic and monetary union was clearly established by the Treaty of Maastricht, which was negotiated by a Conservative British Government and confirmed by the Westminster Parliament on several subsequent occasions."
"I have to say that if British Members think they can play glibly with the future of the single currency, they are committing a profound mistake."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe, in all seriousness, we can say that we in Europe are standing at a crossroads, and it is a crossroads where two major crises require action on our part at the same time."
"The first of these is the economic and financial crisis and, in its wake, also the euro crisis - dramatic consequences, in my view, of a one-sided and unsustainable development model based on debt and deregulation that, in our Member States and throughout Europe, increasingly destroyed the sustainability as well as the social cohesion and the achievement potential of the public budgets as the basis for that."
"The other major crisis, of which we are much less aware, is what I see as a crisis of democracy and legitimacy, linked to the fact that we are able to take more and more decisions not in the nation state but beyond it, the result of which, as this is associated not with more but with less democracy, is that we lose the consent and the acceptance of the people."
"We should therefore consider very carefully what we do."
"We believe that we do need a stability mechanism, it is just that we think that this one does not go deep enough, as it deals with the symptoms and not the causes."
"Intervention is one-sided and affects public expenditure, wages, salaries, pensions and social welfare."
"The enormous profits from speculation that have been and continue to be made and the increasingly unequal distribution of wealth and income in Europe are not being tackled."
"We are not asking those who have made their profits from such speculation to dip into their pockets, and that means we are not going far enough."
"My second point is that what we are doing here is establishing a mechanism outside of the Community method."
"Yet Europe is exactly the model of how such collaboration between States on their free initiative can be based on social cohesion and more democracy."
"Through the Treaty of Lisbon, we promised to prepare future Treaty revisions by means of a convention so that they would thus be subject to intensive democratic debate."
"Now, with the very first revision of the Treaty, we are doing the opposite."
"We do want this stability mechanism, but we do not want it at the expense of European democracy, citizen participation, at the expense of giving up the Community method."
"We do not want it in the form of a retreat to an intergovernmental Europe again but as a step forward to a more communal Europe with more participation and more democracy."
"We have therefore tabled amendments to this effect relating both to the content and the methodology."
"We are in close contact with the rapporteurs."
"We have decided not to have a final vote today."
"I am hopeful that the progress that has emerged over recent days will mean that, in the end, we will be able to give our approval."
"We will only give our approval, however, if this pact takes us forwards and not if it leads to backward steps in our construction of a communal, democratic and social Europe."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, my group is happy to support the Treaty amendment proposed by the Member States."
"We do so because we want the euro to survive and the countries that use it to prosper."
"We in the United Kingdom are glad that we are not part of the euro, but we wish you well."
"While we support the Treaty amendment, however, we do not support this report because what we have here is a wish list of unnecessary changes dreamt up at the last minute."
"It really is unfortunate that the Parliament is behaving in this manner."
"Such posturing is all the more bewildering given that we will vote on this opinion only hours before the European Council formally agrees the Treaty change."
"Does anyone here really believe that the Council is listening to us?"
"If the Parliament wants to be taken seriously, we must stop grandstanding and instead start delivering for the citizens of our Member States."
"Mr President, I find it remarkable that unease now reigns in the majority of the groups in this House in respect of approving the use of a fast-track procedure for the amendment of Article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
"This report clearly confirms our expectation as MEPs that any future crisis-management mechanism will not create parallel structures outside the Union and that parliamentary democratic supervision should be maintained at every stage."
"It is just that I find myself somewhat lacking in belief in this regard."
"Mr Barroso did make clear yesterday that he supports both the goal of social cohesion within the Union and the Community method."
"All the speakers agreed with him."
"Thus far, however, this has not been made into a motion for a resolution and that, it strikes me, is something lacking."
"What there was - or not - was the Merkel-Sarkozy pact."
"That awakens my mistrust and a certain degree of scepticism."
"For my group, it is clear that we cannot give our approval to any policy that aims to consolidate the budget by means of further cuts in the social sphere."
"The European Parliament must first be given a vote on the specific proposals for the Union's future economic and monetary policy and the related mechanisms, as these are what this is about at its core."
"That, in turn, is such a fundamental decision that it must not be taken on the basis of 'Europe by decree' but only in accordance with the convention method laid down by the Treaty."
"My group is thus unable to vote in favour of what is, in many respects, a positive report."
"Ultimately, despite constant assertions to the contrary, this would, of course, set a precedent."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr President, I have been here six and a half years, and, my goodness, I have heard some nonsense."
"But I have not heard so much nonsense spoken as I have today."
"Many years ago, I used to lecture on this subject at Cambridge University, and I would suggest that you would do well to read some of my old lecture notes."
"None of you, it appears, seems to understand the concept of international money."
"Herr Brok, who has not come off the phone since he came in only to listen to himself, was rather interesting."
"He started off this debate by suggesting it was a great success - the euro."
"One wonders what planet Herr Brok lives on."
"Dear oh dear!"
"It is a complete disaster."
"If he thinks it is such a success, I would argue that he speak to the millions of unemployed people, youngsters mainly in the Iberian Peninsula, southern Italy and the rest of Europe, who are suffering from this disgraceful, fraudulent and deceitful currency which was rammed down the throats of the people of Europe against their will."
"There is no mandate, Mr Duff."
"There is no mandate, with your blue card hanging up there, let me tell you."
"There is no mandate for this."
"The British people have not been given a vote on this whole shebang of European Union, and neither has anybody else."
"There is only one way this ridiculous currency spanning many different economies against a whole background of failed ideals can survive - and if you understood international money to any degree, you would understand this - and that is by having a financial, central, statist fiscal policy."
"If you think you have a mandate for that, you are a disgrace and a scoundrel."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"Mr President, I would like to ask Mr Bloom just how his diatribe was received at Cambridge."
"I cannot imagine an economics class tolerating such fatuous and intemperate nonsense."
"I would also like to ask him this: does he not find that there is unemployment in the United Kingdom?"
"Does he not know of the excessive deficit position of the UK?"
"Does he not care that inflation in Britain is greater than it is in the euro area and that sterling is a fragile currency?"
"Mr President, I have to say to Mr Duff that at the time, in the mid-1990s, some of the class greeted my views with some scepticism."
"I still now go back to the occasional reunion dinner and most of them come up to me and say, 'My god, Godders, you were right'."
"And I am, by god!"
"I was right in spades, was I not?"
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, there is a temptation for the British to regard the stability mechanism as something that has nothing to do with us, simply because we are outside the euro area."
"I think that would be a grave mistake."
"There is no doubt that there are many UK politicians, here and at home, who would like Britain to join the euro."
"There was a pledge by all the parties that there would be a referendum before there was any attempt to join the euro, but we all know how valuable referendum promises are in the UK."
"Both the Labour Party and the Conservative Party pledged to have a vote on the Lisbon Treaty."
"The former wriggled out of it on the spurious ground that the Constitutional Treaty and the Lisbon Treaty were different; the latter wriggled out of its obligation on the ground that the Lisbon Treaty had been ratified and therefore, it was impossible to have a referendum."
"Furthermore, the present government has decided there will be no referendum on this Treaty change."
"The proposed amendment to the Treaty provides for expensive involvement in the stability mechanism of those countries that are not in the euro area."
"The whole stability mechanism, of course, is an admission of the innate flaw in the euro experiment."
"A currency value should reflect the relative value of a country's imports and exports - the state of its economy."
"A single currency cannot reflect accurately the state of 17 - or eventually 27 - different economies."
"Our priority must be to make sure this disastrous experiment is never extended to the UK."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the strange thing about the Council's proposal is that once it has been approved, it will pave the way for the creation of a permanent stability mechanism through an instrument of international law, and hence without a direct link to the institutional structure of the Union."
"This fact caused great concern in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, which I chair, and which has the task of keeping an eye on the coherence of the Union's institutional framework."
"The simplified revision proposal therefore sparked a lively debate in which arguments based on the solid principles of the process of European integration came up against pragmatism and realpolitik."
"In short, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs thinks that in order to deliberate on the proposal to amend the treaty, Parliament must assess the economic governance context under which the proposal falls."
"We need to know more about how the future mechanism will tie in with existing institutional structures."
"It would be a mistake to create twin structures which, in the long term, would carry the risk of the Union breaking up."
"The proposals and suggestions in the report by Mr Brok and Mr Gualtieri aim to build suitable bridges between the Union's institutional structure and the new mechanism."
"Moreover, I should like to emphasise that the Council must see these issues as fundamental for harmonious cooperation between the European institutions."
"I therefore strongly urge the European Council to take heed of this requirement and the consideration that it must give us, ahead of our vote on 24 March."
"As we await a positive sign, I should like to offer my heartfelt thanks for the brilliant work of the rapporteurs, Mr Brok and Mr Gualtieri."
"Mr President, I have no doubts whatsoever that Europe needs a permanent stability mechanism."
"I have fought many political battles and referendums over democratically legitimate community decision making."
"I therefore have deep reservations about the Treaty mechanism being proposed by the Heads of State to establish and manage the ESM."
"I urge the Heads of State to reflect very deeply on the consequences for Europe if they reject the broad consensus of this directly elected Parliament."
"Yes, we need a speedy decision, but for such a fundamental issue, we must comply with the Treaties."
"The elephant in the room is a concern that a change in the wording, or switching to the ordinary procedure, might trigger a referendum in Ireland."
"My reaction as a democrat is quite simple: so what?"
"I respect the people."
"I do not fear the people."
"I believe that Ireland is a mature democracy capable of recognising where our best interest lies and that is at the heart of Europe."
"Mr President, response to the sovereign aspects of the economic crisis was slow."
"Initially, the markets punished inadequate responses."
"Recently, there has been a respite."
"Now, some bond interest rates are creeping up again into the unsustainable zone."
"Rescue arrangements that were made have been shown to need change and with the best will, I doubt that the next attempt will be one hundred percent correct, let alone future-proof."
"Therefore, we need a permanent funding mechanism that is flexible, not least to enable early intervention if that is the most effective remedy."
"This is not such a wild idea."
"The IMF does it."
"But, of course, there have to be boundaries, priorities and governance."
"So we need a Treaty change that enables evolution, not a Treaty change that leads to embroilment in what is meant by 'indispensable to the euro area as a whole', which, at the very least, suffers from size discrimination."
"Even strong euro area countries need the stability mechanism because of the interconnectedness of the banking system and sovereign debt."
"It is not a coincidence that the ECB calls for a fund large enough to cope with euro area bank recapitalisation."
"And on interest rates, a balance has to be struck between sustainability and moral hazard, but the end-of-the-day position cannot be that Member States extract rent greatly in excess of costs."
"Mr President, Treaty change is a sensitive subject in my Member State where, despite promises, the Lisbon Treaty was passed without a referendum."
"But I understand why the crisis in the euro area is prompting you to establish a permanent stability mechanism, and although the UK is not a member of the euro area, we do wish to see your economic success."
"For these reasons, my government has said that it will not block the Treaty change required to establish the mechanism."
"But this resolution goes further, and we know from history that introducing vague language leads to uncertainties."
"The recitals raise the concept of Eurobonds, woolly-worded and with no details."
"Members from my group are concerned."
"Does this hand over the sovereign right to manage one's own treasury?"
"What about moral hazard issues?"
"To summarise, we will not vote against the Treaty language agreed by Member States, which is specifically to enable this mechanism to be created, but we cannot support this resolution with creeping, vague concepts."
"(DA) Mr President, it is only a little over a year since the Treaty of Lisbon entered into force."
"Nevertheless, we are already in the process of making a second amendment to the Treaty."
"I actually think it is very interesting that the Treaty of Lisbon was clearly so poor that it constantly has to be amended."
"Why is it being amended, and how are we going about it?"
"Not via the usual procedure, but by means of a special 'fast track' procedure."
"Why is this?"
"Is it because the amendment of the Treaty is unimportant?"
"No, quite the contrary in fact."
"Nevertheless, it is intended to proceed so quickly that there is no real opportunity to involve the people in an in-depth debate."
"When the Treaty of Lisbon was sold to the people, one of the arguments presented was that it would give the European Parliament more influence."
"However, the proposed amendment will mean that major decisions can be taken at EU level without the European Parliament having any say in the matter."
"So, what will be the result of the amendment of the Treaty?"
"In this regard, we are in complete agreement with the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC)."
"The amendment of the Treaty will pave the way for top-steered assaults on collective agreements throughout Europe and thus, for a lowering of conditions for workers."
"Does anyone really believe that this is the way to win the support of the people for a joint European project?"
"Thank you for giving me the floor."
"(DA) Mr President, the main thing that comes to mind when I read this report and this amendment of the Treaty is that this is an absolute insult - an insult to the electorate, who now, for the second time, find themselves totally disregarded in relation to the Treaty - a Treaty that they were not even asked whether they wanted the first time around."
"It is an insult to taxpayers, particularly those in northern Europe, who are having to pay for the overspending in a number of southern European countries."
"It is also an absolute insult to the southern European economies, which may have the impression that it is a question of a lack of money in the countries in question."
"That is not the case."
"The problem in these countries is structural shortcomings."
"These countries should undergo a number of structural reforms if they are to fit into the model that the euro requires and aspires to."
"Only by changing their financial policy to be more like that of Germany will these countries be able to kick-start their economies."
"We might just as well say it like it is, and to constantly give them more money and ever cheaper loans will only prolong the pain."
"Thank you, Mr President."
"(ES) Mr President, I would like to say that I agree with the opinion of the members who have spoken here this morning and who insist on respect for Parliament and for the Commission."
"This is why my modest vote in favour will depend on whether the European Council is prepared to accept the role of these institutions."
"This is because the new mechanisms we are talking about must be a significant component in economic governance, driven by a European Union that is capable of ensuring coherence between common economic policy, which must set clear, precise and limited objectives, and this stability instrument."
"In other words, we must ensure at all costs that this effort we are involved in does not end up going down the intergovernmental route, which is a blind alley or one dominated by just a few countries, because that would obstruct the reform."
"Fellow Members, Europe is being built one brick at a time, and this is one brick that will reinforce and balance this delicate building."
"(DE) Mr President, we must not forget, in this debate, that we are dealing with a simplified Treaty revision pursuant to Article 136 and that we, as Parliament - in connection with whatever mechanisms - are supposed to be more heavily involved."
"That is the starting point."
"A wish list has been put forward in this regard."
"I would like to give my specific backing to Mr Brok when he says that the participation of the Commission and of Parliament must be envisaged."
"That is why we are having this debate and will not be taking a decision until 24 March, in order to give the Council the chance to actually bring about that participation in reality."
"The full inclusion of the Commission throws up questions, as the Commission has failed, in the past, to observe its obligation to act as guardian of the Treaties by failing to instigate proceedings."
"The Member States themselves have likewise failed to observe their obligations."
"It is therefore imperative that, in this simplified Treaty revision, we take a new step towards completing economic and monetary union."
"I also have an idea of how that can be brought about, which is for the Commission to prepare everything - including proposals and drafts - on behalf of the Council, and the Council to then be obliged, much like in the monetary dialogue that we have with the independent European Central Bank, to report to us here and discuss matters with us."
"That would be a sensible approach."
"(SK) Mr President, from a legal perspective, the amendment to the agreement is essential for the introduction of a fixed Eurobond."
"It is also undoubtedly necessary to introduce a euro area stability mechanism."
"A mutual assistance mechanism, if properly set up, can bind the Union together and lead to greater integration and solidarity between Member States."
"However, we should definitely not stop there."
"If the mechanism is to be significant, coordination must be improved in the economic area, but also in the area of social policies."
"At the same time, I consider the intention to establish a stability mechanism outside the system of European institutions to be a bad signal."
"The intergovernmental or even private-law nature of the proposed mechanism may put the European integration project back several years."
"I would therefore like to call not only on the Commission, but especially on Member State representatives, to abandon such ideas."
"If we are to exploit the crisis at least in some positive way, then we must see it as a chance to mobilise and not to split apart."
"The establishment and operation of a permanent stability mechanism should happen in the closest possible connection with the framework of the EU, and should involve the institutional procedures of enhanced cooperation."
"I would like to end by expressing the hope that only the good signals from the submitted proposal will come to fruition."
"(PL) Mr President, we are amending the Treaty of Lisbon, which, in fact, we only recently adopted."
"Perhaps this should cause us to consider whether the Treaty, which was so greatly trumpeted and said to be a panacea for all of Europe's problems, has nevertheless proved basically to be completely overrated."
"Of course, the crisis, which is, at the moment, a problem for the Union, requires very resolute action."
"Only there is a question as to whether what the Commission and the Council are proposing really is a good solution."
"This is not only a matter of the euro area, because it is going to affect countries which are outside the area."
"What is more, those countries - and that includes my own country, Poland - are basically going to have decisions imposed on them which were made without their involvement."
"This is not a good signal for the citizens, who were once told that the Treaty of Lisbon would be a panacea for every problem."
"Mr President, I have three points."
"Firstly, deficits are not caused by currencies."
"They are caused by governments and overspending."
"I think that is perhaps bad news for Mr Bloom, who spoke here earlier, because if he was right and the responsibility was that of the currencies, that would be extremely bad news for the pound or the dollar, where we have the biggest deficits globally today."
"The responsibility lies with governments."
"That is why it is important that we secure and structure the stability mechanism in a way that helps Member States get out of difficulties, but also helps to ensure that Member States do not get into difficulties."
"That is why I think it is important that the financing of the stability mechanism is structured in such a way that those who are exposing us to bigger risks by having bigger deficits should be obliged to pay more in order to contribute to the mechanism."
"Then you have some kind of 'polluter pays' principle and you also have a preventive action in the stability mechanism, contributing to the stability of the euro as such."
"That is why I think we need not only to discuss the formal structure of the stability mechanism, but also how we finance it."
"We need to secure stability in a long-term perspective as well as in the short-term perspective."
"(PT) I can summarise my position in three points."
"Firstly, the idea of a permanent stability mechanism for the euro in itself constitutes a vital contribution to strengthening the single currency, to greater monetary integration in the EU, and to making the public debt markets more stable."
"We should therefore support it unreservedly."
"Secondly, the permanent stability mechanism can only be created with security and legal certainty if it is included in the Treaties in a clear way."
"We should therefore support the careful amendment of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
"Thirdly, it would obviously be preferable if the aforementioned mechanism were created and managed by the European institutions themselves, rather than emerging as an intergovernmental initiative for the euro area."
"Nonetheless, we are well aware that this is impossible in the face of insurmountable objections from certain Member States, and it only takes one such objection for the amendment to the Treaty not to be passed."
"We should therefore support the Council's proposal for the amendments of the Treaty as it is."
"Mr President, first, I would like to thank the rapporteurs for the excellent work they have done."
"It is quite heartening that we are speaking with the same voice as the European Commission."
"Most importantly, I would like to thank them for defending the prerogatives of this House."
"To my colleagues from the ECR, I would say that this is not grandstanding but legitimately asserting our role in this process."
"In times of crisis, we need effective solutions, stability and predictability, and all these features can be achieved best when we avail ourselves of the Community institutions."
"Intergovernmental solutions will not, in the long run, lead us anywhere."
"Most importantly, if we are serious about fighting economic crisis and being competitive, we have to do it together, regardless of whether a given Member State is a part of the euro area or outside it."
"Therefore, I welcome the fact that, in our position - voted on yesterday in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs of this House - we have agreed to open the mechanism to all countries willing to participate in it, thus dispelling the ungrounded fears of a two-speed Europe."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Lisbon, on which work went on for so long, had two clear messages: firstly, the strengthening of the Community method with a central role for the Commission and, secondly, the strengthening of democracy with the participation of the European Parliament."
"Little more than a year after the entry into force of the Treaty, the spirit of Lisbon is already being ignored and ridden roughshod over."
"What the European Council has devised with this revision of the Treaty is unequivocally contrary to both of these messages of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"The Community method is not being strengthened - instead, what we have is renationalisation, intergovernmentalisation, in an important area of future EU policy and the complete exclusion of the bodies of the EU."
"That is unacceptable and Parliament actually has to be opposed to this proposal."
"It amazes me that the Commission, as guardian of the Treaties, has not spoken up more clearly and that we here in Parliament have to act, to some extent, as representatives of the Commission."
"We must push the Commission into action that it should already have taken."
"A dangerous precedent is being set here."
"We are observing as a result of the economic crisis that monetary union cannot exist alone."
"Given the influx of refugees from North Africa and the uncertainty in our neighbourhood, we are seeking additional EU policies and we do not want renationalisation."
"I hope that the rapporteurs can still make improvements as otherwise, I cannot vote in favour of this revision of the Treaty."
"(FR) Mr President, the stability mechanism before us has been designed from the point of view of previous emergencies."
"It is a rescue mechanism."
"However, in the long run, the States cannot be saved, and they should not be saved."
"The aim should be to perfect Europe's economic union and to create a European budgetary area capable of supporting the Member States and the single currency."
"To this end, we must go further than current emergencies dictate."
"Ultimately, the European institutions must take the lead, and we must stop depending on endless intergovernmental initiatives, be they Franco-German or from elsewhere."
"Pierre Werner, whose plan may be regarded as the fundamental basis of the euro, included in his work the notion of a European economic decision-making centre that is answerable to Parliament."
"Well, today, that economic decision-making centre can only be the Commission and Parliament."
"The next step, after we have overcome the hurdle of the small amendment to the Treaty, on which we are about to vote, must therefore ultimately be to go back in time 40 years and finally fulfil Pierre Werner's wish."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, amending a treaty is always a complex and sensitive subject, even more so the first time because it can set a precedent for future interventions."
"Likewise, for this reason, I think that the work of Mr Brok and Mr Gualtieri is very careful, balanced and utterly worthy of support."
"There are three issues that I should like to emphasise in the report that they have presented to us."
"The first point is that the permanent mechanism cannot, and must not, lie outside Europe's institutional framework."
"For this reason, the presence of the Commission on the board will be the key to providing a common thread to the relationship between the current institutional framework and the mechanism to be amended."
"The second issue is proper continuity of the temporary measures with the current situation: there will be trouble if this is not achieved."
"Lastly, the relationship with the economic institutions is crucial for the future development of economic governance."
"We must avoid creating dual systems that would do more harm than good."
"(ES) Mr President, we will not be going ahead with the vote on the Brok-Gualtieri report this morning: we will do it during the Brussels sitting."
"We will do it then in order to give Mr Brok and Mr Gualtieri time to negotiate the conditions for applying Article 136 with the European Council."
"We are doing so because, as Mr Leinen said, the European Parliament is also der Hüter der Verträge - the guardian of the Treaties - and because we want the euro to function with everyone involved and with everyone committed; in the end, Mr President, we want it to be effective."
"That is what we asked for."
"It is not about any dispute between the institutions."
"It is not about gaining power for Parliament."
"It is about the result - the mechanism resulting from this - being effective for the European public."
"(PL) Mr President, only a year ago, in view of how difficult it was to ratify the Treaty of Lisbon, none of us considered the possibility of having to amend its provisions."
"However, the economic situation in Europe has meant that what was impossible only a year ago has become something which can be done, and that this even has the consent of the majority of Member States."
"The economic and financial crisis is not only teaching us solidarity, but is also revealing strong economic relationships between the individual Member States."
"Being outside the euro area does not protect countries which do not use the common currency from the budget crisis inside the euro area."
"On the contrary, the financial problems of members of the euro area are having an adverse effect on the situation throughout the Union."
"Therefore, the permanent financial stability mechanism should be open to all Member States, including those from outside the euro area."
"Withdrawal from Member States which are not part of the euro area, including by stronger economic and social integration as is proposed by the Franco-German competitiveness pact, will foster a widening of the divide in the two-speed Europe, which will not help us in building a strong, cohesive and competitive Europe and will not create conditions for the Union to work together, which Mr Brok encourages us to do."
"Thank you."
"Mr President, we are all aware of the current economic crisis and the danger it presents in general to our lives, in particular, to the euro, which is crucial for the European political and economic project."
"We need to maintain the stability of the eurozone in the principle of responsibility and solidarity for all Member States in need."
"That said, I would like to underline three points."
"Even when desperate times call for desperate measures and simplified procedures, in the long run, it is not possible to ignore transparency, parliamentary scrutiny and democratic accountability."
"The stability mechanism should represent the first part of a complex approach and permanent measures aimed at working towards the Union's economic governance."
"The permanent stability mechanism, once established, should not exist outside the EU institutional framework."
"Let me finally thank our rapporteurs for the outstanding job they have done on this extremely important, urgent and complicated matter."
"Even without much information on the stability mechanism, it deserves a place in the EU institutional framework."
"I am very pleased that the President of Hungary will be coming here soon."
"(FR) Mr President, three years ago, we were told: 'This is the treaty to end all treaties; it will not be revised'."
"Realism has today led us to revise it."
"For the first time, the Treaty of Lisbon provides real powers for the European Parliament where revising the Treaties is concerned."
"We have before us a proposal that ignores the rights of this European Parliament and which is proposing an intergovernmental mechanism for a Community matter - monetary policy."
"I have drawn two conclusions from this."
"Firstly, I hope that our colleagues who are going to negotiate on our behalf are able to amend as much as possible the proposal that has been submitted to us, so as to 'recommunitise' the mechanism."
"Secondly, I also hope that this revision of the Treaty will be the last one carried out without the agreement or the involvement of the European Parliament."
"This European Parliament has proposals to make, and we know that we will have to go further in terms of revising the Treaty and in terms of enhanced cooperation if the euro area is to survive."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are now three different economic governance packages before us: the Commission's six proposals, the competitiveness pact - currently being negotiated under the leadership of Mr Van Rompuy and Mr Barroso - and the proposals to amend the Treaty and the associated establishment of the European stability mechanism."
"It is clear, after this debate, that all of this must take place under parliamentary supervision and on the basis of a proposal from the Commission."
"The fact is though, that, under the Treaties, Parliament has different rights in relation to the three different packages."
"At the same time, these packages do overlap."
"What should we do politically, therefore?"
"In my view, it is crucial that we link our consent for the Commission's six proposals to having our demands met in the other areas, so that everything becomes one well-balanced package in the interests of the citizens."
"(SK) Mr President, a number of EU Member States agreed to create and use one common currency."
"However, differing economic potential has led to a situation where, for some Member States, the link to the common currency complicates the options for using standard procedures for handling insolvency."
"All countries using the common currency have therefore agreed to create a mechanism enabling them to resolve existing financial problems and also to prevent these in the future."
"The solution agreed on by the countries involved, however, requires an amendment and a supplement to Article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and acceptance of this solution by all EU Member States."
"However, responsibility for the common currency is currently borne mainly by the 17 countries of the European Monetary Union, and it is therefore logical that the European stability mechanism should have an intergovernmental character, and the position of the European Commission as a simple observer is, in my view, sufficient."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, as has been said several times, sometimes, for the Commission to be heard, it must speak up."
"I will try to do this now."
"Firstly, I would like to thank the rapporteurs for their excellent cooperation and the Members for a very important debate."
"I think that we can definitely agree with many points which have been made in this discussion, especially that we need strong action at European level and that a future mechanism should be as close as possible to the Community spirit and the method."
"To react to the comments on our assistance to Greece and Ireland: I think our experience clearly demonstrates that we should be constantly searching for a delicate balance between preserving the sustainability of the debt and avoiding moral hazards."
"The fact that we are learning from the experience has, I think, clearly been demonstrated by the statements of my colleague, Commissioner Olli Rehn, in the last few days."
"At the same time, I think we have to remind ourselves that the circumstances we are living in are truly exceptional."
"The crisis is still here, recovery is fragile and markets are in turmoil, as we can see in the constant movements of the spreads."
"More importantly, European countries are suffering unacceptable pressure and they see their future as mortgaged by high interest rates on their debts."
"We therefore need to act, and we need to act fast."
"We clearly need to demonstrate our resolve."
"Setting up the permanent mechanism must therefore be done in the shortest possible time and as quickly as possible."
"What is very important - and this was the one condition on which the Commission was very insistent - is that it must be done within the framework of the Treaties."
"I agree with Mr Gauzès that swift action is needed, because we need legal certainty."
"I also agree with Mr Guerrero Salom, who said that we should not treat this as a precedent."
"I can assure him that the procedure which is used, and the type of cooperation which is proposed, is definitely not seen as a precedent by the Commission."
"I have to inform you that the Commission is closely associated with the preparatory work and that we consider it essential that we are also involved in setting up and operating this mechanism."
"As stated in Annex 2 of the European Council conclusions, the role of the Commission is expected to be central in the preparation of analyses and programmes for the future countries in it."
"But we believe that the Commission's central role should be underlined even more strongly."
"Regarding the criticism of the method which was chosen, I have to say that we have seen good examples which such a method can result in, for example, Schengen or the third pillar."
"To conclude, just one sentence."
"When the Lisbon Treaty was being drafted, this type of cooperation, this area of cooperation, was considered to be too ambitious for the Member States."
"Now, however, real life, the real experience we have with interdependence and with economic cooperation, is clearly demonstrating to us that what we need is a European solution to this very important European problem."
"I believe we will achieve it."
"Thank you, Mr Šefčovič."
"Mr Gualtieri has the floor, though I would strongly urge him to keep to one minute."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this has been an important debate which I think has clearly shown the existence of broad consensus among the political groups over the assessments and general direction of the report."
"With a few exceptions, Parliament is truly speaking with one voice and that is important."
"We are saying yes to the permanent stability mechanism though we cannot hide some confusion and concern which, as we have learnt, is also shared by the Commission, even though we would have liked to read of these concerns in the opinion of the Commission on the procedure selected."
"We are open to showing practicality and a sense of responsibility in noting that the political conditions do not exist to set up a European mechanism today and, nevertheless, we have shown and continue to show determination in our desire to help insert the mechanism into the Union's legal and procedural framework, whilst also respecting the Treaties."
"Our proposals are clear, but now I think the crucial issue is another."
"Is the European Council willing to start up a real discussion with Parliament on its proposals and is the Commission willing to take an active role in this discussion?"
"I should like to underline that Parliament has taken what I would call a customary decision to postpone the vote to 24 March."
"I think this is an important sign: this is a responsible Parliament, but I think the Council also needs to show this sense of responsibility by taking Parliament's proposals into consideration."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Against the background of the current economic crisis, the suggestion to introduce a financial stability mechanism meets the urgent need for solidarity between Member States and is a positive step."
"However, modifying the Treaty in the format envisaged at the moment could create a mechanism devoted exclusively to a limited number of Member States."
"This does not allow, for example, Member States which do not have the euro to be included under its remit."
"I believe that for this mechanism to be truly European, it must be created inside the European Union's institutional framework, with the involvement of the Commission and European Parliament."
"It must also take into account the participation of all 27 Member States."
"We must not forget that the economic fluctuations which occur in Member States outside the euro area have an impact on the economic and financial stability of the whole Union."
"What is currently happening with the announced amendment to the Treaty of Lisbon shows that everything that EU leaders have said about the importance of the national parliaments and the European Parliament, the deepening of democracy, and the sustainability of the Treaty itself, has been nothing more than propaganda."
"A year and several months after the Treaty of Lisbon's entry into force, everyone is being sidelined for an amendment to be drawn up using a mechanism of the Treaty itself which not only allows an amendment to be made without any democratic participation whatsoever - continuing, in fact, with their rejection of the national referenda to approve the Treaty - but also creates a mechanism enabling permanent control of the Member States' economies."
"This report is heading in the same direction, by tabling certain proposed amendments to the Commission's proposal regarding the amendment to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union as regards a stability mechanism for Member States whose currency is the euro."
"In practice, everything is aimed at consolidating the boost that they are attempting to give to this economic governance with the creation of the 'European semester': the deepening of the penalties relating to compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact, of the economic policy guidelines, and of any indicators that may be adopted."
"They are trying to impose a veritable straitjacket on the Member States."
"In May 2010, the long-term fiscal imbalance in Greece resulted in a major rescue package amounting to EUR 720 billion from the resources of the EU and the International Monetary Fund."
"Despite the fact that the special European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) was created for euro area countries, with resources of up to EUR 440 billion, it cannot be said that all of the EU's problems have been overcome."
"Moreover, the operation of the EFSF terminates at the end of 2012, and a measure of uncertainty prevails among investors as to what will happen with the debts of problem euro area countries after this date, or after the guarantees provided run out."
"It is for this reason that a change to Article 136 of the Treaty, creating a stabilisation mechanism after 2013, is desirable for the EU's future financial and fiscal stability."
"Nevertheless, I would like to point out that this mechanism will not be a panacea for the actual protection of the budgets of problem (or peripheral) states, and that we also need to consider a comprehensive solution to this problem (public debt reduction, renewal of confidence in the banking sector and structural reforms, including fiscal consolidation of the peripheral states in order to boost their competitiveness)."
"On the whole, I think that the report submitted by Elmar Brok and Robert Gualtieri presents an accurate analysis of the issue, referring to the relevant EU legislation as well as the opinion of the Committee on Budgets, and I therefore recommend approving the amendment to Article 136 of the Treaty in its proposed form."
"in writing. - (LV) In the last few years, the euro has experienced several shocks, which would possibly have destroyed another currency."
"The actions of EU leaders, albeit they have not always been sufficiently swift or convincing, have enabled the euro to be defended."
"The situation is still fraught with difficulty, but I am convinced that Europe will overcome this crisis and become economically more powerful."
"This crisis has revealed the EU's weak spots and more clearly shown what amendments are necessary to European Union legislation, including the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, with respect to the stability mechanism for euro area countries."
"I am convinced that the establishment of the European financial stabilisation mechanism (EFSM) is one of the most important steps that can be taken for the EU to avoid serious economic crises in the future."
"Of course, the establishment of the EFSM will not solve all problems, which is why it is important that governments recognise their responsibility for compliance with the Maastricht criteria, and implement a sensible, well-considered economic and monetary policy based on long-term objectives."
"We cannot afford a repetition of the scenarios of recent years, when Member States pursued 'foot hard down on the accelerator' economic policies, disregarding the Maastricht criteria and breaking other fundamental laws of economics."
"The euro is not only a currency; it is a political covenant, demonstrating the EU's ability to be united in diversity."
"The euro is the guarantee of European stability, growth and unity."
"That is why I do not have the slightest doubt that we shall be able to be sufficiently clear-sighted and wise to overcome this crisis and give a new stimulus to development."

"The next item is the vote."
"(For the results and other details on the vote: see Minutes)"
"Mr President, I rise yet again to complain about the time management of this Parliament."
"Both yesterday and today, we were given a time to vote, and we have abused it yet again."
"Surely, the sign of a well run and effective Parliament is one that can manage its affairs properly and to time."
"Can you please urge the authorities to get a grip of this?"
"Otherwise, we will be treated with the contempt we deserve."
"Mr President, my point of order regards the first two votes we have today on the calendar for next year and the year after."
"I have two points to raise, if you please."
"First of all, these votes simply illustrate how powerless this Parliament really is."
"Everybody here thinks they are getting more and more power, and more and more influence."
"But, in point of fact, these amendments are simply to get round the fact that we are obliged to have 12 part-sessions ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr Clark, you have a point of order not a speech."
"I am sorry, but I have to stop you."
"We now move on to the vote."
"Mr President, I would not normally rise on such a point."
"As a Vice-President, I respect the Chair."
"However, the groups have all been told that the calendar votes, which are very limited - I think there are two amendments - will take place at the beginning of the voting session and not after Mr Schmitt has spoken to the House."
"I think it is disrespectful to Mr Schmitt to allow people to go and then ask them to come back again for two votes after his speech."
"I therefore ask you to put to the House the proposal to modify the agenda that all votes today take place before Mr Schmitt's speech, and we start on the basis of the calendar votes."
"(Applause)"
"Mr McMillan-Scott, I have an answer to what you have just said and it is that on Monday, this Parliament voted the agenda."
"You will see in the agenda that Parliament voted that the calendar votes would take place from 12:30 to 13:30."
"This is a decision that Parliament took on Monday."
"Mr President, I am sorry to prolong this but as it happens, the voting lists have been circulated to all the groups."
"If this was an error, it needs to be corrected."
"It is ridiculous, and disrespectful to the President of one of our Member States and currently in the Presidency, to call the Members back to the House, back to the Chamber, after he has spoken."
"Let us do it now in the order in which it is on the voting paper."
"There is no justification for changing this again."
"(Applause)"
"This is how it goes. Every Monday, we vote on the agenda."
"Listen to me."
"Do not aargh and oooh."
"If you want to change the rules, you can do so, but the rules we have say that we vote every Monday on the agenda."
"We did so this time with those Members who were in the Chamber."
"Nevertheless, the President has the right to put the agenda to the vote again if a majority of the Members want this, so what I will do is exercise my discretion and ask you: would you like to vote to change the agenda for today?"
"Who is in favour of voting to change the agenda?"
"Who is against?"
"Abstentions?"
"(Applause)"
"Having said this, dear colleagues, I remind you that if you want to have a say on the agenda, be here on Mondays."
"Mr McMillan-Scott's proposal was to vote on the calendar before the address by the President of Hungary, if indeed time allows - because, as you see, we are actually losing time."
"Given the time now, I expect that we will have a lot of votes to continue with after the speech by the President."
"So, who is in favour of voting on the calendar before the President of Hungary's speech, if, in fact, we have the time to do so?"
"Who is against?"
"Abstentions?"
"So we shall do that: we shall vote on the calendar if we have time before the President of Hungary's speech."
"(Objections)"
"Colleagues, it makes no difference; we will continue the votes anyway after the President has spoken."
"(Murmurs of dissent)"
"I shall exercise my discretion."
"In order to stop this ridiculousness, I will take the vote on the calendar as the first vote."
"Is everyone happy now?"
"(Applause)"
"OK, you will still be here to vote after the President's speech, but let us go ahead now with the vote on the 2012 calendar."
"Formal sitting - Hungary"
"President Schmitt, honoured guests, ladies and gentlemen, we welcome you, Mr Schmitt, as someone who, not long ago, was a fellow Member of our Parliament."
"You are with us, today, in a completely different role than before."
"You sat many times in this seat, Mr President, and chaired the proceedings of our Parliament."
"It gives us great pleasure that you are supporting the Hungarian Presidency today, and also that you are working today to create a friendly climate for the European Parliament in Europe, because you know how important this House is - how important it is for the people who live in our country and for the decisions which are made in the European Union."
"We are going to vote, today, on the report drafted by Mrs Járóka."
"This is an important matter for us all, because the Roma minority is the most persecuted minority in Europe, and it is also the largest minority in Europe."
"We have both the will and the means to be able to solve this problem gradually."
"The Járóka report will contribute to this greatly."
"We are sure of this."
"It is also important that we are opening up to the Balkan states."
"We remember very well, Mr President, that during the six years in which you worked with us, you attached very great importance to enlargement of the Union to include the Western Balkans."
"There are indeed many problems to be solved there."
"The countries concerned have to prepare first, but after that, their participation in the European Union will help us, too, to solve many problems."
"We would also like to thank you for your work on this."
"Perhaps my fellow Members remember the days, many years ago, when you won Olympic gold medals."
"Then you put your whole heart into serving the Olympic movement, and now, as a statesman, you represent your country, and the European Union too, both outside the Union and in Europe."
"We would like to thank you for this."
"We are very interested in what you are going to say."
"President of the Republic of Hungary. - (HU) I shall speak in my mother tongue, Hungarian."
"Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, I stand here before you with great pleasure and pride."
"I was glad to return to this important scene of my life and career, to my friends and associates, to the European Parliament, where I was a member for six years."
"Thank you for inviting me."
"Mr President, what would I not have given a year ago for twenty minutes' speaking time!"
"This is an influential place, where every politician, every public actor can learn a lot."
"I think it is no coincidence that many presidents and ministers have emerged from these benches."
"This is good news for Europe because it gains leading politicians who have graduated from the not-always-easy school of European dialogue, who see their national affairs in a community dimension, and who are not only able to represent interests, but have also learnt to reconcile them."
"This is Europe's civilisational legacy and this is its mission today as well."
"The European Parliament is a prime example of the important role parliamentarianism and the culture of public debate plays in European thinking."
"Parliament, endowed with increased powers since the Treaty of Lisbon, is the guarantee of democratic decision making."
"Clear-mindedness and open attentiveness towards each other befit its traditions."
"Thus, Hungary, as the current President of the Council of the European Union, readily cooperates with the European Parliament, because this here is not simply a melting pot of legislation but, if I may put it like this, far more than that: the soul of Europe."
"Ladies and gentlemen, indeed, Europe not only has a market, a currency, policies and laws, but it also has a soul and a spirit."
"I know full well that the day-to-day work here is mainly about practical details."
"However, the crises of the recent past have also illustrated what can happen when the fate of people is approached from a purely financial or technocratic aspect and the major objectives, the principles holding things in place, are forgotten."
"Jean Monnet, whom we revere as one of the fathers of post-war cooperation and who, even as an economist, did not dream of merely economic unity for Europe, said this at the time: 'We need true European efforts."
"The following ideas expressed by Jean Monnet are still relevant today, even though they were put into words sixty years ago: 'We are here to undertake a common task - not to negotiate for our own national advantage, but to seek it to the advantage of all."
"Only if we eliminate from our debates any particularist feelings shall we reach a solution."
"In so far as we, gathered here, can change our methods, the attitude of all Europeans will likewise gradually change'."
"More than six decades have elapsed since then."
"Do we, however, still take these thoughts which showed us the way seriously?"
"From the very beginning, this alliance was more than a community of coal and steel."
"Its founding fathers brought it to life as a pledge of peace, as a mission to create a strong Europe."
"I admit that it is not easy to find a common denominator for half a billion people in today's expanded Europe, a Europe with 27 Members States."
"I - if you allow me - see a special grace in the fact that Hungary could take over the mantle of the rotating Presidency precisely now amidst grave dilemmas, hard struggles and momentous issues, because it is at such times that there is the greatest need for the qualities which my country has."
"True, the battles of the present can never be fought for us by the spirit of our forebears."
"Nevertheless, we Hungarians can be rightly proud that, to quote the Hungarian composer, Ferenc Liszt, born 200 years ago, 'we are the sons of an inherently free people'."
"We live in a country which, thanks to Saint-King Stephen, was created as a tolerant, welcoming, multi-ethnic Christian community, has more than a thousand years of statehood, and has testified to its profound sense of freedom through revolutions."
"As Hungary's national holiday on 15 March is approaching, we must remember the many, many struggles of the Hungarians, such as the 1848 war of independence and revolution, and, to be sure, the 1956 revolution and fight for freedom, which some of you, many of you who are older, may remember, by dint of which we won ourselves a kind of right and respect here in Europe."
"Moreover, this never allowed us to forget fraternity and solidarity."
"We Hungarians have fought too much to be indifferent to the struggles of others and pass other people's problems by without a word."
"For this reason, we are watching with particular sensitivity all the events which are now unfolding to the south of us in the Arab world."
"We show understanding for people's desire for freedom, for a trait that no doubt lives in the heart of every person and every nation."
"It is no wonder, and actually not unexpected, that this has happened."
"The desire for freedom of any nation cannot be suppressed forever."
"Sooner or later, it will break loose."
"It is the European Union's common duty to protect the interests of its own citizens and to remain true to its humanitarian obligations."
"Through its own means, it must promote peaceful transition and - there, in the countries concerned - prosperity in one's native land."
"Ladies and gentlemen, or if I may so address you, colleagues and friends, as we are talking about solidarity, allow me to list a few of the concepts of the Schuman Plan, such as 'de facto solidarity', 'creative efforts', 'fusion of interest' and 'deeper community'."
"I sincerely believe that these terms, which we may come across in every EU document and every speech, have not lost their meaning."
"I am sure that these are profound emotions on which once European unity and post-war reconstruction could be built, and which eventually also brought the countries of Eastern and Central Europe oppressed by dictatorships back here, into this community."
"Every point in the Hungarian Presidency's programme sets these basic values as goals."
"Everything that we are planning and working for can be described by two words, two words that are often used but which have lost nothing of their power: responsibility and solidarity."
"Please allow me to expand on a few points."
"What do we mean by solidarity and responsibility?"
"Solidarity is required in financial affairs."
"We know that protecting the euro is the first of all our common tasks."
"This is a matter for all Member States, I repeat, all Member States, because the European Union's competitiveness is important for countries both within and outside the euro area, and it depends on us all jointly."
"Already now, Hungary is setting a good example by laying down a strong legal restraint on state indebtedness in the constitution which is being drafted."
"Hungary has decided to take serious measures to reduce expenditure in order to alleviate its current debts and bring its budget deficit below the European average."
"However, we respectfully expect the countries using the euro to regain confidence in the common currency."
"The introduction of the European semester serves the purpose of common competitiveness: it will enable Member States to inform each other of their budget plans prior to national approval and enable us to set country-specific targets."
"I personally would be delighted if it were introduced during the Hungarian Presidency and could even be called the Budapest semester."
"Please allow me to use the words of Jean Monnet again, who thought it was an important virtue and aim of community commitment that nations - to quote him - 'instead of confrontation, will let themselves be mutually influenced, and eventually pass naturally to dialogue, to common action'."
"I know that common action still has its moot points, but I sincerely hope that these will be clarified successfully before the economic and financial discussions due to be held soon."
"The magic word is prevention."
"This can help ensure that the financial crises of individual countries do not catch the European Union unawares and enables an appropriate reaction to these because it is easier to avoid a crisis than to recover from one."
"We must shoulder responsibility for closing the development gap."
"Even in a community of this size, solidarity can mean paying attention to the fate of individual people, on the one hand, and to that of smaller and larger communities, entire regions, on the other."
"The citizens of the European Union deserve equal opportunities."
"This can be promoted by good cohesion policy, the main cornerstones of which have already been successfully agreed."
"It is important that Europe should not be torn apart from the point of view of competitiveness either."
"Turning to solidarity and unity in the energy market, efforts to develop a single energy market are also closely linked to cohesion."
"They aim to reduce energy dependency and vulnerability and ensure the unrestricted flow of gas and electricity throughout Europe."
"The events in North Africa are also a reminder of how important it is to reduce unilateral dependence and to link up unconnected energy networks."
"Developments are needed for the completion of the single energy market, funds are needed for developments, and broad agreement is needed for finding the funds."
"Assuming responsibility is required at a macro-regional level as well."
"Just as the Barcelona Process in the southern part of Europe and the strategy for the Baltic Sea region in the northern half provide a framework to harmonise regional developments, now the countries of Central and Eastern Europe are seeking opportunities for more efficient cooperation as well."
"The strategy for the Danube region is taking shape through the participation of 14 countries in some 40 programmes, which is excellent evidence that being neighbours, frequently mentioned as a geographical constraint, can also be viewed as a geopolitical asset."
"We are very much looking forward to the Danube, as one of our natural bonds and the river of our eternal dependence on each other, helping us progress thanks to the strategy due to be adopted in June; helping us as a green corridor, as an economic potential, as the driving power of joint ventures, as a developing transportation route and, indeed, as a cultural connection."
"Hungary is acting as an initiator in devising the strategy and, as regards the practical tasks, is organising the work on common water management and environmental protection."
"We must accept responsibility on our borders."
"Europe must be able to react to rapid changes in the world."
"However, no change that is taking place justifies our acting against our own interests, running from one side of the ship to the other, thus only strengthening the effect of the none too light waves even more."
"I am aware that many people raise the issue of the southern and eastern neighbourhoods as a case of either/or, saying that the current situation dictates that we focus all our attention on the European Union's southern borders."
"However, we can only give good responses to changed situations - and we must admit that there will always be such changed situations - if we otherwise stand firm at all points of the compass."
"If the European Union forgets this, it acts against itself and weakens itself."
"Unexpected situations can always arise more easily wherever we do not keep abreast of affairs, and vice versa: every newly arising problem can be handled more easily wherever there are well-functioning relations."
"The Eastern Partnership is neither a Hungarian nor a Polish priority."
"Although this seems to appear to be our approach to the situation, it is far more common foresight."
"Nothing proves this more clearly than the fact that we will co-host the Eastern Partnership summit jointly with our Polish friends during their Presidency."
"We also need to talk about the solidarity which we need to show with those waiting for expansion."
"The alliance of states that founded the European Union has always kept its doors open, saying that any democratic country wishing to accede of its own free will which accepts the EU's basic principles may become a member of the community."
"On the one hand, this means that there are clear conditions to belonging to the alliance."
"On the other hand, this means that we also have a responsibility for countries outside the European Union, for all those states which consider membership to be their goal and are making serious efforts to achieve this."
"The ambition to accede deserves clear answers, clear requirements, and an obvious schedule and perspective for the countries of the Western Balkans, but also Turkey and Iceland."
"As regards responsibility for minorities, allow me to quote Article 3 of the Treaty of Lisbon: 'The Union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities'."
"Cultural diversity is indeed the essence of Europe, the source of its vitality."
"As a national declaration of this, in Hungary in the next national assembly - which, incidentally, will be halved in size from 2014 - all minorities within the country will have their own representation in parliament."
"How Hungary represents the fate of Hungarians living abroad is in complete accordance with the same principle."
"We are in an unusual situation."
"We have a constitutional obligation to defend the minority rights of indigenous Hungarian communities living in other countries, their right to use their own language and right of self-government."
"Could we call ourselves good Europeans if we did not do this?"
"It is precisely the European Union that provides us with a legal and intellectual framework where this issue is, in fact, no longer an issue."
"Now, at last, we have every chance of overcoming historic grievances - without mourning our geographical separation - and celebrating our spiritual and intellectual fellowship without any kind of territorial claim."
"We have even framed this in law."
"A state will become stronger and not weaker by granting rights to its minorities."
"By doing so, it will gain loyal, satisfied, self-respecting citizens, who - not inappreciably - enhance and add colour to diversity through their culture and traditions."
"Lastly, allow me to mention the Roma strategy, as Mr Buzek has already done so."
"The Hungarian Presidency regards tabling an effective and viable Roma strategy to the European Union as one of its most important tasks."
"Lívia Járóka has already done this."
"I am convinced that we need this common action plan."
"To eradicate poverty, however, in addition to social measures, the firm rejection of prejudices, and developing a supporting cultural and educational environment are indispensable."
"All this is not, first and foremost, a question of agreement and money, but of our humanity and ingenuity."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are well aware that the rotating Presidency is primarily always about taking current processes forward."
"Two apparently opposing characteristics are needed for this: humility and tenacity."
"Humility in common concerns and tenacity in representing them are the qualities that may lead to success."
"At the end of our term, the yardstick for us will be this: whether we have strayed from the designated path, or whether we have managed to guide the dialogue back to essential, substantial and constructive affairs."
"Therefore, the mission of our Presidency is to be the engine of the processes."
"Being a player in a team: this is also what the concept of the trio of presidencies represents."
"It is possible to produce a good individual performance but only if the service of the community, or rather team, interest remains paramount."
"Many things require reconsideration because it has become apparent that we did not build our new European life on sufficiently solid foundations."
"An era spent on seeking the way forward appears to be ending in Europe, too."
"I am inclined to think that I see a fortunate conjunction of the stars in this."
"Now the European Union has a President-in-Office which is a country making precisely the major structural changes that are also awaiting the EU."
"Large, poorly functioning systems believed to be unchangeable must be reorganised and reconsidered, and conditions better able to weather crises, which promote development and protect competitiveness, are needed."
"The fact that everything in Hungary today is about the need for change and renewal only makes us more receptive to shaping the common European future."
"Therefore, we have the experience which makes it clear that we must return to the effective representation of community interests."
"Hungarians expect their leaders and politicians - on whom, incidentally, sovereign power was conferred last year to an unprecedented extent in Europe - to provide a framework for a new life and express the fundamental principles for our future through strong laws and a worthy constitution, and will call them to account on this."
"Our guiding principle at all times is to enact laws which determine our future in accordance with EU standards, European tradition and civil liberties."
"The effective Hungarian constitution, if you will allow me to say a word about this, begins with the date 1949."
"This was the year when, in the more fortunate half of Europe, the idea of the common market had already come into being and its realisation was close at hand."
"In the same year, the Communist regime in Hungary expelled itself from Europe through show trials."
"The country lost its independence by being absorbed into the Soviet sphere of influence for decades."
"We were cut off from the real Europe, from the community to which we had always belonged through our traditions."
"Even the sun was blotted out from our vision."
"What a state built on lies could lose, the Hungarians preserved as a nation."
"This is why I feel that it is important and speaks volumes that the Hungarian constitution will bear the current year from now on."
"It will bear the year 2011, when, as a kind of gift of history, as a form of redress, we can hold the office of the Presidency of the European Union for the first time."
"This is the first time when we can really demonstrate our democratic commitment through a lot of work and also under peaceful, constructive circumstances and are able to place our Hungarian resolve at the service of the community."
"I believe that in the life of a nation, the right time for drafting a constitution always comes when it is strong enough to admit its past mistakes and advocate truths that will remain valid for many decades, and is sufficiently steadfast to see through what it has started."
"It is at least equally important that we build on European foundations."
"I guarantee and assure you that we will regard the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union as the standard for the chapter on human rights in the new Hungarian constitution."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am a fencer and it was in this discipline that I took part in the Olympics, so the metallic sound of the clash of swords is not unfamiliar to me."
"Nevertheless, I do not think that on the European political scene today, we should compete to see who can oust and triumph over the other by force."
"History has not given us a mandate merely to engage in political chess games and tactical prestige battles, but to serve a cause, to strengthen cohesion and seek consensus."
"Europeans need a successful, triumphant and strong Europe, a Europe that is equally founded on the community of interests and values, in which individual nations are also strong."
"The ambitious programme we call Europe 2020 is about precisely this."
"Ladies and gentlemen, please allow me to finish my speech with a thought of the deservedly popular Hungarian writer Sándor Márai, which is related to Europe. I quote: 'We need to build this way of life further."
"We need to fill it with everything that is modern and preserve in it everything that is timeless."
"We have everything that we need; all we need is faith and stubborn will, faith in our role and the will to fight against the tyranny of stupidity and temper."
"Where can a European start work?"
"Where can a Hungarian do so?"
"I think he has already started'."
"End of quote."
"All I can add to this is so be it."
"Thank you for listening."
"President Schmitt, those were important words, and your definition is very important."
"The European Parliament means not only simple legislation but the very soul of Europe."
"Quotations from Jean Monnet on the spirit of integration, dialogue and common activity, common actions, are very important for us."
"It is very important to remind us of the Schuman Plan: grounded on solidarity, first of all, at the beginning of the European Union and then in the 1990s; last century in Central and Eastern Europe, today on the financial markets and, in the very near future, in the Mediterranean region."
"Thank you for all your remarks on today's activities and today's challenges and threats facing the European Union."
"Thank you very much for your speech."
"We will remember your words and your remarks."
"(Applause)"

"This means that amendment 26 to paragraph 18 will be withdrawn by Ms Flautre."
"Therefore, I advise my group to vote in favour of amendment 29 to this paragraph."
"Mr President, I have an oral amendment to add in paragraph 18: 'is concerned by the lack of progress in these investigations and notes that the recent detention of well-known journalists such as Nedim Şener and Ahmet Şık might lead to a loss of credibility of these trials which should, on the contrary, strengthen democracy'."

"I apologise for this but we have to keep to the time."
"Voting time (continuation)"
"Voting time now continues."
"Explanations of vote"
"Oral explanations of vote"
"Mr President, I want to give an explanation of vote on the calendar for 2012."
"Of course, what we were voting on was utter nonsense, because it does not address the problem of the three different parliaments: Strasbourg, Brussels and, of course, Luxembourg, which everybody forgets about."
"The total combined costs, I believe, are something in the region of EUR 250 million per month."
"What I would like to do is to offer a constructive suggestion."
"Instead of meeting on twelve different occasions in Strasbourg, why do we not meet on twelve different sessions in Strasbourg in one week: first day - three sessions; second day - three sessions; third day - three sessions; fourth day - three sessions."
"That way, we only need to spend one week a year here."
"We can spend the rest of the time in Brussels if we have to, and we can save an enormous amount of cost and an enormous amount of inconvenience."
"Mr President, there is something extraordinary about the monthly peregrination of this Parliament between the two seats."
"We preach fiscal rectitude and yet we spend hundreds of millions of pounds a month on shifting our interpreters and our committee clerks and all the Members."
"We talk about global warming and yet we emit thousands of tonnes of greenhouse gases as fleets of lorries transport the necessary documentation back and forth."
"I know there is an argument that Members of this House make for the symbolic significance of Strasbourg and the historic idea, and so on, and I am rather attracted to the idea that the EU, as a club of nations, should share the institutions around rather than concentrating everything in Brussels."
"But let us have one seat, one way or the other."
"Why do we not simply put it to this House that we should meet either permanently here in this handsome Alsatian town or we should meet permanently in Brussels?"
"Either way, let us cut out the waste and let us, in this time of austerity, try and return some savings to our hard-pressed taxpayers."
"(FR) Mr President, the vote that has been cast, although a majority one, is, in fact, a move to undermine the letter of the Treaties, which is very clear and which stipulates that 12 part-sessions must be held in Strasbourg."
"In order to get rid of one of them, it is being claimed that two different part-sessions could be held in the same week."
"This is also a way of bypassing the very clear interpreting judgment that was delivered by the Court of Justice precisely when this House wanted to go from having 12 part-sessions to only 11."
"For 20 years, we have witnessed surreptitious moves to deprive Strasbourg of the seat of the European Union."
"It is true - and my fellow Members are right on this point - that the current situation is untenable, but we are not obliged to make Brussels the Washington DC of the European Union."
"We could have consolidated all of Parliament's activities in Strasbourg, but it would have taken something other than the French authorities' persistent negligence to do so."
"(DE) Mr President, what happened today was not a victory for the Brussels camp over the Strasbourg camp, as we also reduced the number of Brussels sittings by one."
"The score is therefore Brussels 1 Strasbourg 1."
"However, ladies and gentlemen, we voted against the law - the decision to hold the August and October plenary sessions in one week each is illegal, as the Treaty states that there must be monthly plenary sessions."
"Equally, this cannot be justified as a cost saving, as the costs - which, by the way, amount to EUR 70 million, which is plenty - do not arise as a result of Strasbourg, but rather because activities are continually being rerouted, contrary to the Treaty, into the shadows of Brussels' bureaucracy."
"Were we to concentrate our work in Strasbourg, we would both save money and have an independent democratic face in Europe!"
"(DE) Mr President, I asked to speak on the budget negotiations because I believe that the European Parliament does not always receive fair treatment in this connection."
"As MEPs, we, too, need to support economising, but it is also quite simply the case that we must fulfil our responsibilities properly."
"The proposed increase in the budget for the European Parliament, which is far below the rate of inflation, is thus not a reasonable one."
"It takes no account, for example, of the increase in the number of members of this House by 18, of the fact that we must fund the accession of Croatia, or of the other investments that we have to make."
"I assume that, ultimately, a sound compromise will be found on this issue."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as we all know, Turkey is a strategic partner for the European Union."
"Its location is crucial for the economic and political interests of the Union and gives it an important role in promoting European activities in the Black Sea area, as well as promoting peaceful relations in the Middle East."
"The 2010 report on the progress made in the negotiations for Turkey's accession to the European Union does, however, show the sluggishness of the process and the resistance of the political forces in Turkey to some of the fundamental provisions of the association agreement."
"Mr President, I do not believe that the Turkish authorities have made significant progress in terms of justice, fundamental rights, freedom of information, religious freedom and immigration, despite public pressure on these issues."
"The economic interests in the region cannot allow us to make concessions on fundamental rights and freedoms."
"Parliament's resolution looks at this situation with a determined approach, urging the Commission and the Council not to waste the positive results achieved since 2005 and, above all, not to void the existing bilateral agreement with the idea of a privileged partnership."
"My worry is that this partnership idea could compromise the acceleration of the accession process, which must remain our overall goal."
"(PL) Mr President, water covers the greater part of our globe."
"However, we do not very often appreciate the potential and significance of seas and oceans for economic development."
"The Atlantic region is particularly important for fishing, transport and energy."
"It is the source of almost 50% of the world's catches, as well as a variety of mineral deposits such as metals, oil and gas."
"Powerful climatic phenomena also occur there, and these can have catastrophic effects for coastal regions."
"Therefore, it is essential to draw up the right strategy for the Atlantic region - one which will enhance good management and contribute to protection of the environment and a better life for the people of the region."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, discussion of this resolution must be built around Directive 2008/56/EC, the so-called Marine Strategy Framework Directive."
"As my fellow Member who spoke earlier said, the context is the protection of the marine environment because the directive I mentioned sets out common principles on the basis of which the Member States must develop their own strategies together with third countries in order to achieve good environmental conditions in the marine waters for which they are responsible."
"This is the framework, therefore, on which the strategy for the Atlantic region ought to have been built, as well as on the basis of the indications of the Council of 14 June 2010, as noted by the Commissioner when speaking in this House."
"Instead, the resolution submitted for Parliament's vote lies outside this framework and proposes - quite apart from what came out of the consultations carried out by the Commission - a strategy for a macro-region, as well as dealing with territorial issues instead of marine issues."
"This direction brings forward a different decision."
"I hope that the communication from the Commission, in line with the advance statements in this House, bring the initiative back within the scope of the directive on the integrated maritime strategy which, as it stands, I support."
"That is why I abstained in the vote."
"(PL) Mr President, I was pleased to hear the result of the vote on the report on Turkey."
"I am certain that every effort which aims to transform Turkey into a fully fledged pluralistic democracy with the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms at its heart is deserving of support."
"Recent years have shown that Turkey's efforts to become one of the European Union's Member States are having positive effects."
"The Union's Member States should continue to support Turkey in the reforms it is undertaking. It is necessary to concentrate, in particular, on the most problematic issues, such as constitutional reform, freedom of the press, women's rights and the protection of national minorities."
"I would also like to draw attention to the problem of implementation of the Additional Protocol to the EC-Turkey Association Agreement."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the resolution on Turkey because the constitutional reform that took place 12 September last was unanimously recognised as an important step forward made by Turkey in relation to Europe."
"Naturally, there are still many more steps to be taken and in this vein, I would express my concern over the numerous arrests of journalists."
"I would like to underline that Turkey is the seventh largest commercial partner of the European Union, that the European Union is Turkey's main commercial partner, and that trade - which has been carried out correctly for centuries - has favoured interpenetration and the peaceful acquaintance of one people with another."
"I therefore applaud the notable progress made in terms of getting started on connections between the European Union and Turkey, in particular, through the motorways of the sea that cross the northern Adriatic and the northern Tyrrhenian seas, which now see a flow of more than 250 000 truckloads per year in both directions, together with an important heavy-goods railway freight link from ports to destinations within Europe."
"In this way, it was possible to get rid of a significant amount of heavy goods vehicles on the road and I hope that this continues."
"(PL) Mr President, Turkey is an important neighbour of the European Union, and the report which has been submitted for 2010 highlights significant changes which have taken place there."
"There is no doubt that the constitutional changes make a great impression, and they make a fundamental contribution to the democratisation of life in Turkey."
"There are, however, areas in which we should like to see greater progress."
"A basic matter here is, of course, the fostering of relations with neighbours."
"Without a solution to the Cyprus issue, all other issues will be at a permanent impasse."
"The situation is similar when we look at civil liberties, including religious freedom."
"I hope the conclusions of the report will allow progress to be achieved in Turkey, and a recognition that the country is changing not only in economic terms but also in matters which are important from the point of view of civil rights and freedom."
"(PL) Mr President, as a member of last year's parliamentary delegation to Turkey, I had the opportunity to see for myself the progress Turkey is making in the process of integration with the European Union."
"We should certainly take a positive view of the way the Turkish authorities have dealt with issues related to religious freedom, women's rights, trade union rights, judicial reform, revision of radio and TV legislation and improvements in civil-military relations."
"I agree, too, that it is essential to improve relations between the government and the opposition, to respect freedom of the media, including the Internet, to make improvements in the area of civil rights and the right of freedom of assembly and to carry out a thorough reform of the electoral system."
"Another disturbing matter is the increasing problem of domestic violence and so-called honour killings."
"Particular attention should be given to the questions of opening the border between Turkey and Armenia and support for negotiations on stabilising the situation in Cyprus."
"I support the resolution, because I think that enlargement of the EU to include Turkey is in the interest of particular EU Member States, including Poland."
"(DE) Mr President, I abstained from voting on the progress report on Turkey, but not because I do not agree with its analysis - despite some reforms, the criticism of press censorship, violations of human rights, the Turkish electoral system and the freedom of religion do speak for themselves."
"The reason I abstained from voting was that I believe that the European Parliament must be much clearer in its response."
"If Turkey refuses to make crucial reforms, we must bring a halt to negotiations on membership."
"It is time that this House called for the cessation of accession negotiations."
"(FI) Mr President, it is absolutely true that Turkey has made progress in recent years, but when we look at the Copenhagen criteria for membership of the European Union, Turkey still has a long way to go."
"We might predict that Turkey's accession to the European Union will not happen in our lifetime."
"Specifically, there is still a long way to go regarding the basic assumption that we make about human rights and the rights of women and children."
"These, however, lie very much at the heart of this European Union and community of values."
"It is also very important to consider the situation in Cyprus."
"If Turkey wants to occupy half of Cyprus, which is a Member State of the European Union, we obviously have to be tough with them on that."
"We cannot accept a situation of this sort, where Turkey is at present playing two different games and following two agendas."
"In this matter, we should encourage them to develop democratically but say very clearly that the European Union will not give up its values, and ensure that that is the case."
"Mr President, the EU's attitude to Turkey will one day be regarded as a generational error, as an ethical mistake."
"We could have reasonably pursued one of two policies."
"Either we could have worked with goodwill towards eventual accession, or we could have said at the outset 'look, accession is not going to happen, let us work out an alternative arrangement'."
"Instead, we have held out the promise of eventual accession with our fingers crossed behind our backs."
"We have made promises which we have no intention of fulfilling."
"Now, look at it from Ankara's point of view."
"Would they have made a series of difficult and painful concessions on broadcasting, on secularism, on Cyprus, above all, where Turkish Cypriots voted in favour of the EU plan and where isolated Greek Cypriots rejected it and were rewarded?"
"We have made them grovel about the Armenian massacres, we have imposed tens of thousands of pages of the acquis communautaire on them, and then at the end of this process, we are going to turn around and flick two fingers at them!"
"We risk creating the very thing we purport to fear: namely, an alienated and anti-Western state on our doorstep."
"Turks defended Europe's flank against Bolshevik expansionism for 50 years."
"We may one day ask them to do the same against Jihadi extremism."
"They deserve better than this."
"(DE) Mr President, though I share Mr Pieper's concerns, I voted in favour of this report, as we have stated quite clearly once again - at the beginning of the report - that, for us, the negotiations are a long process with no predetermined result."
"We rejected the motion by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, which sought to specify accession, as we did similar motions by the Socialists in previous years."
"This House therefore found the right line."
"We should take the next step soon, however, and tell Turkey quite honestly, as Mr Pieper said, that as far as we are concerned Turkish accession is simply out of the question as it would overburden Turkey and overstretch the European Union."
"A politically integrated Europe including Turkey as a member is not possible."
"It is a grand delusion that we must finally step away from."
"As for the progress in question, it is in the interests of Turkey itself, a country that is a member of the Council of Europe and NATO and our closest ally."
"(PL) Mr President, I would like to refer to the discussion which took place in this Chamber on the integration of Montenegro into the European Union."
"During the discussion, I asked the representative of the Commission and the Council for a timetable for this process and to say when Montenegro can become a fully fledged candidate for EU membership."
"Unfortunately, I did not receive an answer to that specific question."
"Despite this, I voted for Parliament to adopt the resolution, because I think there are important reasons why we should do so."
"Firstly, it is a resolution which is important for Croatia."
"Secondly, it is a signpost for other countries which are today part of the Balkans."
"However, I think there is a third, very important reason: it is a positive resolution and one which shows that the Union's values are still attractive."
"(DE) Mr President, when it comes to enlargement policy, we need something along the lines of a regulatory framework."
"We must, therefore, complete the negotiations with Croatia by June, as planned, and then get the accession process for that country under way in the autumn with our vote."
"We want Croatia to be in the European Union by next year or, at the latest, the year after that."
"Things have to go on then, too, but how?"
"We need to integrate the small but difficult remainder of South-Eastern Europe."
"First of all, there is Macedonia, and then Montenegro."
"This is a signal to all the other States in the region that, if they fulfil the criteria, they too have a place in our ranks."
"Unlike Turkey, these are European States to the core, and as such, they naturally have a future within our Community."
"Montenegro, in particular, is a small country with a major European tradition."
"I look forward already to the negotiations with Montenegro!"
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is still much to be done in the field of combating discrimination in Europe."
"I agree with the rapporteur, Mrs Járóka, when she states that even if discrimination based on ethnicity could now be considered eliminated, the socio-economic exclusion of most Roma continues and remains one of the greatest challenges that we shall be called to deal with in the coming years."
"This is down to a whole series of specific factors, such as geographical disadvantages, deficient education or the collapse of planned economies attracting a large and low-skilled labour force."
"A strategy to improve their socio-economic inclusion will not compromise anti-discrimination laws in any way, rather, it would complement them."
"A significant proportion of European Roma face such precarious and unfavourable conditions that measures aimed at fostering social inclusion must be thought of as bridging one of the largest gaps in the fulfilment of constitutional and human rights in Europe."
"(DA) Mr President, it is always an emotional debate when we discuss the Roma here in Parliament."
"There is one group that believes we should not actually do anything - it does not concern the European Union - and then there is another group that believes that we cannot pay out enough money, even if it is not well spent."
"None of the approaches to this problem are particularly serviceable and, in any case, we are simply not solving the Roma's problems."
"It is therefore good that we have this report."
"It is good because we have now taken a decision to look at the results that have been achieved as a result of the considerable funds that we have already allocated to the integration of the Roma."
"We need to see which projects have been beneficial for integration before we can set a proper strategy, thereby ensuring that the money is well spent."
"The Danish Liberal Party has therefore voted in favour of this report."
"It is moving in the right direction for the Roma. Thank you, Mr President."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with today's adoption of the own-initiative report, Parliament has made real progress towards the proper inclusion of Roma in the communities that host them."
"Overcoming the marginalisation of Roma communities by fully recognising their fundamental rights to healthcare, education and the protection of vulnerable groups is absolutely incumbent upon us."
"We also welcome better coordination with local and regional bodies as well as the improvement of the part of the text providing for concrete checks on the consistency and effectiveness of financing compared to the expected result, together with the part that introduces award criteria for Member States that guarantee appropriate use of the resources granted."
"However, more could probably have been done with regard to the recognition of reciprocal rights and duties because it is essential to keep in mind the joint responsibility of Roma communities for their effective inclusion."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we all agree on the need for a European strategy for the integration of Roma and, of course, possible discrimination against them should not be underestimated, but rights cannot exist without duties and integration cannot exist without legality."
"Shockingly unhygienic illegal slums, a huge school dropout rate, illegal activities such as theft, receiving stolen goods, women and children being led into prostitution, begging, refusal of all offers of integration and job support proposed by local authorities: this is the reality of many Roma communities in my country and in other European countries."
"It is a bit hypocritical to say that responsibility always and only lies with institutions and never with those who have chosen to inflict this behaviour on society."
"Lastly, I regret that this text fails to make reference to the correct implementation of Directive 2004/38/EC, which sets out stringent requirements for European citizens residing in another Member State and their expulsion for public safety reasons."
"For these reasons, I voted against the rest of my group."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report by Mrs Járóka takes on particular importance at this time and - together with the communication that the Commission is on the brink of adopting - will constitute the basis for further discussions at the European Roma Platform, scheduled to take place in Budapest on 7 and 8 April"
"I support the call for the introduction of binding minimum standards across the European Union in the education, employment, housing and health sectors."
"In particular, I think greater attention should be paid to primary education, which is crucial for the full integration of the Roma minority."
"The firm appeal made by France, Romania, Bulgaria and Finland to the European Commission is certainly to be welcomed."
"The Commission does, however, need to take greater responsibility for an active, strategic and leading role in developing the implementation of an effective Roma inclusion strategy."
"The need to identify specific duties that the nomadic communities must assume is clear."
"Mr President, my group supports this report because it is a move in the right direction, calling for an EU strategy and a road map for Roma inclusion."
"The report is inspired by a keen perception of the extremely heterogeneous cultural aspects between different Roma communities in Europe."
"At the same time, it advocates the introduction of binding and minimum standards at EU level for starting a real policy of integration."
"The EU strategy addresses all forms of violation of the fundamental rights of the Roma people and calls for effective access for the Roma to the labour market by making micro-credit available for self-employment and entrepreneurship."
"My group particularly appreciates the stress on the education of Roma children, namely, the abolition of classroom segregation through the employment of Roma mediators and an increase in the number of Roma teachers."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this important own-initiative report forcefully affirms the need to set out a European strategy for the social inclusion of Roma."
"Indeed, we need to fight economic and social discrimination against European Roma, which has increased as a result of the current economic crisis."
"The European Union must develop a new legal framework and avoid continuing to deal with this problem through non-binding legislation, as this is insufficient and not suitable for achieving the goal in question."
"It is equally important to maintain the Roma task force as a permanent organisation and to start thinking about a mechanism for this issue which would be similar to the one used to assess the internal market."
"Lastly, Europe must make every effort to guarantee its citizens - and particularly the most vulnerable groups - protection of all human rights related to human dignity."
"In the end, the overall inclusion of Roma is essentially a question of fundamental rights, even if we have to ask the Roma communities to try and integrate and not to close themselves in their own world where they do not respect European and national laws."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with today's vote, we have given a further boost to the - how should I put it - definitive solution to this problem, but we have not adopted the best possible solution."
"Indeed, I should like to point out that the more than 300 amendments presented on the reports have been transformed into 38 compromise amendments - all of which were adopted - that aim to better define the priority sectors of the strategy, which is to say, the objectives of this strategy."
"Through the permanent task force, the Commission will have to ensure the collection and circulation of statistical data and good practices, and the Member States will have to appoint a government official - hopefully a high-level one - who will act as a point of contact for the implementation of the strategy."
"However, we could have been even more incisive and less hypocritical if, in the report, we had looked at the obligations and duties that the Roma community ought in any case to respect in their host countries."
"That is what I am hoping for, namely, that we will soon find the solutions that will enable this community to coexist more easily in all Member States."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, no more children who do not go to school, no more children forced into begging or being exploited."
"These are just a couple of the aims of the report by Mrs Járóka, which represents an important political response."
"Besides declarations of principle, we are awaiting the Commission's proposal - expected in April - so that there can be clearer and more shared responsibility and cooperation on Roma policies between the Member States and European institutions."
"The aim must be to use the resources available as efficiently as possible, beginning with European funds and avoiding local administrations having to take on all the problems and dealing with constant emergencies."
"Lastly, I hope that a debate is opened up over Directive 2004/38/EC, which sets out specific conditions - i.e. work, sufficient economic resources and health insurance - to retain the right to reside, but which simultaneously leaves a number of gaps in terms of what happens if these requirements are not fulfilled."
"This inadequacy needs to be rectified as soon as possible."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of this report and I should like to offer my congratulations to Mrs Járóka for the work she has done."
"She managed to bring together the different positions and establish clear objectives and priorities for the strategy; namely, the provision of specific measures against nomadic lifestyles, guarantees on basic healthcare, equal access to primary, secondary and higher education, and the right to housing."
"The strategy actually aims at inclusion and not merely integration."
"It is obvious that the role of the Commission and local authorities will be crucial, above all, in terms of controlling and managing European Union funds."
"The only limitation of this report is the lack of instruments to check the actual desire for integration amongst some Roma communities and the consequences that are likely to stem from any unwillingness to remain on the territory of a Member State or participate in the treatments, and the aid and welfare programmes, which certainly cannot continue ad infinitum without producing results."
"(FI) Mr President, I gave my vote to Mrs Járóka's report, but I want to explain my position in a little more detail."
"The Roma question is a paradoxical one for Europe in many senses."
"It challenges the fundamental values and ideals of the European Union in practice, but, on the other hand, it is born out of one basic right, freedom of movement, which is a traditional way of living for one nation."
"There are Roma in Finland too; there, the problem is mainly the low standard of education and consequent unemployment."
"That is why we need to invest in education in particular."
"Soft law is no longer enough, and soft measures are not either."
"We need consistent legislation and practical measures that are binding on everyone."
"All the Member States and EU institutions are responsible for this."
"Kali sarakosti: Happy Lent to you all."
"(SK) Mr President, we are talking about Roma integration issues."
"The Roma live in many European countries - both Western and Eastern countries."
"It is interesting to note that, although freedom and democracy have been established in Western European countries for longer than in Central and Eastern countries, among which is my own country as well as our neighbours in Hungary, we see similar problems both in the West and in the East."
"We have not yet overcome these differences."
"There is talk of an integration of the Roma population aimed at making them successful on the labour market, and healthier as a population."
"According to the laws currently in force, access to education and healthcare is guaranteed everywhere, and it is just sad that the Roma population often do not send their children to school to be educated."
"(FI) Mr President, efharisto, thank you."
"This report by Mrs Járóka is an excellent one."
"I think that everyone in this House will share the view that it really is time to take action at European Union level to ensure that everybody enjoys equal human rights."
"For, unfortunately, they have not been implemented as far as the Roma are concerned."
"It is not enough to have a good report: we also need action."
"Now is the time to ask a fundamental question."
"How do we move forward from here, to prevent this report from merely remaining a naïve dream or a mixture of different opinions, and to allow it to work in practice so that we can see the status of the Roma improve significantly in the European Union?"
"It is also very important to organise followup for this report."
"Perhaps we need an ombudsman for Roma affairs at EU level, someone to report on the measures that we have decided on and ensure that they will indeed work in practice."
"This is the way to tackle this issue properly and successfully."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the recent and profound economic crisis that has hit European industry has simultaneously highlighted its importance for the European Union's economy."
"Indeed, the European economy has often been focused on the idea that the markets ought to regulate themselves and so far, this has mostly been achieved through individual measures with practically no coordination between Member States."
"However, the Europe 2020 strategy recognises for the first time the need for a new approach with a flagship initiative."
"It is time for the European Union to fully exploit the shared opportunities for the sustainable renewal and further development of the industrial base, with good quality jobs."
"European industry ought to maintain its leadership in key sectors and not find itself bringing up the rear."
"It is time for the Union to choose its path for the industry of the future."
"We must make sure that our European market creates its own added value."
"For this purpose, clear macro-economic coordination of economic, fiscal and budgetary policies is essential for growth and employment, for example, through the fiscal harmonisation of corporation tax."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report by Mr Lange tackles a very topical problem: reacting to the economic and financial crisis that has seriously hit our productive system."
"I think the response contained in this resolution is extremely positive, because it manages to bring together the variables required to build a good economic revival plan."
"The idea of concentrating on research and innovation, bearing in mind the size of our entrepreneurial fabric is very important and I think it gives a useful shot in the arm to the perhaps slightly more conservative stance of the Commission."
"I appreciate the work of the rapporteur, Mr Lange, who has managed to integrate more than 500 amendments, bringing in a resolution that overall makes a huge contribution to our work. What emerges is a targeted industrial policy in European terms, which encompasses the various sectors and is participatory, given the use of monitoring models from both above and below."
"One controversial point remains: the European patent."
"I maintain my complete opposition on this issue, but this has not prevented me from voting in favour of what is a very positive report."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report shines a light on many positive aspects and mirrors the considerations and requirements expressed by the various national associations."
"Therefore, I cannot but support the overall spirit of Mr Lange's report."
"However, some critical issues were not addressed or resolved, such as the request for new legislative measures on resource efficiency and, above all, the issue of enhanced cooperation on patents."
"It is now imperative to tackle the question of European provisions on origin marking, which, in my opinion, is an indispensable tool to strengthen and improve European industry and its competitiveness."
"I voted in favour of the report by Mr Lange because I hope that adopting this report will prompt all the institutions to work to implement the ambitious programme set out, translating it into practical policies."
"(PL) Mr President, industry is developing around the world at an extraordinary speed."
"In order not to fall behind China or India, we need immediate change."
"Europe, which is small by comparison, should, however, offer the world more than simply more toxic factories, so I think it is right to invest in new technologies, the development of medicine and pharmacology and innovative solutions in areas which we already know well, including agriculture."
"I am not thinking of huge livestock farms, but of the creation of new solutions which make it easier to grow crops, raise animals and produce healthy and ecological food, as well as to obtain energy from alternative sources."
"It is just such investments which today's economy needs."
"Innovative solutions are also an answer to the demographic changes taking place in an ageing Europe. Thank you."
"(SK) Mr President, industrial policy must, as part of economic policy, aim for sustainable growth, higher employment and a decent quality of life for all Europeans."
"European industry is facing powerful competitive pressure from developing countries."
"The Union must therefore maintain a proactive policy in order to sustain and strengthen European industry as the driving force of economic growth."
"A functional internal market must be adequately secured by negotiating favourable conditions in trade agreements with third countries, but also by means of protection against unfair competition and infringements of competition and intellectual and industrial property rights by third countries."
"The EU has great potential for securing a competitive advantage in the area of highly qualified human resources and the creation of innovative technologies, which is necessarily linked to further investment in research and development."
"(PL) Mr President, industrial products account for nearly three quarters of European exports and give work to 57 million citizens, not including extra jobs in related services."
"Industry therefore has enormous significance for our economy and affects all of the economy's other sectors."
"As we learn the lessons of the recent economic crisis and the growing competition in world markets, it is essential to take what action is necessary to maintain the strong position of European industry and also to continue its systematic development."
"Here, the Europe 2020 strategy seems to be an attempt at a new approach, one which makes full use of opportunities for sustainable modernisation and development of the industrial base of Member States while also ensuring a high quality of work."
"This creates an opportunity for Europe to maintain its position as a leader in key sectors of the economy."
"The integrated industrial policy, which is intended to bring about a gradual and sustainable transition from a mainly productive towards a knowledge-based industry, looks particularly promising."
"Therefore, I fully support the resolution."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it would be inconceivable for a sector that accounts for 57 million jobs across the European Union, three quarters of European exports of industrial goods, and roughly one third of gross value added in the European Union, to be left without support from appropriate sectoral policies targeted at growth and development."
"There can be no competitive commercial policy without innovative, good quality industrial production."
"I would reiterate the suggestions made by the Committee on International Trade, and particularly those that emphasise the importance of an effective trade protection system, making use of the instruments provided where necessary."
"Defending the Union's interests in future negotiations, so as to protect industry and employment, is an unavoidable necessity to help overcome the crisis and ensure that, along with the manufacturing sector, the real economy takes precedence over the financial economy, avoiding those speculative bubbles that caused so much disaster."
"(DE) Mr President, I consider it to be very important that we should be able to debate this report and also to vote on it today."
"It would be best, of course, if crises simply did not occur, but it would be worse if no lessons were learnt from crises when they do occur."
"It is precisely because we learnt from the last crisis that we are getting involved in industrial policy in the European Union again, especially as, before the last crisis, there were quite a large number of people who believed that money could be easily earned with money."
"Economic and industrial policy, after all, is critical to our prosperity in the European Union."
"I therefore believe it is extraordinarily important that we have engaged on this issue."
"It is a good thing, of course, to be involved in innovation and future-oriented industrial policy, but I think it is just as important that we have emphasised our traditional industry in this report."
"I am very pleased by this and I hope that we will continue to discuss this issue."
"(GA) Mr President, I voted in favour of this excellent report and indeed it was time for us to focus on industrial policy for the European Union."
"There is no doubt that we have fallen behind in recent years compared to the major countries of the world, but I hope that we will forge ahead in the future."
"Mr President, having indicated my support for the document, I want to express my concern at one item in the explanatory statement, where, on page 32, it calls for the harmonisation of company tax."
"Now that is something my country would not agree with."
"Company tax or corporation tax is very important to us and it is up to each country to set its own rate."
"Indeed, it is well known that some countries allegedly have a high corporation tax but, in reality, they pay far less."
"(GA) Be that as it may, this is a fine report and I am very happy to support it."
"(PL) Mr President, the resolution which is the product of the debate on the real economy is most deserving of support."
"The recent period has been characterised, above all, by the challenge which globalisation has presented to European industrial policy and real production in Europe."
"How the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy can be achieved, in particular, those of job creation and resisting delocalisation of industrial policy, is a fundamental question which was discussed during the debate on the subject of the resolution."
"In answer to the question as to whether Europe has to lose traditional industries, it can be answered that this does not have to happen, and this was also demonstrated by the debate on small and medium-sized enterprises which was held during the last part-session."
"The availability of, among other things, raw materials, including raw materials for power generation, is a serious challenge."
"We have to devote much attention to innovations and to using the results of scientific research in industry."
"Another important task is to make use of the synergies which exist between different areas of European Union policy, including between industrial/agricultural policy, for example, and commercial policy. Thank you."
"(ES) Mr President, I voted for this initiative because the European Union has to make a firm commitment to industrial policy and face up to the risks of the crisis, to competition from third countries, and to globalisation with increased public funding that is reflected in the future framework programme."
"Why is that?"
"For the purposes of research and development activity."
"To boost private investment and encourage the public and private sectors to work together."
"This will enable us to create skilled jobs."
"However, we need to make use of the scientific and technological skills of the regions, which have developed innovation networks and competitiveness clusters, and whose innovation and effectiveness exceeds those of their countries."
"That is the case with Euskadi, the Basque Country."
"Make use of the regions' knowledge."
"Do not live your lives blind to this European reality, because acknowledging it and taking it on board will enable us to consolidate our leading position in industrial policy in the face of the current threats."
"Written explanations of vote"
"in writing. - I would ask fellow MEPs to imagine for a moment that they are in business."
"You currently have two factories, but by having only one factory, you could increase productivity while reducing costs by £150 million and protecting the environment."
"It is what your shareholders want."
"What businessman in his right mind would keep two factories?"
"Yet, fellow MEPs, we are actually in business, the business of government and, crucially, of overseeing the spending of our constituents' - our shareholders' - money."
"We waste £150 million each year by having 11 sessions here in Strasbourg."
"In a house that obsesses with green policy, some choose to needlessly pump 20 000 tonnes of carbon monoxide into the environment."
"I commend Mr Fox on his work to at least bring some modicum of common sense in 2012 and 2013."
"I voted for Amendment 1 to the draft of the European Parliament's calendar of part-sessions for 2012 and 2013."
"Despite the fact that I understand the symbolic nature of plenary part-sessions held at the Strasbourg seat of Parliament, given the current critical financial situation in Europe, we need to look for savings, and this is what this amendment means."
"Holding two part-sessions in one week is, above all, a gesture to European citizens, because it is their taxes which are used to pay for the expensive and time-consuming journeys not only of Members, but also of officials and assistants."
"in writing. - I voted for Amendment 1, which deletes the part-session proposed for week 40 in 2012."
"I see this as a small step in cutting the waste involved in travelling from Brussels to Strasbourg."
"in writing. - As one of the co-signatories of the key amendment, I am glad it has been adopted."
"The calendar of part-sessions for 2012 should now be amended as follows: delete the part-session proposed for week 40 (1 to 4 October); split the October II part-session (22 to 25 October) into two separate part-sessions: part-session 1: 22 and 23 October; part-session 2: 25 and 26 October."
"The outcome of this vote sets a fundamental precedent along the road which I hope will one day lead to the concentration of all of Parliament's activities in a single place."
"Actually, I think we can no longer tolerate the waste of public resources and atmospheric pollution caused by the dual location of Parliament, which each month forces thousands of people to make long and difficult trips between Brussels and Strasbourg."
"Putting the two October plenary sessions together in the 2012 official calendar sends a very strong signal and I am optimistic that the path we have taken is more honest and in tune with citizens' wishes."
"I rejected these amendments and will be instituting infringement proceedings at the European Court of Justice along with my colleague, Mr Posselt."
"in writing. - According to European law, 12 plenary sessions must take place every year at the Strasbourg seat of the European Parliament."
"The vote on changing the calendar to allow two of these Strasbourg sessions to take place within the same week reflects our desire as MEPs to cut costs and CO2 emissions."
"Travelling to Strasbourg is expensive and the increased travel causes extra CO2 emissions."
"I therefore support this report, which will enable us to hold the required 12 plenary sessions in 11 weeks, thus cutting the cost and environmental impact of our work."
"As an MEP, I wish to represent the best interests, economically and environmentally, of my constituents."
"I also call on the UK Government to raise the issue with other Member States, as it is the Council's responsibility."
"I voted for Amendment 1, which proposed combining the two October part-sessions and holding them in the same week in the European Parliament's session for 2012."
"I am opposed to organising the work of Parliament by splitting it across three locations."
"The amendment means that both time and money will be saved, and thousands fewer tonnes of CO2 will be released into the atmosphere."
"Savings have to be made - the amendment means that not only MEPs, but also several thousand European Parliament officials who normally work in Brussels, as well as journalists, lobbyists and staff of the European Commission and of the administrations of different Member States, will travel to Strasbourg 11 times instead of 12."
"This will reduce the costs of transport, expense allowances, hotels, etc."
"in writing. - Today, Parliament voted on its calendar for 2012 and 2013."
"For the first time in my experience as an MEP, the amendments were approved by the majority."
"This means that MEPs will not have to move to Strasbourg 12 times a year, but 11 times to incorporate 12 sessions in Strasbourg."
"The monthly 'travelling circus' from Brussels to Strasbourg has become synonymous with waste, both in terms of the EUR 200 million spent on it, and the 20 000 tonnes of CO2 emitted."
"MEPs cannot decide where they sit but they do have the power to decide how many times Parliament must relocate from one city to the other."
"Around 350 MEPs supported the amendment that would sandwich two of our sessions into one week, thus saving the costs, time and energy of the return journeys."
"It will also send a positive signal to our electorate."
"I also hope that this will serve for an eventual calendar in which 12 sessions will be held in 6 weeks."
"I disagree, however, that the calendar of 2013 was put to vote together in this plenary."
"It is clearly a manoeuvre not to further extend this procedure during this legislature."
"During the vote on Parliament's calendar of part-sessions for 2012 and 2013, 58% of MEPs approved an amendment abolishing one of the two October part-sessions held in Strasbourg."
"That amendment is quite simply a violation of the Treaties!"
"The Treaties designate Strasbourg as the seat of Parliament and stipulate that 12 part-sessions must be held there annually."
"Two part-sessions are held in October to catch up on the work that is not carried out in August."
"Outside these part-sessions in Strasbourg, meetings of the parliamentary committees and additional part-sessions are held in Brussels."
"In 1997, the Court of Justice clearly established the principle that the European Parliament must meet every month in Strasbourg."
"The Treaties leave no room for doubt: Strasbourg is not the second seat of the European Parliament; it is the institution's only seat."
"The anti-Strasbourg group is becoming organised and flexing its muscles more and more, in an attempt to make people believe that Parliament is unanimously against Strasbourg."
"The supporters of the Alsace seat must speak out more."
"They have the legitimacy of the law and of 50 years' history of European integration on their side."
"in writing. - I voted to change the 2012 calendar to save taxpayers' money, to save CO2 emissions and to lessen the disruption to Parliament business by the monthly trip to Strasbourg."
"The European Treaties explicitly state that Strasbourg shall be the only seat of the European Parliament, and that 12 part-sessions shall be held there annually."
"However, a vote was held this week with a view to merging two Strasbourg part-sessions in the same week, in October 2012 and October 2013."
"The democrat MEPs voted against that decision."
"France, for its part, has already announced that it will shortly refer the matter to the Court of Justice of the European Union."
"Indeed, the decision taken is in flagrant breach of the spirit and the letter of the Treaties, since it should be remembered that the provisions of the texts may be amended only upon a unanimous decision by the Member States."
"We voted this week on the European Parliament's calendar of part-sessions for 2012 and 2013."
"To my great regret, a majority of MEPs voted in favour of an amendment (to which I was strongly opposed) merging the two October part-sessions into one, in the same week."
"As far as I am concerned, this vote completely contradicts the spirit of the EU Treaties, which explicitly state that Strasbourg shall be the seat of the European Parliament and that 12 part-sessions shall be held there annually."
"The debate on the location of the European Parliament's seat resurfaces all the time, and this is a fresh attack today on the European Parliament's seat in Strasbourg."
"However, the Strasbourg seat has historical references and is referred to in legal texts, and it should not be called into question by these multiple attacks."
"France recently announced that it was referring the matter to the Court of Justice of the European Union, a move which I would like to applaud and which I will support."
"I voted in favour of the changes to Parliament's official calendar for 2012, because I think it is right to try and limit wastage of economic and other resources as we carry out our parliamentary duties."
"The decision to hold the two October plenary sessions in the same week actually means we can avoid a double journey to Strasbourg, with all that this entails in terms of resource saving."
"In the end, I think this decision is in line with what already happens, with the concentration of the two plenary sessions in September."
"I voted in favour of the proposed changes to Parliament's calendar of plenary sessions for 2012 and 2013 because I think that, even fully respecting the Treaties, it is, in any case, possible to bring two part-sessions of Parliament together in a single week, avoiding going over to Strasbourg twice in the same month."
"This will allow us to cut down the costs of the European institutions and avoid wasting time and money."
"This will require greater effort in terms of organising proceedings, both by myself and my fellow Members, but it will show the public a greater commitment to avoiding the senseless waste of public money."
"in writing. - I believe that holding two separate plenary sessions in October is unnecessary."
"The EU Treaties require Parliament to hold 12 sessions in Strasbourg each year."
"However, they allow for two sessions to be held in the one week."
"By stopping the practice of travelling to Strasbourg twice in one month, the Parliament can set an example in reducing its CO2 emissions and saving public money."
"in writing. - I voted for Amendment 1 which deleted the part-session proposed for week 40 in 2013."
"As with the decision on the 2012 calendar, this is a contribution to cutting Parliament's costs."
"in writing. - As one of the co-signatories of the key amendment, I am glad it has been adopted."
"The calendar of part-sessions for 2013 should now be amended as follows: delete the part-session proposed for week 40 (30 Sep to 3 Oct); split the October II part-session (21 to 24 October) into two separate part-sessions: part-session 1: 21 and 22 October; part-session 2: 24 and 25 October."
"The outcome of this vote sets a fundamental precedent along the road which I hope will one day lead to the concentration of all of Parliament's activities in a single place."
"Actually, I think we can no longer tolerate the waste of public resources and atmospheric pollution caused by the dual location of Parliament, which each month forces thousands of people to make long and difficult trips between Brussels and Strasbourg."
"Putting the two October plenary sessions together in the 2013 official calendar sends a very strong signal and I am optimistic that the path we have taken is more just and in tune with citizens' wishes."
"I rejected these amendments and will be instituting infringement proceedings at the European Court of Justice."
"The Conference of Presidents should not have allowed this motion to go to a vote."
"I voted for this report, which respects the principle that the institutions should have sufficient resources to be managed rigorously and efficiently."
"At a time of economic and financial crisis in Europe, when the public are obliged to cut back on their personal expenditure, both the EU and national institutions should follow suit."
"This should not, however, prevent the necessary public investment which translates into medium- and long-term gain."
"I would stress that the impact of the Treaty of Lisbon's entry into force in heading 5 should become stable in 2012, although the accession of Croatia planned for 2013 will have an impact on the 2012 budget."
"Faced with the present situation, some institutions may have some difficulties in maintaining a balanced budget."
"For this to be successful, I agree with the good management measures relating to administrative resources and cost reduction plans, whilst adapting efficient and environmentally friendly technologies."
"Finally, Parliament cannot jeopardise the necessary conditions for giving all the Member States sound working conditions, on an equal footing."
"in writing. - I voted against the Fernandes report on budget priorities for 2012 because the European Parliament is still going to look for a 5% increase in its budget even though the rest of the European institutions will confine themselves to 1%."
"The cost of the EU is, in fact, unsustainable for the nations of Europe and needs to be reduced."
"I am appalled at the European House of History being approved as part of this report: it is a 70-million-euro-and-counting vanity project which is completely at odds with the supposed claims of austerity."
"I voted in favour of this resolution which sets out the general framework and priorities for the 2012 budget in the area of funding the EU institutions."
"Faced with the continuing economic crisis, it is very important to ensure good financial management in order to implement the principles of economy, efficiency and effectiveness."
"I agree with the rapporteur's opinion that as a result of the implementation of these principles, institutions should submit cost cutting plans."
"Furthermore, each expense incurred by the institutions should be clearly specified and justified."
"Parliament and the other institutions should submit biannual reports on the implementation of their own budgets, giving details of the implementation of each budget line."
"I therefore believe that the European Parliament and the other institutions should show budgetary responsibility and self-restraint."
"I welcome the establishment of a new Section X in the EU budget for the European External Action Service, with an allocation of EUR 464 million."
"However, I would like to call on this Service to use the funds earmarked for it to implement its activities and achieve concrete results."
"I voted in favour of this report."
"Next year's budget must be responsibly balanced, with priority being given to those areas that are inextricably linked with the EU 2020 strategy."
"In drawing up the budget, it is necessary to ensure the principle of sustainable governance in aspects of effectiveness and efficiency."
"It is necessary to ensure sufficient resources for the EU institutions so that they can perform their functions properly."
"At the same time, the institutions must also respond to the current financial, economic and social situation of the EU, apply stringent management procedures and manage resources with rigour and efficiency I agree that the EU institutions can make a significant contribution to reducing costs and generating economies of scale, such as centralised procurement, shared services between institutions, e-governance systems, etc."
"I voted for this document because I think that the Fernandes report on the budget priorities for 2012 appropriately identifies the directions to follow next year."
"I approve of and support the idea presented in the report about giving priority to the internal recruitment of staff."
"This will help increase efficiency through using the experience previously acquired, while also reducing training costs and the costs involved in adapting to a brand new organisational culture."
"At the same time, it is important to compare in detail the actual expenditure with that budgeted during 2011 and to pinpoint exactly the causes of significant variations."
"EU institutions should prepare and send the Commission plans for cutting their expenditure, with specific deadlines and measurable targets."
"We cannot ask only ordinary citizens and the private sector to make sacrifices."
"EU institutions need to as well."
"Indeed, Parliament must serve as a model, demonstrate solidarity and keep a very close watch on how resources are spent."
"The report on the priorities for the 2012 budget of Parliament and the other European institutions, for which I voted, goes some way toward taking account of the economic, financial and social situation that we are experiencing."
"In other words, it is a budget marked by restraint and austerity."
"This report advocates legislative excellence, cutting costs, reducing the impact on the environment, and a zero-based increase; that is, an increase in line with inflation."
"The proposal that coming budgets should be multiannual budgets is equally important, so that they can be in line with the multiannual financial framework."
"It also takes into account the possible accession of Croatia in 2013."
"I agree with the report on the guidelines for the 2012 budgetary process, which stresses the need to consolidate the resources required to address the new institutional framework resulting from the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"A responsible attitude towards budgetary matters is of paramount importance for both Parliament and the other institutions."
"The current crisis and the heavy burden of public debt lead to an urgent need for self-restraint, taking into account the principles of economy, efficiency and effectiveness."
"It is worth highlighting the fact that certain investments, particularly in technology, could result in future savings in the long term, and therefore, these should not be prevented."
"I would also stress that proposals for reducing paper, energy and water consumption, along with emissions, should be tabled as part of the organisational culture of Parliament and the other institutions."
"It would also be desirable to reduce the amount of material for disseminating physical media, which should be replaced by digital media."
"in writing. - I voted to restrict the EP budget for 2012, given the economic, financial and social constraints on EU Member States."
"We undertook to seek to cut some spending and to justify the rest in detail."
"However, projects already under way, such as the House of European History, should not be jeopardised."
"This is an austerity budget which stays in line with inflation."
"At the same time, cuts must not have a negative impact on the quality of Parliament's legislative work."
"I support the excellent report by Mr Fernandes, because at a time when we are experiencing a severe financial, economic and social crisis in which so many sacrifices are required of the public, we must be the first to set an example by adopting guidelines for a budget marked by restraint and austerity."
"The resources needed for the EU institutions to be able to fulfil what is expected of them should, however, be made available, especially in view of the new institutional framework resulting from the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"I would also stress the importance of subjecting the management of these resources to higher standards of rigour and efficiency, under stricter and more transparent control."
"It is equally important to encourage the creation of synergies and avoid unnecessary duplications in terms of personnel and functions."
"in writing. - When this House considers budget priorities, it does so in the context of massive public sector cuts in EU Member States, rising unemployment, increasing household bills and overall economic uncertainty, both nationally and in many families."
"In this extremely serious and challenging context, what does the EU consider to be a priority?"
"Remarkably, one priority is a European House of History."
"I would hazard a guess that if my constituents were to be asked if this represents 100 million well spent at this time, few - if any - would say yes."
"It is time for this place - MEPs, the Commission and officials - to get real."
"Priorities must be in the best interests of our constituents and aimed at making their lives easier."
"EU money must not be wasted solely for the fulfilment of those obsessed with pushing their idealistic notions of a shared EU history or identity."
"Such self-indulgence must end."
"We have chosen to support this budget report."
"This is partly because it so clearly emphasises the importance of economy and restraint in these difficult economic times and partly because it welcomes the allocation of EUR 464 million to the European External Action Service, the important activities of which are in the area that the EU ought to be focusing on."
"At the same time, however, we are extremely critical of the investment of a total of EUR 549.6 million to extend the KAD building in Luxembourg, and we do not at all share the rapporteur's expectation that this will result in savings in the long term."
"Instead, the only reasonable option would be to establish the European Parliament and its work in a single location."
"We Swedish Social Democrats voted in favour of the report on the priorities for the 2012 budget for the European Parliament and other institutions."
"The report adopts a critical and questioning stance towards a number of budgetary proposals involving high costs and recommends that Parliament's budget for next year increase by no more than the rate of inflation; in other words, it should not change at all in real terms compared with 2011."
"We would also like to emphasise that we agree with the report's extremely hesitant and critical position with regard to the project to establish a House of European History."
"At a time when there is severe pressure on national budgets, we consider it inappropriate to initiate such a project, which will probably be very expensive."
"However, we would like to point out that we would have preferred an even more restrictive approach to be taken to Parliament's budget for 2012 that also included proposals for savings and redistributions to finance new requirements."
"The Commission advocates a rate of increase of a maximum of 1% for the EU institutions' administrative budgets for next year - an initiative that we believe should be supported."
"Compared with inflation, an increase of a maximum of 1% would, in practice, entail a reduction in the overall size of Parliament's budget."
"Taking the current financial, economic and social situation in the EU into due consideration, it is increasingly important that the institutions respond with the quality and efficiency that is required, and that they employ strict management procedures so that savings may be achieved."
"It is now necessary to make efforts to fully achieve the objectives enshrined in the Europe 2020 strategy, focusing on growth and job creation."
"It is also necessary to strike a sustained balance and make an effort towards consolidation in all the categories of the budget."
"It is therefore important to maintain a prudent approach with regard to administrative expenditure."
"In conclusion, Parliament should maintain the principle of legislative excellence, respect the principle of good management and transparency, and ensure a spirit of budgetary responsibility in the general framework and priorities for the 2012 budget."
"The report 'sets the principle of legislative excellence as a priority'."
"Given that, despite the ambiguity of the concept, this will depend essentially on the political guidelines attached to the legislative process, we advocate that a fair allocation of resources - material and human - be made available to Parliament, to serve the requirements and scope of parliamentary work."
"The rapporteur does not hold back from longwinded rhetoric throughout his report, which is punctuated by concepts like 'good management', 'economies of scale', 'efficiency', 'effectiveness', 'cost-benefit analysis', 'redeployment of staff', 'mobility', and so on. Nevertheless, the European External Action Service appears to be excluded from this list when it comes to supporting 'the EU's ambitions in foreign policy'."
"We agree completely about the 'importance of equal treatment of Members of all nationalities and languages in terms of the possibility for them to carry out the duties and political activity incumbent upon them in their own language'."
"However, this involves much more than ensuring interpretation services in committee meetings, as the rapporteur suggests."
"It also involves the provision of interpretation services at meetings of coordinators, trialogues, delegations, parliamentary assemblies and others."
"It also involves all official and work-related documents being translated in a timely manner."
"At present, there are unacceptable omissions in both areas."
"This is another report on the continuity of EU budget policy, which is subordinate, above all, to the political guidelines introduced into the legislative process."
"However, we advocate the fair matching of work resources - both material and human - available to Parliament to the needs and scope of Parliament's work, without exaggerating the costs or possible savings, and without undermining Parliament's work."
"We cannot, however, refrain from pointing out that, rather than concepts like 'good management', 'economies of scale', 'efficiency', 'effectiveness', 'cost-benefit analysis', 'redeployment of staff', 'mobility', and so on, what the European Union needs is other policies, including substantially reducing spending on the military and on the European External Action Service."
"We support the protection of equal treatment of Members of all nationalities and languages in terms of the possibility for them to carry out the duties and political activity incumbent upon them in their own language, bearing in mind, however, that this means much more than ensuring interpretation in committee meetings, as the rapporteur states."
"It also involves the provision of interpretation services at meetings of coordinators, trialogues, delegations, parliamentary assemblies and others."
"It also involves all official and work-related documents being translated in a timely manner."
"The report by Mr Fernandes concerns the guidelines for the 2012 budget procedure for the European institutions."
"Amongst other things, the report provides for greater rigour -given this tough time of economic crisis - in terms of the bureaucratic management of the European organisational system."
"That is why I supported Mr Fernandes by voting in favour."
"I voted in favour of adopting this report, which lays down guidelines for the 2012 budget procedure: a general framework and budgetary priorities for the functioning of the European institutions (except the European Commission)."
"Our report supports, in particular, the reduction in the European Parliament's budget in view of the Member States' economic, financial and social situation, and I welcome that."
"My final point is that I resolutely opposed the amendments attacking the European Parliament's seat in Strasbourg, and I am glad that they were rejected by the majority of the European Parliament."
"I agreed with this report, because it is very important to give priority to the principles of good management, namely, economy, efficiency and effectiveness."
"In the implementation of the various policies, the results achieved must be taken into account and variable expenses should, whenever possible and when their scale so demands, be made subject to regular cost-benefit evaluations."
"As a result of implementation of these principles, institutions should submit cost cutting plans; thought should be given to the advantages of centralisation, so as to generate economies of scale (e.g. centralised procurement, shared services between institutions)."
"Interinstitutional cooperation is essential in order to exchange best practices that favour effectiveness and allow for savings."
"I believe that interinstitutional cooperation should be improved as regards translation, interpretation, recruitment (EPSO) and EMAS and should be extended to other areas."
"In a context of economic crisis, the heavy burden of public debt and restraint in times of ongoing national budgetary consolidation efforts, the European Parliament and the other institutions should show budgetary responsibility and self-restraint."
"Parliament's goal should be to develop legislative excellence and all the necessary resources should be available for this purpose, while respecting budgetary constraints."
"In the current economic, financial and social climate, the budgetary procedure guidelines for 2012 present a real challenge, especially because the European Union's institutions are being forced to make considerable savings but, at the same time, they need to have sufficient resources to enable them to carry out their activities with the highest level of professionalism and efficiency."
"In this respect, I express my support for better interinstitutional support with a view to exchanging practices which will result in a strategy for strengthening ties between Europe and its citizens, while maintaining budget austerity and making savings so that the Europe 2020 agenda objectives can be implemented successfully."
"Although the 2012 budget for Parliament and the other institutions should be about consolidation, this should not create obstacles preventing investments, since investment projects ensure the smooth operation of Europe's economies."
"Last but not least, I support the rapporteur's point that it is unacceptable to have no interpretation services available during the meetings of the European Parliament's committees, as MEPs must be allowed to use their mother tongue."
"I, too, was in the situation where I could not use the interpretation services, even when I was presenting a report."
"The 2012 and 2013 budgets will be consolidation budgets aimed at reflecting the Member States' spending cutbacks and setting a benchmark for the levels that will be established in the next financial framework."
"The aim of this budget must be excellence, which means pursuing the objectives of economy, efficiency and effectiveness using as little as possible of the available resources."
"During this consolidation phase, Parliament has to aim to increase the budget but not above the rate of inflation."
"This threshold means exercising great responsibility."
"The increased expenses deriving from enlargement to include Croatia and the 18 new Members of this House provided for by the Treaty of Lisbon will be integrated through an amending budget."
"In order to respect the approach of containing expenses, I hope that all the institutions will send the necessary information in advance in order to set out a general framework of administrative expenses so that the Budget Authority can take decisions on the use of resources following a multiannual, sustainable approach that aims for the comparability of the information provided over time and across the institutions."
"in writing. - I welcome this report which makes clear that Parliament expects the Bureau to submit realistic requests when presenting the estimates, is ready to examine its proposals on a fully needs-based and prudent basis in order to ensure appropriate and efficient functioning of the institution, stresses that the purpose of the amending letter presented by the Bureau to the Committee on Budgets in September is to take into account needs unforeseen at the time the estimates were drawn up and stresses that it should not be seen as an opportunity to renew estimates previously agreed."
"Following the interinstitutional line, the enlargement-related needs shall be integrated either in an amending letter or amending budget, and the needs for the 18 new MEPs following the Lisbon Treaty will also be integrated by an amending letter or amending budget."
"This report has the great merit of stressing the need for MEPs to carry out their duties in their own language."
"The lack of translations in a number of meetings, in communications that are addressed to us, and in joint resolutions that are under negotiation, is an unjustifiable obstacle to our work as MEPs and hence to democracy."
"I support this request."
"However, I refuse to support the waste of money and the democratic aberration that the establishment of Baroness Ashton's European External Action Service represents."
"Likewise, I refuse to endorse the use of private enterprises in preference to civil servants."
"The Treaty of Lisbon has given Parliament new responsibilities."
"This situation means additional administrative work, with the result that Members need qualified staff to carry out advisory roles."
"This new situation leads to two problems: increased costs arising from the need for more assistants, and additional space required in order for them to carry out their duties in good working conditions."
"This situation leads to increased costs."
"That is difficult to explain during this time of crisis, but if Parliament's work is to be excellent, it needs to have the necessary financial and human resources."
"That is why I voted as I did."
"in writing. - Although the report contains the main guidelines and priorities for the 2012 budget, including the standards of legislative work in the European Parliament, I do not think that the budget increase in terms of the rate of inflation is correct or justified."
"There are other mechanisms and ways of solving common problems and priorities."
"I voted in favour."
"The expenditure ceiling for the multiannual financial framework of the European Union budget for 2012 was increased once again."
"Particularly in times when citizens have to tighten their belts, the European Union, too, must make savings."
"There are plenty of opportunities to make savings, from abandoning one of the seats of Parliament, to reducing the morass of EU agencies, to improving the fight against fraud within the aid programmes."
"Labelling it as due to the economic and financial crisis, the European Union has simply put a few plans on hold but not made any real savings, despite selling these acts as major savings."
"This is more than unfair towards European citizens and it is just as unfair to justify all the additional costs on the basis of the greater demands under the Treaty of Lisbon."
"For these reasons, I voted against the budget report."
"This report includes an increase in the expenditure ceiling for the multiannual financial framework (MFF) for the European Union's budget in 2012."
"As a result of the economic and financial crisis, the citizens in the Member States were urged to accept austerity measures and thus to bear the major part of the impact of the crisis."
"The EU, too, should reduce its expenditure."
"This begins with the uncontrolled growth of agencies, goes on to the pre-accession aid for Turkey and continues through to the expensive duplicate structures and administration costs as a result of the European External Action Service."
"I therefore voted against this report."
"Mr Fernandes's proposal for a resolution on the guidelines for the 2012 budget procedure offers an overview of the administration of Parliament's budget in view of a future optimisation of the management of the resources available to the European institutions, which is why I voted in favour."
"Parliament will have to adopt a budget to consolidate the future financial framework and the additional human resources needed to meet the requirements of the Treaty of Lisbon, and to improve and complete the buildings available, information technology and interpreting services."
"The main objective is still to find a good way of managing resources so as to contain expenses while nevertheless improving services."
"I chose to abstain because, although this text mentions identifying possible savings for next year's budget, these are not made specific within the text."
"If we want to be consistent, savings-related policies should begin with the very Members of this House."
"I voted in favour of this report as I believe that the current financial, economic and social situation in the EU cannot prevent the institutions from employing strict management procedures so that the necessary savings may be achieved."
"A real effort needs to be made towards consolidation."
"As regards sound management principles, the institutions should submit cost-reduction plans, and when presenting expenditure, it should be clearly specified and justified."
"In this vein, I would like to publicly express my appreciation for the excellent work that has been carried out by my colleague, Mr Fernandes."
"I voted in favour of the report on the guidelines for the 2012 budget procedure because I think that the current economic crisis - which right now has repercussions on employment above anything else - requires a joint effort on cutting back from the Member States and the European institutions."
"I therefore agree with the statement that in the current circumstances, the general principle for European financing is to follow an ethos of budgetary austerity."
"In any case, I feel that I must emphasise how, even in view of the economic situation, the Union's budget and, in particular, Parliament's budget - as the only European institution directly elected by citizens - should primarily take care to promote and bring citizens closer to the European Union, particularly at times like these when the future is so uncertain."
"In particular, I think it would be a particularly good idea to consider a better distribution of Parliament's information offices in the Member States and their more strategic location, partly in the light of the latest upheavals in neighbouring States."
"in writing. - I voted in favour even if I would have preferred that some amendments concerning the need for the EP to reduce its number of places of work to one did not pass."
"The guidelines for the 2012 budget are based on a balance between the need to give the European institutions sufficient and appropriate resources to carry out their activities, and the need to find a quality and efficient response in the face of the current financial, economic and social crisis."
"The submitted proposal points out that the institutions may have difficulties in maintaining the financial discipline and restraint needed to comply with the multiannual financial programme, particularly with regard to heading 5."
"The rapporteur therefore calls for sound management principles, such as economy, efficiency and effectiveness, so that it is possible to achieve greater rigour, simplicity, clarity and transparency."
"As regards the Parliament, this document, for which I voted, includes the needs arising from Croatia's accession in 2013, the increase in the number of MEPs by 18 and the need for extra staff following the Treaty of Lisbon's entry into force."
"For the other institutions, it is worth pointing out the new Section X on the External Action Service which, with the new Treaty, will respond to the financial needs arising from the creation of an ambitious institutional framework to support EU foreign policy."
"According to the Fernandes report, the European Parliament must shine in the legislative field and all resources must serve that end."
"For me, there has to be a second priority here, too, namely, that Parliament must shine when it comes to budgetary discipline."
"Governments, businesses and citizens are currently having to evaluate their expenditure once again."
"The European Parliament must do the same - we must focus not on more money but on new priorities."
"We need a change of course because the European Union's administrative spending has risen faster than its total spending, and Parliament tops the list!"
"Recital F of the report makes reference to the European External Action Service, which is likely to cost more money."
"That, too, must change."
"Why does the said service have many dozens of employees and luxury premises in exotic locations like Barbados and Madagascar?"
"Take a close look at the service and you find that it does not need more money."
"This must be the number one budgetary priority for the European Union: not spending more money, but spending better."
"The guidelines for the 2012 budget procedure consist of assorted individual sections drawn together under the headings 'economy' and 'consolidation'."
"Many citizens in Europe, like their national governments, have been forced into economy and restricted spending by the consequences of the financial and economic crisis."
"In this situation, it is more than justified that the European Parliament should lead by example with its proposed budget for 2012."
"In 2012, the EU will be faced with new - and inevitable - expenditure. This is dependent on the potential accession of Croatia, the newly created European External Action Service and the three financial agencies."
"In order to stop the automatic process of increased budgetary demands equating to an increase in the budget, now is the time that potential savings in the EU budget must be identified."
"This should include, for example, a business analysis of the Union's agencies and an evaluation of EU bodies' human resources and buildings policies."
"I am voting for this resolution because a strategy for the Atlantic region is essential for EU territorial cohesion, especially in the context of the eastward enlargement of EU borders."
"It is worth noting that our approach to the Atlantic can only be less one toward a peripheral region and more one that affirms its geo-centrality in the world as part of a strategic orientation that puts the region at its centre."
"For the EU, it is the border area with North America, South America and all of western Africa."
"A strategy for the Atlantic region in which the Member States and their regions participate should also prioritise new areas of innovation in the economy and science, in particular, new products and services linked to the environment, to renewable and marine energy, to food-related marine biotechnology, to health and smart technology-intensive products and services."
"The Atlantic strategy should not be isolated, but rather enshrined within the set of the EU's overall objectives, given the lessons of the Baltic strategy, adapted after the start of the period of budgetary planning for 2007-2013, which has undoubtedly limited the scope of the initiative."
"I voted in favour of this resolution on the European strategy for the Atlantic region."
"Five EU Member States are situated along the Atlantic coast - France, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom."
"Therefore, there is a need for a strategy to coordinate the actions of these countries in the region."
"I agree with the rapporteur that the major added value of EU regional strategies is seen in multi-level cooperation, coordination and better strategic investment of available funding, not in additional allocation of resources."
"I believe that this strategy would address the following issues of common interest: environment and climate change, including preventing and combating marine pollution by ships, transport and accessibility, research, innovation, culture, leisure and tourism, marine services and training, as well as fisheries and the seafood sector."
"I would like to recall that one of the first strategies of this kind is the EU strategy for the Baltic Sea region approved by the European Council, covering 8 EU Member States, including my own country, Lithuania."
"This strategy is aimed at making the Baltic Sea region environmentally sustainable, prosperous, easily accessible, safe and secure."
"This strategy has already been successfully initiated, and I therefore feel that the European strategy for the Atlantic region would be beneficial not just for this region, but for the whole of the EU."
"Cooperation on problems extending beyond national borders is one of the great added values of the work carried out by the European Union."
"My colleague, Mr Cadec, has been working for months to strengthen cooperation between the regions of the Atlantic Arc, so that it enables them to make the most of any possible synergies."
"I therefore voted in favour of this resolution, which 'asks the Commission to shape as soon as possible the EU strategy for the Atlantic region as an integrated strategy dealing with maritime and territorial issues'."
"I supported this resolution."
"Territorial cohesion is one of the EU's most important objectives and a precondition for an effective, economically strong and competitive internal market."
"The Atlantic region has its own specific characteristics, namely, a dynamic maritime area whose fragile environment must be preserved and which is subject to the consequences of climate change."
"It is an outlying area within the European Union, with major accessibility and connectivity problems."
"I feel that there is an urgent need to adopt this strategy, which will help address this region's fundamental problems as regards opening up, the interconnection of transport and energy networks and the development of marine energy, the development of urban and rural areas, and the intensification of land-sea ties and of sea-interior waters ties."
"I agree with Parliament's resolution on the European strategy for the Atlantic region, which I believe is of great importance, as five Member States have an Atlantic coast: France, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and the UK."
"This strategy is being proposed to address significant issues, such as maritime energy, the environment and climate change, transport and access, security and surveillance, research, innovation, the creative industries, culture, leisure and tourism, marine services and training, fisheries and the seafood sector."
"European territorial cooperation, which is consolidated in this strategy through the aforementioned aspects, can contribute widely to the intensification of the integration process within the Atlantic region through greater participation by civil society in the decision-making process and the implementation of concrete measures."
"I would also like to stress that this initiative can, and should, lead to the better use of EU funds, not an increase in expenditure."
"As a Member elected by a country in the Atlantic region, I must highlight the importance and the need to create a European strategy which takes the geographic, demographic and economic characteristics of this region into account."
"An integrated and joined-up strategy needs to be created to ensure a synergy and consistency between sectoral policies in this area, creating the added value necessary to address the challenges of sustainable development and competitiveness of this region in particular, and of Europe in general."
"I have no doubts as to the need for an approach at European level, based on strengthening cooperation between the Member States with an Atlantic coast, coastal communities, the private sector and civil society, and in which this common strategy will benefit all the stakeholders."
"This should enable the identification of common problems and challenges, and of shared priorities, and the creation of the synergies needed to promote more efficient resource use."
"It is important not only to improve the competitiveness and sustainability of the traditional sectors, but also to exploit the full potential of the Atlantic area, with new markets, products and services, guided by two main priorities: protection of the environment and ecosystems, and job creation."
"I voted in favour of this resolution as I support the need for the Commission to establish, as rapidly as possible, a European strategy for the Atlantic region which addresses maritime and territorial issues."
"This strategy should address issues of common interest, such as the environment and climate change, marine energy, maritime transport, maritime security and surveillance, fisheries, tourism, research and innovation."
"The Azores, Madeira and Cape Verde should also be included and have a prominent role in this strategy."
"Today, the Atlantic is one of Europe's borders and has been one of the European continent's most important means of contact with the world."
"It was across this ocean that European peoples, particularly the Portuguese, came into contact with peoples, economies and cultures previously unknown to one another, and forged what is today a truly globalised world."
"Today, the Atlantic region suffers marginalisation compared with Europe's centre, and this can and must be remedied through the understanding that the Atlantic and relationships with the more important partners bordering it, such as Brazil and the United States, can bring about the reaffirmation of a geostrategic centrality that has, however, been displaced by the emergence of the Asian countries."
"The importance of the region fully justifies the establishment of a European strategy which, true to the role historically reserved for the ocean that gives it its name, does not confine itself to the Member States, but rather is able to provide a link to those other coasts."
"In this regard, I would stress the extremely important and irreplaceable role of the outermost regions in the strategy's success."
"These continue to merit special support from the Union, which can overcome the costs of insularity and boost foreign contacts."
"On 14 June 2010, the Council asked the Commission to draw up a European strategy for the Atlantic region within one year, as it is a peripheral territory with special characteristics in terms of both its potential and its environmental fragility."
"Therefore, given its importance at global level, a strategy is required that is ambitious and takes into account its maritime and territorial aspects."
"This resolution represents a fundamental contribution to drawing up the strategy as it draws attention to crucial aspects such as the need to seek out synergies with other policies on the environment, energy, transport, tourism, marine resources, and others, to adopt a macro-regional policy and move towards the international approach that is needed for good relations with countries that have Atlantic coasts."
"I welcome Parliament's adoption of this resolution, as I am convinced that this EU strategy for the Atlantic region will speed up sustainable growth in this area and put maritime issues at the top of the European agenda."
"We are in favour of developing strategies aimed at the economic, social and territorial cohesion of certain macro-regions, which should obviously be given the appropriate means to allow this to be achieved fully and effectively."
"Every phase of these strategies - preparation, formulation and implementation - should actively involve the countries and regions that are within their geographic scope, and should be based on cooperation between those countries and regions."
"These strategies can and should address issues of common interest, such as, in the case of this specific proposal of the European strategy for the Atlantic region: marine energy, environmental preservation, including the prevention and fight against marine pollution, transport and access, research and innovation, among others."
"However, we have major doubts about, and other strong disagreements with, some of the points in the resolution."
"We therefore did not vote in favour."
"The resolution does not safeguard the principle that new resources, especially financial resources, should match the new objectives in the area of cohesion policy, in order to make them effective."
"The resolution also proposes the subordination of the strategy to EU foreign policy, to international trade policy objectives, to the Europe 2020 strategy and to the achievement of 'the aims of the internal market'."
"It is important to continue developing strategies aimed at the economic, social and territorial cohesion of certain macro-regions, which should obviously be given the appropriate means to allow this to be achieved fully and effectively."
"Every phase of these strategies - preparation, formulation and implementation - should actively involve the countries and regions that are within their geographic scope, and should be based on cooperation between those countries and regions."
"These strategies can and should address issues of common interest. This case concerns the European strategy for the Atlantic region: marine energy, environmental preservation, including the prevention and fight against marine pollution, transport and access, research and innovation, among others."
"However, we have major doubts about, and other strong disagreements with, some of the points in the resolution."
"We therefore did not vote in favour."
"The resolution does not safeguard the principle that new resources, especially financial resources, should match the new objectives in the area of cohesion policy, in order to make them effective, which means that we will have a lot of promises but few actions, in addition to being subordinated to international trade policy objectives, to the Europe 2020 strategy and to the achievement of 'the aims of the internal market'."
"I strongly support what is being done at EU level to establish an integrated strategy for the Atlantic region."
"The Atlantic strategy must focus on stimulating economic development of the Atlantic islands and the Atlantic coastal region."
"The Atlantic region is one of the richest areas for wind, wave and tidal energy, but not enough benefit is being reaped from that energy potential."
"Atlantic coastal region leisure and tourism activities also constitute valuable economic resources."
"There is true growth potential there; for example, developing strategic marinas in each country."
"The maritime transport, ports and seafood sectors - including aquaculture - in particular would benefit from the establishment of closer collaboration among the Member States bordering the Atlantic."
"Any strategy for the Atlantic must comply with the provisions of the common fisheries policy."
"Over the years, there has been an improvement in cooperation between Member States on issues of safety, security and maritime surveillance."
"Since the Atlantic Arc area is so extensive, however, an integrated strategy must be put in place to ensure better and more effective activities coordinated by Member States."
"The adoption of a parliamentary resolution on the draft strategy for the Atlantic region is an opportunity for me to point out the urgent need to work at European level on a common approach regarding the use of our maritime areas and to find a joint solution to the problems that exist."
"The Channel is a particularly illuminating example in this respect: a strategic maritime gateway to the European Union, it is both an essential link between the Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea (it contains 20% of the world's fleet and more than 500 vessels over 300 tonnes sail through it every day) and an area dedicated to fishing, leisure activities, aggregate extraction and soon - much to my satisfaction - energy production from offshore wind farms."
"This concentration of activities calls for serious thought to be given to the issue of managing maritime safety in that area at European level, as part of a joint strategy."
"That is why, during the debate on the strategy for the Atlantic region, I once again called on Mrs Damanaki, Commissioner for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, to include the Channel in the proposal that she is due to submit in June."
"I voted in favour of this document, because as we know, the Atlantic region has its own specific characteristics; namely, it is a dynamic maritime area (thanks to maritime transport, fishing, marine energy, etc.), an area whose fragile environment must be preserved and which is subject to the consequences of climate change, and it is also an outlying area within the European Union, with accessibility and connectivity problems and with a low number of major city centres."
"We need to shape as soon as possible the EU strategy for the Atlantic region as an integrated strategy dealing with maritime and territorial issues."
"This strategy should implement a better coordination of goals and means, with strong links to the EU 2020 strategy and EU policies post-2013. This strategy aims at better spending of EU money, not increasing expenditure."
"This strategy needs to be well-connected to EU regional policy and integrated maritime policy."
"I feel that it should also facilitate synergies with other EU policies such as trans-European transport networks, the common fisheries policy, climate and environment actions, the research and development framework programme, energy policy, etc. It is important to improve accessibility in Atlantic maritime regions and increase movement of persons, goods and services in these regions in order to achieve the aims of the internal market and the objective of cohesion policy, especially by the development of short sea shipping and the highways of the sea."
"in writing. - I voted for this report on the EU strategy for the Atlantic region which is of the opinion that this strategy should be set within the cohesion policy objective of territorial cooperation (Objective 3), and be based on an integrated, cross-domain and territorial approach, aiming at better coordinating policies between the various levels of governance on a given territory, with a focus on relevant issues, and is convinced that European territorial cooperation can contribute widely to the intensification of the integration process within the Atlantic region through a greater participation by civil society in the decision-making process and the implementation of concrete actions."
"The Atlantic region has specific characteristics of its very own as it is a dynamic maritime area, in which I would stress its maritime transport, fisheries and marine energy."
"It is an area with a fragile environment that has to be preserved, but which is subject to coastal erosion and extreme weather events, and it is a peripheral area."
"Therefore, an integrated EU strategy is required which covers maritime and territorial issues."
"That is why I voted as I did."
"I voted for this resolution which calls for the EU to create a European strategy for the Atlantic region."
"European territorial cooperation can contribute widely to the intensification of the integration process within the Atlantic region through a greater participation by civil society in the decision-making process and the implementation of concrete actions."
"The text includes a call on the EU for the strategy to deal with maritime and territorial issues."
"It also insists that cooperation within the framework of this strategy should, first and foremost, be based on the needs of the stakeholders concerned and is thus of the opinion that the political priorities addressed have to be decided through a consensus."
"in writing. - Taking into account the specificities of the Atlantic region, Parliament asks the Commission to act as soon as possible to establish the EU strategy for the Atlantic region as an integrated strategy dealing with maritime and territorial issues."
"Though Parliament believes that this strategy must develop synergies between relevant EU, national, regional and local policies, it calls on the Commission and the Member States to set up simplified rules to facilitate the implementation of this strategy and reduce the inherent administrative burden."
"In my view, this is not possible, because efficient measures of influence on the Commission have not been found so far."
"I am getting the impression that the Commission has still not started to change its priorities under the Lisbon Treaty and is conducting unjustified and long-lasting rhetoric with Parliament to further its own opportunities."
"This is not being done in the general interest and is actually detrimental to the whole situation."
"I supported the report, but nevertheless remain of the same mind."
"Five Member States of the European Union border the Atlantic."
"France, Portugal and Spain, in particular, certainly do not see only benefits from this geographical fact, as the Atlantic plays a not insignificant role when it comes to the streams of refugees that now threaten to increase as a result of the crises in the countries of North Africa."
"People-smugglers are all too keen to use the Atlantic route, since Spain's border fence was erected in 2005."
"In order to prevent a flood of predominantly economic migrants, the EU would be well advised to quickly develop an effective Atlantic strategy that also covers this aspect, even though the remaining two Atlantic States - the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland - bear little to no impact in this regard."
"As the resolution hardly, if at all, covers this area, I abstained from the vote."
"At today's vote, the European Parliament adopted the resolution on the European strategy for the Atlantic region."
"The strategy is a further European initiative which will not concentrate on solving the problems of a single country but of the entire Atlantic region, which includes as many as five Member States."
"It is important to draw attention to the fact that the strategy should be characterised by a bottom-up approach."
"The geostrategic position of the region allows development of cooperation in the fields of maritime safety, international trade and fishing, as well as protection of the marine environment and preservation of biodiversity."
"I think it is necessary to ask the European Commission what resources will be given in pursuit of the strategy, because this is particularly important in relation to establishing the new financial framework."
"In my opinion, another important matter is the process of putting the strategy into effect and the possibility that it may be necessary to create additional financial instruments."
"I agree with the resolution on the European strategy for the Atlantic region, which will contribute to the region's sustainable development."
"Moreover, a further step will be taken towards the implementation of one of the European Union's objectives - territorial cohesion."
"Given the geostrategic position of the Atlantic region, the Commission must take immediate action and develop an integrated strategy for this region, strengthening international cooperation and triangular cooperation initiatives, and addressing maritime and territorial issues."
"Attention is drawn to the fact that effective territorial cooperation will promote the development of marine energy and will create a favourable environment to use transport and energy networks and interconnections."
"For this strategy to achieve the objectives set, it must be well-connected to EU regional policy and integrated maritime policy. Only this can guarantee synergies with other EU policies and create the conditions for more targeted and more effective absorption and use of funds allocated by the EU, without increasing expenditure."
"Furthermore, the adoption of this strategy will improve accessibility to Atlantic maritime regions, and increase the movement of persons, goods and services."
"The motion for a resolution on the European Union strategy for the Atlantic region follows the request made by the European Council to the Commission to develop an integrated strategy dealing with maritime and territorial issues in the Atlantic."
"I voted in favour of the resolution to ask the European Commission to prepare and report on the negotiations on the planned strategy no later than June."
"The aim is to implement better coordination in the region on issues such as the integrated maritime policy, the trans-European transport networks, fisheries, climate and environment actions, research and development, increasing movement of persons, goods and services in the regions in order to achieve the cohesion policy objective, ensuring that everything ties in with the EU 2020 strategy and with the European Union's policies post-2013."
"I voted in favour of this resolution because given that Portugal is an Atlantic country, with a dynamic maritime area and great potential, although it has a fragile environment that needs to be preserved, I consider it positive that the EU is recognising the potential of its Atlantic region."
"I also believe that many of the problems of this vast area should meet with a response at European level through an integrated EU strategy for the region, and through the prospect of a territorial cohesion policy that should be a fundamental framework for Union choices."
"However, Union decisions have been totally absent and completely sacrificed because of unacceptable budgetary constraints resulting from political choices of austerity that do not encourage development."
"Given Portugal's particular geostrategic position, this matter is of great importance, especially as regards the areas of maritime security and surveillance."
"I therefore believe that the establishment of the European Union strategy for the Atlantic is very pertinent."
"in writing. - As was the case in the resolution on an EU strategy for the Danube region adopted by the EP last month, the present draft resolution stresses that the major added value of EU macro-regional strategies is seen in multi-level cooperation, coordination and better strategic investment of available funding, and not in the additional allocation of resources."
"The draft resolution underlines the conclusions of the Swedish Presidency regarding no new institutions, no new legislation and no new budgets."
"Furthermore, REGI wanted this strategy to work according to a bottom-up approach and to involve all stakeholders (regional and local public authorities, Member States, the EU, private stakeholders and civil society organisations, including the interregional networks and organisations concerned) in its design and implementation."
"From the Greens/EFA point of view, we proposed amendments on the development of marine energy, the prevention and fighting of marine pollution by ships, and the development of short sea shipping and highways of the sea, that were all adopted."
"As a Galician and co-signatory to this initiative, I support an ambitious strategy for the Atlantic region."
"I call on the Commission to table a proposal prior to June 2011 with the priority of growing and creating sustainable jobs in line with the Europe 2020 strategy."
"The macro-region's area is maritime, fragile and peripheral, so the strategy requires an integrated, cross-cutting and territorial focus, all of whose dimensions should protect the environment, encourage accessibility, mobility and connectivity, and promote cohesion."
"The strategy should also facilitate synergies between the EU's various policies - for example, as regards: tourism; highways of the sea and trans-European transport networks; common fisheries policy; energy policy, and marine energy in particular; climate change measures; the Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development; multilingualism; and, in general, any policies that will be implemented from 2014 onwards - and between any relevant policies developed in the field by the various responsible authorities."
"The plan must be drawn up, adopted and implemented in a transparent and trustworthy way, through cooperation between all the public institutions, and the involvement of the private sector and civil society organisations."
"Owing to its vast area, the European Atlantic coast has great potential and several specific characteristics."
"The Atlantic region offers significant and dynamic maritime activity and has at its core regions that are very different from one another, but which have the common characteristic of depending on activities in the maritime basins of this ocean."
"There are remote regions of the Atlantic that are difficult to access, being at a great physical distance from continental Europe."
"I am talking, specifically, about the outermost regions of the EU, where problems of connectivity and accessibility are reflected in their economic and social development."
"However, it is also important to mention that these regions have unique advantages compared with other European regions."
"Apart from their permanent constraints, their own characteristics offer potential that should be taken into account as part of an integrated view of the Atlantic region."
"The objective of territorial cohesion allows, or rather obligates, harmonious development for all EU regions, bearing in mind the specific characteristics of each one."
"I therefore hope that the outermost regions of Macaronesia, including my home region of Madeira, are properly taken into account in any future strategy for the Atlantic, and that an integrated approach can overcome the main difficulties and challenges that these regions experience."
"I am voting for this resolution, as I believe that the accession of Turkey to the EU is in the strategic interests of both the country and the EU, but this will require Turkey to make a firmer commitment to the processes of reform in order to meet the accession criteria."
"This is the case particularly in the areas of freedom of the press, association and assembly, of commitment to creating a faster, more independent and fairer judicial system which cooperates effectively in the fight against terrorism, and in the struggle for women's rights and human rights in general."
"Moreover, the withdrawal of Turkish forces from Cyprus is an essential condition for building a climate of good neighbourliness."
"I voted in favour of this resolution on Turkey's 2010 progress report."
"When it began negotiations on EU accession, Turkey committed itself to reforms, good neighbourly relations and progressive alignment with the EU."
"However, it is clear that Turkey's progress is too slow, demonstrating the unwillingness of this country's government representatives to implement reforms and democratise the country."
"The European Parliament has serious concerns about the deterioration in freedom of the press, about certain acts of censorship and about growing self-censorship within the Turkish media, including on the Internet."
"We condemn the restrictions on freedom of assembly and, in particular, the violent police crackdown on student demonstrations at Ankara University in December 2010."
"The European Parliament is also concerned that human rights defenders are being persecuted in Turkey."
"This represents just a portion of the human rights violations in a country that aims to become an EU Member State."
"It is clear that the current human rights situation in Turkey is complicated, one might even say contrary to the EU's values and policies."
"Against such a backdrop, negotiations on EU accession are leading to a dead end."
"I therefore believe that the Turkish authorities must adopt immediate rigorous reforms in all branches of government or consider the possibility of becoming not an EU Member, but a strategic partner."
"The European Parliament report and the corresponding motion for a resolution adopted by plenary illustrate the imperialistic infighting within the EU and the conflict surrounding economic and political relations and the objectives processed in cooperation with the bourgeoisie in Turkey."
"These issues relate to the exploitation of the people in this country, the servicing of broader imperialistic interests in controlling wealth-producing resources and the exploitation of the people in the Middle East, in North Africa and in the area as a whole."
"As the capitalist crisis and imperialistic aggression escalate, the European Parliament has concealed the anti-grassroots policy of the Turkish Government and the attack on the social rights and grassroots freedoms of the workers in that country."
"The Turkish Government continues to view grassroots forces protesting against violations of the rights of the Kurds as terrorists."
"The European Parliament tolerates Turkey's intransigence and aggression against the Republic of Cyprus."
"It has voted against the proposals and amendments concerning the Republic of Cyprus and its legal rights in the area."
"The Greek Communist Party is radically against the accession of Turkey to the EU, because it is fighting against this imperialistic organisation."
"The MEPs of the Greek Communist Party voted against the report on Turkey because its accession to the EU can only bring hardship for the workers."
"in writing. - My statement aims to justify my abstention on the resolution on Turkey."
"I abstained because I did not agree with its lack of positive inspiration and its lack of a clear appreciation of some key features of the Turkish Government's recent action."
"In this resolution, there is too much of a paternalistic attitude towards a great country that does not deserve this treatment."
"There are too many demands on Turkey, with too many details and too many unrealistic standards to be met."
"If these standards were applied to the EU Member States, several of them would not qualify for EU accession."
"I hope this attitude towards Turkey will change over time, and I hope this Parliament will show a stronger commitment to the goal of having Turkey in the EU soon."
"I voted in favour of this resolution."
"Turkey committed itself to reforms, good neighbourly relations and progressive alignment with the EU."
"These commitments and efforts by Turkey should be viewed as an opportunity for Turkey itself to modernise, given the support from Turkish citizens and civil society for Turkey's further democratisation and their commitment to an open and pluralistic society."
"Despite the progress made in some areas, the situation in Turkey remains rather complicated."
"Hitherto, Turkey has made rather slow progress with regard to reforms."
"Ongoing confrontation between the political parties and the lack of readiness on the part of the government and the opposition to work towards consensus on key reforms mean there is no visible impact, and in some areas, the situation is worsening, particularly as regards freedom of the press."
"The Turkish Government has committed itself to undertaking comprehensive reforms in order to modernise its country, and it must therefore increase its efforts to establish a democratic state, based on the principle of separation of powers with a balance between the executive, legislative and judicial functions and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms."
"For the fifth consecutive year, Turkey has failed to comply with Europe's requests."
"There has been a growth in fundamentalist movements, which the government does not combat due to its nationalist and Islamist political views."
"The status of religious Christian minorities and of women has been deteriorating for years."
"Turkey does not therefore wish to come into line with Western democratic standards; it has chosen a pathway of re-Islamification, which will lead it ever further away from accession."
"A country that aims to take a leading role in the Arab-Muslim world with an aggressive foreign policy towards the West and Israel is a country that demonstrates for itself the reasons why my group has long opposed those who would like to see Turkey become a Member State."
"Whilst, on the one hand, the report sheds light on many problematic aspects that have emerged in recent years, it also applauds the 'progress' that the Turkish Government has made in some areas."
"Essentially, the report holds the doors to Europe wide open for Ankara, which is why I voted against it."
"Turkey is not Europe and never will be, either in cultural or political terms."
"The backward steps made by Turkey ought to convince even its most enthusiastic supporters to give up on the idea that this country should join the European project."
"The European Parliament must continue to give encouragement to states wishing to become members of the European Union because it is only by encouraging democratic change and punishing swiftly abuses or ineptitude that will enable these countries to become aligned with Member States' common democratic and economic standards."
"This is why it is natural to welcome the first steps which have been taken towards constitutional reform in Turkey, which highlights, however, the need for global system reforms."
"Turkey's political problems, its relations with Greece, which are still tense and even in stalemate, the precarious dialogue between the political parties and the undermining of press freedom are all reasons for slowing down the pace of the accession negotiations."
"Turkey's immediate aim is likely to be the waiver of the visa scheme imposed by Member States on Turkish citizens."
"Indeed, concluding the negotiations on the readmission agreement will result in better management of migration."
"The Commission must launch the dialogue with Turkey about visas as soon as the agreement comes into force."
"Europe cannot afford to have a state the size of Turkey feeling frustrated about the way in which its citizens are treated."
"Turkey is likely to expect Parliament's resolution to benefit it more."
"However, the fact that Parliament is saying that the negotiation process with the EU is lengthy and open-ended does not reflect the reality on the ground."
"The Member States clearly have everything to gain from maintaining good relations with Turkey, but once again, the European Union has discredited itself with this report on Turkey's progress towards accession."
"Firstly, it is still not listening to the people of Europe, who are worried about this prospect, the upshot of which is that hundreds of millions of euro are being spent indiscriminately each year (in pre-accession assistance), and nothing is being given in return."
"Secondly, the Union recognises, although it has not learnt from it, that Turkey flouts international law in Cyprus and fundamental rights in its own country, scorns its Armenian and Greek neighbours, oppresses the minorities living on its territory and does not even deign to honour the commitments it makes to the Union."
"When will we have the courage to get out of this trap?"
"Will our leaders get back to reality and propose a partnership to Turkey instead of accession?"
"I voted in favour of this report because I believe that the reforms in Turkey, although important, have been taking place slowly."
"It is worth stressing the recent amendment to the legal framework reinforcing women's rights and contributing to greater gender equality, but there is still much to be done to reverse the low rates of female employment."
"We Swedish Social Democrats support the demand for Turkey to recognise the genocide."
"However, we believe that it is important that the criticism of Turkey for not recognising the genocide is not used as a weapon by the - regrettably - xenophobic forces which want to keep Turkey out of the EU at any price."
"We think it is important to continue the membership negotiations with Turkey and to put pressure on this country to comply with the Copenhagen criteria, because that will force it to comply with the human rights requirements and adopt a more progressive attitude to minorities like the Kurds, Armenians, Assyrians and Syrians, who we believe would perhaps be the ones to benefit most from Turkey joining the EU - an EU that is genuinely democratic and prepared to accept diversity."
"We therefore abstained from voting on Amendment 38."
"Given the maelstrom of instability afflicting the southern Mediterranean and the whole Muslim world, it is clear that, for all its flaws, the Turkish regime has been able to evolve in a more peaceful and orderly way, and that it has sought to converge and integrate with the European Union by adopting its standards and best practices."
"Today, Turkey is a regional power to which the EU must pay particular attention, as the link between the two is crucial."
"Having said that, it has to be acknowledged that Turkey still does not fulfil all the objective criteria that would enable it to aspire to be a full member of the Union, and that the reforms that it has recently been making will take time to have the expected results."
"I hope that Turkey will be successful in its efforts at democratisation and that, whatever form its future relationship with the Union takes, it will become closer and deepen, for their mutual benefit."
"Negotiations concerning Turkey's accession to the EU began in October 2005, and that process is still ongoing and a long way from reaching an outcome in the near future."
"The European Union, which is interested in pursuing a policy of good neighbourliness, welcomes this integration, as it regards Turkey as a strategic partner."
"Nonetheless, there are certain problems hampering the advancement of this process."
"The first of these is the disrespect for fundamental rights as regards freedom of speech, respect for minorities and the rule of law."
"The EU sees this as an unacceptable situation, which is only exacerbated by the occupation of a large part of the territory of Cyprus."
"Turkey must therefore provide evidence that it is in the process of changing, particularly by implementing the legislation amended in 2007 and complying in full with the undertakings that it has made to the EU."
"I am voting in favour of this report in the hope that the Turkish Government will adopt the approved recommendations as soon as possible, as the people of Turkey will reap the benefits."
"Turkey is militarily occupying part of an EU Member State: the Republic of Cyprus."
"Despite efforts by the Cypriot Government to resolve the problem and repeated demonstrations of goodwill to come to a fair solution, the Turkish authorities show no signs of wanting to match these efforts."
"Instead, they are pursuing a policy of non-compliance with United Nations resolutions, and of the occupation and colonisation of the northern part of the island."
"That should be a central point in this resolution."
"However, the resolution is complacent as regards the continuation of this situation."
"In addition, it is silent about the repression of workers, trade unionists and leftist forces in Turkey, as well as of the Kurdish minority."
"Those who have voted for this resolution are concerned rather to urge Turkey to 'support and actively contribute to the implementation of EU policies and measures in the region', particularly in the area of energy, highlighting its 'constructive engagement' in NATO operations in Afghanistan and the Balkans, along with the renewal of 'close ties with Israel'."
"These considerations are illustrative of the deeper meaning and significance of EU enlargement processes which, in the specific case of Turkey, is the imposition of the wishes of the EU powers and the interest that they serve."
"I welcome the report by my Dutch colleague in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), Mrs Oomen-Ruijten."
"The text is very balanced."
"It highlights some of the critical issues still to be resolved in the process of bringing Turkey closer to the European Union and also notes how, as well as the unresolved issue of the Armenian genocide, it is also up to the Turkish authorities to take responsibility for the occupation of part of the island of Cyprus and the dispute with the Republic of Cyprus, a Member State since 2004."
"Another fundamental point is inter-religious dialogue with the various communities, including the Christian community, and, in particular, the possibility for these communities to obtain legal personality in order to open and operate houses of worship."
"I think the time has come to leave hypocrisy behind and stop constantly boxing in the Turkish people, since we knew from the start that the obstacles would be difficult to overcome."
"Turkey is not Europe, either in cultural or geographic terms, though it has extremely strong commercial ties to Europe."
"For these reasons, I think it would be more useful and worthwhile to set up a privileged commercial partnership, instead of insisting on the long and winding road to accession."
"As we have been stressing, many questions are raised by the negotiations on Turkey's accession to the EU."
"This is a process promoted by the major powers in the EU, and it is not lacking in contradictions, as its objectives include the integration of this large country into the EU single market, control of its economy and the use of its geostrategic location in relation to the Middle East, the Caucasus and Central Asia, particularly for access to and control of the energy sources and markets of these regions."
"Moreover, the resolution is instructive on this point, urging Turkey to 'support and actively contribute to the implementation of EU policies and measures in the region', particularly in the area of energy, highlighting its 'constructive engagement' in NATO operations in Afghanistan and the Balkans, along with the renewal of 'close ties with Israel'."
"The resolution ignores the repression of workers, trade unionists and leftist forces in Turkey, and of the Turkish people."
"As for Cyprus, the majority of Parliament maintains the usual ambiguity, although it is not clear why, given that Turkey has not taken any step towards recognising Cyprus, an EU Member State, but is continuing its military occupation of the north of that island, installing Turkish citizens to change its demographic balance, and in breach of UN resolutions."
"The large groups have not had the courage, in committee, to defend their own political choices regarding Turkey's accession to the European Union."
"In order to avoid talking about full membership of the Union, in the case of the left, or of a privileged partnership, in the case of the so-called right, they have struck a deal."
"They have decided on the usual meaningless option of the 'open-ended' process - in other words, a process with an uncertain end."
"Who, though, wants to pursue negotiations that have no clearly defined aims?"
"The people of Europe, who are overwhelmingly opposed to this accession, and whose governments, like this Parliament, refuse to listen to them, are being made fools of."
"Parliament, which, every year, deplores the fact that Turkey does not honour its commitments, that reforms there are slow, that the conditions of women and Christian minorities there are deteriorating, that it is in conflict with a Member State ..."
"And which completely fails to learn from this!"
"Turkey and its people are also being made fools of - with disastrous diplomatic consequences, as we saw recently with Mr Erdoğan's visit to Germany and Mr Sarkozy's visit to Turkey."
"Neither does Nicolas Sarkozy have the courage of his alleged convictions: is he in favour of a partnership and not of accession?"
"Then he should say so clearly and act accordingly."
"I am in favour of the negotiations and Turkey's accession to the European Union, but only on condition that human rights and democracy are respected. That is why I voted for the amendment, which proposed the recognition of the Armenian genocide, a crucial historical act and prerequisite for Turkey's accession to the Union."
"I voted in favour of this document because accession negotiations with Turkey were opened on 3 October 2005 after the Council had approved the Negotiating Framework, and because the opening of those negotiations was the starting point for a long-lasting and open-ended process."
"Turkey has committed itself to reforms, good neighbourly relations and progressive alignment with the EU, and these efforts should be viewed as an opportunity for Turkey itself to modernise."
"Full compliance with all the Copenhagen criteria, in accordance with the conclusions of the December 2006 European Council meeting, remains the basis for accession to the EU, which is a community based on shared values."
"I would single out the main aspects and priorities of this integration as building good neighbourly relations, advancing EU-Turkey cooperation, enhancing social cohesion and prosperity and fulfilling the Copenhagen criteria."
"Turkey has aspired to membership of the EU since the 1960s, but now the membership talks have, in practice, come to a halt."
"Turkey needs to look in the mirror: it has not implemented the Ankara Protocol or recognised Cyprus."
"Furthermore, the country must introduce civil and human rights reforms before it can join the Union."
"These include freedom of religion and acknowledging the rights of women."
"These are the facts."
"The Union, however, should also take a look in the mirror."
"There is strong opposition to Turkey in the EU, based on prejudices and fear of difference."
"The big Member States, such as Germany and France, are afraid of Turkey, which is a large, influential country."
"The situation in North Africa has once again shown that Turkey is a skilful foreign policy actor."
"In fact, Turkey is more skilful than the EU or its individual Member States."
"Since the 1990s, Turkey has built good neighbourly relations and stability in its region - on its borders with Europe, the South Caucasus, Central Asia and the Middle East."
"The young people in North Africa who are so keen to see reform are looking to Turkey."
"Turkey is a strong economic actor."
"Unlike the European economy, Turkey's economy is dynamic and is growing, in spite of the economic crisis and recession that has hit Europe and the rest of the world."
"This cannot be ignored."
"Today, when with bated breath and hope, we observe the revolutions that have overwhelmed some of the Arab countries, my conviction that Turkey's membership of the European Union is a geopolitically strategic necessity simply becomes stronger."
"Turkey is a democratic Islamic state, which can serve as an inspiring example to other Arab countries that wish to establish a democratic system of government founded on the rule of law and respect for human rights, while preserving their religious values."
"It worries me that we are sending the wrong signal to the citizens of Turkey and reinforcing the influence of anti-European and Islamic fundamentalist forces."
"We must recognise that by so doing, we are also doing a service to those who do not wish to see the European Union as the most important player on the world stage."
"We must face up to the truth and admit that Europe cannot currently compete in terms of economic development with such countries as China, India and Brazil."
"Admitting Turkey to our Union would make us larger and economically more powerful."
"We must also recognise Turkey's stabilising geopolitical significance."
"From the experience of Latvia, I know that adhesion negotiations are an important instrument for encouraging reform, which is why it is important for the EU to open negotiations on new chapters with Turkey."
"Turkey's wish to commence negotiations with the EU on the introduction of a visa-free regime is justified."
"Turkey's government has made significant strides, which is why I should like to emphasise that criticism in EU reports on Turkey's progress should be commensurate with an objective assessment of the country's achievements."
"Turkey has achieved remarkable economic growth, enabling it to progress in 10 years from the 27th to the 16th biggest economy in the world."
"It is the European Union's 7th biggest trade partner and the EU is Turkey's main trade partner."
"Roughly 88% of direct foreign investments in Turkey come from EU states, which indicates how solid our ties are."
"On the political front, it is a model of stability and democracy for Muslim states."
"Negotiations with Turkey should be given a boost."
"For example, I think that opening Negotiation Chapter 15, which is on energy, is important, including for EU Member States."
"Turkey's strategic importance to the Union's energy security must not be ignored at a time when we want to diversify supply sources, with the Nabucco gas pipeline project being a significant example of this."
"Therefore, I think that Turkey must be considerably involved, even prior to accession, in EU energy projects or in regional cooperation in the Black Sea and Mediterranean Sea region."
"in writing. - I voted for this report, which commends Turkish citizens and civil society for supporting Turkey's further democratisation and for their commitment to an open and pluralistic society, but notes Turkey's slow progress with regard to reforms and recalls that the Turkish Government has committed itself to undertaking comprehensive reforms, both with a view to fulfilling the Copenhagen criteria and for the sake of Turkey's own modernisation, and calls on the government to increase its efforts in that respect."
"There has been no change over the past year in Turkey's attitude towards either the European Union or Cyprus."
"Turkish colonisers and occupying troops are still on the island."
"It is important to note that the Turkish Cypriots in occupied Cyprus are demonstrating against Turkey, protesting about their financial hardship due to the presence of the Turkish occupying army."
"Referring in a statement to the Turkish Cypriot demonstrations, Turkish Prime Minister Erdoğan accepted that Turkey invaded Cyprus in order to serve its strategic interests."
"This resolution lectures Turkey on democracy."
"Such lectures are inappropriate."
"Barely two months ago, Parliament was welcoming the negotiations between the Commission and the dictator Colonel Gaddafi."
"And what about integration between the Union and Turkey?"
"As for its claim to draw a partner country's attention to the need for a separation of powers when this House demands no such thing within the Union, it is, in fact, unbearable."
"There is worse, however: this text threatens Turkey with the cessation of its EU accession negotiations if it fails to comply immediately with the Union's neoliberal dogma, and reminds it of the Copenhagen criteria."
"Anyone who has the general interest of the people at heart knows that this Europe needs to be changed before it is enlarged."
"I am opposed to any further accessions taking place until social dumping has been stopped, but I shall vote against this arrogant text."
"The possible accession of Turkey to the EU continues to be cause for major reservations."
"Its continuing occupation of part of Cyprus, its refusal to open ports and airports in the region, the violation of rights of political, religious and ethnic minorities, discrimination against women, the exclusion of political parties and the revocation of laws limiting the jurisdiction of military courts are some examples that demonstrate this."
"There are other fundamental issues."
"Most of Turkey is not geographically part of Europe."
"Turkey has an Islamic identity that is very different from the Judaeo-Christian identity of most EU countries; the secularity of the country is only held in place by military force."
"The movement of people from what would become the country with the largest population in the EU would create great imbalances in the labour market."
"None of this precludes acknowledgement of the efforts made by Turkey over recent years to meet certain criteria required by the EU, and it recognises the invaluable role that this country plays within NATO."
"A relevant consideration would be whether it would be better to guarantee Turkey privileged and preferential partnership status with the EU, rather than creating false expectations and hopes for membership, something that it would be difficult for the facts and circumstances to accommodate."
"I am in favour of Turkey's accession to the EU and welcome the progress the country has made to its citizens' benefit."
"However, at the same time, it should be mentioned that in order for Turkey to be able to accede as a Member State of the EU, it has to comply with the Copenhagen criteria and the obligations to the EU itself and to its Member States, like any other candidate country."
"It is necessary for Turkey to respect international law, and it must do much more in relation to the Kurdish problem, to acknowledgement of the Armenian genocide and to normalisation with its neighbouring countries."
"As such, Turkey must withdraw its occupying troops from the Republic of Cyprus."
"I believe that Turkey's eventual accession is of vital importance if the Union wishes to increase its political, strategic and economic influence at international level."
"Integrating that country into Europe will benefit Europeans at least as much as it benefits the Turks."
"We should not forget that Turkey is a traditionally secular country; it is powerful and has a wealth of human resources."
"It is a gateway to the markets and the energy routes of Asia and the Middle East."
"It is also totally reliable within NATO."
"Certain efforts made by the Turkish authorities with regard to respect for human rights deserve to be mentioned."
"Thus, the adoption of amendments to the constitution is a step in the direction of the democratic standards necessary for accession."
"Nevertheless, although the new radio and television laws are welcome advances, freedom of expression and, more specifically, freedom of the press, remain a cause for concern."
"Similarly, the resolution of the Cyprus issue is a prerequisite for any progress in the accession process."
"in writing. - Turkey's accession to EU is not within the strategic interest of EU until Turkey admits to the genocide of Armenians and withdraws its troops from Cyprus."
"I voted against the resolutions as a whole and against many separate odious points."
"The progress report on the accession negotiations with Turkey was, once again, more than sobering."
"Given the circumstances, however, what else could be expected?"
"Turkey is not a European country - geographically, culturally or historically - and it has a different approach to many issues for these reasons."
"All of this being the case, it always astounds me how this House manages to produce such politically correct and positive resolutions on this subject."
"The truth is never allowed to be stated and clear words are to be avoided if at all possible."
"It is really time to come clean with Turkey."
"It must be made clear to the Turks that they are our friends and partners in many areas but that accession to the EU is just not possible."
"Rational forces in Turkey have long since recognised that accession to the European Union is not the most worthwhile goal for them."
"In light of its location and the manifold connections with the Turkic peoples of the Caucasus and with the Arabs, Turkey is assuming an important strategic position in the Middle East."
"The EU should take account of this and recognise Turkey as an important strategic partner beyond its borders."
"I wonder how it is possible that this report does not mention a number of fundamental issues regarding Turkey, above all, the disastrous situation in Cyprus."
"In the northern, Turkish-controlled part of the island, systematic violations of basic rights are a common occurrence and Turkey is trying to bring in more settlements, which definitely will not help the peace process that we are hoping for."
"Another fundamental issue that astonishes me and that has not been adequately stressed is Turkey's obstinate refusal to acknowledge the Armenian genocide that took place last century."
"For these and other reasons, I voted against the report, just as I remain strongly and staunchly against Turkey's possible future accession to the European Union."
"The European Union needs Turkey and Turkey needs the EU."
"It is important not simply in terms of trade and economic ties and investments."
"Almost 100 years ago, Turkey turned to face Europe and it can and must become a bridge linking our continent with the Muslim world."
"Unfortunately, it has to be acknowledged that negotiations on Turkey's accession to the EU have slowed."
"The EU is waiting for progress, particularly as regards protecting human rights, gender equality and safeguarding freedom of expression, freedom of the press and religious freedoms."
"Normalisation of relations with Cyprus is another important issue."
"This conflict must be resolved in a manner that is favourable for both Turkey and Cyprus."
"It is important to reach a peaceful solution to the conflict."
"Events in North Africa demonstrate the important contribution Turkey has to make, spreading stability and democratic values."
"The people of Libya, Egypt and other Arab nations view Turkey and the EU as an example that they need to follow."
"I voted in favour of the report, because it is well balanced."
"It reflects well the state of Turkey's EU integration in 2010."
"I have always agreed with Turkish membership."
"However, this country would have to implement the Ankara Protocol and do more, particularly as regards minorities, women, press freedoms and the rule of law."
"I voted in favour of Parliament's resolution on Turkey's 2010 progress report."
"The Commission's annual report shows that the modernisation of Turkey towards a democratic and pluralist system is a slow and painful process but that the Turkish Government, citizens and civil society are working towards it."
"The domestic political squabbling over reforms does not ease the way to reaching European standards, but does, however, show a commitment to change and modernisation."
"Recent events in the Mediterranean show how important it is to assess the reforms and the situation step-by-step, avoiding taking simplistic stances on the issue."
"I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on the 2010 progress report on Turkey."
"Apart from anything else, it contains an important call on the Turkish Government to apply the bilateral readmission agreements entered into, pending the application of the readmission agreement between the EU and Turkey."
"This call is even more valuable in light of recent events in North Africa, which put Greece at the centre of the wave of immigration."
"This is a time when, wherever we are and wherever we stand, we need to highlight the immigration dangers that we may have to face; we cannot simply stand by and watch something that is already happening."
"As a candidate country, Turkey should cooperate with the EU so that, together with Greece and the other Member States, we can stem the flood of immigrants trying to enter the EU illegally."
"The motion for a resolution on Turkey draws attention to the situation on human rights."
"The constant stalemate between Turkey and Cyprus, the precarious dialogue between the political parties, the undermining of press freedom, women's rights and other fundamental rights are some of the factors which have resulted in slowing down the pace of the accession negotiations, according to the draft report."
"The negotiations are regarded as 'a long-lasting and open-ended process'."
"I think that Turkey's accession to the European Union must be seen as a strategic benefit for both parties: the EU and Turkey."
"This is why I call on the Turkish Government to step up the reform process in order to fulfil the accession criteria completely."
"The process of bringing Turkey closer to the objectives of the European Union has been, and will be, a long one."
"I have therefore always advocated the deepening of relations between the EU and Turkey through the gradual implementation of partnerships in various areas."
"I think that creating a long-term expectation of integration is not positive either for the EU or for Turkey."
"in writing. - Notwithstanding the progress mentioned during the debate, and the 'opening', problems remain in relation to women, minorities, freedom of opinion and the press, social imbalances, poverty, rights of the child, education, an independent judiciary and army intervention in politics."
"The EU Commission notes that despite legislative advances, 'however, senior members of the armed forces have made a number of statements going beyond their remit, in particular, on judicial issues'."
"It reached the following conclusion regarding the judiciary: 'Investigations in some high-profile cases continued to raise concerns."
"There are still many unresolved questions over Turkey's progress in the EU accession negotiations."
"First of all, the ongoing issue with Cyprus needs to be concluded between the Greek-Cypriot and Turkish-Cypriot communities, during which the withdrawal of Turkish troops will also be negotiated."
"These negotiations are currently going through a particularly delicate phase."
"In addition, major doubts must once again be raised over the cultural background of the country itself, which is closely tied to Islamic traditions - a long way from Europe's Catholic Christian roots."
"Although the report offers strong criticisms of the positions held by Turkey, the clear intention to have it join the European Union remains."
"We cannot support this for many reasons that show that this country has nothing in common with the rest of Europe: geographic position, religious belief, the militaristic decision to continue to occupy part of the European Union in northern Cyprus, the decline of the freedom of the press, limits on the freedom of expression, religious discrimination and the violation of women's rights take Turkey ever further away from Europe."
"To this day, religions other than Islam cannot open and operate places of worship, proselytise, form a clergy or have a legal personality."
"The Turkish Government does not wish to comply with the important European Union Treaties and protocols and it does not cooperate sufficiently in terms of controls on illegal immigration."
"For these reasons, I voted against the report."
"I have always supported Turkey's accession to the European Union, subject to adherence to the Copenhagen criteria and Turkey adopting the acquis communautaire in the proper manner."
"Today, I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on the progress report on Turkey."
"The resolution gives expression to a clear and balanced political message on the eve of the parliamentary elections."
"Turkey has delivered major efforts on the road to its membership, including the partial revision of its constitution, civilian control of the military and the partial reform of the judiciary."
"Further steps are necessary, however. The pace certainly needs to be stepped up, too."
"The European Parliament points out that better guaranteeing of human rights, including those of women and minorities, is crucial, as is an independent judiciary."
"In addition, emphasis must also be placed on guaranteeing the freedom of expression and, in particular, the freedom of the press, as this was recently put under pressure again as a result of the arrest of journalists."
"It is necessary, however, that Turkey be encouraged to fulfil the exemplary role that it can play in the democratisation process for the Arab world."
"I therefore find it regrettable that there are still crucial chapters in the accession negotiations that are being blocked by various Member States."
"in writing. - I supported this report which recognises the constitutional changes which have taken place in Turkey but also addresses areas which remain problematic, such as their failure to implement the Ankara Protocol."
"By encouraging Turkey to continue carrying out reforms, the European Parliament hopes to see improvements in human rights and equality laws which will benefit Turkish citizens."
"The progress report on Turkey very clearly shows up the weaknesses in the process in place hitherto."
"Turkey clearly lags behind expectations."
"There must also be no accession discounts, as the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance have been calling for."
"In this context, also, Mr Erdoğan's appearances in Germany, where he called on the Turks in Germany to un-integrate, must be viewed in a critical light."
"Such speeches are not helpful for good cooperation and represent a snub to the efforts of both Germany and the Union."
"Furthermore, there is still much to be desired in relation to the freedom of the press and the resolution of the Cyprus issue."
"in writing. - I have been consistently supportive of Turkey's accession process while fully aware of serious concerns that have to be addressed."
"The Progress Report 2010 is a reasonably balanced document and I have voted in favour of it in spite of a number of reservations - not least over the Cyprus issue, where I much regret that the amendments calling for fulfilment of the EU Council's promise to end the isolation of Northern Cyprus were voted down."
"Turkey has a pivotal role to play as a gateway between West and East and we should be sending positive and welcoming signals."
"I voted in favour of the 2010 progress report on Turkey, which turned out to be clearly negative."
"According to the report, over the past 5 years, Turkey has made hardly any progress worth mentioning in its process of reform or in meeting the EU's accession criteria."
"There are still considerable failings in the fields of human rights, freedom of the press and of opinion, and women's rights."
"As a member of the High-Level Contact Group for Relations with the Turkish Cypriot Community in the Northern Part of the Island of Cyprus, I am well aware that the same applies to the unresolved problem of Cyprus."
"I voted in favour of this report, but I did so only because it very specifically makes clear that there is no progress in the accession negotiations with Turkey."
"On the contrary, indeed, essentially what we have is a standstill or even steps backwards in relation to the observance of civil and human rights, freedom of religion, of assembly and of the press, and on the Cyprus issue."
"In fact, Turkey's new foreign policy direction, for example, as relates to Iran and Syria, gives rise to doubts about whether Turkey's Prime Minister Erdoğan is really serious when he talks about moving closer to Europe."
"Furthermore, it remains unclear how the billions of euro of pre-accession aid paid to Turkey are being spent."
"There is only one conclusion from all of this, and that is that the accession negotiations must be halted."
"Turkey remains one of the EU's most important partners. The idea of its full membership, however, is becoming increasingly illusory."
"I am in favour of this resolution as I am convinced that Montenegro should become an example of success for the EU in the Balkans, as it meets all the conditions established by the Commission to begin the accession process."
"However, I am concerned about the prevailing corruption, particularly in construction, privatisation and public procurement sectors, and, more seriously, discrimination against minorities and the most vulnerable groups."
"The independence of the media should also be a concern."
"I voted in favour of this resolution on the European integration process of Montenegro."
"The European Parliament approves of the reforms being made by Montenegro and welcomes the progress made in the European integration process."
"On 17 December 2010, the European Council took the decision to grant Montenegro the status of candidate country for accession to the European Union."
"I share the regret expressed in the resolution over the decoupling of candidate status from the right to open negotiations."
"It is important that the decision to start these negotiations should not be unduly or unreasonably postponed."
"I expect the negotiations to start at the latest after the publication of the 2011 Commission Progress Report, provided Montenegro makes good progress in fulfilling the benchmarks set by the Commission."
"The European Union strongly supports the progress made in the enlargement process but notes that major challenges remain in most of the countries concerned."
"This resolution concerns the case of Montenegro."
"I supported it as I believe it is balanced: it emphasises the fact that Montenegro has made real progress, not only in economic terms, but also in terms of the fight against corruption."
"While Montenegro must, of course, continue its efforts, I feel it is only right for it to be granted the official status of candidate country for accession to the European Union."
"I voted in favour of this resolution."
"The European Council reaffirmed that the future of the Western Balkans lies with the European Union and that the growth and stability of this region is particularly important."
"Judging by the progress made by Montenegro in various areas, it is clear that the country is taking preparations for European integration seriously."
"The government and opposition parties in Montenegro have reached a general consensus as regards European integration and have made it a high priority."
"The report also shows that Instrument for Pre-Accession (IPA) assistance works well in Montenegro and that there has been significant judicial and administrative reform."
"Montenegro is successfully engaging in regional cooperation, is a constructive regional partner, and is playing a stabilising role in the Western Balkans region."
"The report sets out the reasons why Europe should not want Montenegro to join the European Union."
"Rampant corruption, ongoing serious social discrimination against women and several ethnic minorities, media pluralism standards that fall far short of European levels and the entrenched presence of organised crime in the economic and political life of the country."
"Furthermore, I cannot even support the Council's basic position regarding the accession of Balkan countries to the EU."
"It is a political and strategic absurdity to think of Europe as the inevitable destiny of the countries of the former Yugoslavia."
"It seems that recent experience does not count at the top levels of our institutions."
"Trying at all costs to speed up enlargement, including economically weak and politically unstable countries, certainly has not helped the consolidation of the European project."
"Indeed, it has weakened its structure, slowed down decision-making processes and complicated the development of shared policies in crucial areas for the life of our continent."
"I therefore voted against this report which, although it emphasises the multiple problems underlying the process of Montenegro's accession, retains the basic idea of giving this country the opportunity of joining the EU."
"I welcome the concern and commitment shown by the government and opposition parties of Montenegro in relation to European integration."
"The results of this process are the institution of the country's legal and constitutional framework, which has almost been finalised, along with the economic reforms that have been undertaken."
"However, there are a number of aspects to improve, including corruption, organised crime, discrimination and the freedom of the press."
"I would like to call upon this state to continue along this route, which I hope will soon end in processes of negotiation being opened."
"Montenegro has shown that it wants to continue with its European choice."
"I welcome the determination of its leaders and the changes which have been taking place in the country to bring it up to European standards, particularly with regard to democracy, human rights and respect for the rule of law."
"Despite the progress which has been seen, it is still clear that the country still has some way to go before being fit to join the European Union."
"I hope that the determination of Montenegro will continue to be felt and that, rather than nominally or formally converging with the EU, Montenegro will improve living conditions for its people and improve the functioning of its institutions so that it can become a prosperous state."
"The European institutions have recognised the strategic interest of EU enlargement to the Balkans on a number of occasions."
"The accession of new states depends on various factors. The first of these is the interest expressed by the state, followed by a pledge to comply with a set of fundamental rights for citizens."
"As the Republic of Montenegro has expressed its interest in acceding to the EU, the Council decided to confer candidate country status on this state on 17 December 2010."
"In fact, as stated in this report, Montenegro has been making a number of reforms, particularly the creation of a new legal and constitutional framework, and in the fight against corruption."
"Nevertheless, there are areas in which more progress is needed, such as the freedom of the press and respect for the work of non-governmental organisations."
"I am voting for this Parliament resolution on the process of integration for the Republic of Montenegro, which recommends that the process of integration be speeded up."
"I would like to call upon the Montenegrin authorities to continue to make an effort to fulfil the established objectives, as this country is an important neighbour for the EU, and one with which we would like to collaborate."
"In the case of Montenegro, it is becoming clear that the direction and meaning of the processes of EU enlargement are intended to satisfy the designs of the major EU powers and their interests, which serve their large corporations: namely, the extension of markets, access to and control of geostrategic locations, and manual labour that can be exploited and used to further devalue the workforce in the EU countries as a whole."
"As the peripheral regions created as a result of successive processes of enlargement are exhausted, it is necessary to create others."
"Many promises are being made today to the people of Montenegro, as they have been to others in the past and present."
"However, the price is high, and it has only partially been divulged."
"In this particular case, it is important not to forget that the process of breaking up Yugoslavia was carried out by NATO and the EU powers, which are today seeking to attract Montenegro into an accession to the EU that is the successor to that process."
"We are facing yet another episode in the process of the total disintegration of Yugoslavia, and what remains of it."
"This time, it is Montenegro's turn."
"The major powers of NATO and the EU, having imposed strangulatory economic and financial measures on Yugoslavia, with the support of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, supported ethnic divisions which ended in war and the hasty creation of new 'sovereign states'."
"The future integration of Montenegro into the EU is the successor of that process and the attack on the achievements of socialism, with a view to satisfying the interests of economic and financial interest groups by exploiting the workforce, through the market, and through the geostrategic locations and natural resources of these countries."
"Now the promises are huge."
"The EU beckons with millions of euro in so-called 'aid' and development."
"However, how much will this cost and when will it arrive, if indeed it does?"
"Our experience is that 25 years of Portugal's capitalist integration in the EU demonstrate that the promised progress is never achieved."
"What is achieved is the destruction of manufacturing and employment, the exploitation of workers, the destruction of public services, debt and foreign dependence."
"This is why we have out doubts about this process."
"The enlargement process of the European Union continues on exclusively geographical premises and, as I have already stated in this House, the Council is being hasty in granting the status of candidate country for accession before the countries in question reach democratic quality standards that at least approach a basically adequate level."
"Corruption, smuggling, organised crime and violations of the freedom of the press are just some of the factors that lead me to think that Montenegro is still a long way from Europe."
"These reasons really seem sufficient to not support this resolution, which traces the guidelines for the European future of the Balkans irrespective of the area's tangible problems."
"The decision to grant candidate status to Montenegro was primarily political."
"Montenegro would probably have had to wait longer for it, if not for the fact that this issue was being considered at the same time in relation to Albania."
"However, the comparison works to the advantage of Montenegro, of course."
"Nevertheless, many of the reservations applying to Montenegro 'carry over' from one annual report to the next, and we see from the Commission statement that politicisation of the state bureaucracy, independence of the judiciary, organised crime and the environment are now 'regular features'."
"There is no fundamental progress in sight regarding the fight against all-pervasive corruption."
"We must not underestimate this."
"In the given circumstances, it is therefore a good solution to grant Montenegro candidate status without setting a deadline for the start of accession talks."
"The EU has already adopted a similar approach towards the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in 2005."
"The difference is that overcoming the barrier which confronts the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia requires the agreement of two states."
"Montenegro's fate, meanwhile, is entirely in its own hands."
"I presume that all of this was made very clear in the recent talks between Herman van Rompuy, José Manuel Barroso and Jerzy Buzek and the new leader of Montenegro, Igor Lukšić, the world's youngest premier."
"Nobody likes to be led by the nose for too long."
"This also applies to a country which, despite the fact that it is not in the EU, has been using the euro as its national currency for many years now."
"I voted in favour of this document because a general consensus and high priority has been given to European integration by the government and opposition parties in Montenegro, which has resulted in good progress in the reform process since the independence of the country."
"I welcome the fact that Montenegro was granted the status of candidate country for accession to the European Union and Montenegrin citizens have been granted the possibility to travel without visas (full visa liberalisation) to the EU Schengen area."
"I welcome the fact that the process of establishing the legal and constitutional framework of the country has almost been finalised and there has been good progress in adopting important legislation in the field of fighting corruption, as well as progress in reform of the judiciary."
"However, there is still a need to continue to reform public administration, strengthen human resources at the local level of administration and combat organised crime, particularly money laundering and smuggling."
"The media sector must be able to operate without political interference and it is necessary to guarantee the independence of regulatory bodies."
"I voted in favour of the resolution, which promotes the integration of Montenegro into the European system, because we have all witnessed that this country has made notable progress towards adopting proper processes and instruments."
"These are necessary steps not only for joining the EU but also to give a judicial, civil and social structure to a country that must develop in compliance with the regulations and in view of shared growth at the various levels of administration."
"Montenegro has already launched important reforms that are therefore heading in the right direction, which also involves creating an administrative structure capable of making effective future use of Structural Funds, which will benefit this country greatly."
"Ahead of the start of the much anticipated negotiations, many fellow Members and I hope to create a suitable environment for the citizens of Montenegro, free from corruption and bursting with initiatives for democratic growth."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of the resolution in order to acknowledge Montenegro's progress towards European integration and highlight the remaining goals to be achieved for the benefit of its people."
"When the resolution was in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, I contributed amendments concerning the efficiency and predictability of the justice system."
"The publication of all judgments and the unification of jurisprudence should be priorities in order to ensure public trust and a predictable judicial system."
"Increased funding for courts to work fast and efficiently and consistent measures for training judges are also necessary."
"The efficiency of the EU funds spent in the area of justice reform and the combating of corruption must be assessed."
"The consistency of the rule of law throughout a nation is vital to its ability to progress politically and democratically."
"in writing. - I voted for this report, which welcomes the general consensus and high priority given to European integration by the government and opposition parties in Montenegro, which has resulted in good progress in the reform process since the independence of the country, and which welcomes the new political leadership in Podgorica and encourages the new government to continue Montenegro's European integration process and speed up the reforms leading to fulfilment of the Copenhagen criteria."
"It also welcomes the European Council decision of 17 December 2010 to grant Montenegro the status of candidate country for accession to the European Union, but regrets, however, the decoupling of candidate status from the right to open negotiations, stressing that the decision to start them should not be unduly or unreasonably postponed, and expects the negotiations to start at the latest after the publication of the 2011 Commission Progress Report, provided Montenegro makes good progress in fulfilling the benchmarks set by the Commission."
"This resolution supports the obligation for the people of Montenegro to submit to the Copenhagen criteria and accelerated privatisations."
"The Union has been reduced to an aggressive and pretentious liberal doctrine."
"I want no part of it. I shall vote against."
"As a candidate for future accession to the EU, Montenegro has demonstrated its willingness to pursue its choice of Europe through the determination of its leaders and the changes which have been taking place in the country in order to bring it closer to European requirements, particularly with regard to democracy, human rights and respect for the rule of law."
"However, despite the progress that has been made, this is not yet enough, and Montenegro has to continue to make efforts before it is fit to join the European Union."
"I hope that this determination will continue to bear fruit and that joining the EU will become a reality, so that Montenegro can give its people better living conditions and improve the functioning of its authorities in order to become an increasingly better state."
"I am in favour of starting discussions on the accession of Montenegro to the EU, inasmuch as I am in favour of expansion on principle."
"Nevertheless, I have been unable to vote for this resolution as the Commission is demanding a series of reforms from Montenegro that are in line with the EU's neoliberal policies, such as the privatisation of the public sector and the adaptation of the education system to the Bologna Process."
"For all the above reasons, I did not vote for the report, but rather abstained."
"Ever since it gained independence in 2006, Montenegro has clearly demonstrated its desire to join the European Union: the euro was officially adopted in 2006, and a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) has been in force since 1 May 2010."
"Montenegro's accession to the Union will bring greater political, economic and social stability to the country and will increase the stability of the Balkan region."
"Indeed, I welcome Montenegro's efforts to become a constructive partner in the field of regional cooperation, notably as a result of the various regional agreements it has concluded with its neighbours in the areas of readmission and extradition and in judicial and police matters."
"The consolidation of peace and stability benefits not only the region but also Europe as a whole."
"I therefore call for accession negotiations to begin as soon as possible, particularly since the European Council granted Montenegro the status of candidate country at the end of December 2010."
"Montenegro's efforts to meet the accession criteria are going well, even though substantial progress still needs to be made, in particular, regarding corruption and organised crime, freedom of information and gender equality."
"in writing. - Although the Committee on Foreign Affairs welcomes the European Council's decision to grant Montenegro candidate status, serious problems remain as regards corruption, especially where the building industry, privatisation and the state procurement sector are concerned."
"There are still problems as regards minorities and unprotected groups as well."
"It would be correct to supervise the implementation of Parliament's recommendations to Montenegro, and if these recommendations are implemented, I believe that the accession of a country like Montenegro can only be a benefit to the EU."
"There is constantly a tension that is not always easily reconcilable between respect for human rights and other national interests (perhaps of a military or economic nature)."
"Even the United States and the European Union step over this fine line from time to time, as can be seen from the infringement of civil liberties and data protection in the context of the fight against terrorism."
"The EU must therefore stand up more strongly and consistently for human rights within and outside the Union."
"Outside the Union, I have in mind especially the protection of Christian minorities in Islamic countries and in Asia."
"I therefore voted for this motion for a resolution."
"Today, the European Parliament adopted the resolution on the European integration process of Montenegro."
"Enlargement of the EU to include the Western Balkans was confirmed as long ago as 2003 in Athens, which is why Parliament has expressed the hope that accession negotiations will begin before the end of this year."
"In the resolution, attention is drawn to the significant improvement in the political and social situation in Montenegro, and also to Montenegro's positive approach to European integration."
"Unfortunately, Montenegro has still not overcome the problem of corruption and organised crime."
"In my opinion, a very important and so far also unresolved problem is the question of discrimination against ethnic groups and also against women, who are under-represented in decision-making processes and in public administration."
"Another positive feature is the country's fight against censorship and its attempts to guarantee freedom of expression."
"However, attacks on journalists and activists are still being reported."
"EU integration is the main driving force behind Montenegro's progress."
"This country has achieved a lot in the last 12 months, successfully implementing structural and economic reforms, and effectively combating corruption and organised crime."
"Ethnic minorities live together peacefully in Montenegro and the country successfully promotes good neighbourhood relations."
"The EU and Montenegro therefore signed a Stabilisation and Association Agreement."
"I voted in favour of this resolution, because it rightly indicates further steps to reform Montenegro."
"It is necessary to make progress in the establishment of the rule of law, to continue to implement administrative reforms, improve the capacities of civil servants, amend electoral law, and strengthen civil society and the independent media."
"It is important for the country to maintain the momentum and to continue the work it has begun."
"Montenegro became one of the official candidate countries for accession to the European Union last December 2010, but no date has yet been established for the start of proper negotiations."
"I support the spirit of the resolution where it compliments the government of Montenegro in light of the priority being given to reforms linked to the integration process and, despite the problems still to be resolved, it expresses hope for official negotiations to begin within the year."
"In terms of bringing the Balkans closer to the European Union, Montenegro is the country that offers the best socio-political situation."
"This is why I voted in favour of the resolution, since I think that the accession to the EU of Montenegro and the other Balkan countries is of fundamental strategic importance for Europe in terms of the stability of the region itself, for its own development, and for the resources that it offers."
"I acknowledge the effort that has been made by Montenegro, particularly with regard to legal reforms, the struggle against corruption and the fight against different types of discrimination, but I would like to stress that this work needs to be continued and intensified."
"However, there is still a wide range of matters that require particular attention."
"I am referring to economic issues in particular, and the need to apply new structural changes, despite the success of the economic reforms, which has been exposed by the financial crisis."
"I would like to add one final remark on an issue that I hold dear: the need for improvement in the quality of legislation drafted in Parliament."
"in writing. - In general, this report is good and well balanced. The report addresses all relevant policy fields."
"Montenegro, which became a candidate country in December 2010, is still waiting for negotiations to start."
"The report criticises this fact in paragraph 2: 'regrets the decoupling of candidate status from the right to open negotiations and stresses that the decision to start them should not be unduly or unreasonably postponed'."
"The rapporteur expects negotiations to start after the 2011 progress report."
"Some interesting points are on IPA (paragraph 5), corruption (paragraph 8), freedom of information (paragraph 10), organised crime (paragraph 14) and anti-discrimination (paragraphs 17-22)."
"Many paragraphs are devoted to the issue of anti-discrimination and touch on all relevant aspects such as Roma, Ashkali, Egyptians (paragraphs 17 and 22), LGBT (paragraph 17), women and domestic violence (paragraphs 17-19), ethnic issues (paragraph 21) and civil society (paragraphs 5, 10, 23, 24 and 32)."
"In general, the report is very positive on the role of CSO and devotes many paragraphs to the issue. The most important are paragraphs 23, 24 and 32."
"In these paragraphs, the report 'reiterates the importance of active and independent civil society organisations for democracy' and 'encourages the Montenegrin Government to have close collaboration and regular dialogue with NGOs'."
"Ever since Montenegro officially became a candidate country for accession to the European Union on 17 December 2010, the country's government has immediately given priority to reforms that can accelerate the European integration process."
"There are still some problems to resolve, such as electoral reform, and reform of the public administration and the legal system, but the report makes it clear that Montenegro is making progress."
"Italy fully supports the European aspirations of this country, since it believes that the accession of Montenegro and the Western Balkans meets a basic interest of the EU in that it promotes stability, regional cooperation and development in a crucial geographical area for our continent."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this resolution which would see Montenegro achieve candidate status for the European Union."
"It also highlights the issues of equality and corruption which need to be tackled within Montenegro and calls for measures to be taken to tackle these problems."
"I voted for the motion for a resolution, because the report states quite clearly that since gaining its independence in 2006, Montenegro has made significant progress in internal reforms."
"However, we must not be blind to the fact that there are, as always, serious problems with corruption and organised crime, freedom of expression and discrimination."
"Nevertheless, at the same time, the report explains that the government of Montenegro is prepared to tackle these problem areas effectively, and has introduced a package of suitable and appropriate measures."
"I voted in favour because I think the process of European integration in Montenegro can meet a fundamental strategic interest of the European Union, namely, promoting and seeking to guarantee stability and development in a crucial geographic area for our continent."
"At the same time, this accession may strengthen the fight against organised crime originating from the Balkan area."
"It also needs to be highlighted that during the process of bringing the Balkan countries closer to the Union, Montenegro has long expressed strong domestic consensus on the European outlook and shown a mature and conciliatory attitude to neighbouring States."
"I voted for this report because the values of European integration require that the EU be free of prejudice and discrimination in order for human rights to be respected."
"This discrimination is exacerbated by the current economic crisis, and the integration of the Roma population should be seen as the joint responsibility of the European institutions, the Member States and the regions, making use of all the resources available to the EU to address this situation."
"The Commission should play a leading role in this process, paying particular attention to requests for technical assistance and, above all, presenting a strategy that includes the defence of human rights, the right to education and training, culture, employment, sports, adequate housing, healthcare and better sanitation for the Roma population as priority areas."
"Moreover, efforts should be made to increase political and civic participation by the Roma, starting with the youngest."
"I voted in favour of this resolution on the EU strategy on Roma inclusion."
"Roma are Europe's largest ethnic minority, but they are also very isolated and, therefore, almost completely disconnected from national economies."
"I agree with the rapporteur's opinion that the inclusion of Roma is a necessary investment, because it is cheaper to integrate Roma than to sustain their substandard socio-economic conditions."
"Another important dimension that I would like to underline is the fact that the overall inclusion of Roma is essentially an issue of human rights."
"A significant proportion of European Roma face such substandard conditions - almost totally disconnected from the economy, resulting in their exclusion from basic human rights - that fostering social inclusion cannot be viewed within the framework of general policy rectifications, but must be handled as bridging one of the largest gaps in the fulfilment of constitutional and human rights in Europe."
"By approving this strategy, the European Parliament has taken the first step towards promoting the social and economic inclusion of Roma, and now the Council and the Commission must take the necessary action to ensure that this strategy is successfully implemented."
"Approximately 10-12 million Roma reside in the European Union."
"Many suffer discrimination and social exclusion."
"They are, for the most part, European citizens, and the EU must establish a strategy for integrating them."
"That is why I voted in favour of this text."
"It provides for an action plan based on the fundamental values of equality, access to rights, non-discrimination and gender equality, drawing on the Structural Funds already available."
"The Roma situation in the EU is rather complicated."
"A large proportion of Europe's 10-12 million Roma have suffered systematic discrimination and are therefore struggling against an intolerable degree of social, cultural and economic exclusion as well as human rights violations."
"Furthermore, a significant proportion of the Roma community live in regions which are among the least economically and socially advanced in the Union, and therefore Roma children often do not have access to education and training systems, which later leads to them being discriminated against in the labour market and prevented from integrating into society."
"The EU has developed a range of useful tools, mechanisms and funds to foster the inclusion of Roma, but these are scattered across policy areas and, therefore, their effect and benefit remain limited."
"I agree that the Member States must improve the implementation of the EU strategy on Roma inclusion and ensure the full transposition and application of all related directives and EU law, thereby preventing Roma segregation and discrimination."
"The European Charter of Fundamental Rights prohibits discrimination on grounds of sex, race, colour or ethnic or social origin, genetic characteristics, language, religion or beliefs, political or other opinions, membership of a national minority, wealth, birth, disability, age or sexual orientation, as well as on grounds of nationality."
"There are approximately 10-12 million Roma in Europe, most of them European citizens, who suffer from systematic discrimination and who are victims of intolerance."
"The integration of the Roma population is the responsibility of all the Member States and European institutions."
"This report urges the Member States to cooperate with the European Union and the representatives of the Roma community to develop integrated policies, using the resources available within the European Union, under existing Structural Funds, to support the integration of the Roma community, as it is less costly to integrate the Roma than to sustain their insecure socio-economic conditions."
"The harmonious integration of Roma communities involves the participation of everyone: the Roma themselves, and their host community."
"For this reason, I supported this report."
"The adoption by a very large majority of Mrs Járóka's report is an additional political signal confirming that the European Union is aware of its responsibility towards this ethnic minority, which is the largest one in Europe, as well as the most persecuted one."
"The report highlights priority areas that must feature in the strategy, such as the fight to have the Roma people's fundamental rights respected."
"The strategy must focus on education, but it must also prevent extreme marginalisation and avoid the reproduction of inequalities."
"Finally, the strategy must establish innovative ways of providing genuine access to the labour market and to affordable, healthy housing."
"The current challenge, as mentioned in the report, is to ensure that EU funds are fully absorbed and are used in a way that will benefit the Roma people."
"Indeed, the instruments are there but they are utilised particularly badly."
"Roma inclusion is a matter for Europe."
"It is now up to the European Commission to draft final proposals on the basis of our vote today."
"While respecting the principle of subsidiarity, the Union must fully perform its role as a driving force and unite the actors involved at all levels so as to increase the beneficial effect of EU funds and make the Roma fully fledged European citizens at last."
"Basically, the report on Roma inclusion does not bear in mind the difficulties faced in the social integration of Roma if one considers the fact that often, it is the Roma community itself that does not want to integrate in the social fabric of our countries."
"This is a cultural factor that cannot be denied or ignored: Roma have their own traditions and customary ways of life which makes it difficult to integrate them in social environments characterised by processes, lifestyles and habits very different from their own."
"It therefore remains a fact that any Roma integration policy will have to deal with this obstacle: their actual desire or willingness to integrate."
"Quite aside from sociological considerations, I must recall that given these and other difficulties, the policies proposed in the reports on Roma communities will require an enormous disbursement of funds by the EU and the Member States, without achieving the desired result in the end."
"Without mincing words, that is what has happened so far and there are no reasons to believe that the situation will change from here on in."
"I have therefore voted against the report."
"I voted in favour of this report, because Roma living in Europe need the support of the European Union (EU)."
"The EU strategy on Roma inclusion proposes setting compulsory minimum standards of education, employment, housing and healthcare."
"Nevertheless, a significant proportion of European Roma face such substandard conditions, being almost totally disconnected from the economy, resulting in their exclusion from basic human rights."
"Therefore, the strategy proposed by the European Parliament gives priority to Roma employment and improving education, housing and social security."
"It is important to ensure the abolition of the segregation of Roma children in schools and classrooms."
"It is also very important to encourage Roma to become involved in all areas of public and political life and to participate in the work of non-governmental organisations."
"In order to implement the strategy on Roma inclusion, it is indispensable that the strategy must, above all, be an internal EU strategy, and the general oversight of priority areas and objectives must be within the Community structures, with an annual report on the progress of the strategy and the evaluation of results."
"The 10-12 million Roma should enjoy minimum standards at EU level so that they can have access to jobs and education."
"The European Parliament resolution, which endeavours to influence the future strategy on the inclusion of the Roma, offers better protection for fundamental rights, as well as increased EU funding."
"Romania understands perfectly well the difficulties, but also the indolence of this minority."
"The European Union ought to be aware that there is a very high level of resistance to change within this ethnic group, including social inclusion."
"The Roma have been victims of discrimination down the centuries but, at the same time, of self-exclusion as well."
"This assessment is very fair, but it needs to be realised that, very often, the solutions which we come up with are inadequate or not understood by the Roma."
"The future EU strategy on the Roma minority must obviously emphasise compliance with, and the promotion of, the fundamental rights to work, housing, health and, in particular, to education, even in spite of resistance from parents."
"However, no one must expect change to occur quickly."
"Several generation changes will probably be required for this minority to assume certain rules of social coexistence."
"A basic precondition for drawing up any kind of sensible strategy on Roma inclusion is to collect and provide data on the socio-economic situation of the Roma (chiefly education, health, housing and employment)."
"Both Member States and international organisations (the International Organisation for Migration and the OECD) should therefore focus on these issues in greater detail, and help to set concrete objectives relating to, for example, the percentage of the Roma community completing secondary and tertiary education or employed in the civil service or represented in various areas of social and political life."
"It is then up to the Commission to set out a clear and manageable EU strategy for Roma inclusion on the basis of this data."
"We might consider establishing performance bonuses for the EU strategy on the Roma minority, within the framework of the cohesion policy."
"In any case, there is a need to draw up more effective methods for monitoring the spending of EU resources specifically designated for marginal groups of citizens."
"In the interests of Roma inclusion, it is also perhaps necessary to make use of the funding options provided by the PROGRESS programme, the lifelong learning programme, the cultural programme (2007-2013) and the public health programme (2008-2013)."
"In this context, the Commission should provide the European Parliament with a list of projects benefiting the Roma which it has funded since 2000, and set out the results achieved by these projects."
"I am pleased with the commitment that the EU has demonstrated in establishing binding standards that guarantee the Roma community access to education, employment, housing and healthcare."
"This initiative addresses not only the human values inherent in the social inclusion of ethnic minorities, but also the economic progress stimulated by the fall in unemployment."
"I agree with the measures proposed under this integration strategy, in particular, the fight against undeclared work and the increase in Roma teachers."
"It is important that the community itself be included in the integration process, so as to ensure sustainable development from the inside out, encouraging a desire for a positive role in society, instead of imposing it."
"This process should also focus on all forms of the violation of fundamental rights, with particular attention to social exclusion and discrimination in public life."
"The issue of Roma inclusion is a major challenge that the European Union must take up."
"This report is along the right lines, as it shows the European Parliament's will to fully contribute to this end."
"in writing. - I voted for this report as Europe's 10-12 million Roma should benefit from binding minimum standards at EU level to improve their access to employment, education, housing and healthcare."
"The resolution, which seeks to influence the Commission's upcoming strategy for Roma inclusion, also calls for better protection of fundamental rights and use of EU funding."
"I hope EU governments now respond to this strong message from Parliament."
"I support the rapporteur, Mrs Járóka, when she advocates a coordinated EU policy, complementing existing legislation, to promote the integration of European citizens belonging to the Roma ethnic group - estimated by the Council as numbering between 10 and 16 million - that provides for the adoption of anti-racist and anti-discriminatory measures."
"The implementation and correct application of this policy should also be ensured."
"Measures should also be adopted, however, to respond to the specific needs of the Roma and to promote their socio-economic inclusion, such as the right to work, housing, education, healthcare and others."
"In addition to the humanitarian aspect of Roma integration, this should also enable an increase in the workforce to support the social security system, and reduce the social and healthcare benefits guaranteed by the state to those living in poverty, not to mention the possibility that crime rates may be reduced."
"Integration should take into account the protection of children and should respect the law."
"A common European solution is needed to a common European problem, taking an integrated and cross-sectoral approach that enables aid for and specific intervention in the most underdeveloped areas, and in those with severe structural disadvantages."
"We have just adopted by a large majority the EU strategy on Roma inclusion."
"This is a strong political signal confirming that the European Union is aware of its responsibility towards this minority, which is the largest one in Europe, as well as the most persecuted one."
"The European Union and the Member States must tackle the disgraceful segregation suffered by the Roma head-on."
"This report stresses the importance of respecting the fundamental rights of the Roma and, in particular, access to education."
"To avoid any risk of marginalisation, it is also important to implement innovative policies on genuine access to employment, and to enable these people, the vast majority of whom are permanently settled, to access decent and affordable housing. The EU funds are there."
"They must be used in a way that will benefit the Roma."
"It is now up to the European Commission to draft final provisions based on the proposals in this report in a coherent manner with the principle of subsidiarity and with one aim: to ensure that the Roma become fully fledged European citizens."
"Parliament has adopted a good text. It emphasises Europe's important role in ensuring the social inclusion of the Roma within the European Union, with the application of this strategy at local level."
"The report points out that a strategy for the Roma is possible only with the cooperation of members of the community - in short, we must work 'with' before we work 'for'."
"The Roma should therefore be involved in any decision making."
"The text points out the difficult living conditions, discrimination and difficulties in accessing essential services that the Roma suffer. It points out the need to ensure respect for the freedom of movement of European citizens."
"It also mentions the importance, in social inclusion terms, of social protection, vocational training, education and public service provision."
"It denounces the insufficient allocation of funds, when the money could be put to good use."
"However, the real drawback of this report is the insistence by the conservatives in the European Parliament on mentioning the need to combat the Roma people's so-called 'prolonged dependence' on the social welfare system."
"This is a scandalous prejudice aimed once again at marginalising the Roma community."
"I am delighted that the European Parliament has adopted the Járóka report by an overwhelming majority."
"The report states the need to combat the exclusion of, and discrimination against, the Roma, to promote their social, cultural and economic integration, to better protect their fundamental rights and to make better use of European funds."
"Parliament has defined its priorities, on which there is a consensus."
"Parliament calls for an EU action plan in this area, wants EU funds to be harnessed, and proposes the adoption of a crisis map, to show where Roma populations are concentrated."
"As far as specific measures are concerned, one can mention access to education, which is as much a priority for the Roma people as it is for anyone else."
"Furthermore, we must monitor the use of EU funds to ensure that the money actually reaches the intended recipients."
"Parliament has also made strong calls for EU bodies to be set up under the supervision of the current Roma Task Force, with the aim of providing EU financial assistance to relevant local initiatives and of identifying and reporting in good time any misuse of funds."
"Furthermore, the scope of the funding should be extended to projects aimed at improving public services as well."
"I voted for this report because I think that an EU-level strategy for integrating the Roma minority is a positive and welcome step."
"This community needs special attention at European level, given the persistent problems with social and economic integration, along with the particular level of mobility among its members."
"However, I think that the biggest effort is still to be made."
"Strategies and actions plans for Roma integration have been and are available at every level, but it is their proper implementation that is lacking."
"To ensure its success, this new strategy must be implemented in the most appropriate manner."
"With this in mind, I think that a structured dialogue between the Roma communities, non-governmental sector and local authorities must provide the basis for the future strategy's implementation."
"I voted in favour of this report because I believe that the inclusion of the Roma does not just have to do with moral imperatives or the European Union's human rights obligations."
"A number of studies prove that the exclusion of these European citizens has socio-economic costs for the Member States."
"The social inclusion of the Roma is a necessary investment, and will be of financial benefit in the long term."
"Historically, the Roma have been the target of discrimination and hostility from the majority populations of the Member States."
"Much discrimination also still persists within Roma communities themselves, and the strategy urgently needs to seek to remedy this, rather than simply not hiding it."
"I believe that an EU strategy in favour of the integration of the Roma, as for any other disadvantaged ethnic minority group, is to be welcomed."
"I also believe that it is likely to succeed if it is supported by the active involvement of the very people whom it aims to integrate."
"Without the participation, interaction and commitment of all players in this common effort, the strategy will run the risk of being nothing more than a statement of good intentions."
"Much remains to be done to reverse the trend of discrimination towards the Roma."
"I hope that the strategy's success will eventually justify the slowness of its elimination."
"This report covers the development of an EU strategy on Roma inclusion."
"It is a very useful and encouraging document which was compiled jointly by the Commission and Parliament, and its recommendations address the objectives set out in the Europe 2020 strategy as regards reducing poverty and combating social exclusion, so as to foster inclusive growth throughout the EU."
"The Roma population has highly dynamic demographics, unlike other ethnic groups, and it is thought that in some countries, such as Hungary, they will make up more than 50% of the economically active population by 2050."
"Their integration is therefore imperative, not only in ethical terms, as it is a human rights issue, but also for the sustainability of social security systems, It has been shown that this does not represent a cost, but rather a 'necessary and financially profitable investment in the long run'."
"Sometimes, the costs of exclusion are greater than those of inclusion, when we take account of the benefits that this brings."
"I welcome the adoption of this report, and I welcome the recommendation that the Commission take on the role of overseeing and monitoring Member States' compliance with this strategy."
"The resolution adopted advocates the adoption of an EU strategy for Roma integration, along with the development of an inclusive action plan based on the fundamental values of equality, the exercising of rights, non-discrimination and equality."
"The aim is to ensure that the Roma community has real access to education, jobs, housing, healthcare and culture."
"The mention of European programmes and funding that can be used for the social and economic integration of the Roma is opportune, given that these are underused."
"This resolution is all the more important given that it is common knowledge that the Roma have been the target of unfortunate and unacceptable discrimination in a number of EU countries, such as France and other Member States."
"The discrimination that takes place against the Roma in various EU countries is common knowledge."
"Just recently, there have been problems in France and other EU states, which could worsen under the pretext of the economic and social crisis."
"The rapporteur, who is a Member of Roma origin, has therefore tried to make Parliament aware of this situation."
"Within this context, the resolution that has been adopted today advocates that the Commission propose and the Council adopt an EU strategy encouraging Roma integration as an action plan at European level, and which will be significant and inclusive at various different levels, based on the fundamental values of equality, the exercising of rights, non-discrimination, and equality between men and women."
"In the same way, it is worth remembering that there are European programmes and funding which can be used for the social and economic integration of the Roma, but that communication needs to be improved at all levels if these are to be properly employed."
"The objective is to ensure that the Roma community has real access to education, jobs, housing, healthcare and culture."
"Managing the problems of the largest ethnic minority in Europe requires pragmatism, rather than some kind of fake bleeding-heart liberalism."
"We are talking about giving the Roma minority a whole series of rights, which a very great many citizens can only enjoy thanks to daily sacrifices."
"I do not think it is a European strategy or a decision that deserves support given that this phenomenon also implies vast differences between one Member State and another."
"Some countries are in an objectively difficult situation, whilst others are barely affected by the phenomenon."
"That is why I think it would be more effective to apply the principle of subsidiarity. Hence, I do not intend to lend my support to the text that has been tabled."
"Rarely has a European Parliament report come so close to madness."
"For the strategy on Roma inclusion read the systematic promotion of a small population in everything and everywhere, mandatory quotas in all areas, including in decision-making bodies and businesses, and the systematic public funding of its alleged needs, including housing."
"This minority is, of course, supposed to be the frequent victim of malicious discrimination, and never does one question one's own responsibilities."
"It should be said that the rapporteur is herself part of this minority, which proves that it is not as oppressed as all that."
"Frankly, it is a bit like entrusting a Chinese person with the task of defining Europe's trade protection policy."
"To return to the subject at hand, though, which other European citizens, albeit victims of poverty and insecurity, and excluded, in their own country, from the social benefits already allocated as a priority to others, are the object of such deep concern on your part?"
"It is in this systematic discrimination against European citizens and at their expense that the reasons for their growing rejection of the Brussels set-up are to be found."
"This week, the European Parliament, by a large majority, adopted a report on the EU strategy on Roma inclusion: this is an additional political signal confirming that the European Union is aware of its responsibility towards this ethnic minority, which is the largest one in Europe, as well as the most persecuted one."
"The report emphasises the priority areas of this strategy: fundamental rights, inequalities, the fight against discrimination, education, access to employment, the labour market, access to housing, and so on."
"For my part, I stressed the need, within the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, to pay special attention to children and minors when drafting such a strategy."
"The report also highlights the misuse of the European funds available for Roma inclusion: administrative delays and burdens, insufficient awareness, a lack of involvement on the part of local authorities, and so on, are all difficulties to which the Member States, local authorities, interested parties and others must respond in order to ensure the full absorption of these European funds."
"This strategy will have to be shaped later on by each Member State and will thus be assessed at local level."
"The issue of Roma inclusion is a genuinely European problem, which is why the European Union must go to the very root of the discrimination suffered by the Roma community by combating stereotypes, in order to ensure equal access to employment, housing, healthcare and education."
"I am therefore delighted that the European Parliament has taken up the issue and adopted this report, which aims to provide food for thought for the Commission."
"This report denounces the misuse by the Member States of the European funds that should be devoted to Roma inclusion projects, but it is my hope that the Commission will go further by forcing the Member States to account publicly for their use of these funds."
"I voted in favour of this document, although I believe that this report should have been rejected."
"At the moment, it is not necessary to strengthen a strategy that is devoted to just one group."
"Rather, we need an effective emergency strategy aimed at solving the issue of legal and illegal migration in order to ensure, above all, economic stability, employment, security, public order and justice for all European citizens who make up part of a Member State from demographic, cultural, traditional, historical and economic viewpoints."
"in writing. - (RO) The European approach to the Roma problem has been, and still is, inadequate."
"The report drafted by Lívia Járóka in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, along with the contributions from the other associated committees, should provide new impetus for a proper Roma integration strategy, which we expect from the Commission next month."
"I strongly believe that we are all eager to bring about real change for the Roma community and offer them all the prerequisites for social inclusion."
"This is why we need to focus on the political and financial instruments we have available and take direct action in key areas such as education and health."
"Cooperation at every level, from European to local, is also essential because, without concerted action, all the resources are wasted."
"The Roma need to be involved in making policies."
"This is why solutions must be found to bring us into contact with those who form the link between the decision-making and implementation levels."
"Lastly, we must acknowledge the importance of the message we are sending out with this report."
"However, we should not forget that numerous messages have been given and the time has now come for concrete actions."
"The Roma are culturally one of the richest nations in the world."
"Their presence lends variety to the landscape of many different countries."
"However, stereotypes and discrimination are injurious to the Roma, and unfortunately do not help in establishing dialogue - and dialogue is needed."
"We live alongside one another, and we must at least accept each other in order to put an end to the phenomenon of exclusion."
"To this end, it is necessary to support education so that there will not be obstacles to Roma children learning alongside other children in European schools."
"It is also necessary to support initiatives which will allow Roma to undertake legal employment and more easily acclimatise in the country in which they are currently living."
"We are afraid of what we do not know."
"If we know more about the riches of Roma culture and customs, integration will certainly take place more quickly."
"in writing. - The ECR Group is wholeheartedly supportive of the inclusion and integration of the Roma people within Member States and the European Union."
"Equal access to the public service sector and the labour market and freedom from discrimination are essential for all people regardless of race, ethnicity, or heritage."
"We also strongly support the report's aims regarding EU funds being better spent and better allocated in order to fully support the Roma people."
"However, some sections of the report which discuss health, education and employment are areas which we believe should be legislated by Member States."
"Voting in favour today on the resolution on the European Union strategy for Roma inclusion could represent a useful boost to the promotion of non-discrimination in the Member States, as well as an incentive to bring in instruments to protect the Roma."
"What I have said is valid, in particular, for the most vulnerable groups, in line with the provisions of the EU's Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"I think that defining effective economic instruments is a further aim to be reached in order to implement a serious and substantial Roma inclusion policy."
"The resolution in question tackles a particularly significant issue - including for my own country - and aims at proper integration of the Roma so as to enable their real participation in the economic, social and cultural life of the countries in which they are located, on condition (I would add) of the total respect of the principles and laws of the host State."
"Lastly, I support the request made to the Commission regarding the adoption of a leading role in the establishment of unitary strategic coordination, in partnership with the Member States, by setting up a task force to act as a permanent organism responsible for supervising and coordinating the issue."
"I voted for this report as I welcome its extremely close look at the complexity of the issue of the Roma community in the EU."
"I would even dare say that when most of these problems are resolved, it will mean that a large number of the problems we are faced with now as a European society will be resolved."
"I would just like to mention the way in which the Structural Funds could be used to support the priorities of the EU Roma inclusion strategy."
"I believe that substantial funds need to be allocated to the economic and social development of these communities."
"In cases where inadequate support is given to interventions in terms of finances or an appropriate period of time for the envisaged impact to be made, the effects achieved will not be those we currently expect."
"What is required is prioritisation, smart spending of funds and political commitment."
"Otherwise, the financial resources will be wasted."
"Following this report, I await with interest the next steps which the Commission is going to take."
"I hope that this strategy will generate the value added required from implementing a European measure supporting Roma inclusion."
"in writing. - I welcome this report on the plight of the Roma - the most marginalised group in the European Union."
"The resolution sets out practical steps for improving the health, education and welfare of the Roma."
"It includes measures to improve their access to the labour market and to decent housing. This resolution offers an opportunity for the Roma to be better integrated into society."
"This resolution is pure talk, yet again."
"I am pleased that this text denounces racial hate speech, ethnic profiling, unlawful fingerprinting and unlawful eviction and expulsion."
"However, I object to the bitter pills we are made to swallow along the way: full powers for the Commission in this matter, stigmatisation of the Roma in a text that claims to defend them, competition on the job market and competitive clusters."
"This confused approach is unacceptable."
"The EU is an area of solidarity and inclusion, so it must do what is necessary to prevent discrimination against the Roma and to gain them the same rights as regards education, employment, healthcare and housing in all Member States, as well as states intending to join the Union."
"The Roma should be attending to children who are generally prevented from attending school; with children and women who are used in begging; with begging adopted as a life choice; and with the rejection of work and recourse in its stead to the social security systems of third countries."
"Decisive steps must be taken to bring discrimination to an end."
"However, if this is to be achieved, the Roma cannot exclude themselves and must help with their own integration into a European area in which inclusion is desirable."
"I voted for the report on the EU strategy on Roma inclusion."
"The text points out the need to prepare an EU-level strategy for the protection and integration of this population."
"It also calls on the Member States to adopt and strengthen effective legislation against discrimination - including multiple discrimination - in all areas of life that guarantees, protects and promotes fundamental rights, equality and non-discrimination, and the right to freedom of movement, including actions to raise public awareness directed both at Roma people and at others, so as to eradicate discriminatory obstacles."
"Today, some 10-12 million Roma are in need of European measures to promote their social, cultural and economic integration."
"The Roma have suffered and continue to suffer systematic discrimination, exclusion, human rights violations and stigmatisation."
"The report we have just adopted is an important step towards measures aimed at reducing marginalisation, poverty and social exclusion."
"However, much remains to be done to prevent discrimination."
"Even if discrimination on the grounds of ethnic origin can be eliminated, the socio-economic exclusion of the majority of the Roma population remains a harsh reality."
"Many Roma in Europe are completely cut off from the economy and live in conditions so poor that they cannot enjoy their fundamental rights."
"I believe, furthermore, that Roma inclusion should begin in early childhood, with the inclusion of children in the population register, access to quality education, and job assistance for parents."
"The Commission must set binding minimum standards at EU level that require the involvement of local, national and European authorities alike."
"in writing. - Areas in which more effort from the EU is required in the Roma inclusion process are priorities for the EU."
"Unfortunately, there are problems involving education, medical care and the extreme isolation of these people."
"The report calls for the Commission to present a strategic plan for introducing binding minimum standards at EU level for these priorities, including penalties for Member States that do not comply with the objectives."
"Although I am not confident that this will be successful, as a whole, I voted in favour."
"The Roma and Sinti - that is the politically correct term, although some members of these ethnic groups take this to be pejorative, and ask to be designated 'Gypsies' - do, of course, live to some extent in miserable circumstances."
"We must, at the same time, not overlook the fact that the lack of progress towards a better way of life is also connected to the traditions of these groups, to which they continue to cling."
"In a typical do-gooding way, over many years now, attempts at socialising these groups have been begun but they have all failed, because they have not been accepted by the great majority of this nomadic people."
"The European Union has set aside EUR 12 billion up to 2013 for integration of minorities, and it is already quite clear that the money will be wasted where most Roma and Sinti are concerned."
"Both the clan structure and lack of the right to intervene on the part of the authorities prevent this vicious circle from ever being broken."
"The strategy that has been planned is not only incapable of changing anything significant; it could, in some areas, such as 'non-discrimination', even turn into an own goal."
"Moreover, there is a lack of the concept that there is no such thing as a right to be included in the social security system."
"That is why I strongly reject the report."
"I decided to vote against this report because I cannot see any need for the European Union to commit huge resources to the inclusion of the Roma."
"At a time of economic crisis and general difficulty, it aims to press ahead even more quickly to ensure specific funding and favourable conditions in a number of areas for the Roma population."
"This ethnic group has historically remained isolated in Europe, often not as a result of the will of others but by their own nature; they have willingly remained at the margins in order to carry on living according to their own customs, which are a long way from the common values and sentiments of Europe."
"Rather than a specific European strategy for the inclusion of the Roma, I would like it if we worked at a European level for a real and effective common immigration strategy, which seems increasingly essential and can no longer be postponed."
"A European Roma strategy is undoubtedly an absolute necessity, as this is a European minority which is typified, at the same time, by a very large degree of cross-border mobility, given their way of life."
"I voted for this resolution, especially because it emphasises the role played by good quality education and training as a factor influencing people's personal and professional life and because, as a result, education is the most reliable solution for ensuring Roma integration into society."
"While the majority society in the EU is rapidly ageing, the Roma are recording a rapid increase in population."
"In Hungary, where the Roma currently make up between 6% and 8% of the population, they will exceed 50% of the working population by 2050."
"All the worse, therefore, that Roma life in the EU is characterised, as it always has been, by unemployment, a level of education that is greatly below average, organised crime and prostitution, as well as retreat into a parallel society."
"The situation of women in often archaic Roma society is particularly dramatic, and their lack of education and, hence, their exclusion from the labour market is so much the greater."
"The report before us admittedly addresses some of the problems, however one-sidedly."
"Integration is not a one-way street."
"The Roma must make their contribution, send their children to school, integrate themselves better into the labour market and put an end to criminal tendencies."
"I therefore voted against the report."
"I voted in favour of this report, because we urgently need to change a situation where, even in the 21st century, a significant portion of the 10-12 million Roma living in Europe suffer discrimination, and economic and social isolation."
"The road to integration is a long and complicated process which is adapted to the conditions of individual countries and local regions."
"The European Union strategy should ensure clear objectives and means of funding programmes."
"However, the greatest responsibility lies with national governments and local authorities, which know best the situation in the region."
"Education, healthcare, housing policy and the more rapid inclusion of Roma in the labour market - this is the key to solving a long-standing problem."
"If Roma EU citizens are unable to integrate properly into the societies of European Union Member States, then this would send out a poor signal on EU integration policy in general."
"The European Union has now been working for years on problems relating to the social integration and protection of minorities."
"The report by Mrs Járóka on the Roma inclusion strategy sets out an action plan for their socio-economic integration in view of a European project that defines national strategies to deal with the problem, partly on the basis of the costs that each Member State will have to bear."
"I voted in favour of the report precisely because we need a new European legal framework that includes measures to combat discrimination and protect human rights, to integrate Roma in the various Member States with a plan that guarantees their education and health coverage."
"I voted today in favour of the European Parliament report on the EU strategy on Roma inclusion."
"Their inclusion in society is a very important issue which concerns all the Member States in general and Greece in particular where, according to studies (by the EU Fundamental Rights Agency), 35% of Roma are illiterate and just 4% have attended school for at least ten years."
"The key point in inclusion is education and the abolition of segregation in schools."
"Alongside adequate healthcare and equal opportunities in employment, the Member States need to keep a closer eye on the extent to which EU funds for the Roma are actually used for the benefit of the recipients."
"in writing. - We know that 10-12 million European Roma continue to suffer serious systematic discrimination in education (where they are victims particularly of segregation), housing (particularly with forced evictions and sub-standard living conditions, often in ghettos), employment (their particularly low employment rate) and equal access to healthcare systems and other public services, as well as an astoundingly low level of political participation."
"The EU strategy on Roma inclusion should embrace measures to ensure the monitoring of the situation of the Roma in relation to the respect and promotion of their fundamental social rights, equality, non-discrimination and free movement in the EU, and also to provide education, training opportunities and job assistance for adults, which are crucial in order to support the recruitment and continued employment of the Roma with the aim of avoiding the perpetuation of social exclusion."
"The Commission and Member States should address the particular needs of Roma women by applying a gender perspective in all policies for Roma inclusion and providing protection for especially vulnerable subgroups."
"Therefore, I ask the Commission to present annually to the European Parliament a follow up of the EU strategy on Roma inclusion in order to monitor the progress made at national level."
"I voted in favour of this report, which focuses on the need to effectively address the problems and challenges related to this sensitive issue of integrating Roma communities."
"in writing. - Parliament's Járóka report on the EU strategy for Roma inclusion was voted on in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on 14 February, with the majority of the Greens/EFA amendments accepted by the rapporteur or included in the compromise amendments, and many of the Group's red lines to the issue included: namely, the Roma inclusion strategy should be guided by an insider's approach: designed by Roma for Roma, which means empowerment of Roma, inclusion in the decision-making process, hiring of Roma staff/mediators in key positions at local, national, EU level; stop unlawful practices that continue with EU Member State impunity: violence against Roma, violations of the right to free movement, increasing activity of extremist political parties, politicians, and policies, systemic segregation of Romany children in education, widespread residential segregation of Roma, trafficking in human beings, denial of access to healthcare and social services, coercive sterilisation of Romany women."
"On 6 April, the European Commission will present its Communication on Roma inclusion."
"This issue is also listed among the priorities of the Hungarian Government, which currently holds the European rotating Presidency."
"Parliament's resolution points out the need for the greater integration of Roma populations in modern society."
"Personally, I think that it is up to these populations to adapt to our society and not to force us to adopt favourable policies that often produce results that are quite opposite to expectations."
"Ignorance, a lack of education and illiteracy often mean a lack of future prospects."
"Without education, it is impossible to take an active role in society."
"The difficulties that the Roma face in finding a job are often the result of their low level of education and this shows that the educational sector is the foundation on which to build a future of their own."
"This report is absolutely unacceptable since it reiterates on a number of occasions that the inclusion of the Roma is an economic necessity and that it would bring financial advantages for the Member States."
"It also proposes a task force for the Roma as a permanent organ of the Commission and denounces systematic discrimination and an intolerable level of exclusion and human rights violations."
"The report also emphasises the need for a common European strategy to combat all forms of violation of the rights of the Roma, including fingerprinting and expulsion."
"It sets out fines for national governments that do not respect obligatory European standards towards the Roma population, promoting the hiring of Roma in the public administration, and hiring Roma teachers in schools so as to protect their culture by using their language."
"As a final insult to the freedom of speech, it also sets out to condemn the rejection of and discrimination against Roma in political meetings."
"It is clear that I cannot but vote against a report that is absolutely offensive and harmful to the rights of people to be the lords of their own manor."
"Any European strategy for Roma inclusion must be based, first and foremost, on a knowledge of local conditions."
"The strategy is therefore inconceivable without close cooperation with the local authorities and the communities where the declaration must be translated into everyday coexistence between the majority of society and the Roma community."
"The report does not overlook this aspect and I have therefore voted in favour of it."
"The Roma struggle with discrimination in Europe on a systematic basis and have to fight exclusion, violations of their human rights and stigmatisation."
"By voting for binding EU minimum standards today, I hope that the 10-12 million Roma will have better access to jobs, education, housing and healthcare."
"It is a positive that the report calls for the best measures to be sought in collaboration with the stakeholders."
"The report further highlights the primordial role of regional policy."
"The Member States, after all, do have access to funds to assist the Roma with integration, but barely use that money."
"It is thus up to the Member States to face up to their responsibility."
"Another positive in this report is the idea that the Commission will have to introduce award criteria in favour of compliant Member States and penalties for non-compliance."
"The only minus point is the reference to the Roma's 'prolonged dependence' on the social welfare system."
"This is a very conservative, preconceived opinion that marginalises the Roma community once again."
"I hope that the Commission integrates this report into its own proposal, which is likely to be presented on 5 April."
"It is scheduled to be adopted by the Council before the summer."
"The integration of the Roma is one of the priorities of the Hungarian Presidency."
"in writing. - I supported this report which aims to combat discrimination against the Roma people and calls on Member States to produce policies for their integration into the labour market."
"The Roma people is one of the most marginalised groups in the EU, which is why we need to ensure that action is taken to tackle the social exclusion that they face."
"In the vote on the Lange report, I am abstaining on paragraph 31 because of the ambiguous wording, which refers to Eurobonds as well as project bonds."
"However, taking it as a whole, I am voting for the report, as I have nothing against project bonds in themselves."
"Project bonds serve as finance for extensive innovation, infrastructure and reindustrialisation projects."
"This is not a question of instruments for the communitarisation of debts, as would be the case with Eurobonds."
"I voted for this report, as industrial policy is a priority for the Europe 2020 strategy and the main driving force behind the European economy."
"The focus on this sector is due to the fact that it is responsible for three quarters of European exports, providing jobs for 57 million people and representing 80% of investment in research and development."
"I believe that if Europe is to be competitive in this area, there must be a focus on advocating green and innovative knowledge-based projects."
"I voted in favour of this important resolution on an Industrial Policy for the Globalised Era."
"The global economic crisis has affected European industry and therefore, to be able to overcome the effect of the crisis and face those challenges, the EU needs an industrial policy approach that combines competitiveness, sustainability and decent work that can, at the same time, stimulate the economy, boost employment, reduce environmental degradation and improve quality of life."
"I agree with the resolution's call for the Commission and the Member States to develop an ambitious, eco-efficient and green EU industrial strategy in order to recreate manufacturing capacity across the EU territory and to generate highly qualified and well paid jobs within the EU."
"The European Parliament stresses the great importance of SMEs in the industrial landscape, in particular, when it comes to providing long-term jobs at regional level, and in preserving economic and creative vitality and a high level of growth."
"There is, therefore, a need to continue working on better access to financing opportunities for SMEs and, in particular, to develop viable venture capital possibilities; to strengthen, in the context of the new architecture of the financial market, short- and long-term financing possibilities for SMEs and their preferred sources of finance; to open up markets and create fair conditions for competition, enabling more entrepreneurs and small companies to grow and develop into companies operating all over Europe."
"The global economic crisis has affected European industry, making it more difficult for it to adapt to the challenges posed by the transition to an industry based on knowledge and efficiency, which has a strong impact on industrial development and the labour market."
"To be able to face these challenges, I think an industrial policy approach is required which combines competitiveness, sustainability and decent work which can, at the same time, stimulate the economy, boost employment, reduce environmental degradation and improve the quality of life in the European Union."
"This report supports industrial progress through smart and forward-looking regulation and market stimulation, based on accurate expectations for market developments, and supporting the global trends towards clean, sustainable and innovative forms of production, distribution and consumption."
"I voted for this report because I believe that the success of the European Union's industrial policy depends on it being firmly rooted both in a new financial sector architecture that promotes investment and prevents speculation, and also in a macro-economic policy that steers fiscal, economic and budgetary policies in the EU towards sustainable growth and job creation."
"Deindustrialisation is an established fact in Europe."
"Europe's technological and economic position is being put at risk by increased globalisation and intense competition from rapidly developing countries."
"The European Union must therefore adopt an industrial policy that combines competitiveness, sustainability and decent work."
"The aims are as follows: to stimulate the economy, boost employment, reduce environmental degradation and improve quality of life."
"This is the thrust of this resolution, which I endorsed."
"In particular, I am in favour of issuing EU bonds with a view to enabling the European Union to fund innovation, infrastructure and reindustrialisation."
"There are 57 million people employed in the industrial sector in the EU, and 75% of European exports involve the same sector."
"That sector will be central to the future competitiveness of the EU."
"I welcome what the EU's 2020 strategy contains about encouraging high quality jobs and training to help and support the development of the industrial base, and therefore I voted in favour of the report."
"Since it is SMEs which create two thirds of the jobs in the sector, I welcome what the report contains on small business access to public procurement opportunities and the role of small businesses in improving industrial policy."
"SMEs must have better access to the Framework Programme, and assistance and support must be given for technology transfer and innovation."
"I agree with the rapporteur that the EU should develop and encourage innovative clusters in regional areas."
"The major advantages of these clusters are their ability to transfer knowledge, to develop research activities, qualifications and infrastructure, and to stimulate employment opportunities in regional areas."
"I voted in favour of this report."
"The European Union is the world's largest market, but we are not exploiting our huge potential."
"We are a very open market, but face enormous obstacles to accessing foreign markets."
"The incomplete single market in areas such as energy forces us to bow to the conditions dictated by external parties, which has a direct impact on our competitiveness."
"The viability of industry depends on the viability of our small and medium-sized business sector, which, despite the measures approved, is going through a difficult period."
"I agree that innovation is at the core of industry today, but in this area we cannot exactly boast of our ability to react in a timely manner to changing global market conditions."
"I believe that today, we have a well balanced and comprehensive vision of industry, and now the Member States and the European Commission will have to do their bit to ensure that our ambitious goals enable the creation of a modern and competitive industry."
"European industry is still facing the consequences of the economic crisis, and requires a coordinated approach at EU level in order to handle them successfully."
"An industrial strategy must be drawn up for the EU setting out strategic areas for investment, and then taking account of these priorities in the future financial perspective, annual budgets and policies of the EU."
"The development of European industry will not happen without ambitious funding, especially in the areas of research and energy, telecommunications and transport networks (TEN), and therefore in the public services which sustain the business environment."
"In my opinion, however, it is neither necessary nor appropriate to start issuing EU bonds for this purpose (Eurobonds or project bonds)."
"The EU is not a sovereign political entity, and therefore its revenues should basically be made up of the contributions of Member States."
"Not to mention the fact that the idea of Eurobonds involves debt and might clash with the principle of a balanced European budget."
"Financial support for innovation, infrastructure and reindustrialisation should be based primarily on boosting the resources for the Eighth Framework Programme for Research and Development and for the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme, with the aim of ensuring that European industry remains competitive at the global level, and thereby also making effective use of private investments."
"Europe is currently finding that it has become less competitive in global markets."
"As such, Europe needs to find ways of strengthening its industrial base to face up to new challenges."
"This report, 'An integrated industrial policy for the globalisation era', aims to table proposals to relaunch European industry."
"An integrated and sustainable industrial policy must be based on scientific research, on innovation, on increased resource efficiency, on a commodities strategy, on reinforcing small and medium-sized enterprises, and on developing regional networks."
"In particular, it is essential for energy efficiency and the introduction of information and communication technologies to constitute the basis of the industrial revolution, so as to increase competitiveness, economic growth and employment."
"I particularly welcome the emphasis given to traditional European industry, which is essential to our economy."
"Measures such as the introduction of new technologies and increased efforts in scientific research and innovation in sectors such as the manufacturing industry are of crucial importance."
"This is the only way that we will be able to return European industry to a leading position in the world."
"Industrial policy is essential for the European Union, and this report is an opportunity for the European Commission: the initial communication was disappointing."
"Parliament's work provides the Commission with concrete proposals that it must take up."
"This report should be linked to our proposals, which the European Parliament as a whole adopted this week, including, in particular, the principle of a 'tax on financial transactions' at European level and of issuing EU bonds (Eurobonds)."
"Our policies must show that social innovation and technological innovation are compatible."
"In the vote on the Lange report, I am abstaining on paragraph 31 because of the ambiguous wording, which refers to Eurobonds as well as project bonds."
"However, taking it as a whole, I am voting for the report, as I have nothing against project bonds in themselves."
"Project bonds serve as finance for extensive innovation, infrastructure and reindustrialisation projects."
"This is not a question of instruments for the communitarisation of debts, as would be the case with Eurobonds."
"Clearly, Europe must develop a long-term European industrial strategy."
"We cannot be the only economic area in the world to unilaterally apply free trade principles while having no idea of what our main competitors are doing."
"The European Commission has to realise that, with the crisis, the rules put in place are no longer suitable for today's economy, and that it is time to seriously strengthen the European Union's anti-dumping arsenal and the application of the general principle of reciprocity in trade."
"The European Union needs a European strategy that serves as a vehicle for major industrial projects such as Galileo and ITER."
"It must also support its production sectors and its SME base."
"It must promote and increase its research and development investments so as to try to maintain its lead in the area of high technology."
"Similarly, it must step up the fight against counterfeiting, and put forward an offensive European patent policy."
"This text does not stand out for its quality, since it is the result of a very broad compromise between the MEPs."
"It contains both elements that are very positive in the eyes of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and certain ideas that we have sought in vain to denounce."
"However, the main thing is that it enables MEPs to express a rather progressive opinion on the EU 2020 strategy's flagship programme dedicated to industry."
"Hence, the text calls for transport systems to be made more sustainable through the use of more efficient technologies, interoperability and innovative mobility solutions."
"It points out the need to place energy and resource savings at the heart of European industrial policy."
"In this respect, it recalls the huge job potential and cost reduction benefits that energy efficiency improvements are expected to yield."
"The adoption of measures that ensure energy efficiency improvement must therefore underpin initiatives in all industrial sectors."
"MEPs also sought to encourage all the efforts made to redress skills shortages in order to promote the qualifications of the workforce and interest young graduates more in industry."
"Industry creates almost one third of EU GDP, industrial products account for three quarters of exports, and industry employs 57 million European citizens."
"European industry was already going through a restructuring process before the crisis stated."
"At present it is influenced especially by the rapid and changing development of the global economy, as well as growing competition."
"A new form of globalisation is developing, leading towards a global society based on knowledge, research and innovation."
"The need to mitigate climate change and maintain maximum biodiversity levels is leading industry towards production that involves 'zero' CO2 emissions and an efficient use of resources."
"European industry should continue to maintain a strategic position in key sectors, and to exploit the opportunities for sustainable recovery aimed at securing the greatest possible number of jobs for qualified workers."
"The rapporteur proposes a whole raft of measures to make this possible."
"I agree with and support the creation of an innovation supply chain, greater efficiency in the use of resources, the more effective use of public contracts, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), greater production of so-called clean energy and the generally broader inclusion of SMEs in the concept of European industry."
"The report is of benefit to European industry, the rapporteur genuinely understands the issue, and I am therefore voting for the adoption of the report."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this report because I believe that it represents the way forward for a robust, cohesive and employment-based industrial policy for the European workforce."
"R&D is a key driver for innovation and trade and will remain one of the cornerstones for industrial policy in the EU."
"I believe that industry plays a key role in keeping jobs in Europe and this is why we must enhance efforts to maintain a strong industrial base, become the most competitive economy in the world and ensure close-knit networks between companies in different Member States in order to achieve shared industrial priorities."
"Some of my amendments included in the report concern shortening the time to market for new products, ensuring that European manufacturing strengthens the foundations of the European economy and the simplification of funding programmes for industry."
"I voted in favour of this report as I support the idea that only an industrial strategy that is ambitious and efficient from an environmental standpoint can renew and stimulate Europe's productive capacity, and gain a central role in the creation of highly skilled and well paid jobs in the EU."
"At a time when Europe is experiencing an unprecedented crisis, which is due, albeit not solely, to the budget, we cannot forget the leading role of industry, which represents 37% of Europe's gross domestic product, and the challenges that it is facing in a globalised world in which emerging economies - and also the US - are committing to aggressive industrial policies based on massive investment in research and development in key sectors, competing with Europe, with the advantage that they do not have the same environmental, social and labour constraints."
"There is no miracle solution to this."
"Despite its many virtues, the Europe 2020 strategy is not a magic wand for European industry in a world where competition is global and fierce."
"I therefore believe that the only route for European industry is to specialise and definitively commit to quality and the latest technology, along with rationalising costs and ensuring greater efficiency in management."
"European products must be preferred, not because they are cheaper - that will never happen - but because they are better and more innovative."
"Only the excellence of European industry can make this happen."
"We hope that we are capable of rising to the challenge."
"The importance of European industry is indisputable."
"It represents three quarters of exports, a third of the EU's gross value added and a third of employment."
"Although dynamic, it has not escaped the economic crisis and needs to be at the forefront of the European policy agenda advocated by this report."
"Indeed, industrial policy should be central to our concerns, as it relates to the future, by creating employment and promoting investment in production."
"However, it also presents us with challenges: how can we guarantee the sustainability of resources when faced with climate change?"
"The EU needs a coherent industrial policy that conveys confidence to companies and helps them to overcome the crisis."
"It needs to promote modern industry that is effective, reduces energy costs and CO2 production, and is ecologically responsible, and which is competitive, engaging in research, innovation and the recycling of raw materials."
"This is because we cannot forget that an industrial policy is also a social policy, and I am therefore voting in favour of this report."
"However, I would like to draw attention to the need to strengthen support for small and medium-sized enterprises, which employ the majority of workers in the EU's business sector, and to implement origin marking."
"This is another report that is full of contradictions."
"On the one hand, it has some positive aspects, which we appreciate, defending industry and small and medium-sized enterprises."
"The presence of modern and efficient industry which creates jobs and is environmentally sustainable is an important tool for development in every country and region."
"However, the current framework of EU policies, in which the most negative aspects have been worsening over the years, is markedly unfavourable to this endeavour."
"Rather, it has been promoting the dismantling of important productive centres, deindustrialisation, the elimination of jobs, and growing dependence in innumerable countries and regions."
"Liberalisation and international trade deregulation policies are a central tenet of this policy framework, and are contributing decisively to the current situation."
"However, the report insists on advocating these policies. It endorses them, while ignoring their effects."
"It also insists on the sacrosanct principle of 'free competition' and the deepening of the internal market, both offshoots of the aforementioned framework, on public-private partnerships, and even on synergies between civilian and military investment."
"The Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left sought to eliminate these most negative aspects from the report, while keeping the aspects that are good."
"Unfortunately, all the proposals were rejected by the majority in Parliament. That is why we voted against."
"Unfortunately, none of our amendments, which were aimed at removing the most negative aspects from the report, were passed."
"We therefore voted against in the final vote on the resolution by Parliament."
"Although, as I mentioned in the debate in plenary, there are positive aspects in the report, there are many contradictory positions."
"While, on the one hand, it claims to defend industry and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), on the other hand, it contains proposals that insist on the liberalisation of free trade and free competition, on the deepening of the internal market, on public-private partnerships, and even on synergies between civilian and military investment."
"We would like industries that are efficient in terms of resource use, that are less dependent on carbon, that value jobs with rights, and that guarantee equal rights for women in terms of access to jobs, to promotion, to wages, and to participation in management and administrative bodies."
"We advocate other policies, particularly in terms of industrial policy, foreign trade, financial, research, science and innovation policies, which support SMEs, as well as a commitment to training and skilling workers, and to the dignity of those who work."
"Mr Lange's report on the Industrial Policy for the Globalised Era looks at extremely important issues, such as access to credit for enterprises, and, above all, for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"I particularly appreciate the idea of linking the industrial world with universities in order to boost European universities, thereby harking back to the EU 2020 objectives."
"I therefore voted in favour."
"The Europe 2020 strategy has acknowledged the need to set out a new industrial policy in order to maintain a solid and sustainable industrial base in Europe."
"Strong and prosperous industry is indeed a key factor for growth in the European Union and therefore, in the current context of globalisation and intense international competition, it is essential to create a framework that is even more favourable for its development."
"This report should certainly be applauded for having provided a detailed survey of industrial policy in the light of the economic crisis, which seriously damaged the sector, and also for providing various cues for properly reviving European industry."
"For this reason, I think it is important that the political aims set out in the flagship initiative tabled last 28 October by Mr Tajani are translated into tangible actions such as, by way of example, strengthening and internationalising small and medium-sized enterprises, providing easier access to credit, and the definition of a new industrial innovation model."
"Other than that, Europe must take the risk of increasing productivity with new ideas by investing increasingly in research, which must represent the new engine to restore European excellence."
"The global market is reacting to the need to meet the demands of the model of consumption which has already been formed in highly developed and developing societies."
"However, competitiveness 'at any price' is appearing, by which I mean competitiveness which is influenced by more than just the innovativeness of industry and changes in the model of consumption."
"We can include the following in the catalogue of unfavourable phenomena which accompany competitiveness: a model of consumption, imposed by industry, which squanders energy and raw materials; competition which is based not on the superiority of the methods used but on the financial supremacy of wealthy monopolistic corporations; a fragmentary competitiveness which is concerned only with the final phase of processing and not gross competitiveness, by which I mean competitiveness which takes account of the preparation of raw materials and materials for production; the taking over of raw materials and energy markets by supranational, often non-European, corporations; increases in energy prices and, as a result, of raw materials too, by regulations which impose a system of emissions trading on the EU Member States; unfair competition imposed mainly by large, supranational corporations, including financial corporations."
"I treat this report as a good beginning to a very important discussion about the future of competitive industry in Europe, and so of Europe itself, so I voted in favour of its adoption."
"I regret that this report was not tabled earlier, for example, when Brussels was denouncing the creation of industrial champions, or when Mittal was carrying out its hostile takeover of Arcelor, depriving Europe of the only bit of its iron and steel industry it had left."
"For decades, the European Union has worked hard at destroying our industrial fabric and our industrial jobs, through European sectoral policies, European competition policy and European free trade policy, which all of you here have systematically praised, supported and promoted."
"In the face of disaster, you are now tentatively coming round to what the Front national has been proposing for a very long time: recognising the crucial nature of an industrial base, developing strategic sectors, protecting against unfair competition and helping to penetrate external markets, guaranteeing and safeguarding raw material supplies, regulating takeover bids, making competition policy subject to strategic, socio-economic and public service requirements, providing public support to emerging or innovative sectors, and so on."
"However, it is rather late in the day, and Europe, which has hung on to its ultraliberal ideological foundations, is definitely not the best level at which to make decisions and implement such policies."
"I agreed with this report, because EU industry accounts for roughly a third of gross value added in the EU, with almost three quarters of European exports being made up of industrial goods, and a third of employment, providing subsistence to some 57 million people."
"The recent profound economic crisis has hit European industry."
"However, the crisis has also highlighted the importance of industry to the EU economy and made it evident that not enough has been done to comprehensively address its needs in the current challenging climate."
"Manufacturing growth has fallen to its lowest level in the last two decades, and certain European industries are in permanent crisis as a result of unfair competition from third countries, particularly in the areas of labour relations, the environment and intellectual and industrial property protection."
"As the USA, Japan and China are pursuing a strong and active industrial policy supported by leading edge products and services, there is a danger that European industry may be left behind."
"An integrated and sustainable industrial policy in the EU should be based on the following key aspects: the need to establish an innovation chain linking scientific research and practical adaptation, to use resources more effectively, and to enhance clean energy production."
"We must call on the EU to launch strategies providing for long-term changes and to pursue an education policy that satisfies the needs of the labour market."
"It is necessary to combat the spread of the shadow economy and undeclared casual work during the crisis which distorts competition, and there are also proposals to facilitate SME participation in public procurement."
"In the vote on the Lange report, I am abstaining on paragraph 31 because of the ambiguous wording of the vote, which refers to Eurobonds as well as project bonds."
"However, taking it as a whole, I am voting for the report, as I have nothing against project bonds in themselves."
"Project bonds serve as finance for extensive innovation, infrastructure and reindustrialisation projects."
"This is not a question of instruments for the communitarisation of debts, as would be the case with Eurobonds."
"In my opinion, today's vote is an important step forward towards emerging on the other side of the economic and financial crisis that has struck Europe and its industries."
"Indeed, the resolution looks at a key sector that needs support in order to allow the European Union to implement an industrial policy that needs to marry the achievement of high levels of production with a commitment to competitive and sustainable renewal."
"For this reason, I applaud the reference to the EU 2020 strategy, which must function as the guiding light for the complete implementation of Europe's priority actions through huge investment in innovation and research, which is necessary for growth and development in Europe."
"Overall, I think the rapporteur, Mr Lange, has done a good job, managing to bring together the ideas and suggestions garnered from more than 500 amendments and putting together a report that I agree with and support, with the exception of the European patent."
"Indeed, I think that the decision to start enhanced cooperation in a sector of strategic importance - namely, intellectual property - is not a correct decision or one that will bring positive consequences for European industry."
"Industrial policy for the globalised era is becoming a great problem for the Union and for individual Member States."
"The quest to minimise production costs and prices is becoming the reason for closing down industrial production in the Union, moving factories to locations outside the EU and then importing production."
"This is having adverse effects: a loss of the capacity for industrial development, technical education and innovativeness, and, as a consequence, a dependence on other countries."
"Entire sectors of industry are going under, such as the shipbuilding industry in Poland."
"Stricter environmental requirements introduced only in the EU and toleration of dumping by Asian producers are accelerating the deindustrialisation of Europe."
"What is needed is a judicious policy which will allow Europe to retain its industrial character."
"The recent economic crisis has confirmed that small and medium-sized enterprises are still the driving force of economic and social development, playing a key role in promoting economic competitiveness and creating jobs."
"I welcome this report and I think that the EU instruments supporting competitiveness need to be reviewed and strengthened with the aim of streamlining administrative procedures and facilitating access to funding for SMEs."
"It is also absolutely essential to introduce innovative incentive mechanisms, based on achieving the targets linked to smart, sustainable growth with an integration aspect, and to promote closer cooperation with the financial institutions."
"One important method for funding innovation for SMEs which is available via the European Investment Bank is the Risk Sharing Financial Facility."
"However, to ensure its success, the European Commission needs to make significantly more funds available, including through innovation funds from ERDF sources, and to promote direct private investments and innovative financing mechanisms for high-risk innovative projects and those in which SMEs participate."
"in writing. - I agree with this report that an EU strategy to promote strong and skilled human resources with a strong creative potential and active involvement in innovation and development, new and innovative technologies/processes/solutions which generate added value, R&D geared to the needs of sustainable development, an efficient supply chain for the production of high quality goods and services, more efficiently organised production and management systems, overall greater resources efficiency that leads to a reduced carbon footprint, cost-efficient and sustainable modes of transport, smart and efficient logistics and high quality infrastructure, a consolidated and fully operational single internal market, and a level playing field in trade relations with third countries, is the only means of increasing the sustainability and competitiveness of European industry and thus maintaining its global leadership."
"The report on an industrial policy for the era of globalisation is an important document in the crisis that has affected the European economy and industrial production in particular."
"However, it does not include the main issue - the real cause of the enormous economic problems."
"This is the global capitalism of free competition and unbridled neoliberalism, on which the EU is unfortunately based."
"The EU does not need more strategic documents literally churned out by the Commission, but there is a pressing need for a change to its underpinnings, and particularly a move towards a social and peaceful union with a regulated financial sector."
"Since we are debating a 'strategic' document as such, experience shows that it is not as difficult to produce such documents as it is to develop them subsequently in the individual areas, and to monitor and evaluate the effects of the proposed measures flexibly."
"The area of intellectual property rights, for example, including industrial rights, is proof of this."
"In the vote on the Lange report, I am abstaining on paragraph 31 because of the ambiguous wording of the vote, which refers to Eurobonds as well as project bonds."
"However, taking it as a whole, I am voting for the report, as I have nothing against project bonds in themselves."
"Project bonds serve as finance for extensive innovation, infrastructure and reindustrialisation projects."
"This is not a question of instruments for the communitarisation of debts, as would be the case with Eurobonds."
"European industry represents approximately a third of the EU's gross value added, as almost three quarters of European exports relate to industrial goods, and a third of employment."
"Moreover, it has a multiplying effect, which means that approximately two additional jobs are created in associated services for every job in industry."
"In view of this, no one is disputing the importance of the industrial sector to the economies of the Member States, but the economic crisis has cast doubt on the importance of this sector, to the detriment of the financial and service sectors, and it is time for us to review this situation and go back to investing heavily in this sector."
"European industry is heading in the direction of specialisation and commitment to the quality of its products and to the latest technology."
"What is produced by our industry needs to distinguish itself by innovation and quality, never by price."
"In order to remain competitive amidst worldwide economic change, the significant economic sector that is industry must not be neglected."
"Sustainability as well as humane working conditions should be both encouraged and demanded, for it is the case that competition from the emerging nations such as China, India and Brazil grows ever stronger and consequently, the pressure on the European internal market grows ever greater."
"Sustainability and growth are two buzzwords often heard, above all, in industrial policy, but their implementation is seriously in doubt, due, primarily, to the lack of available resources."
"I am abstaining because I am of the view that the measures proposed will not be in any way sufficient to secure Europe first place in the world in the industrial sector."
"I voted in favour of this resolution because EU industry has been badly hit by the current economic crisis."
"In today's world, there is huge competition in industry and, therefore, the industrial sector must remain competitive and innovative, supporting innovative ideas, and quality and technological leadership."
"We must enhance facilities, transfer high technologies and facilitate their transposition among companies."
"We must make every effort to ensure that existing resources (minerals) are used appropriately within the European Union, avoiding their export outside the EU's borders, and that we stop oligopolies from forming in trade."
"European aid should go not towards a quick fix, but towards investments in the future that are focused on the creation of new jobs, so that every citizen has work in their own country."
"Particular attention must be paid to so-called problem regions with a low level of industrial development or a high level of unemployment."
"Consequently, there is a need to promote the establishment of technology, industrial and science parks and company centres."
"These organisations are particularly important for actively creating and developing modern technologies and ensuring economic development and modernisation, while, at the same time, creating new jobs."
"Small and medium-sized enterprises must be encouraged to invest in clusters."
"A favourable business environment should be created for them and the administrative burden should be reduced."
"Deep-rooted bureaucracy is preventing industrial development and is damaging the competitiveness of products created."
"I voted in favour of the report by Mr Lange because alongside the Europe 2020 strategy, the European Union must work for vigorous development and better use of resources in order to ensure innovation."
"The report on an Industrial Policy for the Globalised Era lists precisely these objectives: industrial innovation and simplification of existing legislation with the interests of citizens at its heart, and the role of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) - the beating heart of the European economy."
"SMEs need to be guaranteed favourable conditions and easier access to financing."
"It is important to emphasise that the means through which a dynamic and cutting-edge industrial policy will be realised is Structural Funds, which, if used correctly, will lay the foundations for growth in Europe."
"EU industry accounts for roughly a third of gross value added in the EU, with almost three quarters of European exports being made up of industrial goods, and a third of employment, providing subsistence to some 57 million citizens (plus its multiplying effect whereby each job in industry creates approximately two extra jobs in related services)."
"There are 15 key elements: building an innovation chain; increasing resource efficiency; clear targets for sustainable products; using public tenders; enhancing clean energy production; a convincing raw materials strategy; reshaping trade for fair coexistence and sustainable production; outlining an obligatory sectoral industrial policy; involving SMEs; developing regional areas for action; ensuring anticipation of industrial change; restructuring; enhancing qualifications; enlarging workers' participation in decision making; and long-term policies."
"EU industrial policy must be orientated towards both a sustainable, eco-efficient and globally competitive renewal of the industrial base and a sustainable transition from a mainly production-based towards a knowledge-based industry, while being definitely committed to investing in the EU and establishing strategic partnerships between companies in the Union."
"Through this report, Parliament has highlighted important issues that deserve to be emphasised in terms of the growth of European industry."
"I am referring to the recognition of the strategic role of small and medium-sized enterprises and to the need to make it easier to access credit with simplified funding procedures, as well as the importance of internationalisation as a key factor for competitiveness."
"The link between innovation and the industrial world through continuous relations between enterprises and universities is also crucial and includes the sale of results and encouraging their use."
"For this reason, I support the contents and the proposals of the report by Mr Lange."
"The recent economic and financial crisis has highlighted the importance of industry to the EU economy, which means that it is important to recognise the need for an integrated approach to industrial policy, combining competitiveness, innovation and sustainability, whilst, at the same time, showing itself capable of stimulating growth, creating jobs and ensuring environmental preservation."
"Indeed, European industry is facing numerous challenges, so it is vital that there be commitment to investing in new technologies and solutions, in training of staff, in the efficiency of production systems and management models, and in strengthening small and medium-sized enterprises."
"I voted for the report because I am convinced that an integrated industrial policy for Europe is indispensable, especially in the face of the new challenges brought about by globalisation, and a further development of industrial policy is therefore necessary."
"Industrial policy serves as a driver for sustainable employment and the prosperity of society."
"A single job in industry creates at least two more jobs."
"Europe's position in industrial policy is increasingly being put in doubt as a result of increasing industrialisation in the emerging countries and the growing strength of our largest competitors, like the US and China."
"We must therefore develop more ourselves; for that to be the case, we need to make sure to renew our industrial base by taking steps in specific sectors, but also by guaranteeing, in broad terms, the competitiveness of Europe on a global level and the sustainable growth of European industry."
"The report also calls for an integrated industrial policy to serve as the foundation for environmental, competition and trade policy, in order to improve resource efficiency."
"In addition, the report highlights the importance of a constructive partnership with workers and trade union organisations."
"The need to improve coordination between the EU and the Member States is also emphasised in the report."
"I consider these measures to be absolutely necessary."
"This report makes provision for the further development of industrial policy to be approached with the necessary ambition and prudence."
"In the vote on the Lange report, I am abstaining on paragraph 31 because of the ambiguous wording, which refers to Eurobonds as well as project bonds."
"However, taking it as a whole, I am voting for the report, as I have nothing against project bonds in themselves."
"Project bonds serve as finance for extensive innovation, infrastructure and reindustrialisation projects."
"This is not a question of instruments for the communitarisation of debts, as would be the case with Eurobonds."
"In today's plenary session, we voted on Mr Lange's report, entitled Industrial Policy for the Globalised Era."
"European industry accounts for roughly a third of gross value added in the EU, with almost three quarters of European exports being made up of industrial goods, and a third of employment, providing subsistence to some 57 million people."
"If its multiplying effect is accounted for, whereby each job in industry creates approximately two extra jobs in related services, its impact on employment is even more substantial."
"Furthermore, EU industrial policy should be oriented both towards a sustainable, eco-efficient and globally competitive renewal of the industrial base and towards a sustainable transition from a mainly productive towards a knowledge-based industry."
"The integration of all EU policies so as to combine all aspects that have an impact on industry is crucial."
"The own-initiative report on industrial policy by Mr Lange restates the position expressed in the Communication by the Commissioner for Industry, Mr Tajani, with some new ideas aimed at the important renewal of the industrial sector following the economic crisis."
"in writing. - Parliament has today supported a set of actions to promote the competitiveness of European industry."
"I welcome the recognition that, to face the crisis and globalisation challenges, energy and resource efficiency must be the basis for European industrial renewal."
"Sustainability has to be recognised as a central aspect of the so-called 'competitiveness proofing' and 'fitness checks' to be implemented by the Commission as part of its better regulation initiatives."
"The report rightfully calls for closed-loop industrial systems, greater resource productivity, durability and re-use, recycling and remanufacturing."
"The report also calls for instruments to foster the development and growth of eco-innovative SMEs, as well as the development of eco-industrial parks."
"It is important to bring the EU's industrial policy in line with its climate and energy policy objectives."
"The Greens expect the Commission to deliver on that challenge in its upcoming strategic initiatives, such as the resource efficiency strategy, the raw materials strategy and the Small Business Act."
"At last, the European Union has recognised the fundamental role of industry, calling for simplification of access to credit and a reduction in red tape."
"In recent years, we have witnessed the adoption of measures which cause heavy burdens for European industry and which favour the unfair competition of products imported from third countries."
"I would note the costs resulting from combating climate change and the measures aimed at reducing or eliminating duties."
"The report highlights the importance of research as an instrument to fend off competition and notes the professional training of workers and the information that must be given to consumers."
"Let us not forget, however, that aside from all the fine words, the EU is at risk of a rupture between Member States, which results in a minimal desire to create an industrial future together."
"I am referring to what has happened with the European patent, which has seen the Union exclude Italy and Spain, and the use of enhanced cooperation amongst other Member States."
"I voted in favour of this report since the principles it brings up are worthy of support."
"Industry in Europe is facing not only the effects of the economic crisis, but also the new challenges of the globalised era."
"Businesses must react appropriately to ever faster changes in economic trends."
"The economies of rising countries are altering the balance of forces in international markets."
"With the development of a knowledge-based society, the role of scientific research and innovation is also being enhanced, these leading to economic growth and competitiveness."
"The problems which the EU economy is having to face up to include demographic change and the downturn in productivity."
"The main objectives for EU industry are a growth in competitiveness and innovativeness."
"To achieve them, it is necessary to take a number of measures at the same time."
"It is essential to continue work on the single market and harmonisation of customs and tax legislation."
"The bureaucratic burden on businesses should be reduced and the legal framework simplified."
"Cooperation between businesses should be strengthened through business clusters, networks and centres of excellence, and efforts should be made to promote synergies between universities and business."
"It may also prove helpful to use alternative mechanisms such as public-private partnerships that share the risks between private and public investors, and to use leverage and the knock-on effect."
"It will be crucial to support small and medium-sized enterprises, which form the basis of European industry, by financial assistance in the area of innovation and technology transfer and by involving innovative and sustainable criteria in tenders for public procurement."
"It should not be forgotten to ensure a rise in spending on research based on cooperation between the public and private sector."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this report which highlights ways in which the EU's industrial base may be strengthened."
"Industry provides roughly a third of employment in the EU, which is why it is so vital that we ensure its ongoing viability."
"European industry and its multiplier effect account for approximately a third of the EU's gross value added, and it provides a livelihood for 57 million people."
"It is necessary to create an industrial policy which fosters coordination between the Member States and their competitive potential, as expressed in the Europe 2020 strategy."
"The relevance of this report at a time of economic recession shows that, despite its importance, this sector is relegated to the background."
"This evidence requires a closer look at the challenges which European industry will have to face, particularly the restructuring and reorientation of its makeup, based on a global knowledge society through innovation and research, in order to address the competitiveness of emerging economies."
"Aside from this, new dynamics, climate change, demographic shifts and the process of urbanisation/depopulation are developing."
"Of the 15 points tabled by the rapporteur, I would like to highlight the measures that have an effect on small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs), which are the real driving force of the EU growth."
"The simplification of European procedures for obtaining funding, more and better information given to the SMEs about operational programmes, the creation of innovation clusters and networks, as well as greater support on the part of the European Central Bank, are key initiatives for the success of European industrial policy."
"In the vote on the Lange report, I am abstaining on paragraph 31 because of the ambiguous wording of the vote, which refers to Eurobonds as well as project bonds."
"However, taking it as a whole, I am voting for the report, as I have nothing against project bonds in themselves."
"Project bonds serve as finance for extensive innovation, infrastructure and reindustrialisation projects."
"This is not a question of instruments for the communitarisation of debts, as would be the case with Eurobonds."
"in writing. - I supported this report as it sets out the need for a coherent policy on the future of industry across the EU."
"With over 60 million jobs in the EU generated by industrial manufacturing, a robust policy will help the EU overcome some of the challenges faced by manufacturers."
"Making up part of the EU's 2020 strategy, this report outlines 15 'cornerstones' of a strong policy which will ensure that the EU can keep up with competitors from the US, China and Japan, who invest heavily in research and development into cutting-edge technology, and countries that are able to cut costs through cheap labour and have less stringent intellectual property rules."
"Some of the most useful recommendations in the report include the need for an innovation chain which links industry-related research to innovation and application of the technology, and an increased emphasis on resource efficiency and sustainability which ties in with the aims of the Europe 2020 strategy."
"I decided to vote in favour of the own-initiative report by Mr Lange since it represents Parliament's contribution to the debate on an issue of utmost importance for the business world: European industrial policy."
"The report has a number of positive aspects, such as the broad appeal to European enterprises to meet environmental standards, but only on a voluntary basis and without rigid impositions."
"The central role of industry - and not just industrial policy - for the growth of the European Union is also correctly reiterated."
"Now, taking our lead from the report that has been voted on today, I think it is important that all the institutions and interested parties strive to realise the objectives defined therein, translating them into real action."
"Particularly important are: the adoption of measures for the protection of intellectual property; the affirmation of an industrial innovation model that aims for excellence; the modernisation of industries, particularly with regard to environmental protection and the careful use of energy resources; and support for the creation of circumstances that assist in the internationalisation of small and medium-sized enterprises."

"Approval of the minutes of the previous sitting: see Minutes"
"EU approach towards Iran (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Belder, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the EU's approach towards Iran (A7-0441/2011)."
"Mr President, I would like to start by expressing my gratitude to the shadow rapporteurs, with whom I enjoyed sound collaboration in the course of producing this report."
"The result is something that we can be proud of."
"A report was adopted in a vote of the Committee on Foreign Affairs by an overwhelming majority of 62 in favour and just 3 against."
"It is also very important, in this key portfolio, that we speak with one voice, not only in Parliament, but also in the European Institutions as a whole."
"I am delighted that, through this resolution, we are expressing our support and solidarity with the millions of demonstrators who have taken to the streets since the disputed presidential elections of 2009."
"The opposition forces in Iran are in dire need of that support and solidarity now that they are seeing how regimes are falling and presidents resigning elsewhere in the Middle East."
"The Green movement must feel our support, as the opposition is once again looking for options for how to organise legitimate protests against the Iranian authorities at the risk of their own lives."
"The fact that that risk is real is proven not only by the arrest of the opposition leaders, Mr Mousavi and Mr Karoubi, but also by the wild and uncontrolled calls from a significant proportion of the Majlis, the Iranian Parliament, to have them put to death."
"In our resolution, the European Parliament calls on the Iranian authorities to fully and unconditionally cooperate with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), based in Vienna."
"It is precisely Tehran's uncooperative stance that lends Iran's nuclear programme its suspicious air."
"The concerns of the whole international community are more than justified."
"That being the case, in my view, it is incomprehensible to send a country like this the message that it has a right to enrich uranium."
"However true it may be, it is not the signal that the European Parliament should be giving at this crucial point in time."
"I therefore ask my fellow Members to support my proposals to remove these passages from our resolution."
"The resolution also goes into Iran's role in the region."
"Certainly, in the wake of the documents leaked via WikiLeaks on the region's perception of Iran, Parliament will serve Tehran well by sending it a clear message that it must bring an immediate end to exercising its destabilising influence."
"I therefore ask you all to support the amendments I have tabled on the role of Iran in its neighbour Iraq and on the removal of paragraph 53 from the resolution."
"In my opinion, the European Parliament already gives sufficient support to the idea that the Union and Iran should have a stable Afghanistan as a common goal in paragraph 55."
"As I reach the end of my speech, Mr President, I would like to make one final remark."
"I am not thin-skinned, and it is precisely for that reason that I want to comment on Iran and its official representatives in Brussels and the national capitals."
"I have had the opportunity to take a look at correspondence from Iran to my fellow Members from various sources."
"The tone and the content of the correspondence must be called remarkable, to say the least."
"This report - I referred to this earlier - was adopted by the Committee on Foreign Affairs on which I serve by an overwhelming majority."
"For that reason, this resolution must not be seen as a private project of mine, but as a common stance of the European Parliament as a whole."
"It is therefore not the case that my background as chair of this Parliament's first delegation determined the critical tone of this resolution."
"On the contrary, in that respect, Iran must be called to account for its own behaviour."
"The entire European Parliament - and I am thankful for this - accepts neither President Ahmadinejad's anti-Semitic rhetoric nor the denial of the holocaust, although I have to say, unfortunately, that that anti-Semitism is not restricted to the inner circle of the regime."
"Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. - Mr President, this is an opportunity to debate the European Union's approach to Iran, which has been the subject of an own-initiative report with Mr Belder as rapporteur."
"Mr Belder's report touches on a broad range of issues and reflects the views of many different interests, but I will concentrate on two issues, the nuclear programme and the human rights situation in Iran, both of which the report deals with extensively."
"As honourable Members know, Iran's nuclear programme remains a serious concern for the European Union and for the international community as a whole."
"Both the UN Security Council and the Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna have adopted a series of resolutions requiring Iran to take the steps necessary to build confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of its programme."
"Regrettably, the last IAEA report, issued on 25 February, confirmed Iran's failure to comply with its international obligations."
"For the European Union, we remain determined to work towards a diplomatic solution on the basis of our double-track approach, combining pressure with dialogue."
"The objective remains to engage Iran in a phased approach of confidence building, leading to meaningful negotiations on the nuclear programme."
"At the second meeting I led on behalf of the E3+3 - China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States - in Istanbul, I presented to Iran our proposals for concrete confidence-building measures, including an updated fuel supply arrangement for the Tehran Research Reactor, as well as other transparency measures."
"Honourable Members will know that these proposals would bring immediate benefit for both sides and could pave the way for a process to address concerns and gradually build mutual confidence."
"And building confidence is what our efforts are all about."
"Iran's response was disappointing."
"It was not ready to discuss our proposals unless we first recognised Iran's 'right to enrich uranium'."
"It spoke of the removal of all sanctions."
"I understand Iran's wish to see sanctions removed."
"We all want to see our talks come to a successful conclusion which - in accordance with the Security Council resolutions - would mean the sanctions would go."
"The removal of sanctions is something which would accompany the gradual re-establishment of confidence."
"That was the path we were trying to go down."
"As for the 'right to enrich', the Non-Proliferation Treaty is careful to balance rights and obligations."
"I see no value in re-writing or re-interpreting it in any selective way."
"The first step is for Iran to put itself into full compliance with its obligations."
"We will continue our efforts engaging Iran but, at the same time, our efforts to increase the pressure, first of all, through a strengthening of the implementation of existing sanctions."
"I have since met with the new Foreign Minister of Iran, Dr Salehi, in Geneva, a meeting which gave me the chance to explain to him the efforts we have put into the Iran talks and our strong desire for a response, for the security of all of us."
"I have also written to Dr Jalili, who led the talks on behalf of Iran, to restate our offer and to invite him to respond."
"Dr Salehi told me they were considering their response and I urged them to be positive."
"Like this Parliament, I share the views of so many on the issue of human rights in Iran."
"The continued and systematic oppression, arrests and harassment of lawyers, journalists and others who are exercising their rights is totally unacceptable."
"We have seen very long prison sentences and restrictions on the right to work and travel for up to 20 years for some of the people convicted."
"When Iranian people wished to demonstrate peacefully on 14 February in support of the situation in Egypt and Tunisia, the demonstrations were forbidden."
"Moreover, as Mr Belder has said, Mr Mousavi and Mr Karoubi, the two opposition leaders who had expressed their support for these demonstrations, were held under house arrest and later apparently detained."
"I have seen the statement by Socialists and Democrats of the Parliament made on 1 March, and I fully support that."
"I remain very concerned about the treatment of Mr Karoubi and Mr Mousavi and I issued a statement on 4 March to that effect."
"Despite our efforts to secure verifiable information, it remains unclear whether they are under house arrest or otherwise imprisoned."
"I urge the authorities of Iran simply to grant them the freedom of movement to which they are entitled."
"The report also underlines the seriousness of the increase in executions in Iran."
"The information we have suggests there may have been around 100 executions since the beginning of this year."
"In line with our longstanding and firm position on the abolition of the death penalty, I have called for a halt to all pending death penalty cases."
"I want the death penalty abolished, whatever the method."
"Stoning and public hangings are barbaric."
"It is important to note that international efforts can and do make a difference."
"I saw that in the case of Ms Ashtiani."
"Her execution has - at least temporarily - been stayed, but as the report points out, Zahra Bahrami, a Dutch-Iranian national, was executed in Iran on 29 January with no prior notice."
"Both the execution and the process leading up to it were shocking."
"I have made this clear publicly, expressing my dismay over the lack of transparency in the case and that the Dutch authorities were refused consular access."
"Let me finish my intervention by mentioning that my services, together with Member States, are discussing how we can be more effective on human rights issues in Iran, using public and private messages, working bilaterally and through multilateral organisations, working with Member States and with international parties, all with a single purpose: to ensure that the Iranian people, like others, have their basic rights respected."
"I look forward to this debate."
"Mr President, Baroness Ashton, I should first like to thank our rapporteur, Mr Belder, for his comprehensive report."
"As soon as it is now put to a vote, it will be passed by a large majority here in this plenary."
"It is really important that the regime in Tehran must not succeed in breaking a broad common front even in this Chamber."
"As regards the nuclear ambitions of the leadership, the international community stands together at the United Nations."
"No one in the world wants the Iranian bomb."
"We all want complete and transparent collaboration with the International Atomic Energy Agency."
"We have made wide-ranging offers."
"Unfortunately, they have not met with a positive response."
"In this House, we are not quite all of one mind as to how far we should enforce international demands with sanctions."
"I hope, however, that in our overall view of the situation, we are coming to a common way to proceed."
"The second aspect that worries us is Iran's role in the region."
"Iran's attitude to Israel remains intolerable and unacceptable."
"Its support for organisations that destabilise the region cannot be tolerated."
"Large parts of the region are in fear of Iran's policy."
"The internal political situation is dramatic where human rights and democracy are concerned."
"It is for that reason that I harbour the wish that this great people of culture will rid itself of this leadership sooner rather than later."
"I am very confident that we shall not see a second Iran in Egypt, but rather a second Egypt in Iran."
"Then we should see an end to the exploitation of religion for very secular aims."
"Then one hopes that there would be an end to the death penalty in general and, in particular, for minors and members of minorities."
"Then there would be an end to the persecution of dissidents, not only of Mr Karoubi and Mr Mousavi, and then one hopes there would be press freedom and a path to free elections for a better Iran."
"On the way there, we must put our European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights to use among other things, so as to allow support to be given to active players in civil society."
"Targeted sanctions against representatives of the regime must also be extended."
"In the light of the events in North Africa, let us also give Iranians the courage for a better future."
"Mr President, Baroness Ashton, I am very pleased that the approach of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy is the dual approach of discussing human rights and the nuclear issue on a practically equal footing, because Iran is a contradictory example to the world and to the countries surrounding it which, immersed in democratic reform processes and guided by the legitimate democratic aspirations of their peoples, see in Iran exactly what they do not want for themselves, and that is what we are denouncing in the report that will possibly be adopted tomorrow."
"First of all, it is a technocratic regime that subjugates its people and violates human rights, by applying the death penalty - and I should like to mention the case of Zahra Bahrami in particular - by disempowering women, by persecuting homosexuals and by suppressing dissidence."
"It is also a contradictory example as regards political freedoms."
"The repression of demonstrators, which is going on right now and has been going on since 2009, is absolutely unacceptable, just as the detention of the leaders of the democratic opposition movement is unacceptable."
"On behalf of my group, I am demanding the immediate freeing of the opposition leaders, Mr Mousavi and Mr Karoubi, and their wives, as well as of all the people under arrest for peacefully exercising their right to freedom of expression, freedom of association and freedom of assembly."
"Iran is also a contradictory example in terms of negotiations with the international community on the nuclear issue."
"A responsible attitude by Iran in this area, as well as in that of human rights, a different focus in the region as regards Hamas and Hezbollah, and different rhetoric in relation to Israel, would make Iran an important partner and player in the region's stabilisation, which is another of the things we are calling for in this report."
"Baroness Ashton, it is important to open a European Union delegation in Tehran, not only so that we can have a political dialogue with the Iranian regime, but also with a view to civil society."
"Finally, I should like to thank Mr Belder for the work he has done with the shadow rapporteurs so that we were able to balance this report and make it acceptable to the entire European Parliament."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, is Ahmadinejad better than Gaddafi?"
"While the international community is rightly focused on Libya and seeks ways to end the violence Gaddafi and his collaborators inflict on citizens, let us not allow Iran to be snowed under in our political agendas."
"A massacre is also happening in Iran, but it happens in slow motion."
"One execution every eight hours since the start of this year, and systematic repression, torture, rape and censorship have been rampant during the Islamic Republic, and, in particular, since the elections in 2009."
"Ahmadinejad is no better than Gaddafi and we need to invoke similarly harsh measures to protect human rights in Iran."
"Some might argue that sanctions are in place, but these only focus on the nuclear issue without yielding the desired results."
"In fact, this risks becoming a zero sum game vis-à-vis human rights as impunity meanwhile continues."
"Madam Vice-President/High Representative, in this report, the European Parliament gives you the mandate to impose sanctions on individuals responsible for the grave human rights abuses that we see, and we have made this recommendation before."
"A list of 80 names has been leaked and attributed to your office."
"I want to ask whether this is a sign of your inclination to move ahead with this important measure."
"We also need to provide technologies for citizens to communicate freely and to access information, and the EU needs to be a safe haven for free thinkers."
"Vice-President/High Representative, let the EU lead on efforts to hold accountable individuals who rape women before execution so that there is absolutely no chance they may end up in heaven as virgins, men who shoot dead unarmed youths from rooftops while they walk in the streets, and the judges who convict human rights lawyers for defending juveniles and women."
"Let us hold accountable a system that allows de facto imprisonment of opposition leaders."
"When Libya is discussed on Friday, please use the momentum to introduce similar measures against those in power in Iran so that justice can be done to the Iranian citizens who, in 2009, started the massive youth uprisings that now inspire a generation in the Middle East and in North Africa."
"Mr President, the report before us, on which all groups have worked intensively together, represents a very good basis on which the EU can construct its Iran policy."
"The various issues on which we disagree with the Iranian Government are dealt with as a single overall challenge: the nuclear programme and Iran's relations with its neighbours, the catastrophic human rights situation in the country and the difficult economic situation."
"Unemployment has risen to enormous proportions; one in four Iranians is living below the poverty line."
"Baroness Ashton, you must now draw some conclusions from the report."
"We Europeans must not stand by while critics of the regime, trade unionists, women's rights workers and those of different faiths are detained, tortured and murdered."
"We must try, plainly harder than before, to put pressure on those responsible for human rights violations, through targeted sanctions, such as restricting entry or freezing their accounts."
"The European External Action Service must equally examine which economic sanctions actually hit the target and which of them merely impact upon the Iranian people."
"A policy of complete isolation will just lead us up a dead end and also fails to find favour with many Iranians."
"Parliament has, with this report, made it unmistakeably clear that democratic change cannot be brought about by external military means."
"We must stick to a double-track strategy going forward, under which we try to engage in dialogue while unambiguously insisting on respect for universal rights and compliance with international treaties."
"It is in this context that we must understand the demand to open an EU delegation in Tehran now that the European External Action Service has taken over responsibility from the rotating Presidency of the EU for representing the EU in third countries."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, High Representative, Iran to me represents the most serious threat to global security."
"President Ahmadinejad is determined to arm his country with nuclear weapons and the prospect of a nuclear-armed Iran is too terrifying to contemplate, posing an existential threat to Israel."
"This is why we must consider all options, including military ones, to prevent it."
"Iran has deceived and obstructed the international community time and time again."
"Sadly, the European Union has, at times, allowed itself to be manipulated by Ahmadinejad."
"While the Council regularly denounces the barbaric theocratic regime in Tehran, individual Member States have sometimes taken a less robust approach."
"Indeed, it is only a few months ago that EU leaders agreed to proscribe export credit guarantees to Iran."
"Until then, these guarantees represented a vital lifeline of an economic nature to the regime which craves any vestige of legitimacy, not least because of Ahmadinejad's contempt for human rights, as evidenced by the regular execution of homosexuals, political dissenters and minors."
"(The President asked the speaker to speak more slowly so as to permit interpretation)"
"Mr President, the Belder report has been considerably improved by the amendments, and my group can agree with a great number of statements."
"Unfortunately, for all that they are correct, it primarily contains descriptions of the situation, but the underlying philosophy of a realistic future perspective has not been developed."
"The human rights situation in Iran is intolerable."
"However, sanctions will not bring about a lasting improvement in this situation."
"In order to promote democratisation in Iran, we must do everything we can to make the international situation less tense."
"Worsening international relations brings with it the danger that further anti-democratic measures will be taken inside Iran, which will result in weakening the opposition."
"A policy of detente would also have to put an end to every form of threatening behaviour."
"Negotiations and international relations can only be successful if diplomatic recognition of all partners is a given."
"Only in this way can meaningful compromises in the dispute on the nuclear programme be achieved."
"I have set out our ideas for a carefully targeted Iran strategy in an alternative motion for a resolution, and on the grounds that I have described, I shall call for the Belder report to be rejected."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Belder on his excellent work."
"Whilst the world is watching the revolt in the Arab world, Iran continues to repress dissidents."
"The arrest of the two leaders of the opposition, Mr Mousavi and Mr Karoubi, is the most obvious proof of this."
"The West took action against Mr Gaddafi, but it continues to dither over Iran, perhaps because Mr Gaddafi has already fallen whilst Mr Ahmadinejad so far has not."
"The largest rebellion since the post-electoral revolts of 2009 is currently under way in Iran."
"What are we waiting for before we freeze all the assets held by Mr Ahmadinejad, the companies controlled by the revolutionary guard and all supporters of the regime who are involved in this repression?"
"What are we waiting for in order to impose travel restrictions on these figures of the regime?"
"(DE) Mr President, as is well known, it remains open to doubt whether the Iranian nuclear programme is really intended for peaceful purposes."
"For this reason, Iran's cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency is particularly important."
"It is crucial in order to confirm to the international community that Iran is applying nuclear energy for civil purposes."
"With regard to Middle East policy, it is up to Mr Ahmadinejad finally to make it clear that Iran poses no threat to Israel and also that it recognises Israel's right to exist within the borders recognised by international law."
"Disarmament and the creation of a nuclear-free zone should, in my opinion, be an important goal of the EU's Middle East policy, in order to guarantee peace and security in this region."
"Iran is naturally an important player in the Middle East."
"With this in mind, I am pleased to gather from Mr Belder's most comprehensive report that there is constructive cooperation with the EU on the question of Afghanistan in order to increase security and stability in this region."
"It is only in this way that we can remove the breeding ground from radical Islam or Islamism, which is rearing its ugly head increasingly often in Europe too."
"(NL) Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, two years ago, in other words, before the demonstrations in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya, the people of Tehran took to the streets."
"They did so at the risk of their own lives."
"They took to the streets because they wanted greater democracy."
"They also wanted to protest against the intolerance and repression of a flawed regime."
"I am therefore pleased that the emphasis in this report is on human rights and I congratulate Mr Belder for that. The lesson that we need to learn is that we have to do everything in our power to assist the opposition and all those who have demonstrated."
"We need to extend a helping hand to them against the regime."
"Why do we have to do so?"
"We have to do so because the regime has the money and the oil and those who are being oppressed will only be able to achieve anything if we also make an effort."
"I think it is a very good thing that we are very clear about this point in paragraph 32 of your report, Mr Belder."
"Mr President, when I see the repression, I would also like to hear from you what we are doing when it comes to the opposition leader, Mr Mousavi."
"Are we still paying attention to the fate of Mr Karoubi?"
"What specific options do we, as the European Union, have in order to provide more support?"
"Proof of the dynamism of Iranian society can also be seen in the one million signatures campaign, a campaign led by women who have been collecting one million signatures for the cause of opposing discriminatory legislation."
"I want to pay sincere tribute to these brave women."
"I would like Baroness Ashton to tell me where she can offer consular assistance, as this is not always offered."
"(SV) Mr President, violations of human rights in Iran are extensive and are also thought to be on the increase."
"There has been a definite deterioration in the situation in most areas, particularly when it comes to freedom of expression."
"There are threats to carry out a number of death penalties to which attention has been called; intellectuals, students and dissidents are persecuted; people are tortured; and women and ethnic and religious minorities continue to be discriminated against."
"The list can go on."
"This is something that was already disturbingly evident at the time of the election in 2009 and that continues to be so."
"All of us who, on various occasions, meet official representatives of Iran, are also met with more severity and implacability."
"In the light of this, I would like to say that I think the priorities that Baroness Ashton has outlined - which is to say human rights, strong existing sanctions and the nuclear programme - are the right ones and should clearly be our main concern."
"However, the sternness of the EU's reactions towards Iran must be made stronger and clearer."
"We need to be more implacable, too, when it comes to crimes against humanity."
"There comes a time when polite conversation is actually a form of deceit, and I believe that we are at that point now in relation to Iran."
"(SV) Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Belder for a very good report."
"I am a member of the delegation to Iran and I receive letters from the Iranian regime in which they address me in God's name, which I find extremely unpleasant."
"On this pretext, they are succeeding in creating what, on the basis of Mr Belder's report, can be clearly described as hell on earth."
"It is incredible and hard to believe."
"I have a little idea and a dream that I would like to present to Baroness Ashton in this context."
"When you build a big new building for the External Action Service, would you possibly have room for a little office for a small group of people who could gather information on who the torturers, executioners and judges are in these grotesque societies that surround us, so that they know that we are monitoring their behaviour closely?"
"(PL) Mr President, Mrs Ashton, I would like to congratulate Mr Belder for an excellent report."
"I have the impression that the European Union has a double standard, and that we very severely criticise regimes just as they begin to crumble and fall."
"The example of Libya is a case in point."
"Meanwhile, we remain silent, guided too often by a variety of reasons - which include the economic interests of certain countries - when it comes to those regimes which are doing well."
"The Iranian regime is doing well, and the report's criticism of it is completely justified."
"What has been going on for years in Iran is something which is absolutely unacceptable."
"The European Parliament must speak about this."
"We must say what we think about the death penalty, about torture and about the fact that the hopes which - let us remember - were associated with the fall of Shah Reza Shah Pahlavi have completely failed."
"On the contrary - things are even worse."
"(NL) Mr President, I would like to start by offering my compliments to Mr Belder on his outstanding report."
"Mr Belder has written a very pointed report that takes a stone-hard line on Iran."
"It is the right line to take."
"The dictator, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, just carries on killing his own citizens, while political opponents are tortured."
"Rumour has it that the Dutch citizen, Zahra Bahrami, was also tortured and I have asked for this to be looked into."
"I would like to ask the left-wing socialists and the appalling Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance in this House not to water down this report with all sorts of different amendments."
"The criminal Ahmadinejad regime continues to threaten Israel and is attempting to exert its influence in Egypt."
"Ideally, Iran would like to see the advent of an Islamic republic including political ayatollahs, Sharia law, the stoning of women and the hanging of homosexuals."
"Yes, ladies and gentlemen, for many Muslims, that is what pure Islam stands for."
"Iranian warships have even sailed through the Suez canal, a downright provocative gesture to the West and to Israel."
"I will make that my last point."
"(LT) Mr President, the European Union's relations with Iran are more than a little ambivalent."
"We are allowing ourselves to be manipulated."
"We are talking about democracy, the democracy clause, but we detect a distinct smell of oil and gas."
"If we do not have the goal of democracy in our hearts, let it be trampled on along with human rights."
"A few years ago, I was astonished by public information on the powerful construction machinery that European Union companies are providing Tehran with. This included deep mining equipment to build underground plants, where a nuclear weapon is most probably being produced."
"Tehran already has rockets able to reach almost the whole of Europe, so why not help them produce just what we always wanted for Christmas."
"European deep excavation machinery is digging a hole both for the Iranian nation, if Israel fails to hold its nerve faced with the spectre of a second exodus, and also for Europe and the whole world."
"It does not seem as if Europe is ready for this scale of challenge, above all, nuclear Iran's hegemony in the Near East and Northern Africa."
"Is anyone analysing current events in this respect?"
"Other notable equipment includes powerful German and Dutch construction cranes, which Tehran is using for the public execution of so-called criminals and opponents of the regime."
"It is said that hanging using these European cranes is particularly cruel and the agony lasts for a long period."
"Today, the executions of sinners continue, as does the supply of equipment from Europe."
"Hopefully, the Iranian authorities will not order Mistral aircraft carriers in Saint-Nazaire, but will be able to acquire them a little later in Russia, built under a French licence."
"There will definitely be a need for the Mistrals, so that the countries of the Persian Gulf feel the gun at their heads."
"The feelings of small countries around the Baltic and Black Seas are of little concern to anyone, but the Persian Gulf is close to Europe's belly."
"I suggest we consider this."
"(SL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the tragedy of Iran is great."
"Thirty years after the revolution against the Shah's dictatorship, a simple question arises: can Iran be considered a civilised country at all?"
"The barbarity of the Iranian regime is reflected in its many diverse forms of oppression and in its anachronisms."
"Women, dissidents, anyone who thinks differently, young people, people of same-sex orientation and so on and so on are being oppressed."
"What can we do about this?"
"On the one hand, the European Union needs a policy towards Iran and it needs to impose sanctions that will hurt the main representatives of the regime."
"Let us prevent them from travelling and doing business, and that includes the Revolutionary Guard."
"On the other hand, let us help young people and those fighting for human rights and democratic change."
"Ensuring free access to information, freedom of the press, television, radio and especially the Internet is key."
"Facebook, Twitter and YouTube are the strongest weapons for those who are humiliated and outraged, the numbers of whom in Iran are very large."
"We have a responsibility to protect them."
"(RO) Mr President, in 2005, this regime came to power with a message promoting nationalism and justice."
"Even now, we have failed to turn Iran into a democratic regime."
"All that we have managed is to witness the development of the only country which promotes a despotic regime on a large scale, worthy of the dark Middle Ages."
"Fellow Members, I believe that Iran is becoming one of the burning issues in our foreign policy because we risk ignoring the huge influence it has in North Africa through funding terrorist-type movements, by which I mean Hamas and Hezbollah."
"Unless the European Union carries out a clear assessment of Iran's influence in this region, we are at risk of this lack of democracy in Iran becoming established."
"More than that, we face within Europe a serious weakness and the risk of a threat to our security."
"I believe that it is time for solutions to stop following the traditional principle encouraged by Talleyrand, which is to dance and then come to a clear, firm decision."
"(NL) Mr President, Mr Belder's report is a very good one, as it is both realistic and pragmatic."
"As far as I am concerned, the report could still have been much stronger in its criticism of the reprehensible Ahmadinejad regime."
"This villain denies the holocaust and would like nothing better than to drive the state of Israel into the sea with no time to lose."
"Christians literally have no life under Ahmadinejad."
"What is more, he oppresses his own people in an appalling way."
"Never have so many people been executed as over the last year."
"The EU must therefore continue to support the forces of opposition, which focus on democracy and human rights."
"The Ahmadinejad regime cannot be tackled hard enough."
"I am talking about sanctions and targeted actions against the Iranian nuclear programme, as happened with the Stuxnet virus."
"I look forward to the day that this regime falls."
"Today would not be soon enough!"
"Mr President, human rights defenders in Iran are subject to death threats, acts of harassment, arbitrary arrest, judicial harassment, stigmatisation, violent attacks, ill treatment, torture and killings."
"Women human rights defenders are particularly at risk in Iran."
"Freedoms of expression, association and assembly are severely restricted in Iran and often come with severe penalties."
"The death penalty is also arbitrarily used, especially on minors."
"However, what I find considerably disturbing is how the European Union actually deals with Iran."
"Once again, our High Representative seems to talk a lot but do very little."
"I have often, and I repeat it again today, invited her to the Subcommittee on Human Rights to actually be questioned on her activities in the area of human rights."
"She has told us today how important human rights are to her, but when has she ever come to the Human Rights Subcommittee?"
"She is willing to send her underlings, but she is not willing to have a democratic cross-examination by this House."
"She will listen to our speeches, come up with some rambling, pre-prepared statement and then go home."
"That is not democracy, Ms Ashton."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"Mr President, I do not want to take up too much time."
"I just want to ask Ms Sinclaire this: when the High Representative comes to a special plenary sitting of the whole Parliament to discuss the annual human rights report and is cross-questioned by MEPs from across the whole Parliament, does she not think that this is a more satisfactory way for us to hold the High Representative to account on the human rights record than asking her to attend the subcommittee of the Parliament, even one that I dearly cherish?"
"Mr President, with respect to my colleague, it is actually not satisfactory because as he knows - and if he spent as much time in the Human Rights Subcommittee as I do, he would - it is in committees that we actually get a chance to have more than one say and more than one minute, and then we actually get a direct response."
"I have made many comments on the issues of human rights and I have yet to have one reply from Baroness Ashton - one reply - so how is that?"
"I repeat that this is about democracy."
"I represent five million people."
"I have been elected here."
"Baroness Ashton has not received a vote in her life."
"(PL) Mr President, Mrs Ashton, I would like to congratulate Mr Belder for an excellent report."
"It is to be welcomed, too, that the report was amended during the negotiations."
"I think that with these amendments it has now been given the appropriate wording."
"The entire international community, which attaches great importance to democracy and human rights, is alarmed by what has been going on over many years in Iran, and we are trying to decide what measures should be taken."
"They must, of course, come from within Iran."
"Hence, it is obvious that the European Union supports the Iranian opposition."
"I think there are three issues which we should now raise and which may influence policy in Iran."
"The first matter concerns our policy of cooperation with Turkey in relation to Iran."
"Turkey is an important partner for the European Union."
"It is a country ruled by a party for which the Islamic tradition is important, but it is also ruled in a way which is much closer to European standards."
"The second matter is cooperation with Russia."
"We should put pressure on Russia to work still more closely with the European Union and the United States, so that cooperation with Iran does not look as it does today."
"Thirdly, the last matter, and one which is very important, is that of the anti-missile shield."
"The European Union should work with NATO and the United States to ensure that the shield is built in Europe."
"Mr President, the initial text of this report was criticised for its aggressive language, focusing mostly on Iran's nuclear programme, neglecting the human rights concern and lacking a positive perspective for future cooperation."
"The numerous amendments presented by my group and by others correct these flaws, and the current text is a balanced one."
"It distinguishes the two main dossiers: human rights abuses by the current government and the Iranian nuclear programme."
"The two dossiers are not the same thing, and it is irresponsible to make threats to Iran of war or international intervention, as I have heard suggested in this Parliament today."
"If you want to strengthen Ahmadinejad, just continue to do so, because all Iranians, regardless of their political positions, will take a stand against any foreign intervention."
"The current policy that the European Council and also the High Representative are taking is the right one, because it is based on a careful appreciation of the situation on the ground."
"Mr President, first of all, I congratulate Mr Belder on his excellent report."
"Iran has the potential influence and wealth to be either a force for good or a force for evil in the greater Middle East."
"Regrettably, its regime has become a force for evil masquerading in religious garb."
"Iran's nuclear weapon programme is cause for enormous regional and international concern."
"Iran has become a source of extremist doctrine, it carries out and sponsors acts of international terrorism, has a dangerous influence on populations of young Shias in the Gulf States, in Iraq and in Lebanon and does not hesitate to ally with Sunni terrorist groups in Gaza and beyond."
"It has helped train and arm terrorists that have attacked NATO forces in Afghanistan and it is a human rights abuser."
"It would be tragically ironic if a tyranny such as Iran became the main beneficiary of the desire for greater freedom that we have seen so dramatically expressed across the Arab world in recent weeks and in a most sickening example of hypocrisy - I am just finishing Mr President - President Ahmadinejad has told the Egyptian people that they have the right to express their own views about their country."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(RO) Mr President, the international community is looking almost helplessly on as the human rights situation deteriorates in Iran."
"However, we should not overlook the instruments we have available to make our voice heard."
"The Treaty of Lisbon provides us, through the position of High Representative, with a means of persuading the Iranian Government that human rights must not be restricted through repression."
"They are an inalienable privilege of the individual and must not be brought into question by any political regime."
"Mass executions, particularly those involving juveniles, stoning, discrimination against women and minorities and torture are, unfortunately, part of a much longer list."
"Democratic change cannot be imposed from outside."
"However, the European Union must constantly support the people inside this country, and not only through making statements, who are risking their lives every day to protest against these injustices."
"(CS) Mr President, in light of what is happening in the Arab world, in Libya, Egypt, Tunisia and elsewhere, the rigidity and immobility of the Iranian regime is even more apparent."
"It is an intolerant regime, a fundamentalist regime, a regime which murders political opponents, and a regime which must be kept under international pressure."
"We must support the Iranian opposition in exile, which is legitimate, and we have European Parliament resolutions on this."
"It is necessary, among other things, to monitor the situation in the Ashraf refugee camp in Iraq, where there are more than 3 000 Iranian refugees from exiled opposition organisations, and where there is a risk of a humanitarian catastrophe, and it is necessary to provide protection to these people."
"I would therefore like to hear a clear opinion from Baroness Ashton on this matter, and I would like to hear a clear statement as to how, under her leadership, the EU will be helping these refugees in the Ashraf camp."
"Mr President, now that the EU is calling for an immediate end to the brutal Gaddafi dictatorship and insists on completely isolating him, the same applies to the brutal and bloody Iranian regime."
"Cherishing hopes for confidence building is not a realistic option any more, especially since Tehran has completely eroded its credibility regarding its nuclear programme."
"Instead, we should address the great potential of people-led democratic change in Iran."
"True, this change cannot be imposed from outside."
"However, the EU's priority should be to extend our clear moral and political support to these forces."
"I have especially in mind blacklisting top Iranian officials (Ms Schaake mentioned eighty names), supporting the start of Farsi-language Euronews broadcasts and insisting that parliamentary relations - if any - should be conducted under strict conditionality."
"Mr President, the current dogma is that Iran will be the big winner of the revolutions in North Africa and beyond."
"This is possible but less probable."
"Firstly, the Iranian model is not exactly what the young people who are revolting in these countries are aspiring to."
"Secondly, the regime does not enjoy internal peace in order to concentrate exclusively on promoting a more assertive foreign policy."
"Finally, because other countries like Turkey - or even Egypt after, but also during, transition - are powerful competitors to Iran's ambitions."
"Of course, Iran can always derive a degree of influence through proxies, but that would probably not prove decisive in gaining control in those countries."
"Paradoxically, the only way to derive an advantage would be to look at the current developments as an opportunity to start reinserting Iran into the international community."
"It would be a long road but the only sensible one for Iran."
"I congratulate Mr Belder on an excellent report."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Belder for his excellent report."
"Just one day after celebrating the 100th anniversary of International Women's Day, I would like to make a special point about the situation of women in Iran, and please allow me to dedicate this speech not only to Sakineh Ashtiani and Zahra Bahrami, but to all women put in jail and those who are missing because of the current Iranian repression."
"The EU has to take into account the aspirations for democratic change of the people of Iran and the unacceptable situation that Iranian women have to face."
"We know that there is discrimination, and even political and social repression, affecting women in this country, and we should echo these unacceptable facts when considering our approach towards Iran."
"While the situation is currently deteriorating, women's rights activists in the country have continued taking the lead in opposing the current repression and denial of civil liberties and human rights."
"Women's rights should not be an optional negotiation point and I hope, Madam Vice-President/High Representative, that the EU will uphold this violence without compromising them."
"(EL) Mr President, the report by Mr Belder, as presented to us, is an accurate, balanced and objective report."
"I personally sympathise with the people of Iran, who are an ancient nation with an ancient culture and important traditions."
"Iran is a rich oil-producing nation and has an important geopolitical position in the Middle East."
"The systematic violation of human rights noted in the report and by all the speakers does not sit well with such a nation with such a tradition."
"First of all, however, the Ahmadinejad government needs to realise this and take the necessary measures."
"This country's insistence on pursuing a nuclear programme which is unacceptable to the international community has caused massive tension in the area and raised huge questions."
"Whatever else, it does nothing whatsoever for geopolitical stability in the area."
"We must not forget or overlook the massive uprisings in North Africa and the Middle East and the fact that the Muslim communities are turning towards a political Islam."
"(DE) Mr President, the green revolution and the latest protests demonstrate quite clearly that there is great potential for civil society in Iran."
"This must be supported, for it is the only way that a democratic opening can develop."
"Unfortunately, sanctions often hit precisely this young and active civil society."
"The holding of Tests of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL tests) has been abandoned, for example."
"This test is, however, a prerequisite for study at most Anglo-American universities."
"The victims of this abandonment are thus internationally minded students."
"The report uncritically proposes further sanctions, such as restrictions on the export of technology for mobile phone and communications networks, yet it is precisely these rapid communications and information technologies that are needed to spread pluralistic ideas."
"Ultimately, it will be the third countries China, Russia and India, who will carry on doing business, exporting and securing raw materials for themselves, and who will unfortunately not comply with these sanctions, who will be left laughing."
"(RO) Mr President, at the moment, Iran is joining the Arab states which are seeking their path to democracy, and the situation in the country is described in detail in the report drafted by Mr Belder."
"The Tehran regime is firmly opposed to change, with its suppression of demonstrations and arrest of the movement's leaders."
"I strongly condemn this stance which has been predominant in Iranian society for a good number of years."
"The people are asking for their right to free expression and the government ought to listen to their requests."
"Furthermore, the Iranian authorities have turned violating human rights into a habit."
"At this point, I would like to mention Neda, the 'Angel of Iran'."
"They support the use of the death penalty, stoning, the execution of juvenile criminals, all by ignoring their international obligations."
"Iran's nuclear ambitions are also endangering the population."
"Operations in the newest nuclear energy plant had to be halted recently due to contamination risks."
"(FI) Mr President, Baroness Ashton, this report is especially welcome because the European Union must have a clear and consistent strategy for countries like Iran."
"Over what was just an 18month period, in 2008 and 2009, Parliament adopted a position on access to justice for 36 Iranian people in connection with single human rights violations."
"This is more than with any one other country."
"Moreover, each of them would deserve being mentioned and remembered individually here even now."
"Where Iran is concerned, human rights should not be accorded secondary status with trade and tariff preferences."
"That is morally wrong and to the EU's shame."
"That is why the European Union and Parliament must, in future, closely monitor developments in Iran's human rights situation."
"Mr President, I also want to join my colleagues in the call to support the Iranian opposition and provide for better protection of refugees in Camp Ashraf."
"These poor people and their families are constant targets of a brutal and vicious Iranian regime."
"Adding to their plight is the daily harassment and hostile attitude of Iraqi forces who are supposed to protect them."
"Madam High Representative, let us not forget these sorely tried people."
"Together, we need to ensure that the EU plays a key role in their transition from persecuted opposition to a democratic government."
"After all, it is in everybody's interest to see - and hopefully soon - a stable and democratic Iran whose citizens enjoy the same freedom and rights as we do here in the EU."
"Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. - Mr President, I think that this has been an interesting debate and I wanted to just deal with the two specific issues that were raised in a sense outside of the debate before winding up on that matter."
"Ms Paulsen asked me whether we could find space in the - I think the word was 'glittering' - new building, to be able to have people working on the issues of concern in human rights."
"Can I just say that I was delighted that Madam Hautala, the Chair of the Subcommittee on Human Rights, wrote to me to say that she was pleased with the design of how we plan to deal with human rights within the new organisation."
"However, I am only moving people into one building to remove them from eight buildings where they are currently scattered around Brussels, believing as I do that enabling people to work together will make us more effective."
"We will have to squeeze them in, because I am also trying to save money on the way."
"Therefore I hope, when you see what we do, that the word 'glittering' will be a nice word and not a word, I fear, that suggests I am trying to do something that I genuinely am not."
"In response to Ms Sinclaire: the way that I was told to respond on human rights issues by Parliament, by decision of this House, was to attend regularly the Committee on Foreign Affairs (AFET) to which the subcommittees - of which the Subcommittee on Human Rights is one - would be invited and where they would be able to put questions to me."
"I have done that and I am more than happy to meet with Ms Hautala, as I do, and to respond to queries from her, as well as to attend the plenary debates in this House."
"I am more than happy to try and do more;"
"I simply ask you to recognise that there is a limit to the amount of hours I have got in the day and the number of things I can do."
"But it is not out of any disrespect to the Committee or indeed to you personally at all; far from it."
"I do hope that you will feel able to contact my office with issues of concern and indeed to attend the meetings where I am able to come and speak."
"I am very well aware of my own background in terms of being a leader of a House of Parliament and not being elected, but I was very privileged to be elected by this House and, of course, to be invited into this role by 27 Heads of State and the President of the Commission."
"As far as that goes, I am very mindful of my responsibilities."
"In relation to the debate itself and the human rights issues that have, in a sense, dominated our debate: I am trying to look at what more we can do."
"I will not comment on what currently is being dealt with specifically because I want to present this when we finish the work, but we are talking to human rights activists and to organisations, as well as considering across the 27 Member States what might be a more effective way of being able to address this issue and to put as much pressure as we possibly can."
"As regards Mr Karoubi and Mr Mousavi, as I have said, it is even difficult to establish precisely whether they are in prison or under house arrest."
"I am trying to continue to get that clarification."
"Of course, we are supporting the resolution in Geneva for a special rapporteur on Iran."
"We do raise these issues directly as well; it is really important that we all stand together in pushing forward on human rights in Iran."
"Many honourable Members have raised specific cases and the terrible record that this country has, and we need to do as much as we possibly can and I think we can do better if we do that together."
"Finally, on the nuclear issue: I spent four and a half days in direct discussions with the Iranian negotiators and I am very clear in what I am trying to do, which is to provide an opportunity for this country, for Iran, to show what it keeps saying, to demonstrate that it is moving in a civil nuclear power direction and not in a nuclear weapons direction."
"As I have said to them, it is not difficult: what they have to do is be open and transparent, to allow the inspectors to do the job they are supposed to do and to do the confidence building that we have ofttimes explained to them in great detail."
"It is for them to choose."
"I am absolutely clear as well that the Security Council and my role with the E3+3 will continue to put pressure on to try and make sure this happens."
"What is really encouraging is that although I lead the negotiations, I do so with the E3+3 sitting with me; and that shows very clearly to Iran that we are totally united in our approach, and I pay tribute to all those who work with me."
"They have to show the political will to do what is necessary; and if they do not, I say to the honourable Members, we will have to do more to keep the pressure on."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by offering you all my sincere thanks for your valuable contributions to this debate."
"I listened very attentively to what you had to say."
"Your contribution makes it clear what my intention is with this report, namely, to point out that our fundamental rights - our human rights, which are so fundamental and form the basis of our existence - are also the rights of the Iranians."
"For me, it is identical."
"In other words, the attention that we pay to fundamental rights and to their observance is essential."
"I am convinced that such observance also creates future prospects for Iran, and specifically for the youth of the country."
"It struck me during the debate that Mrs Lösing - who is no longer present, unfortunately - hit the nail on the head with regard to future prospects."
"That is certainly something that is close to my heart."
"If we just take a look at the facts, we see that for years on end now, over 150 000 young, highly-educated Iranians have left the Islamic Republic precisely because of the lack of any prospects for the future."
"They did so not only because of the repression, but also because of the oppressive socio-economic situation and the climate of a lack of freedom."
"The bottom line - and I was told this by an insider who is also an economist - is that this alone generates a loss of 40 billion a year, and that is not including the brain drain."
"Through my report, what I wanted to highlight was precisely that the attention we pay and the promotion we give to more leeway and the observance of human rights truly provide some future prospects in Iran."
"This also benefits the region in terms of overall security."
"Finally, Baroness Ashton, I was really curious when I found out - I had not been aware of this, but my fellow Members brought it up - that a couple of weeks ago in the American press, a report circulated that there is, in actual fact, to be a list of serious violations of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran and of those responsible, from top to bottom, right down to the jailors in the prisons."
"I would be extremely appreciative if you were to follow the American example in respect of a list of this kind, as we would not then all merely focus on those bringing about nuclear proliferation and thus threatening world security, but also on the terrible prevailing climate in Iran."
"At the same time, this sends a signal to the Iranians that we are looking at the whole picture in Iran, not just at the nuclear threat, and that we nonetheless believe that Iran should be a normal civil society, in line with the high level of civilisation that the country has traditionally enjoyed throughout its history."
"Finally, you must not think ill of me in relation to the fact that for me, as a Protestant, the freedom of religion is extraordinarily important."
"Let me be clear on this point: for the Sunnis - the minority - for the Baha'i, for Christians and Jews - this is such a terribly embarrassing point - my report unfortunately is already out-of-date, I admit straight away."
"I say this as there has been a tidal wave of repression that has hit the Sunnis, the Baha'i and Christians, in particular, over recent months, and I apologise to my fellow Members that my report is not up-to-date in that regard."
"For me, this is a spur to do more with Iran - I am working on the basis of an open-door policy - and I hope to be in touch with you on a regular basis in order to help bring about an Iran with a future for its entire population."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at midday on Thursday, 10 March."
"16th session of the United Nations Human Rights Council (Geneva, 28 February - 25 March 2011) (debate)"
"The next item is the statement by the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on the 16th session of the United Nations Human Rights Council (Geneva, 28 February - 25 March 2011)."
"Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. - Mr President, I am pleased we also have the chance this afternoon to debate the work of the UN Human Rights Council and, in a sense, to look at how we can strengthen its overall impact."
"As honourable Members may know, I addressed the Council last week together with many Foreign Ministers from across the world."
"For obvious reasons on that occasion, the situation in Libya was at the heart of our discussions."
"I am pleased that the international community sent a strong and united political signal regarding the ongoing human rights violations in Libya."
"Already before the High-Level Segment, the Council had called for an inquiry and recommended the suspension of Libya's membership of the Council - which, as you know, has since been confirmed by the General Assembly in a unanimous decision."
"All that is proof that multilateral institutions can live up to their mandate and can act in what we call real time."
"As I stressed in my remarks there, the UN Human Rights Council has a responsibility to ensure that stated intentions are translated into real action and real progress."
"I think that Ms Pillay, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, whom I met in Geneva, is giving exactly the right direction politically in order to make a difference on the ground."
"What matters in the end is not the number of resolutions that are passed, but results in the real world that make a difference to people who are in need."
"I also emphasised that human rights are universal."
"I pointed out that we in Europe reject the accusation that somehow, the EU is trying to 'export' so-called European values to other countries."
"The rights to free speech, freedom of assembly, justice and equality are not European rights: they are universal rights."
"We must never fall into the trap of believing that people in other parts of the world - whether it is Africa, Asia or Latin America - should be any less passionate about their rights."
"That is why we speak out and we act against human rights violations wherever they occur."
"We also recognise that Europe's own path on human rights protection has not been a straight line and that constant efforts are also needed inside Europe."
"At the Human Rights Council, we are ready to discuss our own challenges, share experiences and offer support to those working to improve respect for human rights around the world."
"We have several priorities for the 16th session of the Human Rights Council and we have discussed these actively with our partners."
"The EU will present an initiative on freedom of religion or belief."
"Faced in recent months with an increasing number of acts of religious discrimination and violence in different parts of the world, we need to send a strong, collective message against religious intolerance and in favour of the freedom of religion or belief for all people everywhere."
"We will also table resolutions on Burma/Myanmar and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea."
"We believe that in both cases, the severity and number of human rights violations justify the extension of the mandates of the respective UN Special Rapporteurs."
"The EU also supports the initiative to create a Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iran, as proposed by several countries and regions."
"We are seriously concerned about the deteriorating human rights situation in Iran."
"This was highlighted by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Ms Navi Pillay."
"A particular concern is the dramatically increasing number of death penalty cases - more than 100 so far this year, as we discussed in our previous debate - and the repression of those exercising their rights to freedom of expression and assembly."
"We feel the Council should address the situation in Egypt in an appropriate manner, taking into account the rapidly evolving situation in that country."
"The EU welcomes Egypt's invitation to Ms Pillay to send members of her Office to the country."
"We hope this mission will be dispatched without delay."
"The EU also is engaging with the Tunisian authorities to jointly present a draft resolution on the subject of boosting UN technical assistance on human rights in the context of ongoing transition."
"Other key situations that need to be addressed by this session of the Human Rights Council are Belarus, where we are deeply concerned at the number of political prisoners, the Democratic Republic of Congo - where there are distressing reports of continuing human rights violations, in particular, widespread sexual violence - as well as Côte d'Ivoire."
"Let me conclude by stressing once again the importance of the Human Rights Council for the EU: the debates, the resolutions and the rapporteurs."
"But in the end, these are only inputs."
"What truly matter are the outputs."
"The real test is whether we make a difference on the ground."
"For that reason, the EU will work hard to strengthen the Human Rights Council and especially its ability to address urgent situations."
"This is a key objective of the ongoing review process."
"We will continue to push for an ambitious result."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, I would like to take this opportunity to express my full support for the decision taken by the UN General Assembly on 1 March to suspend Libya's membership of the United Nations Human Rights Council."
"I think this sends a strong signal, not only to Colonel Gaddafi and his regime, but also to those countries in the world where human rights violations are frequent and widespread."
"In my report on the UN Human Rights Council and the EU's role in it - adopted by this House in February 2009 - I strongly advocated the introduction of membership criteria for this important UN body."
"In the case of Libya, the United Nations General Assembly acted in line with the European Parliament resolution and took a correct and timely decision."
"Speaking of the 16th session, I would like to draw special attention to the Council's review process."
"It is important that the EU Member States and the European External Action Service actively engage in the 2011 review of the Council to strengthen compliance with its mandate."
"The UNHRC should become more an early-warning and preventive mechanism."
"There is also a need for a transparent and all-inclusive review process, including NGOs, civil society and all relevant stakeholders."
"Last but not least, I would like to welcome the establishment of the Directorate for Human Rights and Democracy in the EEAS system."
"The establishment of the External Action Service also provides us with a unique opportunity to streamline our action on the protection of human rights in the United Nations Human Rights Council."
"I therefore want to encourage the High Representative to make sure that European efforts in the Human Rights Council are well coordinated and that EU Member States belonging to this body are united and effective as never before."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - Mr President, I shall start by welcoming yesterday's appointment of Mariangela Zappia as Head of Delegation in Geneva."
"Her appointment contributes to advancing gender equality in the External Action Service."
"We look forward to working with her."
"Our Parliament will be present at a crucial time for the review of the Human Rights Council, as the global fulcrum for respect of human rights, the universal periodic review of all UN members, the independence of its experts or so-called special procedures, and the enhanced role for civil society participation."
"They are key characteristics of the Council that we should work to protect at all costs."
"I am disappointed that the outcome document for the working group on the review omits any independent trigger for special sessions, that there is no requirement for member countries to justify failure to respond to recommendations, and that there is no provision at all for addressing specific country situations."
"It is ironic that this session will address seven individual country situations."
"As it is doing in the cases of Libya and Côte d'Ivoire, the EU must continue to find creative ways within existing rules to make sure that human rights violators can never escape accountability."
"To show in this debate that the High Representative does answer questions, can I ask her three in particular?"
"Firstly, given what she said about the Democratic Republic of the Congo, will Europeans support the appointment of a special mandate holder for that country?"
"Secondly, does she accept that, at some stage, a judgment has to be made as to whether the Palestinian and Israeli investigations in relation to the Goldstone report meet international standards, with a deliberation on the possible referral to the International Criminal Court if they do not?"
"Thirdly, will the EU lodge an objection to Pakistan's reservation on Article 40 - the obligation to report - of the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights?"
"In conclusion, I believe that Libya's suspension from the Human Rights Council creates a historic precedent for respect for human rights in the UN system, which, in these dark days, shines a light on the silver thread."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, the UN Human Rights Council has the potential to address the ever more urgent and elaborate human rights violations across the world in different countries - Iran, Belarus, Burma, Tunisia, Libya, etc., there are too many to mention - but also horizontal themes such as LGBT rights, free expression, rape as a war crime and the role of human rights defenders."
"In a sense, the UN Human Rights Council is in a similar position to the EU and it has to act as a global player."
"But both bodies suffer from the same problem - a lack of credibility, double standards at times, and they are not able to act quickly enough."
"The EU thus far has been unwilling to scrutinise its own human rights record sufficiently, for example, its participation in renditions and the lack of press freedom in some of our Member States."
"Until last week, Libya was a member of the UN Human Rights Council."
"It has, rightfully, been removed."
"This is a very important precedent."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, with decisive and timely action towards Libya, the EU and the Human Rights Council have indeed shown that they can take action when needed."
"They can indeed."
"They can show that different regional groups can come together and they can show that the Council does not need to be divided."
"Today, there is no longer a reason why action on Iran, North Korea, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Burma and Sudan could not be next in line."
"This time is significant for another reason."
"A first comprehensive review of the working methods of the Council has come to a conclusion and, like my colleagues, I feel disappointed by the fact that the Council failed to appreciate the importance of the review."
"The EU prepared itself well but failed to win the support of others."
"But at least the independence of the Human Rights Commissioner and of the special procedure was not damaged, so this is already an achievement under the present conditions."
"In any future discussions of the Council's work, the European Union must be able to build alliances and to reach across to other partners."
"It must also be willing to listen and able to compromise."
"I think we had a very welcome participation by the High Representative in the meeting some weeks ago."
"High Representative, I salute you for taking this step and giving a very impressive presentation there."
"So to my last point: the EU's performance."
"After the creation of the Human Rights and Democracy Directorate at the European External Action Service, the EU delegation in Geneva will have a central role to play in EU human rights policy in the world."
"It needs increased resources and its work must be integrated into all fields of EU foreign policy."
"I am very honoured to be leading Parliament's delegation to the Human Rights Council's 16th session at this critical time next week."
"Mr President, Lady Ashton, you began work with the world in disarray; a world in the midst of financial, food and energy crises triggered by attempts to regulate the markets."
"The truth is that your difficulties are the result of the underlying approach, whereby an unregulated free market structures our lives: this has caused serious human rights issues, both in developed and developing countries."
"This is our problem, one we have been unable to resolve, yet there are no signs of moves to rethink the economic policy that is leading the whole of humanity down a blind alley."
"I believe that is one problem that needs to be resolved, first and foremost, followed by the European Union's cynical exploitation of human rights, and our foreign and neighbourhood policies, which require a comprehensive overhaul in light of the upheavals in north Africa."
"We have given the impression - in the foreign policy that you inherited - that we are more concerned with free trade than with human rights."
"We have never applied Article 2 of the association agreements: not with Tunisia, not with Egypt, nor in the association agreements that we are seeking to conclude with Colonel Gaddafi, Prime Minister Netanyahu or King Mohammed VI."
"The article has never been enforced, giving the impression that we are not interested in strict compliance with the human rights obligations set out in the association agreements."
"This issue has yet to be resolved and I hope that at some point, the House and the European Union will take action."
"Mr President, Commissioner Ashton, I will not say that man is hypocritical, but I will say that he is contradictory."
"The whole of world philosophy, all of literature, everyone with an education, and all of us here in this House, recognise human rights and yet, as you said, half the UN members are in breach of human rights."
"We are talking the talk, but not walking the walk."
"We know that, for the sake of grand ideas, we have become the biggest criminals in mankind."
"This being so, I welcome the 16th session of the United Nations Human Rights Council and I trust that, with current developments and with the lessons we have learned from experience, it will adopt fundamental resolutions."
"As you know, I have been a lawyer for forty years and I have understood and I have as my creed the fact that respect for human rights is a way of life and is not easily imposed."
"Please adopt a more fundamental policy on this issue."
"(DE) Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, human rights, liberty and equality are far too important for all of us to allow games to be played with them, for them to be put in the balance against powerful interests, and for commercial interests perhaps to take precedence over these values that are so important."
"They deserve our full commitment and it is incredibly important for the international community to help in matters relating to human rights quickly, efficiently and in a targeted way."
"The Human Rights Council is on the right track here."
"We have seen that the mission to Tunisia made sense and the mission to Egypt made sense."
"Libya's loss of its seat on the Human Rights Council was a proper and important signal that things could not go on in this way."
"However, it is also the case that missions, resolutions and perhaps other things that happen in this way, have been knocked flat."
"You are quite right, Baroness Ashton: it is not enough to decide to do something, we must also take care that it is implemented."
"The European Union could still make a greater contribution here than it does at the moment."
"However, it is also essential that the United Nations accept that after the Treaty of Lisbon, the position of the European Union has altered."
"Baroness Ashton, I should like to ask you to ensure that especially those who have always called themselves our friends and whom we also call our friends, and for whom we show great consideration (particularly when it comes to trade policy), to remember in future that they are our friends and not to leave the European Union in the lurch, as they did in the vote in September."
"(FR) Mr President, in this debate, we are going to emphasise once again the importance of putting ..."
"(The President interrupted the speaker)"
"social, cultural, civil and political rights on an equal footing."
"Very well."
"Unfortunately, to fully meet that requirement - a legitimate one, certainly - is not quite so easy in practice."
"Why are we unable to make second-generation human rights as binding as first-generation ones?"
"Because traditional human rights - those stemming from the French Revolution - are codified properly today, which is unfortunately not the case for social rights, for example."
"We should not be fatalists, however."
"The European Union, with its battery of instruments, can bring all its weight to bear, particularly at the United Nations, in order to enhance texts relating to rights that are not yet codified properly and, in particular, social rights."
"I would add that, with development cooperation and humanitarian aid, this requirement becomes a little less unrealistic."
"(PL) Mr President, Mrs Ashton, I confess that I was not a great supporter of your taking up the eminent position which you hold today, Mrs Ashton, but I must say that I am, today, pleasantly surprised by at least three things which you mentioned in your speech."
"I would like to stress this and to commend you for this."
"Well, firstly you stressed the universality of human rights."
"I fully agree that irrespective of where we are - in Strasbourg, Libya, Russia or Iran - this universality must be fully respected."
"I am very pleased that we are on the same wavelength."
"The second thing is that you stressed religious intolerance, or rather the fight against it."
"Indeed, the European Parliament's resolution calls on the representatives of Member States to take up this matter."
"I am very pleased that you stressed this."
"The third matter which I am pleased about as a member of the delegation for relations with Belarus is that you stressed the possibility of intervention in matters relating to Belarus, where fundamental human rights are being violated."
"There is a chance that a Regional Council will be established."
"I am very pleased that you support this, because this is something we should be doing. Thank you very much."
"Mr President, I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate and can I say at the outset that I appreciate the briefing arranged by the High Representative yesterday on the issues surrounding Libya."
"Six million Jews were murdered in the Second World War here in Europe."
"Between the two World Wars - the First World War and the Second World War - 60 million Europeans were killed, leaving aside the people from all other parts of the world who died."
"According to a recent edition of The Economist magazine, there is a deficit of 100 million women because of gender-based abortion."
"This is not to do with abortion because a woman's life is in danger, or because she is in danger of having a back-street abortion."
"It is because she is a woman."
"Yesterday was Women's Day."
"This was not raised here."
"When is political correctness going to be overcome, so that we can have respectful debates here, so that we do not turn our heads the other way, as happened in the first half of the last century, so that we raise these issues, so that we ask why this is?"
"This House disgraced itself."
"It voted down an amendment not to fund infanticide."
"Not to fund coercive abortion."
"How in the name of God could we vote down something like that?"
"I am sick of this political correctness that does not allow debate on issues in this House in a respectful manner that allows different views to be expressed."
"I want to know from the High Representative if you are you going to raise this issue with the UN?"
"May I say in conclusion that I find the attitude and some of the decisions of the Court of Human Rights here in Strasbourg, which is not an institution of the European Union, absolutely extraordinary."
"When are we going to be able to discuss this issue?"
"Why were there no women yesterday who asked about the missing 100 million women who have been terminated because they were women?"
"It is wrong and there should be no disagreement in this House on that issue in particular."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on Women's Day, you perhaps failed to notice that in the report by your group member, Mrs Nedelcheva, abortion was not a taboo subject, it was addressed, and it was debated and voted on democratically."
"It is not a taboo subject; this is a democracy."
"Mr President, I know Ms De Keyser's position on this and I respect it."
"It is more than I received from her in relation to my view."
"We have to have respectful debate in this House, where people hear each other's views and then we come to conclusions."
"I have not heard anybody from the Socialist or Liberal side raise in this House the issue of gender-based abortion."
"Not only did they not raise it, they voted down a resolution put to this House not to fund infanticide or coercive abortion."
"It is a shameful occurrence, on the record of this House, for those people who did it."
"Please let us have respectful debate in this House."
"That is what this European Union is supposed to be about - unity in diversity."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"Mr President, of course I respect Mr Mitchell's views."
"Like most, if not all, of the Members of this Parliament, I deplore the fact that in a number of societies in the world, female foetuses are aborted, whether with the consent of the mother or under coercion."
"However, I fear that, by mixing up this issue with the issue of reproductive freedom, Mr Mitchell is obscuring the issue."
"If the issue were limited to the fact that female foetuses are aborted, it might be easier for us to reach an agreement on it."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the honourable Member for that point."
"If we were a bit more respectful of each other's positions and tried to reach common ground, we would find that there is a lot we can do to roll back on this agenda, but please can we all open our minds?"
"I really do find it hard that Parliament would vote down an amendment not to fund coercive abortion, not to fund infanticide."
"Let us have this sort of discussion and see what we can do to stop this gender-based abortion."
"We can have disagreements in other areas."
"I personally have no difficulty with reproductive health support; it is when it comes to the abortion area I have difficulty for very good reasons and I would be happy to debate them."
"I am not an ogre;"
"I am not something from the past."
"I have a well thought out view on this and I would be happy to discuss it with anybody."
"I thank the Members for what they have said."
"(EL) Mr President, Baroness Ashton, the session of the Human Rights Council is being held this year in the shadow of events in North Africa and the Arab world in general, which have a great deal to teach us."
"We, as Europe, must make sure that we are up to the job."
"This is therefore an opportunity for us to make a fundamental evaluation of the Council, so as to further improve its working methods and emphasise our support for its independence and its role in defending human rights in the world."
"In these times of historic change in our part of the world, the message of the universality of human rights is more topical than ever."
"At the same time, however, all the international players need to work to eliminate the practice of double standards when it comes to citing human rights."
"We need to be fair and consistent."
"Just as we welcome the recent adoption of the resolution condemning human rights violations in Libya, we must take the same hard stand on the continuing illegal colonisation of the occupied areas in Palestine."
"(FI) Mr President, I would like to pay tribute to Mr Mitchell's speech, as of course, the primary human right for each girl and boy is the right to be born into this world."
"The Human Rights Council is the UN's main body responsible for human rights, and now at last we must venture critically to assess its status and policies."
"The Council at its best could have a decisive role as a promoter of human rights and democracy."
"Unfortunately, its work is characterised by double standards, selectivity, politicisation and the creation of blocs in human rights issues."
"It is typical that the Council was very close to adopting the resolution on progress (progress mind!) in the human rights situation in Libya."
"Among the countries giving Libya recognition were Iran, North Korea, Egypt, Sudan and Pakistan."
"Do declarations by these countries carry any weight?"
"Should these countries not be the next to be expelled from the Human Rights Council?"
"Just the fact that such a resolution was even considered shows just how ignorant the international community has been or has wanted to be concerning the situation in Libya."
"Over the last few decades, however, around two thirds of the condemnatory resolutions that the Human Rights Council has adopted have concerned Israel, which is nevertheless the sole democracy in that area of the Middle East."
"At the same time, it has ignored the poor state of the rights of women and minorities in all the surrounding Arab countries."
"The work of the Human Rights Council will lack credibility unless it changes that work and its ways of working."
"(ES) Mr President, I do not wish to repeat the important points already made by my fellow Members, so I will simply add that it is good to hear of Lady Ashton's involvement in the Human Rights Council session held at this very important time."
"We hope that the session will constitute a step forward, allowing the European Union to make its actions more consistent and raise their profile, to reach common positions on all relevant human rights issues, and to use the Human Rights Council to build coalitions with countries, civil society and relevant international organisations, in order to make real progress in the field of human rights, as Lady Ashton said in her speech."
"We also hope that the European Union will be able to uphold the universal nature of human rights in the face of relativistic arguments and that it will finally achieve something that is within the compass of our generation; to achieve something comparable with the universal abolition of slavery in the past: namely, the universal abolition of the death penalty."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that the inviolability of human rights is the real essence of all societies, which indeed gives rise to democratic values."
"For this reason, the Human Rights Council meeting that will take place in Geneva must have precise and appropriate priorities: of course, this includes combating discrimination in its various forms - race, sex, religion, political orientation - whilst, on the other hand, there is also the issue of protecting minorities and vulnerable groups."
"The climate in which the Council meeting is taking place is particularly delicate."
"We are all aware of what is happening in North Africa and, above all, in Libya."
"Today, in a lengthy debate, we have listened to and largely welcomed the speeches made by Baroness Ashton."
"However, there is also the problem of the Middle East and, at the same time, the Treaty of Lisbon urges us to adopt an even stronger and more decisive stance in favour of the European Union."
"We need strength of resolve and solidarity, which must be the guidelines for tangible and decisive action, because, after all, the Libyans, the Tunisians and the Moroccans wish to stay where they are currently living."
"To make this possible, we will need to act quickly."
"I should like to make one final consideration, which is also a question for Baroness Ashton: we have listened to your speeches, as I just said, and largely welcomed them."
"One form of serious discrimination relates to religion: how on earth, bearing in mind that the bloodiest violence of recent times has been perpetrated against Christians, did you fail to mention 'Christianophobia' in her speech?"
"(RO) Mr President, I do not know whether this session, which is currently going on, will end in success or failure."
"However, what I do know is that it would have been worthwhile holding this debate much earlier because the European Union will have a voice at this session, which is coherent, articulate and, above all, effective."
"This review, which is getting under way now, partly in New York and partly in Geneva, sends out a very complex signal to a world which is changing and has a major problem with the failure of a certain type of human rights policy."
"Fellow Members, I believe that we will have to discuss very seriously this institutional mechanism created by the UN, certainly without giving any priority to particular rights."
"However, we must discuss its effectiveness and, in particular, think about whether it would not be worth having one of the global agencies involved in immediate prevention."
"In this context, I do not think that we need to restrict ourselves simply to watching what has happened so far, but should also try to prevent it."
"I believe that a different way of handling the human rights issue is on the cards."
"Mr President, the fact that Libya was a member of the UN Human Rights Council tells us everything we need to know about this discredited and politicised organisation."
"Gaddafi's 42-year rule has systematically crushed any vestige of human rights in his country and we have now seen the consequences of the culture of violence on which his reign-of-terror regime was based."
"However, it would be unfair to single out just Libya."
"Other human rights abusers also enjoy membership of the Council, including China, Cuba, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Uganda, where homosexuals are persecuted."
"Bizarrely, it was even mooted that Iran should head up the Women's Equality Commission at one stage."
"The UNHRC also spends much of its time vilifying our democratic ally, Israel."
"However, I suppose, on reflection, that this Council is all that there is on human rights at UN level, so we will have to engage, albeit fully cognisant of the inherent contradictions of having brutal non-democratic regimes as members of the UN Human Rights Council."
"Mr President, I would like to say to Baroness Ashton that she did not answer my colleague, Jan Zahradil, in the last debate on Iran on the question of Camp Ashraf."
"The 3 400 people there are suffering psychological torture."
"This is a breach of their human rights."
"We give EUR 1.2 billion to the rebuilding of Iraq and yet, every time we pass a resolution in this House, every time we pass a written declaration with a big majority, we are simply ignored by the Iraqi Government and by their Iranian cohorts."
"They are psychologically torturing the people in Camp Ashraf with 210 loudspeakers blaring propaganda and threats at a high decibel level day and night for the last year."
"They are prohibiting access to medicines and the hospital for injured people and people dying of cancer."
"Why are we not saying, 'Stop, or you get no more help, no more money, from this House'?"
"Mr President, I would like to ask the High Representative, in the light of all of the events that are going on in Libya at the moment and the much vaunted anguish that we rightly display about the violation of human rights in Libya, whether she will support the cause of those people in the United Kingdom who had relatives, friends and loved ones blown up by Semtex or killed by guns that were supplied by Colonel Gaddafi and his murderous regime in Libya."
"Will she support their case in any new regime that would emerge from the conflict in Libya?"
"(ES) Mr President, in the context of our debate on the current human rights situation, and in view of the last report discussed, I would like to address the following question to Lady Ashton."
"In view of the current situation in some North African countries and within the region, do you feel that this is the right time to be opening a European Union delegation in Iran?"
"Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. - Mr President, again, this was a very interesting and full debate, which has raised a large number of issues that honourable Members feel very strongly about."
"Firstly, I would like to thank all honourable Members for the energy and passion with which they have conducted this debate."
"I reflect on the fact that it is two years since the publication of Ms Andrikienė's report on the development of the UN Human Rights Council, including the role of the EU, and on the resolutions that have been passed since that report was produced."
"I would like to thank her for her comments about the work we are doing in the External Action Service and the beginnings of our work to build the new pieces of work on human rights."
"I am also very pleased to see that Ms Hautala will be going to the session of the Council."
"I think it is extremely important, with her knowledge and expertise, that she is able to participate there."
"I also hope that she will back up the efforts that we have been making to try to ensure that the work of the Council improves and increases."
"I hear the criticisms that are made of it."
"I think we have all been pushing hard with the review to try to make that review as strong as possible."
"It is certainly not quite where we would have wished it to be, but now that we have seen the transfer to New York of some of the discussions, we can continue to work there as well."
"This really is an area of work where parliamentarians working with us can make a significant difference."
"I have full confidence in Ms Hautala's strength in pushing forward on that."
"I want to deal with some of the particular questions that have been asked of me."
"I will start with Mr Howitt's, because he said that there were three in particular."
"Regarding the Democratic Republic of the Congo, we are in favour of a strong resolution and indeed, we have said there ought to be a specific mandate now on this particular situation."
"On Goldstone, we are trying to engage to find a consensual resolution."
"That is what we are doing at the present time."
"In Pakistan, we made a démarche on 5 March specifically on Article 40, which is the point concerned."
"To those honourable Members who specifically talked about freedom of religion and belief, let me first of all say that I do indeed talk about the terrible tragedies for Christian communities anywhere in the world where these terrible tragedies occur."
"My general point is that we believe in the right of freedom of religion and belief, whatever that religion or belief might be in that context."
"It is important that we continue to make those statements as clearly as possible, when you see terrorism or attacks on any religions, including Christianity."
"My team has just been meeting with a group of MEPs to talk further about what more we should do on this."
"I have already said that we plan to do something at this session of the Human Rights Council specifically on this because it is so important."
"I apologise that I did not answer on Camp Ashraf."
"I intended to, but I turned the paper over too quickly."
"I think we have a total of 3 000 people - or perhaps 3 400, the numbers vary - and we are in weekly touch with the UN who, as you know, are visiting the camp."
"They assure me that the basic needs are being met."
"There are really difficult issues, as the honourable Member knows very well, in looking at what might be done around Camp Ashraf."
"I am very conscious of the very different opinions that we hear on this."
"However, the honourable gentleman is completely right that the significant part of this is to make sure that people's rights are not violated and that we ensure humanitarian support is given."
"We do indeed - hence I know about the weekly reports."
"That is not by accident."
"It is because we are engaging on this issue and engaging with the government there to try to deal with that in the best possible way that we can."
"I also agree that it is now important to get a strong delegation in Geneva."
"Again, Mrs Hautala raises specifically the fact that we have just appointed a new Head of Delegation."
"I talked with the team while I was in Geneva."
"We have split the delegation in two so that one can concentrate on the issues, particularly of the World Trade Organisation, and the other can focus much more on the UN agencies."
"In my conversations on this, I am also clear on the need to think better and more creatively about how we operate in Geneva."
"We need to build alliances on human rights and to have the opportunity to talk with partners across the world where we can make common cause on some of the most important issues that concern us."
"I hope that we will be able to move forward on that over the coming weeks and months."
"If I might just finish with this, I was very taken by what Mr Salavrakos said when he said that human rights is a way of life."
"I think that is probably right."
"I describe it as being this simple: for human rights to apply to you, you simply have to be here and human."
"There are no other criteria that should apply."
"I think that in all that we do, it is really important that we do not forget that very simple basic principle."
"Honourable Members, there will be many issues upon which we disagree, many issues which create - as I witnessed - real passion and concern, but the ability to be able to debate those issues and the ability to put our strength of feeling on human rights at the core of what we think is absolutely essential."
"Very finally, I have not made any decision about opening a delegation in Iran."
"That is partly a resources question but, of course, I will keep honourable Members informed about that."
"Meanwhile, I would like to thank everyone for this debate and to assure honourable Members that I will do all I can to make the Human Rights Council as effective as possible and - more important even than that - to represent the European Parliament and the European Union on issues of human rights as effectively as I possibly can."
"(ES) Mr President, I did not really understand Lady Ashton's answer."
"I am not sure whether she gave me an answer, whether she said that she would respond at a later date to my question on whether it is the right time to be opening a European Union delegation in Iran given the current human rights concerns, or indeed whether there was no answer."
"As I did not understand the answer, I would like to repeat my question."
"Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. - Mr President, in response to Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra, I was trying to say that there are two issues."
"One is resources, inevitably."
"The second is that this will require a decision to be made and for proposals to be put by me, obviously not least to the Commission, on the opening of a delegation."
"There will be a discussion in the Foreign Affairs Council and Parliament will also take a view on this."
"I have had no discussions with anybody about doing this at the moment."
"As you well know, at the present time, my engagement with Iran is very much on the nuclear talks and the human rights issues."
"I have received six motions for resolutions tabled in accordance with Rule 110(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at midday on Thursday, 10 March."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"in writing. - In light of the current situation in North Africa, and taking into account the fact that human rights are being violated more than ever across the world, the work of the UNHRC needs to be reformed."
"The UNHRC has to act in time and to react efficiently to the new challenges."
"Regrettably, this is not the reality."
"The problem could be partly solved if additional meetings beyond the current sessions would take place."
"Further, the UNHRC needs to seriously review its membership to make sure that its members fulfil the minimum criteria."
"It is shameful that dictatorships, such as Libya, could so easily take a seat in the body intended to safeguard human rights."
"More than ever, the credibility of the UNHRC is being challenged by politically motivated behaviour."
"Using the EEA, the EU now has an opportunity to speak with one voice and to function as a global actor."
"The Vice-President/High Representative has to make sure that the actions are coherent and that an efficient coordination takes place between the EU Representations in Geneva and New York."
"There is no practical alternative to EU value-based foreign policy."
"in writing. - No convincing and efficient resolution can be adopted while human rights are being strongly violated within the European Union."
"All loud statements and words turn into cynicism and undermine the basis of the fight against global injustice and lies."
"The European Union should not give advice to third countries while in its own territory, namely in Latvia, the government treats Parliament's resolution of 11 March 2004 with scorn and derision."
"It is not acceptable to demand that other countries do what the European Union is not able to demand that the Latvian Republic should do."
"How can the EU be called 'united' when rules are not for every Member State?"
"Until the resolution on 335 000 Latvian non-citizens is implemented, there is no sense in asking for changes in the area of human rights in third countries."
"It is a rough derision of democracy and human rights."
"It is to be welcomed that in the programme of the 16th Session of the UNHRC, alongside the general problem of respect for human rights, reports and panels have been included concerning the rights of the child, violence against women, the rights of national, ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities and the fight against terrorism."
"Also to be presented at the session is a cross-regional statement on LGBT rights."
"The UNHRC needs new legal tools for the continuous monitoring of constant violations of human rights and for reacting rapidly to urgent situations which arise due to the political situation around the world (Tunisia, Egypt, Iran, Belarus)."
"Therefore, I endorse the idea proposed in the resolution for independent 'triggers' which will allow a prompt response to human rights crises."
"I welcome the establishment of the new Directorate for Human Rights and Democracy and the creation of a Brussels-based EU Council Working Group on Human Rights, because this will allow better coordination and monitoring of EU policy on human rights."
"A major role should be played by the high-level EU Special Representative for Human Rights."
"UNHRC panels should also be held in-between sessions, and the sessions themselves should be moved to other regions, including to places where conflicts are currently in progress."
"Finally, I also appeal to the EU's Member States to respect human rights in their own domestic policy, because failure to do so weakens the Union's position in the UNHRC."
"State of play of the peace process for the Middle East (debate)"
"The next item is the statement by the Vice-President of the Commission, the Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, on the state of play of the peace process for the Middle East."
"Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. - Mr President, I am grateful for the opportunity to have today's debate on the Middle East peace process and I am extremely interested to hear from honourable Members on this."
"I believe that achieving progress on the peace process is very urgent and very important."
"As we have discussed in this House earlier today, our Southern Neighbourhood and the wider Middle East are changing fast."
"We have seen historic events in Tunisia and Egypt and ongoing violence in Libya, and we also know of protests which continue in Yemen, Bahrain and elsewhere."
"With the region in upheaval, some have said that it is not the time to focus on the stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace process, but I believe the opposite to be true."
"At this moment, it is even more important to try to put an end to this conflict, as a key contribution towards a peaceful and stable region."
"This is the message which I have delivered in my visits to the region in January and in February and in my discussions with President Abbas and Prime Minister Netanyahu: for the greater security of both peoples, an agreement should be found."
"I also believe the European Union has an important role in this process."
"The Foreign Affairs Council set out its position very clearly, most recently in our Council conclusions in December."
"The only viable choice is a negotiated outcome on all final status issues."
"If there is to be genuine peace, there has to be a solution to the status of Jerusalem as the future capital of two states, with the state of Israel and an independent, democratic, contiguous and viable state of Palestine living side by side in peace and security."
"The EU position on settlements is clear: settlements are illegal, they constitute an obstacle to peace, and they threaten to make a two-state solution impossible."
"I chaired the Quartet meeting in Munich on 5 February."
"The EU went into this meeting seeking an invigorated Quartet and I think we managed to achieve that."
"Together with our partners from the UN, from the US and Russia, we agreed on an ambitious schedule."
"Last week, Quartet envoys met in Brussels, under the chairmanship of Helga Schmid, the Political Director and Deputy Secretary-General of the EAS, with, for the first time, the Palestinian negotiators."
"Tomorrow, the Quartet envoys will meet the Israeli negotiators for the first time."
"The envoys are now moving to prepare the next principal meetings when Ban Ki-moon, the Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov, Secretary Clinton and I will meet again."
"But, if there is to be a two-state solution, both states must be viable."
"For that reason, it is important that the EU is the largest contributor to the Palestinians."
"We remain committed to continuing to support their state-building plan and its implementation, both politically and financially."
"In this regard, we have already approved a first package of EUR 100 million out of the EUR 300 million earmarked for 2011."
"Funds for institution-building have been further increased to reinforce Palestinian capacities on their way to statehood."
"This work is crucial for the establishment of a future state of Palestine and crucial to finding a way to a two-state solution."
"As honourable Members know, I have twice visited Gaza and, after meeting with business, with civil society and especially with many children, we have proposed a comprehensive package of support, focusing on infrastructure, equipment and training for the Kerem Shalom crossing."
"This is specifically to support greater movement of goods, allowing exports to promote economic recovery."
"In both my visits to Gaza, I called for a greater opportunity for the people there to develop the economy and provide jobs and a future for their children."
"I also called, and continue to call, for the release of Gilad Shalit."
"On 13 April, I will host the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee led by Norway; we are in discussion on the possibilities of a donor conference in June."
"Honourable Members will know that on 22 February, there was a useful and productive exchange of views with Israel at the Association Council, where the Middle East peace process was discussed, along with other regional issues, particularly, of course, the changes occurring in the region."
"The discussions included our bilateral relations and how better cooperation can go forward on the current action plan and in the context of the desire for a solution."
"I also welcome the willingness of the Israelis to meet with the Quartet envoys tomorrow, but I urge Israel to make positive moves now to find a solution and to promote and support moves towards direct talks."
"As I said, I believe that this is in the interest of both peoples in that region and I believe Prime Minister Netanyahu has a vital role in helping to get the talks moving."
"Honourable Members, I very much look forward to hearing from you so I will pause at this point."
"I believe all of us in this House share the desire to see this conflict finally end and both parties find a solution for the stability of the people of Israel and for the people of Palestine, which will also help enhance the stability and security of the region."
"I urge and hope that this will happen soon."
"Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, you quite rightly said, Baroness Ashton, that the situation in the southern Mediterranean is diverting attention from the conflict in the Middle East and the peace process, which has already been drawn out over almost 30 years and appears to have come to a standstill."
"As your visit has demonstrated, current events and the general situation in the region have had an impact on the process."
"In the light of that visit, I would like to ask your views on a number of issues."
"This morning, we discussed the difficulties that the United Nations Security Council is having in obtaining a further resolution to impose a no-fly zone in Libya."
"To what extent do you feel that the peace process and the credibility of a key player have been affected by its recent veto of the proposed resolution condemning the settlements in the Palestinian territories?"
"In your opinion, how does the lack of a Security Council decision affect perceptions of the Obama administration's commitment to pursuing this process?"
"Secondly, how do you view the decision taken by the Palestinian National Authority to hold presidential and legislative elections before September and Hamas's decision not to take part in these elections?"
"Lastly, Baroness Ashton, I would like to hear what you think of the resignation of the Palestinian chief negotiator following the publication of documents by WikiLeaks, the reshuffle within the Palestinian National Authority and the repercussions that the leaked documents have had on the Palestine side, on the Israeli Government, or on both parties as a whole."
"Mr President, Baroness Ashton, we have spoken about it all day long: the tremendous hope that has emerged following the revolutions in the Arab world shows us that democracy is something that we all aspire to, and that there is nothing exclusive about it."
"The right to live freely is something that must be universally recognised."
"This also applies to the Palestinians, when, at this very moment in time, in Gaza in particular, young Palestinians - and there are an awful lot of them - have no prospects, no future, no opportunity to educate themselves, to move around and sometimes even to access healthcare or to eat."
"This is clearly unacceptable."
"We share these sentiments;"
"I think they are shared by pretty much everyone."
"However, I then ask myself, and I fail to understand - let me make that clear - what the European Union is trying to achieve in its association agreement."
"You spoke about this."
"I have read and reread the minutes of the association agreement."
"Even though the European Union has denounced the violation of international law in many respects, as you pointed out earlier, we have provided a series of positive incentives - you call them positive incentives - in the areas of agriculture, fisheries, the environment, policing, judicial cooperation, transport, space cooperation, enhanced scientific cooperation, and in an ACCA agreement, with no guarantees and nothing in exchange."
"You had invited the Israelis to your Quartet meeting, but they did not come."
"Thus, I do not want to criticise you, Baroness Ashton."
"I am aware of your efforts; you are putting a lot into this issue."
"I do not even want to tell you that these positive incentives do not work."
"What I want is to ask you whether we still have the right today to dispense with any forms of pressure other than sanctions."
"Do we have the right to provide economic and trade incentives when so many human rights and so many aspects of international law are constantly being violated?"
"I do not think so, and what is more, I believe that this is a political mistake in the light of the revolutions taking place today in the Arab world."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, Madam High Representative, on behalf of my group, I would like to start by saying that we could not agree more with your introduction, with the aims you have put forward, and with the efforts you are making to re-instil life into what you yourself called the 'stalled' peace process."
"I believe that it has stalled and it should be restarted so that we can see some progress."
"Last week, Parliament had the honour of being addressed by the Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister who came to make his case to us."
"He urged us, on the one hand, not to constantly focus on what is happening in the Occupied Palestinian Territories and, on the other, rather to re-orient our focus on what we could do together, Israel and the European Union."
"It would be easier for us to do that if we had some serious indications that Israel is really willing to breathe new life into the peace process."
"I cannot help but feel that Israel believes that upheaval in a number of Arab countries gives it more breathing space."
"Like Ms De Keyser, I am afraid that this could turn out to be a major political mistake."
"On the contrary, Israel should make use of what is happening today to speed up the process and try to conclude a peace agreement as soon as possible."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Baroness Ashton for her speech, in which I am a little disappointed."
"I quite agree with Baroness Ashton that now is the time - with this historic situation - for the Palestine-Israel issue to come to the fore."
"Yet, why was not a single word said about the recognition of Palestine this coming September?"
"We all know very well that time is now running out."
"We all know very well that this issue, in particular, urgently needs to be resolved and that we desperately need to hear from the EU's principal representative in particular that this is what we are working for."
"Many of us were proud and stood tall when we were recently granted a joint EU seat on the Security Council."
"That was excellent and I would like to express my thanks for that."
"It also had a beneficial effect."
"A great number of fine statements are made at a high level - a great deal goes on up in the ethereal regions."
"The terrible thing is that when we come down to earth from these lofty heights - to reality - we experience considerable problems."
"As Mrs De Keyser also mentioned, we saw the EU accept the further upgrading of relations with Israel."
"It was referred to as a mere technicality to avoid conflicts with Parliament, but what is much worse is the fact that the Israeli settlements are expanding as never before."
"The siege of Gaza is certainly not over, and unfortunately, Baroness Ashton only mentioned Kerem Shalom instead of talking about openness towards all parties."
"This is, in fact, a very serious matter."
"Why is it that all we hear about is money?"
"We have paid and paid, and that is important."
"We have given money to Salam Fayyad, but if we do not give him the chance to build his state, it will all have been in vain."
"Allow me to finish by saying that the EU's credibility in this historic situation is now truly on the line."
"If we do not actually understand that we need to back-up all of our fine words with action, where will our credibility go in relation to the rest of the North African and Arab countries?"
"Every single time it seems, when it comes to the crunch, at best we give money, but otherwise we do not go on to take any political action."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, Baroness Ashton, I am deeply concerned about the progress of the situation in Iraq."
"The recent uprising there - when the people took to the streets, particularly young people who cannot get jobs, who see the broken economy, the continuing lack of security and sectarian killings - was brutally repressed."
"Twenty nine people were killed, many hundreds were injured."
"There is now an indication that Ayad Allawi, whose al-Iraqiya Party won the election last March, is going to withdraw from the coalition because Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki has defaulted on the many promises that he made to al-Iraqiya in the coalition deal."
"If that happens, we are going to be back to square one, with a sectarian government, backed by both al-Hakim and Muqtada al-Sadr at the behest of Tehran, and we will have a destabilised situation where the party who won the election is no longer in government."
"That cannot be acceptable surely, in terms of the future of the Middle East."
"Mr President, I should like to take this opportunity, following what has been said today, to comment on the EU's stand on the events taking place around us in the Arab world."
"This stand confuses stagnation with stability; it is a reprehensible stand, because it has failed to heed the demands of the people in the area for freedom and social justice."
"However, the European Union can behave differently; it can behave correctly."
"It proved as much in the case of Palestine, at least as regards so-called 'state building'."
"Even if, in the Arab conflict, the European Union has again failed to send out a strong political message, it has, nonetheless, supported the government of President Abbas and Prime Minister Fayyad over the last two or three years and, as such, they have been able to construct the necessary institutions so that, by next September, Prime Minister Fayyad will be in a position to ask the UN to recognise the independent state of Palestine and I hope that, when it does, the European Union will support that request."
"The European Union could play a similar role in the countries in the area."
"I hope and pray that it does and I call on the European Union to negotiate and to enter into agreement with each of the countries whose people are calling for change and, together with the representatives of those people, to define the sectors in which the European Union could help financially and otherwise, by exchanging expertise and setting out joint programmes for the social and economic development of the area."
"In this way, the European Union will also address the objectives which it has laid down in its neighbourhood policy."
"Mr President, High Representative, I would like to back you up on two points in your introduction."
"You spoke about direct negotiations."
"Last week, I had the privilege of holding extensive discussions with the representatives of the Israeli Government and of the Israeli Parliament, the Knesset."
"You have to trust and believe your discussion partners, and they say that they want direct negotiations with the Palestinian Authority."
"I would thus like to ask you to use all your diplomatic inventiveness to bring these direct negotiations about as, ultimately, you do need both parties to the conflict around the table if you are to conclude a peace."
"Given the background of the events in which Arab masses are calling for responsible governments, we can conclude that the momentum to bring about a breakthrough is now present."
"My second point is that I was very pleased that you made reference to the sad fate of Gilad Shalit, who has now been incarcerated for nearly five years."
"Exactly one week ago, I spoke with his father in the heart of Jerusalem, and he was wondering whether Europe still cared for his son."
"You gave me the answer."
"I hope that you persistently continue to strive to re-unite father and son as soon as possible."
"(DE) Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, the Arab world is in the grip of profound change."
"People are fighting for their dignity; they wish to live in liberty, in a democracy and under the rule of law, as we do."
"It is our political and moral duty to give our full and committed support to people in the Arab world involved in this cause."
"I was in Cairo last weekend and met many young people there in Tahrir Square."
"The openness, confidence, courage and optimism of the young people in Cairo left a deep impression on me."
"Egypt and other Arab countries now have the opportunity of democratic development."
"This is also an opportunity for Israel, for it not to remain the only democracy in the Middle East besides Lebanon."
"The change taking place in Arabia must be seized as an opportunity for peace between Israel and Palestine."
"We must refrain from everything that is a hindrance to this peace."
"This means that settlement building by Israel is a provocation to the Palestinians and the Hamas rockets are a provocation to the Israelis."
"There must be an end to both."
"Peace between Israel and Palestine is possible - two states living together peacefully within secure borders as good neighbours."
"Now is not the time for pusillanimity and tentative dealings."
"Now is the time for courage, decisiveness and statesmanlike behaviour; now is the time for peace in the Middle East; now is the time for democracy in the Arab countries."
"(DE) Mr President, let us be honest, the state of no war, because we cannot talk of peace in the Middle East, has at least allowed the dictators and authoritarian regimes to keep their own people under control and conclude a non-aggression pact with Israel, and has allowed Israel to do so as well."
"As we have seen, such props and such pillars are very fragile and can suddenly collapse."
"Now they have collapsed."
"I am pleased that Israel has not intervened in internal Arab developments."
"However, non-intervention is not enough."
"As Mr Pöttering said, we must seize the opportunity; that is, Israel must seize the opportunity to conclude a lasting peace with democratic states; a peace that does not rest on the shoulders of a few dictators, but is genuinely based on the will of the people to make peace."
"Here, the development of settlements is not only a thorn in the flesh, as it always has been, but also an obstacle."
"What is more, when the deputy Foreign Minister, who has already been quoted here, says, in the talks we had in Brussels, that we are not taking any new areas away from the Palestinians in any case, that is hair-splitting and cynical to boot."
"Settlement development must be stopped."
"I am very sad that the Americans have used their veto here, since they have thereby proved that they have no genuine interest in the peace process."
"Now, briefly about the elections, about which questions have already been asked."
"I hope that we recognise the elections."
"We must recognise the elections and the outcome of the elections as a democratic step."
"That does not mean that we must recognise any policy that is implemented as a result of the elections."
"We must not, however, repeat the mistake of deciding who is the good winner and who is the bad winner of the elections."
"We must instead recognise the democratic development."
"Finally again, since we are all of one mind on this: I hope that you will strengthen your efforts to free Mr Shalit, so that this problem can finally be resolved."
"For just as settlement development is an obstacle to really meaningful dialogue, so is the imprisonment of Mr Shalit an obstacle, as much as ever."
"I hope that we can approach both problems in such a way that we can finally arrive at sensible, constructive peace talks in the Middle East."
"(DE) Mr President, the contrast is striking!"
"The revolution, the change taking place in the Arab world is fascinating for all of us."
"We are trying to help."
"We have discussed Libya today."
"In recent days and weeks, we have discussed Egypt and Tunisia."
"Yet, at the same time, we have a standstill in the peace process."
"Against this backdrop, we must say quite clearly here, Baroness Ashton, that you did us a service when you managed to convene a meeting of the Quartet."
"To produce movement now, at this period of profound insecurity in the region, and profound insecurity in Israel, was an extremely positive service."
"I should like to make this very clear."
"You occasionally have to endure criticism from this House, too."
"For this reason, some praise is perhaps also in order."
"As far as the contents are concerned, I should like to make it clear that I do not believe that Israel is sceptically disposed towards democracy in Arab countries."
"It is merely that these changes have not yet come to an end."
"When and if there are democracies there, I agree completely with Mr Pöttering and with you too, Mr Swoboda, then there will clearly be a great opportunity finally to get the Middle East peace process going too."
"Settlement building must stop, that is clear in any case, as must the sophistry with which it is defended. There is a consensus among all groups in this House on that point."
"Connected to the uprising in the Arab world, we also have experienced protests against the Hamas regime in the Gaza Strip."
"The situation in the Palestinian Territories is in no way simple."
"Democratisation must succeed here too."
"For the time being, we fortunately have a moderate and conservative partner in the West Bank, but that is absolutely not the case in the Gaza Strip."
"(FR) Mr President, Baroness Ashton, I have observed a strange tendency within the European Union: despite statements criticising Israel's human rights violations, the Member States and the Commission are working tirelessly to strengthen political and economic relations with Israel, with no conditions attached."
"On 22 February, the Union actually upgraded its association agreement with Israel, promising to step up cooperation in several apparently technical agreements in various areas: competition, access to public contracts, Israel's integration into the European Research Area and into European agencies such as Europol, the European Space Agency and so on."
"On 31 January, the Commission authorised the transfer of EU citizens' personal data to Israel, a country suspected of having used EU citizens' passports to carry out an extrajudicial killing in Dubai last year."
"Israel, which already participates in more than 800 projects with European universities and businesses, will receive more than EUR 500 million in subsidies in 2013."
"Among the beneficiaries will be the arms manufacturers Elbit and Israel Aerospace Industries, which manufacture the drones and aircraft used against the people of Gaza."
"At the Association Council, the European Union welcomed the new measures announced by Mr Netanyahu for Gaza and the West Bank."
"Baroness Ashton, please could you indicate what this facilitation measure consists of when hundreds of lorry drivers are protesting in Gaza as we speak to denounce the closure of the Karni crossing?"
"Also, how does Mr Netanyahu propose to stop the rapid colonisation of Jerusalem and the West Bank?"
"I would be grateful, Baroness Ashton, if you could send a message of encouragement and a true message of hope to all those women who took to the streets in Palestine yesterday and who are expecting a great deal of the European Union."
"(FR) Mr President, Baroness Ashton, the revolutions in the Arab world are consistent with the aspirations of the Palestinian people."
"There is one difference, however: the Palestinians are fighting not against their leader but against an external power that is dominating them, humiliating them, plundering them, colonising them, imprisoning them, stealing their land and their homes, building walls and imposing a blockade on Gaza, while leaving one million of their people in refugee camps, in defiance of international law."
"Baroness Ashton, I have heard your explanations, but the European Union has to be firmer and more active."
"The Arab peoples are watching us."
"Wholesale changes are taking place in the Middle East."
"Wholesale changes are also required within the Israeli leadership, which must respect the universal values laid down by law."
"Use all the resources at your disposal, which include calling the association agreements into question."
"I agree with what you said about Gilad Shalit, but I have already asked you how you plan to secure the release of a young Franco-Palestinian, Salah Hamouri, who is rotting in an Israeli prison for no reason."
"Lastly, Baroness Ashton, carry out a strong political act, a political act of the utmost importance: ensure that the European Union officially recognises, without delay, the Palestinian State within the 1967 borders and with East Jerusalem as the capital."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is the principal financial backer of the Palestinian Authority, providing it with around EUR 1 billion per year, and yet Europe's political role in the peace process remains marginal."
"This large-scale financial assistance gives us the right to ask the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to return to the negotiating table."
"On the issue of the recognition of Palestine, we must be clear."
"The problem of peaceful coexistence with Israel will not be resolved through unilateral recognition of the Palestinian State, which, moreover, still has not been self-proclaimed."
"The PNA must instead go back to taking an active role, sit down at the negotiating table and resolve the ongoing disputes, particularly over safe borders, on the status of Jerusalem and on the issue of refugees."
"Even a partial agreement would strengthen the moderate sections of both sides and reduce the influence of extremism."
"Mr President, the wind of change blowing through the Middle East promised democratisation, and no true democrat can deny that the people of Egypt, Tunisia and now Libya deserve both freedom and democracy."
"I can also fully agree with the High Representative that these events, rather than being a distraction, demand a refocusing of our attention on the peace process."
"In recent visits to the area, I found an understandably nervous Israeli people."
"Past experiences have seen political vacuums filled by Hamas and Hezbollah."
"In this situation, we must consider how best we can help, both in the peace process and in the stability of the region."
"Recognition of Israel's need for security and the validity of agreements with neighbouring countries are important cornerstones."
"We must also admit that the neighbourhood policy has failed."
"We currently spend EUR 1.5 billion per year on this policy."
"We must assess the tangible benefits of this."
"If we consider Egypt, where tens of thousands of people are added to the labour market each year with no economic future and no hope, perhaps we should realistically acknowledge that the seeds of further revolution are already there."
"(ES) Mr President, as indicated in the Middle East Quartet Statement made in Munich, we would all like to see the end of negotiations between Israel and Palestine in September 2011 in the form of an agreed solution for the two states that will bring peace and security."
"Unfortunately, the prospects are not rosy."
"With only six months left, negotiations have come to a standstill, stalled over the question of the settlements."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I do not think that the loss of valuable time will benefit Israel, nor will it contribute to finding a successful solution."
"On the one hand, I am concerned that it will become ever harder to find moderate leaders in Palestine with enough political support to be able to conclude agreements with Israel, which is no easy task."
"On the other hand, if the settlements remain, it will become ever harder to create a truly viable Palestine state."
"Lady Ashton, I agree that the peace process should not be put on hold because of political upheaval in the region."
"If the current events result in democratic regimes, as we all hope, regimes that will listen to the wishes of the people, the climate in the region will become even less propitious for Israel."
"It may be that Israel will become even more isolated and come under greater pressure from some of its Arab neighbours."
"In conclusion, everyone, including Israel, would benefit from reaching a solution as soon as possible."
"I would therefore urge the European Union to contribute actively to restarting the peace process in close cooperation with the United States and the other Quartet members."
"Lady Ashton, I hope that there will be a high-level Quartet meeting this month, as set out in the Munich Statement."
"Can you confirm whether that will be the case?"
"Mr President, the current situation in the region is both full of risk and full of hope."
"For me, the emergence of democratic movements among Israel's neighbours is a cause of celebration."
"We must reject the racist stereotype that regards them as a threat."
"I led a parliamentary delegation to Gaza and the West Bank in December 2010."
"The most heart-rending story was that of a little boy who brought his toys to school every day because he was not sure when he came home whether his home and his family would still be there."
"That child's parents want peace."
"Every member of the PLC that we met, both in the West Bank and in Gaza, wants secure Israeli and Palestinian borders based on the 1967 green line."
"They also want the settlements to stop."
"It is incomprehensible that Prime Minister Netanyahu has refused appeals from all of Israel's allies to stop the settlements."
"Simply to stop them."
"Not to dismantle them."
"To stop them."
"It is necessary, in order for serious negotiations to get under way, for those settlements to stop."
"I would appeal to Ms Ashton to ensure that that appeal goes again to the Israeli authorities: to please stop the settlements and get the talks going."
"We must support the efforts of President Abbas and Prime Minister Fayyad to peacefully lead the Palestinian people to a Palestinian state."
"We do not know what the consequences will be if we do not do that soon."
"Mr President, there cannot be a greater friend of Israel in the European Union than Germany, so it is quite something to read that Chancellor Merkel has been shouting at Prime Minister Netanyahu, saying 'you have done nothing to promote peace, give me something'."
"Quite something!"
"She is right, of course."
"Israel has played for time."
"It likes talks about talks because all that time gives it the opportunity to keep changing the facts on the ground and making a two-state solution that much harder to achieve."
"High Representative, you have the power to make a difference."
"Here is the statement of the European Union from last month on the association agreement: six pages of condemnation of human rights abuses and illegality and infringements by Israel - and yet a summary which says we seek closer cooperation with Israel."
"What is this about?"
"Is it surprising that Palestinians regard the European Union as having double standards?"
"You are putting your trust in pleasant dialogue."
"But Israel just thinks we are weak, weak, weak."
"And until you use your power, until you stand up and use a word to Israel which they are not used to hearing, nothing will change."
"That word is 'no'."
"Mr President, whilst good Libyan people are being bombed and terrorised by Mr Gaddafi, the EU has been shelling out on projects for Libya like 'enhancing respect for international humanitarian law'."
"It is pretty obvious that has not worked."
"Meanwhile, Baroness Ashton here is demanding yet more resources, on top of the almost EUR 3 billion the External Action Service is due to receive."
"Instead of being immersed further in this bloated, duplicating and insatiable EU foreign service and European Defence Agency, Britain should spend the GBP 48 million a day we pay for EU membership on our own national defence interests."
"The Libyan crisis has shown the value of having aircraft carriers with fast jets stationed off crisis zones."
"I appeal to David Cameron to see sense and reprieve both the carrier HMS Ark Royal, and at least a minimum number of Harriers."
"During the Falklands crisis, Mrs Thatcher successfully reprieved the Ark's sister ship, HMS Invincible."
"We must do the same for the Ark Royal."
"(RO) Mr President, I would like to begin by mentioning the very sceptical, pessimistic voices which have recently expressed the view, since the uprisings in the Mediterranean region, that the Middle East peace process is in danger of becoming a kind of collateral victim."
"Based on this interpretation, the process would become even more deadlocked than it currently is, which would cause further disruption."
"I believe that we do not need to take such a pessimistic view of things."
"I actually believe that it is these recent events which show us the need for significant progress in the peace process."
"In this respect, we need European leadership, mainly so that the September 2011 deadline for reaching an agreement can be met."
"From this perspective, I would like to congratulate the High Representative for the commitment that she has shown and the efforts that she has made in recent months."
"In order to implement the two-state solution and promote the cause of a global Arab-Israeli peace, I believe that we need, once again, to bring both sides to the negotiating table and, in this regard, the Quartet's initiative of consulting with the Israeli and Palestinian negotiators separately marks a first step."
"We certainly need to take a further step."
"I believe that the climate of revolution in the Mediterranean may give new impetus to the peace process."
"However, we must take care that the changes taking place do not lead to a review of the commitments made previously by some of the countries in the region in relation to Israel."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Mediterranean has made a dramatic return to the global political agenda and Europe has found out that it is very weak indeed."
"We failed to invest in a neighbourhood policy with the Middle East and the Maghreb, we did not give our backing to an area of free trade or a common immigration policy and what is happening in North Africa is having an effect on the Middle East, where the peace process has stalled."
"Baroness Ashton, Europe must help Israel and the Palestinians to restart negotiations on the basis of proposals that are now supported by both the Council and Parliament."
"The changes under way also affect Israel and, by investing in change, we can bring together security and peace."
"Europe must exert pressure on Israel to weaken its grip on the occupied territories and to halt the settlement policy, which is a necessary condition to restart negotiations."
"As we are currently seeing, these days, nobody is impervious when the desire for freedom explodes like this."
"Any further delay in resolving the conflict risks compromising Israeli and Palestinian hopes of reaching a fair solution and compromises the future of such a fragile area of the Mediterranean and the Middle East."
"(FR) Mr President, everyone can see that the situation is changing in the Middle East with this democratic wave that is sweeping through the Maghreb and the Mashreq via Egypt."
"This historic uprising taking place in the Arab nations must be seen by Israel and by the Palestinian leaders as an opportunity, not as a risk."
"Indeed, I believe that the sudden emergence of democratic movements at the borders of Israel and the Palestinian territories is an opportunity to be seized by both parties."
"Today, Israelis and Palestinians are having to face facts: the world around them is changing, and it is time for them to change too."
"Therefore, the time has come for Europe to force a dialogue, to open real negotiations and to launch a genuine peace process with a view to finding a lasting solution that sees the two nations living side by side in peace."
"However, at this very crucial time, it would be incomprehensible and inappropriate for the Union to dispense with its special envoy for the Middle East."
"I should therefore like it if you could shed some light on this matter for us, Baroness Ashton."
"(PL) Mr President, as a Member of the European Parliament, I have had the opportunity to visit several countries in the Middle East in the last few months, including Syria, the Palestinian Authority and Israel."
"One of the region's leaders told me: 'Please tell Europe's leaders to be more strongly involved, because if this involvement achieves success, it will be a political success of the kind for which the Nobel Peace Prize is awarded'."
"I dedicate those words to Mrs Ashton."
"However, speaking in all seriousness, all leaders said the same to me: the European Union must be more strongly involved in the Middle East process."
"For example, the United States is affected by certain political restrictions, while, on the other hand, our involvement must include cooperation with a partner such as the United States, if only because of the strategic relations of the United States with Israel."
"Secondly, all of us, including Mrs Ashton, should make use of every opportunity available to the European Union."
"Last week, for example, there was an unprecedented joint sitting of the governments of Poland and Israel in the form of an intergovernmental consultation."
"The Prime Minister, Mr Tusk, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Sikorski, were in Israel."
"We should make the most of this type of opportunity."
"Mr President, the Middle East question, complicated as it was, has become even more complicated lately."
"Naturally, the safe bet for everyone would be to wait and see."
"On the Palestinian side, the question is who will tip the balance in their favour: Hamas, supported by Iran, gaining ground in the West Bank - more probable - or Fatah reasserting its presence in Gaza - less probable."
"Then Jordan, a key country which is engulfed in turmoil, might blow up the entire peace process."
"As for Israel, apparently there are two schools of thought: one favouring a restart of the current negotiations through breakthrough proposals, the other favouring the same 'wait and see' policy."
"However, with the vision and determination to take the right turn at each of these crossroads, there is a chance that the current impasse can be overcome, however far off that might appear now."
"(EL) Mr President, I agree with the High Representative's observation that now is the time for serious intervention and proper negotiation in the Middle East. Firstly, because no one knows what will happen next in North Africa and, secondly, because it is clear that the situation between Israel and Palestine is being used as a pretext for global terrorism and tension and, in particular, to ignite tension in the Muslim world."
"Therefore, the peace process needs immediate intervention, intervention by you, Lady Ashton, and by a special envoy."
"This will also be a chance for Europe to find out if it really can intervene and play the role played once upon a time by the United States, but with different results."
"Of course, financial aid is necessary, but it requires special regulation and special monitoring, because we all know what became of financial aid in the old days."
"Of course, there is also the huge issue of democratisation because, without social democracy, the peace process will certainly become a very difficult process."
"Thus, a special negotiator, with a special team to help towards proper democratisation and constitutional order, would be very valuable and I have the impression from what you said, Lady Ashton, that you will be making efforts in this direction."
"(PL) Mr President, Mrs Ashton, when I talked with politicians in the Middle East, I often heard them say that the European Union is a payer, not a player."
"It was also said that the Union must be a player and not just a payer, because the European Union is the one institution in the Quartet which everyone trusts."
"Some trust Russia, while the other side in the conflict is more open to the United States."
"The European Union is predestined for this role."
"It was said that the Union does not have a common policy because the Member States have very different attitudes to the parties in the conflict and the ways of resolving these problems."
"We have, now, an exceptional opportunity, because there is Mrs Ashton, we have the External Action Service, and we can create a common policy on the conflict."
"This week, the Commission published a new document concerning assistance for the countries of the Mediterranean region entitled 'A Partnership for Democracy and Shared Prosperity with the Southern Mediterranean'."
"I appeal for us to examine our policy on the Middle East and on Eastern Europe and to learn lessons from these experiences which can then be used when building the new policy towards the countries of the Mediterranean."
"The European Union has given help to institutions in Poland and 10 other Member States."
"It has helped civil society in the Middle East."
"Let us, then, make use of this experience when building the new policy."
"(IT) Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, in order to achieve peace, all parties first need to take on some commitments, beginning with the recognition of Israel to all effects - which is still not the case in some countries - and therefore, all countries in the area need to offer basic, essential guarantees in order to establish relations built on mutual respect."
"If the commercial policy has today become a new form of foreign policy, then we must try to propose and reach solutions not only democratically, but also through commercial agreements."
"It is no longer conceivable for the Union to continue financing projects, as it has done so far, that bring neither the result for which the funds were allocated, nor even a slight improvement in the democratic process and the peace process."
"Israel cannot be left alone and the Palestinian people have the right to a State."
"However, we also need to take action in economic terms, with observatories that are capable of monitoring the use of the aid that we are giving out."
"The new situation that has taken hold in recent months, which involves a wider geographic area, finally forces Europe to take stronger and more determined political action and to work more closely with young people, who can help build the safer and more democratic society that we still have not been able to provide for the new generations."
"Mr President, having heard Baroness Ashton's statement, I would like to put two questions relating to her evaluation of the impact on the Middle East peace process of what is occurring now in North Africa."
"Baroness Ashton, do you not believe that we have a new opportunity, since the global platform for human rights is now much higher and the threshold of tolerance in the Middle East for clear violations of international law and human rights, such as Gaza and the settlements, is much lower?"
"My second question is this: do you not believe that the psychology of a besieged fortress in Israel, which, in the past, was a driving force behind its foreign policy, now has much less justification, because the threat posed by what are becoming democratic regimes is very much less and also because democracies do not go to war against each other?"
"Do not all these factors contribute powerfully to a potential reduction in tension in the Middle East?"
"Mr President, the EU is part of the Quartet but sadly, there is currently not much progress in the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians."
"Stalemate is likely to continue as long as there is so much unrest and uncertainty in the Arab world."
"Certainly from Israel's point of view - and I declare I am Vice-President of the European Friends of Israel - the unpredictable situation in Egypt is diverting attention away from the peace process."
"I welcome the commitment by the military government in Egypt to honour the 1979 peace treaty with Israel."
"Let us hope that the Muslim Brotherhood do not prevail in Cairo."
"Whatever happens, we should make sure that future EU aid to Egypt is conditional on retention of the peace treaty with Israel."
"Indeed, the fact that part of the putative future Palestinian state is ruled by Hamas, which is committed still to Israel's annihilation, is surely the biggest obstacle to peace."
"Iran also constitutes a threat to the very existence of Israel."
"Peace in the region will never be possible as long as Tehran continues to fund and arm the fanatics of Hezbollah in Lebanon."
"Therefore, I understand the recent concern in Israel at the passage of two Iranian warships through the Suez Canal on their way to Syria, which is the first time this was allowed to happen since 1979."
"Egypt getting closer to Iran is a very alarming trend."
"Therefore, I wish the High Representative every success in this diplomatic minefield which lies ahead."
"(SK) Mr President, the Middle East peace process is, in my opinion, going through an endurance test at the moment."
"The Arab world is changing and few can foresee what sort of governments or regimes will take power in the Arab countries."
"The situation is all the more complex for the fact that the Israeli administration has again provoked the Arab world recently by building new settlements on Palestinian territories."
"In my opinion, there is only one option open to us at such a time - intensive engagement on all fronts."
"We must convince our Israeli friends to refrain from all actions that might provoke unnecessary anger among the Arab population."
"However, we must, at the same time, carefully attempt, through close engagement with the Arab world, and particularly with countries that are now deciding on their future orientation, to support decent, democratic political forces that will be capable of resolving any disputes peacefully, in a businesslike manner, and without prejudice and hatred."
"We know that the path to greater peace in the Middle East will not be easy, but I hope that the Israeli Government understands by now that today it has one of its last chances for a peaceful and pragmatic ordering of relations with Palestine."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr Tannock referred to the Iranian ships that passed through the Suez Canal."
"My question to Baroness Ashton, the High Representative, is: is it certain that Egypt has no possibility at all under international law to deny passage to the ships, whether it wished to or not?"
"I only wanted to ask whether it was based on international law or whether some political connection is involved here."
"Vice-President of the Council/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. - Mr President, I will try to deal with as many of the issues that were raised as possible but, as always, when we debate the Middle East peace process, there is a real sense of urgency and a strong desire in this House to see us make progress."
"Let me just tell you that this is reflected a thousandfold in the work that I try to do to see what we are able to achieve as the European Union."
"I absolutely want us to move away from ever hearing the phrase 'payer, not a player' again."
"I am sick of it."
"I have heard it enough."
"I do not criticise Members here for saying it."
"It is simply just a travesty of the role of the European Union, but I think it does reflect historically some of the ways in which we perhaps were perceived."
"I have worked really hard in the course of this year to change that, not least on the ground, and I will say more about that in a moment."
"I want to begin with you, Mr Salafranca, because you asked me about some very specific points."
"We began with the issue of the veto of the Security Council by the United States - the 14 to 1 vote on the settlements proposal, the resolution that was put forward by Lebanon on the day, because they are part of the Security Council - which, as you know, created a huge amount of what we might call noise in the system and beyond."
"I was in the Middle East with the Palestinians during the course of those final days leading up to that vote."
"All the EU countries on the Security Council voted against the American position and voted for the resolution."
"Our position is absolutely clear."
"We are all united in recognising that the settlements are illegal under international law."
"Those of you who, like me, have seen the settlements, will know that actually, they are not in anyone's long-term interest and would have to be resolved ultimately by determination of the borders."
"Our proposals have been the 1967 borders with appropriate swapping of territory, which is for the parties to agree and not for us to say, but I am sure that would take into account the reality of people's lives and where they live."
"I do not think it has had a dramatic long-term effect on the relationship with the US, not least because the United States has worked very hard to explain its position - and I am not going to try to explain it for them - and to continue to work with the Palestinians."
"I think that the Palestinians have understood the position that the United States found itself in."
"So there is still a huge amount of work going on, but I do not want in any way to suggest that it was not a difficult time."
"I was very well aware of that."
"You asked me about the Palestinian elections called for September, which Hamas has refused to participate in."
"You will also know - and you will have seen it - that Prime Minister Fayyad is busy looking at the possibilities for some sort of reconciliation."
"I will be speaking to him soon about that among many other things."
"I am not sure whether the elections will now go ahead."
"That will be for them to decide."
"I know that they are thinking about the best way forward."
"You also asked me about the leaks that occurred from the Palestinian side."
"You know that Mr Erkat, who was the chief negotiator, is moving to a new position as a senior advisor for President Abbas on the grounds that it was from his office and he must take responsibility for it."
"I think it had two effects."
"One is, of course, great concern about what was going on."
"When you are trying to pull together a negotiating position, lots of things are said."
"Many of them do not end up in the final documents but people - and this is right and proper - spend time thinking about the different positions."
"So without doubt, there was concern in Ramallah and beyond, and on the West Bank and beyond, about what was being said."
"Interestingly, there was an equal and opposite reaction whereby, I think in parts of the Israeli press, when they saw what they thought was a Palestinian position, they asked, why are we not engaging with this?"
"So it had an interesting effect on raising the debate."
"Perhaps in the longer term - although I am never a fan of leaking anything, because it prevents people from developing good policy - this might not have the effect that originally we might have seen."
"Let me just kill off this association agreement discussion, which is why I kept shaking my head."
"What has not happened is a change in the existing framework and the position."
"Progress in the association agreement remains dependent upon progress in the Middle East peace process."
"What was being described was the aspiration to want to have those stronger relations, because we do believe in a two-state settlement and we do believe in the future of Israel."
"We want to see a strong Israel - economically, politically, all of those things - as we wish to see a strong Palestinian state, but we cannot make progress until we see progress in the Middle East peace process."
"I agree with Ms Neyts-Uyttebroeck that it is really important that we start to speed up."
"This has been a point that I have made consistently in Israel and to the Palestinian Authority."
"We have to get moving."
"There are two reasons for this."
"One is that the region is changing and those changes demand it and, as Mr Arlacchi said, there is a change in the region that demands that we recognise that an Egypt - not that I believe that Egypt wishes to create a problem militarily with Israel, I do not at all - a democratic Egypt moving forward will want to look again at the issue that is on its doorstep."
"I think it is the interests of both."
"I genuinely believe it is in the interests of the people of Israel as much as of the Palestinian people to find a solution now."
"This could be a really important part of a secure, stable region."
"I have said that and will continue to say it, and will continue to say it to all our partners, including everybody in the Quartet."
"Mr Belder, we have to get, as you say, to direct negotiations, but we have to do it by making sure the positions of the parties are credible and credible with each other as well."
"It is really important that the Palestinians are able to go to the negotiating table with the support of the Arab League."
"I speak with Amr Moussa on this subject."
"I will see him again in Cairo."
"He will be leaving the Arab League in May, I think on 14 May."
"He is becoming a presidential candidate in Egypt, as I understand it."
"It is very important that the Palestinians can carry the people with them."
"That is important for them and it is also important for Israel and for the security of both."
"So all of this is tied up with trying to make sure that progress is linked to a certainty about being able to carry the people and the other partners who need to be engaged with that."
"Mr Lambsdorff, thank you for your comments."
"I think the Quartet is a really important vehicle, but it is not everything."
"I am trying to make sure that we make progress on that."
"I feel very strongly that we have played an important part."
"I think we have played an extremely important part over the past weeks and months in how we have been able to keep momentum going."
"We need to get further and faster."
"With the Quartet envoys meetings that are taking place, we need to use that opportunity."
"When the envoys arrived last week in Brussels, I sat with them for an hour to discuss how I saw the possibilities and to impress upon them the importance of using these meetings with the Israelis and the Palestinians."
"I do not mind where we meet the envoys."
"I understand with the Palestinians and with the Israelis that sometimes, they are very nervous about what is happening."
"So if we go to Jerusalem to meet the Israeli negotiator, I do not care where we go."
"Let us just have the meetings and actually, for the very first time, get the envoys meeting with the negotiators and having the chance to explore the positions in a way that we have not done before."
"For me, that really matters."
"When I talked about Gaza and Kerem Shalom, I really was not trying to suggest that there is only one crossing."
"We did a complete piece of work on looking at the whole of the infrastructure on the crossings because, when I went into Gaza and met with businesses, particularly, but also in talking to the young people - and I went to the summer schools last year which we fund - it did seem to me that one of the most important issues for Gaza was to get the economy moving as quickly as possible."
"I respect the fact - and I meet with the Israeli general who is in charge of opening the crossing each time I go and get an update - that there is some movement."
"I appreciate that."
"However, we wanted to make sure that we enabled exports in particular, which is vital for the crossings and vital for the economy, because getting more goods in if you do not have an economy does not help you as much as if you can do both."
"So, getting that to happen mattered."
"Kerem Shalom was the one where we saw that we could do three things."
"First of all, we could put in the infrastructure - the road that would enable it to be used more frequently - and, secondly, we could put in the equipment that would enable the scanning to be done much more quickly to get the flow of goods moving."
"Thirdly, we could also train the Palestinian people as part of our mission."
"EUR 5.3 million is what it will cost."
"We can do it and we are ready to roll."
"The reason that matters is because, although of course I want to see a much bigger solution for Gaza, it is important that we offer our support to enable things to happen quickly that can help to alleviate that situation."
"So that is my particular reference for Kerem Shalom."
"We looked at Karni."
"There are other crossings we have looked at, but that is the one where we can make a specific contribution right now."
"We will try to do so but it does not alter the basic premise of what we have said - that the crossings need to be open, that people need to move freely and be able to do that as quickly as possible."
"I just want to say to Mr Campbell Bannerman that I do not mind you attacking me, but please, let us get the facts right."
"Most of the money that you are describing - and, in fact, there is more of it - is used for spending outside."
"It is not actually for my service."
"It is in order that we can build democracies, support human rights, the instrument for stability, development and so on, which I know you and other members of your group - and I think everyone in this House - absolutely supports one hundred percent."
"You want us to support the people of Egypt, the people of Tunisia and the people of Libya."
"Well, that is some money that we use to do it across the world over time."
"The budget for the European External Action Service is EUR 460 million."
"That funds 135 delegations, the central staff, everything that we do all over the world."
"It is less than 50% of the British Foreign Office's budget."
"So if you want to attack me for that, that is fine, but please do not accuse me of having billions and billions of euro that somehow I am using for a sparkling building or anything else."
"That is the amount that I have for the moment to be able to spend under the budget that exists."
"I will try to spend it as well as I possibly can in the interests of the things that I believe in and which this House believes in."
"The rest of it is for us to give to other people who need it to achieve what we think is right."
"I have been talking too long but, Mr Arlacchi, it is true that things in the Middle East are changing and the terms are changing."
"What is really interesting, as we build the platform on which we operate, is to be able to look at the potential in the region - whether it is in Lebanon and the possibilities of what could happen there, whether it is in terms of the Middle East peace process and certainly what is happening in Egypt and also in my conversations with Jordan, where I speak to the Foreign Minister frequently."
"We talk about the opportunities that we have there."
"So I think it is the moment where we can really make changes."
"I want to just say something about the relationships that we have."
"I work very hard at the relationships with Israel and the Palestinians and I talk to a lot of people."
"I talk to the leaders of both, privately for many hours, and with other people in the meetings."
"I respect those conversations very much, but I tell you the European Union is respected in both countries and I intend to keep it that way because that is about a two-state solution."
"They will tell me about things they do not like."
"I am glad they do, but I think they have respect for the position that we are trying to take."
"We do not have a marginal role."
"We have a realistic role."
"The role that we are able to play is one that I understand and I use to the best effect I can."
"I cannot do what other countries can do."
"I do not have the power to do some things, but what we can do is use our economic and political muscle - in the best sense of that word - to be able to try and support this process going forward."
"I devote more energy to this probably than to anything else that we do."
"Ms Dodds asked whether the neighbourhood policy had failed."
"It has not, but it definitely fits into the 'could do better' category."
"I said a long time ago that we need to review the policy."
"Stefan Füle and I have started that work."
"The events of the last few weeks have proved we need to do it, to make it more effective, more able to achieve what we want and to be flexible and recognise that in the different countries, we need a differentiated approach that will really deliver for the people on the ground the things that they want against the values and aspirations that we hold for them and for ourselves."
"I have upgraded the post of special envoy to Deputy Secretary-General for the moment because I think it is so important that the Quartet envoy is somebody who is absolutely at the heart and who is our political director."
"I thank Marc Otte for his contribution."
"Once Helga Schmid has finished this piece of work and we see where we going, I will then look to see what we should do for the future to make sure that we are properly represented in the region."
"Finally, Mr Swoboda, you asked me about the Iranian ship."
"As I understand it, the position is that the Iranians said they were doing a training mission in support of their work to combat piracy off the coast of Somalia."
"Permission was given for it to go through on that basis."
"As far as I am aware - and that is the last information I had because, obviously, as soon as we heard, we asked for the information - as a training mission with that in mind, I do not think there was any reason for the Egyptians to deny them access."
"Whether that was what was happening or not is another thing altogether."
"Honourable Members, thank you very much for this debate."
"I hope in my response I have covered as many of the issues as possible."
"Baroness Ashton, we thank you very much because you have had a very demanding day."
"You have worked very hard in this Chamber today, so thank you for being with us and for giving us such excellent and detailed answers."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"The situation in the Middle East and the Mediterranean region is at a particularly delicate juncture, as the High Representative has also mentioned in her speech."
"I believe that this is an appropriate opportunity for the EU to focus on the peace process in the region."
"Israel is one of the European Union's biggest trade partners, while students from the whole of Europe have access to study centres in Israel, thanks to the university international exchange programmes."
"I should also mention that the Middle East is where the challenges of the future are already taking shape."
"The management of drinking water is one example of this."
"The Arab revolutions have generated a climate of instability in the Mediterranean region, which has a particular effect on Israel."
"Recently, due to such security risks, the step was taken to close a border point, leaving Kerem Shalom as the only commercial crossing which is completely secure."
"The Israeli authorities are focusing their efforts at this location on ensuring a normal flow of civilian and commercial traffic."
"In this context, I feel that it is vital to resume as quickly as possible the negotiations on reaching a peaceful solution."
"Indeed, the EU's involvement in this process may provide the support needed for this dialogue to be carried out in ideal conditions."
"The revolutions in the Arab world must not divert our attention from the Middle East peace process."
"On the contrary, they are an opportunity to be seized."
"Palestine is due to hold presidential and legislative elections before the summer, and the Palestinian Authority wants to establish legitimate institutions and manage its security."
"The ongoing construction of Israeli settlements is an injustice and a provocation to the Palestinians."
"Today, we have the opportunity, with this wind of freedom that is blowing over the whole of the Arab world, to relaunch the negotiations."
"The EU must take the initiative to relaunch them."
"Why not do so within the context of the Union for the Mediterranean?"
"Agenda of the next sitting: see Minutes"
"Closure of the sitting"
"(The sitting closed at 18:20)"
"Opening of the sitting"
"(The sitting was opened at 09:00)"
"Media law in Hungary (motions for resolutions tabled): see Minutes"
"Respect of national wage and retirement-setting mechanisms (debate)"
"The first item is the Commission statement on respect of national wage and retirement-setting mechanisms."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to thank honourable Members for this opportunity to dispel some widely held misunderstandings regarding the Irish programme."
"The S&D Group's question that gave rise to this statement raises honourable Members' concern that certain economic policy conditions set out in the Memorandum of Understanding of the Economic Adjustment Programme for Ireland are in legal conflict with Article 153(5) of the Treaty."
"That paragraph excludes the adoption of provisions in the field of pay under Article 153, that is, in the field of social policy."
"However, the Economic Adjustment Programme for Ireland is not a social policy programme and is not adopted under Article 153."
"It is a financial assistance programme set up, together with the Irish Government, to restore domestic and external confidence and remove the harmful feedback loops between the fiscal and financial crisis."
"Therefore, it is grounded in Article 122(2) of the Treaty, which allows for Union financial assistance if a Member State is seriously threatened with severe difficulties caused by exceptional occurrences beyond its control."
"The role of the MOU is to specify the economic policy conditions that serve as a benchmark for assessing the Irish policy performance during the financial assistance programme."
"The Member State has full ownership of these economic policy conditions and their implementation."
"These conditions are commitments of the Member State that are undertaken by the state itself."
"It is not EU action in the respective fields."
"Indeed, many of the conditions, such as the minimum wage reduction, were already included in the Irish Government's national recovery plan that was published on 24 November 2010, before the start of the programme."
"The aim of the conditions relating to labour market policy is to create jobs and to avoid long-term unemployment in Ireland amongst the most vulnerable groups."
"The minimum wage reduction is part of this wider package of measures and needs to be seen together with activation policies and efforts to modernise the benefit system."
"When evaluating the reduction in one of the highest minimum wages in the European Union - it is, for instance, the second highest in the eurozone - and although there was significant wage adjustment in the economy, with the minimum wage, in common with wages in general in Ireland, falling by 3% in real terms in 2008, followed by a rise of 0.3% in 2009, it should be noted that most of the labour market adjustments took the form of job losses."
"In fact, the minimum wage cut only restored the status quo prevailing before 1 January 2007, i.e. before the crisis."
"The other condition mentioned in the question is an independent review of sectoral collective bargaining."
"The motivation of the review is to discuss the fairness and efficiency of employment conditions for both employees and employers across sectors."
"I would like to highlight the fact that Ireland has a long-standing tradition of tripartite consultation on economic and social policy and that the successive pacts between the government and the social partners since the 1980s have been widely recognised as major factors in the success of the Irish economy."
"The review is an opportunity for the social partners to voice opinions and shape policy, and its announcement was welcomed as such."
"I am fully confident that the review will be carried out by the Irish Government in a way that recognises the importance of social dialogue, includes all the social partners, and complies with Community law."
"Finally, the conditions in the Memorandum of Understanding with regard to structural reform are not only about the labour market."
"They also contain important measures to open up product markets such as overly regulated sectors and professions."
"These reforms could have a major effect on customer prices and productivity, which support the purchasing power of households."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, I would also like to thank the Commissioner."
"Yesterday, a new national government for recovery was voted into power in Ireland."
"Fine Gael and Labour are part of the PPE and S&D groups respectively in this Parliament."
"One of the issues high up on the agenda of the new programme for government will be the renegotiation of elements of the EU/IMF programme of support to Ireland."
"At present, many Irish people fear that the conditions agreed by the then government in the EU/IMF programme of support are too stringent and place a heavy burden on ordinary citizens who have had to bear the brunt for the mistakes of the banks - both Irish and European - and the government."
"We should note that the new government has agreed to reverse the reduction in the minimum wage."
"We know, however, that recovery cannot happen without pain."
"Ireland went down a similar road in the 1980s."
"Many of the difficult conditions as laid out by the EU/IMF programme are necessary if we are to restore healthy public finances."
"We must prune the tree in order to allow growth."
"I welcome the Commission's support for an interest rate reduction as stated by Commissioner Rehn."
"This should come about as soon as possible and I urge the Commission to really look at this at an early date."
"The Commissioner emphasised that all measures are weighed up against their effect on growth, competitiveness and the sustainability of public finances in the long run."
"I accept that; we cannot carry the entire burden we have been asked to carry at once."
"The Irish people have taken their responsibilities in this matter; in fact, they have taken other people's responsibilities as well, because we were given no alternative."
"What they have done is not just for Ireland but also for Europe and the eurozone in particular."
"We do not need the straw to break the camel's back."
"Please give the Irish people the tools; we will do the job ourselves, but please do not expect the Irish people to carry a burden that they are not capable of carrying."
"So I ask the Commissioner to bear those comments in mind in particular in the days and weeks ahead."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - Mr President, this memorandum requires an EUR 1 per hour reduction in the minimum wage in Ireland and a review, as we have heard, of the system of collective pay agreements which protect the low paid."
"I do not believe that this interference can be justified."
"The Treaty requires the Commission to promote social dialogue, not undermine it."
"Article 152 requires respect for the autonomy of social partners, not this type of interference, and Article 153 expressly excludes EU action in the field of play."
"The Commission cannot pick and choose the hierarchy of articles in this respect."
"The memorandum goes on to insist on cuts in social welfare, the roll-back of key public services, and reductions in public sector employment and public sector pensions."
"How can those demands be justified in relation to a Treaty that requires the Union to aim to eliminate inequalities, promote a high level of employment, guarantee adequate social protection and fight against social exclusion?"
"The only honest answer to that is that these things cannot be reconciled, and the problem is that these things have now, as a result of the Annual Growth Survey, become the general rule."
"The people will reject the idea of a Europe based only on austerity."
"They will not tolerate the far-reaching implications for social policies with lower wages, lower employment protection, weak social standards, reduced public services and the imposition of higher retirement ages."
"If we want to continue to swell the ranks of anti-Europeanism, then carry on, Commission."
"If not, please stop this nonsense now."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, the Commissioner is telling us that the Memorandum of Understanding was drawn up under Article 122, part 2."
"I would like to ask the Commissioner what happens when one article of the Treaty is in direct contradiction with other articles in the Treaty; as Stephen Hughes has asked, how do we decide on the hierarchy?"
"It is in contradiction with Article 153."
"It is also in contradiction with Article 9, the social clause, which I have quoted many times in this Chamber when speaking about the Irish austerity package, where it says that in defining and implementing all its policies and activities, the Union shall take into account requirements linked to the promotion of a high level of employment and the fight against social exclusion, etc. And what about Article 28 in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, under which workers have the rights to negotiate and conclude collective agreements and, in the cases of conflicts of interest, to take collective action to defend their interests, including strike action?"
"Many Irish workers would see that they are in that position at the moment."
"How do we deal with the contradiction between the different articles in the Treaty?"
"Another question for you, Commissioner: are you stating that the Memorandum of Understanding was entirely the responsibility of the Irish Government and that the Commission acquiesced or agreed?"
"Finally, let us assume here you have the power to do all of this - and you are telling us you have; why then was there no effort to reduce or eliminate bank bonuses?"
"Why was there no effort to ensure that those at the top of the salary scale paid their fair share?"
"Why is it that one euro was deducted from the minimum wage?"
"I agree entirely with what Stephen Hughes has said: this fuels anti-European sentiment."
"Citizens see what is happening."
"They see how the Commission is working in this whole process, and what they see is that it is those on the minimum wage, those who are in collective agreements, are being hit with these austerity plans."
"Finally my main question, Commissioner, is: who decides?"
"Is it the Court of Justice?"
"Who decides when articles of the Treaty are in conflict or when the Commission acts in such a way as to bring those articles into conflict with one another?"
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, I understand the urgency of the Commission in addressing the economic crisis and the high levels of debt which are a threat for the stability of the euro."
"I understand that conditions are imposed on countries that have to make use of the European Financial Stability Mechanism."
"However, it seems to me that the Commission is being quite selective in the measures and conditions it deems permitted in this crisis."
"On the one hand, nearly any measure seems legal when it comes to fiscal consolidation by cutting expenditure."
"As soon as Ireland made use of the rescue package, minimum wages and pension levels were the first variables to be adjusted, despite the fact that these matters explicitly are not EU competences."
"On the other hand, the Commission hides itself behind the lack of EU competence to leave the exceptionally low Irish corporation tax untouched, whereas increasing this could also substantially improve public revenues in Ireland."
"Cutting expenditure is not, after all, the only way to achieve a balanced budget."
"I understand that this crisis requires exceptional measures, but why is the Commission in such a hurry to adjust minimum wages, affecting workers who earn the least, while we have to wait and see about measures that make the banking and financial sector pay?"
"I strongly get the feeling that the Commission is interpreting the EU's competences in a very one-sided and, dare I say it, right-wing manner."
"This blunt approach inspires Euro-scepticism."
"It seems that the EU acts firmly in the field of employment and social policy only in times of crisis, and then does so by imposing cuts in social spending and wages."
"The EU can only regain confidence if the Commission shows the same determination in setting proper minimum social standards and social guarantees for the heavy cuts imposed on people."
"Yes, we do want economic governance, but we want balanced governance with both fiscal sustainability and social guarantees."
"If not, the vulnerable will pay the price for a mess that they are not responsible for."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the rescue packages were intended to protect EU Member States from insolvency."
"However, they are overwhelming citizens with brutal austerity programmes and allowing the perpetrators to get off scot-free."
"On top of that, the Commission is now interfering in national wage policy, too."
"Mr Hahn, it is quite absurd and it brings tears to my eyes when I hear formal arguments like yours that this is not at all intended to be a socio-political measure."
"Such a position is utterly unacceptable."
"Wage policy is not the business of the EU."
"This policy on the part of the Commission is at complete odds with the idea of this European Union."
"The EU was never intended to be about competition in wages and social dumping."
"This Commission policy talks about the inflexibility of wages, which is to be reduced."
"It states that wages should reflect market conditions."
"This is like a blind man describing an elephant."
"People who write such things have no understanding of collective agreement systems."
"They interfere in free collective bargaining and reduce the much talked-about autonomy of the social partners and the social dialogue to absurdity."
"I would like to make it clear that this Parliament is called on to ensure that the autonomous collective agreement policy is retained, to protect the social dialogue and to prevent the further dismantling of social security."
"We need measures to prevent a counterproductive austerity policy, not punitive measures."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr President, this goes beyond Ireland."
"Only a month ago, I reminded the House that pensions were exclusively the competence of the Member States and here we go again using the same language of coordination and retirement-setting mechanisms."
"Now pensions are almost always related to earnings, so do we see here an attempt to harmonise wages?"
"I hope not, because the Treaties also say that wages are an exclusive competence of the Member States."
"It is all very well to say that 'equal' must mean equal pay, but should all workers doing the same job get the same pay across the EU?"
"As an example, think 'climate': keeping a house warm near the Arctic Circle needs much more money than in Mediterranean countries."
"Add in winter clothing, snow clearance and all the rest and it is obvious that to pay all workers the same would leave some with more spare cash than others."
"Of course wages cannot be equal."
"The Commission's intentions in drawing up plans to encourage Member States to introduce an EU minimum wage policy and set retirement mechanisms are going against the Treaties."
"I am not surprised: this is the EU at work."
"A harmonised wage and pensions policy is not just a dream; it is illegal."
"Leave it, as the Treaties demand, to the competence of elected governments like mine at Westminster and like that in Ireland."
"(DE) Mr President, Ireland is a tragic historical lesson for us."
"At first, this country was always celebrated as the 'showcase' country and the model for new members of the Union, although at that time, very wrong policies were permitted and encouraged and these resulted in enormous bubbles in the property sector having to be dealt with, the banking sector being allowed to become a law unto itself and no attention being paid to preventing competitive dumping in the area of taxation."
"Commissioner, you have the same nationality as me."
"We know how many Austrian writers, for example, suddenly discovered that they are Irish, because they had to pay hardly any tax there."
"What did the supposedly extremely pro-European forces do at that time?"
"Absolutely nothing!"
"They said 'this country is a wonderful example'."
"All of that has now completely collapsed."
"This bubble has now turned out to be exactly what many people said it was all along."
"Once again we have a situation where - and I am not alone in thinking this - anti-European sentiment is being fanned by the fact that we are again allowing the wrong policies to be pursued, in this case by imposing this massive package on Ireland."
"Commissioner, you say that the Member State is committing itself to this."
"However, we know from our experience of World Bank and International Monetary Fund programmes - and what we are currently seeing in Ireland is not so very different from this - that in the end, these countries have no choice."
"If we were to take a step back and say 'it is a shame that Ireland did not reject the Treaty of Lisbon the second time around', then we could come to a completely different way of thinking."
"We would then see that, with this European construct, we are dealing with something that could be likened to a vehicle, the front of which consists of a Porsche while the back consists of a bicycle."
"These two things do not go together."
"They need to be much stronger."
"If we want to prevent this Europe from breaking apart, we actually need something like a Constitution for Europe."
"We then need clear benchmarks that actually apply to everyone."
"We need economic governance."
"This fragmentary approach - forwards, backwards, sidewards - will not work, and in the end, Commissioner, it is more likely to end in disaster than in what you, I and the vast majority of this House are working for, namely, a peaceful, functional and also united Europe."
"(FR) Mr President, for the record, with the crisis and the bursting of the housing and credit bubbles, the Irish State has had to intervene to support the banks."
"The Irish public deficit, the accumulated budget balance of central and local administrations and, in particular, social security administrations, was estimated at 32% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2010."
"If the Irish Government, which is finding it difficult to refinance itself on the markets, wishes to access loans from the European Financial Stability Mechanism and the European Financial Stability Fund, it will have to meet requirements for social and fiscal change, even though these areas come under subsidiarity."
"In our view, there is no contradiction here."
"As a doctor, I would say that, in the case of fever, there is no point prescribing antipyretics indiscriminately without seeking to treat the cause."
"As far as the allocation of these funds is concerned, this State should get its finances in order so as to correct its excessive deficit and past mistakes."
"This austerity plan should improve GDP by 10% over the next four years."
"As with an individual, to whom a bank will make a personal loan conditional upon meeting the solvency condition without getting involved in their private lives and management, the European Union can lend to Ireland on the basis of consolidated solvency."
"Without interfering in their private lives, the bank will encourage an individual to negotiate, for example, an increase in salary, or to borrow elsewhere."
"Thus, by respecting subsidiarity, the European Union, on the basis of a Memorandum of Understanding drawn up with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), considers that this solvency requires the reduction of the legal minimum wage and an adjustment of pensions, with fiscal measures nonetheless in the mix."
"It is up to Ireland to choose whether or not to implement these measures."
"It does not leave the door wide open for the European Union to interfere in areas falling within subsidiarity, making it possible, for example, to impose a European minimum wage, which would be a dangerous thing to do, but rather ensures the protection of the stability of the euro area through a mutual guarantee process."
"Of course, it is necessary to help Ireland, like other countries in difficulty, which also protects us, but not at any price, especially that of seeing a State unable to pay off its loans, thus weakening its citizens and citizens throughout the European Union."
"I should like to mention to all of you that if you make your speeches at a very fast pace, the interpreters have trouble keeping up with you."
"As I am responsible for matters concerning multilingualism, I would like to point out that the Bureau of the European Parliament is currently studying a new system."
"At the moment, the interpreters indicate to the President that they are unable to keep up, but the President then has the difficult task of interrupting you."
"The system we are now investigating would mean that each of you, in your seat, would have a light to warn you when the interpreters cannot follow the speech, so that the President does not need to interrupt you and you would be informed of it directly instead."
"Mr President, the Memorandum of Understanding in relation to labour market issues is very clearly based on a simplistic economic theory that lower wages will 'clear the market', in other words, end unemployment."
"That is total and utter nonsense."
"It is not supported by practice on the ground."
"And I would draw the Commission's attention to the Forfás review of labour cost competitiveness in Ireland, produced late last year, which says that firms generally prefer layoffs to pay cuts because they harm morale less."
"If you want to look at why we have had more layoffs than wage cuts in Ireland, that is the basis of it."
"I would appeal to the Commission to comply with European law and stop interfering in labour market issues in Ireland."
"As you say, we have a long tradition of social partnership agreements in Ireland."
"Indeed, they are the basis of the fact that there has been no violence on the streets in Ireland: it is because the social partners and the government have sat down and made arrangements to adjust the labour market and adjust conditions to ensure that we can have some hope of recovery from the current crisis."
"That tradition has ensured progress in Ireland, but the programme generally is failing to do what it was intended to do, which was to assist the economy in Ireland to grow."
"It is not growing."
"In fact, it is in decline, and that programme has to be generally renegotiated."
"I would suggest in particular that the issues relating to the labour market have to be removed."
"As has already been stated, the Irish Government, of which my party is a member, has already declared that it will reverse the minimum wage cut as agreed in that programme."
"You may be unhappy with that, but that is going to happen."
"You can be certain as well that your attempt to interfere with the Registered Employment Agreements Act, which has been in place for more than 50 years, will not be interfered with, as you hope, because the current government is determined that social partnership will play its traditional role in ensuring that we have industrial peace and progress."
"(PT) Mr President, the tendency in the EU to increase pressure on the Member States is gathering great pace, under the pretext of the crisis, with a view to devaluing wages and increasing the exploitation of those who work, in order to ensure ever more profits and gains for the economic and financial groups, revealing all the antisocial cruelty of capitalism."
"If the irrational criteria of the Stability Pact, with the proposals of so-called economic governance and the so-called competitiveness pact had not been passed, particularly the attempt to prevent wages from rising with inflation and increase the legal age for retirement, we would have even more serious attacks on labour and social rights."
"What is already happening in this field in certain countries, such as Portugal, Greece or Ireland, and which is of the utmost seriousness, are salary cuts and pension freezes, even on the lowest pensions and those below the poverty line."
"In the case of Portugal, a salary cut on the national minimum wage was already planned for the beginning of this year."
"It was felt that EUR 500 was too much per month, and it was decided to cut this by EUR 15, despite the fact that more than 13% of female Portuguese workers receive only this amount, compared with 6% of male workers."
"This is a clear example of institutionalised discrimination and the effect of the so-called austerity measures that the Commission, together with the Council and the governments of our countries, is implementing, with the subsequent exacerbation of social inequality, discrimination, the devaluing of work and increased poverty, while the indulgence of financial speculation and tax havens continues."
"We therefore express our solidarity with the young workers and teachers who are going to protest over the forthcoming weekends, including this Saturday, 12 March, and at the large national demonstration by the General Confederation of Portuguese Workers (CGTP) in Lisbon on 19 March."
"This will continue the fight against these antisocial policies."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"Mr President, in light of what you are telling us, could you please tell us here in this House how attitudes to the European Union have changed in Portugal?"
"Has the percentage of people in favour of membership of the European Union fallen?"
"How has the general feeling towards the EU changed?"
"Portugal shows a great many parallels with Ireland - at first, there was the great euphoria in the 1970s with the prospect of accession, then the corresponding funding."
"Are you also seeing similar property bubbles in Portugal to those that were recorded in Ireland?"
"(PT) Mr President, the issue is interesting in this regard: it is obvious that these EU policies are also sparking a major revolt in Portugal, and next weekend, therefore, young people and teachers will take to the streets to demonstrate against this policy."
"On 19 March, the General Confederation of Portuguese Workers will hold a major demonstration, which is planned to take place in Lisbon, against these antisocial policies."
"Of course, this is reflected in the behaviour of the Portuguese people because the country has already entered into a recession, and living conditions are worsening for the workers and the people, inequality is being exacerbated, and poverty is also on the increase."
"The European Union, the Commission and the Council ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(SV) Mr President, by setting out requirements for lower wages, the Commission has undermined the negotiating right of the social partners and both directly and indirectly affected wage formation, which is explicitly excluded from the Commission's sphere of competence."
"This is nothing less than a frontal assault on the social partners' influence and is contrary to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which includes the right to enter into collective agreements."
"This is not an isolated incident restricted to Ireland, either, but is being repeated time and time again."
"By talking about 'unit labour cost' instead of wages, the Commission is attempting to circumvent the limits established by the Treaty."
"The European Commission has quite simply redrawn the map."
"It has drawn up a new map and a new set of regulations in which the Member States and the social partners now have their tasks taken away from them and, contrary to all regulations, find themselves dictated to."
"This is what the dispute is about and it has only just begun."
"By acting in this way, the EU is moving ever further away from a democratic basis and legitimacy, which, in other contexts, are usually the keywords when we discuss the future of the EU."
"We hear that there are some troublemakers - including in this Parliament - who are already starting to fish in these troubled waters."
"This is surely not what it is all about."
"(NL) Mr President, very few people in the Netherlands have any idea that we, here in Brussels, are discussing their wages and pensions."
"We are currently witnessing what is happening in Ireland but, at the same time, I am also hearing all kinds of proposals being put forward to the European Council for the abolition of wage indexation and for the maximisation of wage increases, based on increases in labour productivity, etc."
"Unfortunately, we seem to perpetually meet with a deafening silence when it comes to agreements on European standards for the minimum wage, nor have I heard any proposals intended to guarantee that workers can get work which pays or that they can get full-time jobs, instead of piecework or standby contracts."
"I am concerned about the impact of the current discussions on ordinary people, but I am also concerned about the image of the European Union."
"It really does look like we only pay attention to the interests of financial institutions, to speculators and to big business."
"Commissioner, is the Commission going to take steps to change that image and is it going to ensure that it is viewed as an institution which also represents the interests of ordinary people?"
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, you have given us a prescription that says two things: firstly, that we should abolish collective agreements and, secondly, that we should reduce the minimum wage still further."
"This is the prescription which is being given consistently to every patient."
"One of the patients is Greece."
"You recently visited Greece, during an event organised by the socialist party."
"You saw and felt the prevailing situation and my question to you is this: did you feel that the prescription for Greece was working?"
"I was there and I am from the socialist party currently governing the country and doing what it can to get it out of the very difficult situation caused by right-wing governments and it has had to make concessions on the question of collective agreements and I am telling you that we have not yet seen results."
"You say that you are doing all this for European citizens, for consumers, but, if consumers are paid lower wages, they will have nothing to spend and will not therefore help to boost growth."
"You know better than I that it is a vicious circle, because you insist on giving us a prescription which does nothing except destroy the workers' dignity, a prescription which results in a lack of decent and viable jobs."
"I beg you to include social indicators alongside the economic indicators."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, I sometimes have the feeling that you should try out all these solutions on the Commission itself so that you could see what impact you are actually having on Europe."
"Following your speech, I am left with the impression that the Commission really does sit in an ivory tower."
"The people of Europe - the workers, the low earners and the pensioners - are really picking up the bill, and you are interpreting legislation and competences however you please."
"On 19 October last year, I received a response to a question that I had put to the Commission in which it was explicitly confirmed that minimum wages and wages in general are the responsibility of the Member States."
"The response states this very emphatically."
"Please read it."
"It is not acceptable for you to give me that kind of answer when it is a good thing for employers and then simply change direction when you believe something is good for the other side."
"That will make the people of Europe really very unhappy."
"My fellow Member has just mentioned this."
"You are chipping away at codetermination."
"You are weakening the trade unions."
"That is not the way out of the crisis and you are fully aware of that."
"Those who caused the crisis must also be the ones to pay for it."
"(Applause)"
"(LT) Mr President, faced with the conditions of the economic crisis, countries are having financial difficulties implementing the commitments they have made."
"There is little doubt that their capacity to overcome the crisis varies and there is a need to find ways of balancing the budget and reducing the budget deficit."
"However, Commissioner, must we really do this at the expense of those who are worst off?"
"Is it morally right for the European Commission to pressure governments into reducing the minimum wage, pensions or other social benefits?"
"Commissioner, you gave your opinion on the Memorandum of Understanding with Ireland."
"However, I would like to remind you that you signed a similar memorandum with Latvia, where you pressed the Latvian Government to reduce pensions that were already low."
"Pensions in Latvia were reduced, but the Latvian Constitutional Court stated that the country's fundamental law does not allow this and the pensions were reinstated."
"Thus, when taking such decisions and signing such memoranda, it is necessary to thoroughly assess both the legal and social consequences."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner Hahn, the proposals that are now on the table are like putting a large rucksack on the backs of all those who are already finding things difficult enough and telling them they have to run faster with it on."
"How is that supposed to happen?"
"The proposals for decentralised wage negotiations are unfair, unimaginative and they are a diversionary tactic, because it is so difficult to tax asset and financial speculation and the Heads of State or Government are not succeeding in getting genuine macro-economic coordination off the ground."
"In this regard, we in Parliament have already set a very different benchmark this week with our vote on the financial transactions tax."
"I would like to remind you all of the principle of the social market economy as laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon."
"My conception of the social market economy is rather different - it would not include decentralised wage negotiations, quite the opposite, in fact."
"Decentralised wage negotiation systems are contrary to a wage policy based on solidarity and rather than leading to the gap between rich and poor getting smaller, they will - on the contrary - result in it getting bigger."
"In other words, we should do the opposite."
"I would therefore like to expressly repeat what my colleague, Mrs Steinruck, said - we cannot repeat it often enough: we must take more action to tackle the cause of the crisis; make those who caused the crisis pay to a greater extent; and focus on them for the resolution of these problems, including by means of legislative measures."
"(RO) Mr President, in reference to the alignment of unit costs with labour and levels of productivity, I think that we ought to focus on the framework conditions and less on indicators."
"It is not obvious that we can achieve this alignment."
"Productivity depends primarily on factors such as accumulated capital stock, which is very different."
"The clear disparity can be seen between Romania and Germany."
"This is due to the difference in quality of economic policies over time."
"Indeed, such discrepancies cannot be made up overnight."
"My country has made efforts towards reforming pensions and social assistance."
"I would therefore like to suggest including some provisions of this kind in the competitiveness pact."
"I support the need for a correlation between the retirement age and demographic trends."
"The impact which a coherent, realistic pensions policy has on public finances needs to be taken into consideration."
"(RO) Mr President, I understand very well the subsidiarity principle, but I believe that pensions have ceased to be a national concern as they are the subject today of an EU-level debate."
"We are discussing pension systems which are unsustainable as a consequence of common challenges such as the financial crisis, as well as of an ageing population and declining birth rate."
"The principle of intergenerational solidarity is at risk of becoming obsolete, with citizens being forced to contribute to private pensions."
"However, what happens to those who no longer have enough time to contribute to such pensions?"
"European citizens also depend on public pensions."
"In Romania, the gross national minimum wage is approximately EUR 160."
"This is why I believe that investing in private pensions or saving is just pure fantasy."
"I think that the European Commission needs to be more involved by proposing both a minimum EU salary and pension level."
"A first step towards this could be to carry out a comparative pension system analysis."
"(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, we are here to talk about salaries and proposals on the age of retirement."
"These proposals are downright unfair, to say the very least."
"They are unfair as they insist upon routes that have already been proven, more than once, to end in failure."
"What is happening in Ireland, Greece, Portugal, Spain, Italy, and who knows in how many other countries as the list is endless, is different in each of these countries, but they have certain things in common."
"One of the things that we have in common is an unprecedented transfer of the value of work to financial capital."
"We cannot accept this."
"The other thing that we have in common is that it is the workers, retired people and pensioners who are paying for this crisis, along with a generation of workers in unstable jobs who do not have any guarantees in the society in which they live."
"I should therefore like to finish by saying, Mr President and Commissioner, that we cannot continue to condemn people to poverty."
"I sincerely hope ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(FI) Mr President, a growing European trend at present is rightwing populism, whose core ingredient is opposition to the EU."
"Where are these antiEU feelings coming from?"
"They spring from the fact that a social Europe is becoming overshadowed by a 'market Europe'."
"All the Commission's proposals today attack either the pay or the pension system."
"The feeling is that pay flexibility might help in some way."
"It will not: on the contrary, it will result in deflation."
"It is very important that all legislation is bound by a permanent social clause, so that the idea of a social Europe will once again come to the fore."
"It is important to realise that retirement ages will rise if there are improvements in working life, but they cannot be raised through legislation from above."
"(LV) Mr President, unfortunately, Ireland is not the only country, and Greece is not the only country either."
"Latvia was perhaps the first to undergo all this hardship, which was caused by the activities of the banks."
"The minimum wage has been reduced in Latvia, and it is lower than the subsistence level."
"Pensions have been reduced, along with the minimum tax-free amount."
"The people are protesting."
"Over this period, Latvia has lost one fifth of its population; one fifth has emigrated and is working abroad."
"The International Monetary Fund, which is supposedly rescuing Latvia, set conditions that are draconian."
"It permitted money to be used to save the banks, a little money to be left over for the next potential bank rescue, but did not permit ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to express my support for Mr De Rossa."
"The recommendations made to Ireland by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) unfortunately reflect a tendency prevalent among our policy makers at the highest level, which is to make European workers pay for a crisis that is not of their making."
"Another example is the Commission's annual growth analysis, which recommends raising the legal retirement age by linking it to life expectancy."
"Parliament recently expressed its disapproval on this subject in its report on the Green Paper on pensions."
"A further example is the proposed competitiveness pact calling for the abolition of inflation indexation of wages, including in my own country, Belgium."
"Faced with this situation, I welcome the involvement of the trade unions, yesterday in Hungary, for example, or in Brussels on 29 September."
"It is time our Commissioners heeded the message of European workers if they do not wish to widen the gap between themselves and the citizens, who will believe less and less in the European project."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank everybody for their contributions."
"I can promise you that we give serious consideration to each of them."
"Let me first say a few words about the importance and relevance of social dialogue."
"We fully recognise the importance of social dialogue and constructive industrial relations."
"We have continuously engaged with the social partners, both at EU level and in individual countries."
"For instance, Commissioner Rehn personally met with Ireland's trade union leaders in early November, as did officials from the Commission, the ECB and the IMF when negotiating the programme in late November."
"They will continue to engage on the next mission in April and on subsequent occasions."
"By the way, contrary to some allegations, the Commission did not force Ireland to cut the minimum wage or social expenditure."
"These measures were already presented by the former Irish Government itself in its national recovery plan, together with other fiscal and structural measures aiming at economic stability, growth and job creation."
"The legal basis of the economic policy conditions is Article 3(5) of Council Regulation (EU) No 407/2010 establishing a European financial stabilisation mechanism and Article 2(2) of the Council Implementing Decision 2011/77/EU on granting Union financial assistance to Ireland."
"Once again, both are grounded in Article 122(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
"The mere fact that the Memorandum of Understanding's specific economic policy conditions touch upon various issues that are linked to social policy does not put into question the legal basis of the act."
"There appears to be no contradiction with Article 152 or Article 153(5)."
"Article 152 is a general provision which does not exclude the possible need for specific measures with social consequences."
"Moreover, that provision does not create subjective rights for the social partners."
"Article 153(5) is a limit as regards the content of the measures that can be adopted under Article 153, i.e. social policy."
"Since the MoU is not adopted on the basis of Article 153, this limit does not apply."
"The provisions of Title 10, social policy, cannot be disregarded."
"They have to be taken into account, but it does not mean that as a consequence of Article 153(5), no measures having an effect on pay can be adopted on the basis of Article 122."
"The measures adopted on the basis of Article 122 for Ireland do not regulate issues."
"They provide for conditions linked to the granting of Union assistance."
"This is explicitly allowed by Article 122(2)."
"Therefore, there is no legal problem as regards the principle of conferral."
"More generally, the issue of economic policy conditions is not about EU competences in the field of social policy or wages."
"The conditions included in the programme cover a wide range of policy areas, and for most of them, the competence lies with the Member State."
"The economic policy conditions of the programme are Member State commitments agreed with the EU and the IMF on the measures that the Member States will undertake in exchange for EU/IMF financing."
"As a final note, the Commission fully acknowledged that any financial assistance programme naturally has social consequences."
"However, the main goal of the specific economic policy conditions attached to such a programme is to avoid much graver social consequences by setting the country back on the path of sustained growth and job creation."
"Mr President, I would have to ask your assistance to identify when a Commissioner stands here in this Parliament and says, on the one hand, that Ireland is not being forced to reduce its minimum wage or to reduce its social protection and then goes on to say that the agreement is a conditionality; that these are conditionalities for receiving aid - is that not a fundamental contradiction and a misleading ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Excuse me, Mr De Rossa, you know that I have great respect and fondness for you, but we cannot reopen the debate."
"Your opinion should be respected, as should that of the Commissioner on the matter, and each of us has to deal with any contradictions that may arise."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"According to Eurostat, in January 2011, the minimum monthly income varied between EUR 123 in Bulgaria, EUR 157 in Romania and EUR 1 758 in Luxembourg."
"In 20 of the 27 Member States, the minimum income is set by law or by national inter-sector agreement."
"In 11 Member States, the minimum income is between EUR 100 and 400/month, in 5 Member States, it is between EUR 550 and 950/month, and in 6 Member States, it is more than EUR 1 100/month."
"The development and consolidation of the internal market provide businesses with access to Europe's 500 million plus consumers."
"However, maintaining the disparity in minimum income levels between Member States is a barrier preventing both European companies from having access to European consumers and the latter from having access to high quality products and services."
"I regard social dialogue as being particularly important in terms of ensuring social fairness and a decent standard of living for all European citizens."
"We call on the Commission and Member States to guarantee equal pay for equal work in the internal labour market, the lifting of barriers preventing the free movement of workers and the examination of the possibility of providing a minimum salary agreed by law or based on collective negotiation, which will guarantee European citizens a decent standard of living."
"Prevention of natural and man-made disasters (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on the prevention of natural and man-made disasters by João Ferreira, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety - B7-0201/2011)."
"Mr President, Commissioner, two years has passed since the Commission launched a communication in February 2009 on a Community approach to the prevention of natural and man-made disasters."
"The importance of this issue was outlined."
"Since then, various disasters have hit Europe and have had severely negative consequences for the public, the land, the economy and the environment."
"In general terms, the Commission's communication followed a proper approach, albeit an inadequate one, as was considered by Parliament."
"In addition, the Commission is delaying in implementing the commitments it assumed in this communication."
"One example of this is its commitment to draw up a list of preventative measures to be funded by the European Union and implemented by the Member States."
"Two years later, and where is this list?"
"Is the Commission going to wait for the next multiannual financial framework before presenting it?"
"Another two years from now?"
"Meanwhile, in September of last year, Parliament adopted a report on this very matter."
"This report puts forward a set of important recommendations."
"It is important to say that this report was preceded by a much wider debate, not only here in Parliament, but also with a wide range of national, regional and local entities, operating in different phases of disaster management."
"The report also gathered a lot of experience of these catastrophes with the people who were affected by disasters over the last year."
"Here, I would like to mention a few of the specific points of the report, from the many that it contains."
"A range of actions were defined as targets for special support to the Member States, with a view to remedying situations of risk in areas such as forest management, the protection and defence of the coastline, restoring and protecting river basins, the protection and remodelling of populated areas which are particularly vulnerable to certain types of catastrophes and the maintenance of farming activities in the areas affected by depopulation and which are at risk of natural disasters."
"How has the Commission included, or how is it thinking of including, these areas in the list of measures to be drawn up?"
"The report also proposes the creation of public agricultural insurance in Europe and the institution of a system of minimum compensation to farmers affected by disasters."
"I notice that this is very different from the current possibility that the Member States will subsidise insurance internally, with the CAP Health Check."
"What is proposed is insurance financed by Community funds on an equal footing as regards protection against disasters, for all farmers, whether they are from the Member States most in need, or whether they are from rich countries."
"As we know, disasters are deeply unfair, and they almost always have the greatest effect on those who are least able to protect themselves, be they people or countries."
"If there is one area in which the tangible expression of EU solidarity and the principle of cohesion must be ensured, it is in the protection of the public, the economy and the environment, in the face of disasters."
"I would therefore like to ask here what the Commission is going to do to reduce the existing imbalances between the regions and the Member States in this area, in other words, helping to improve prevention in regions and Member States with a greater exposure to risk and lower economic capacity."
"Another area covered in the report is strengthening early warning systems in the Member States and establishing connections between the various early warning systems."
"Which steps have already been taken in this area?"
"Which steps will they take next?"
"Finally, it is worth recalling that following on from prevention, and bearing in mind the experience gained during recent disasters, it is becoming imperative to revise the regulations for the Solidarity Fund to allow for a more flexible and timely mobilisation of this instrument."
"What has the Commission already done, or what is it going to do, for this review?"
"I recall that a year ago, Madeira was struck by a major disaster which resulted in fatalities and high levels of material damage to strategic infrastructures and basic equipment."
"It is now one year later, and Madeira has still not received a single cent of aid at all from the EU."
"What will the Commission do to change this situation, when the regulation of the Solidarity Fund currently says that 'it should help to quickly restore normal living conditions, and it should act swiftly and efficiently to help, as quickly as possible, in mobilising emergency services'?"
"Where is this speed when, one year later, Madeira has still not received a single cent in aid from the EU?"
"To conclude, Mr President, once again I urge the Commission to take the broad consensus that this report attracted, when it was voted upon and discussed, as a clear sign that these recommendations, the recommendations contained in this report, are to be put into practice."
"Many of these recommendations were already contained in previous Parliament resolutions, but unfortunately nothing was done and the Commission bears particular responsibility for this delay."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I wish to thank Parliament for the opportunity to exchange views on disaster prevention, and Mr Ferreira in particular for his continued interest in the subject."
"The disasters of last year were a salutary reminder that the EU and its Member States need to step up work on disaster prevention."
"We need to be ambitious."
"We all know that investing in disaster prevention pays off."
"At the same time, ensuring cost-effective and increased investment in disaster prevention is a challenge."
"We are now assessing the effectiveness of existing EU financing instruments."
"We are also developing a catalogue of prevention measures that would be considered by Member States for EU funding."
"Our objective is to increase the impact of EU funding and to accelerate the implementation of Regional Fund support."
"We are also looking at innovative financing instruments, such as insurance pooling to share risks."
"Effective investments in disaster prevention will help to save lives, limit damages and, ultimately, save money."
"Actions are also under way to improve our knowledge of disasters."
"We have worked with the European Environment Agency on a report assessing the frequency of disasters in Europe and their impact on humans, the economies and ecosystems."
"We also need clear and transparent assessments of the risks we face."
"On 21 December last year, we issued a guidance paper on national risk assessment and mapping to encourage Member States in fostering a comprehensive risk-management culture."
"Developing fully-fledged risk management policies will require the involvement of all actors."
"The increased frequency and intensity of disasters in Europe should also provide further incentives for Member States to invest in preparedness and build up their capacity."
"Besides the prevention elements, it is equally important that Member States, and Europe as a whole, are able to provide the best possible response."
"In October last year, we outlined our policy proposal for a European disaster-response capacity."
"Our objective is to improve the efficiency, the coherence and the visibility of the EU's response to disasters."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, solidarity is the right word to start with."
"When disasters happen - be they man-made or natural - we must stand together in Europe."
"That is central to European integration."
"The second keyword that we must mention here is speed."
"It is important to provide help quickly, because rapid assistance is the most effective form of assistance."
"Thirdly, however, I must point out that it is, first and foremost, the Member States that are responsible for protecting the population, where possible, from such disasters."
"We must examine how we can use European resources and also the funds that are available to us in a more efficient and more effective way."
"However, I should point out that many Member States call for European resources in order to conceal the fact that they are taking inadequate measures themselves."
"What can we do at EU level?"
"We have two major expense items: firstly, the European Regional Development Fund for which Commissioner Hahn is responsible, and secondly, the Agricultural Fund, in which regard we could make better use of the funds that are already available."
"Prevention is key. That is to say, very many disasters, flooding in particular, could be prevented by means of proper spatial planning."
"We already have a Floods Directive, in connection with which it was clear that we could actually achieve a great deal with our existing resources if we took the right measures - such as mapping, risk assessment and, as a third measure, the creation of preventative action plans."
"I would like the Commission, in addition to the prevention measures that it has drawn up, to look, in particular, at the areas of droughts and water shortages."
"In these areas, we still lack an instrument like the Floods Directive, and we could do a great deal here."
"With regard to the catalogue of prevention measures itself, I have to say that mainstreaming is surely crucial in this regard; in other words, that we try to take these aspects into account in other policy areas."
"Under the supervision of the Commission, the Member States must also draw up risk maps for all areas."
"Mr President, this is a recurring debate in Parliament."
"Unfortunately, natural or man-made disasters are becoming increasingly frequent and devastating."
"Although responsibility for disaster prevention lies primarily with the Member States, the European Union can make an important contribution."
"There are certain Community instruments to support this disaster prevention activity."
"However, it is important that those instruments are evaluated so that we can better identify the gaps."
"Moreover, the funding mechanisms also need to be improved."
"It has already been mentioned here, but I should like to reiterate that in the case of Madeira, there has not yet been any promise of aid, and it is clear that the victims of this catastrophe cannot remain waiting forever."
"The Commission was also asked several times to draw up Community guidelines for risk mapping."
"I should also like to highlight the importance of carrying out a complete inventory of the sources of information because it is only possible to proceed in an appropriate way if there is accurate information."
"Some of the suggestions and proposals presented in the Ferreira report were contained in my report, which was adopted by Parliament in 2006, and the Commission has not yet given a response to many of these proposals."
"I should therefore like to ask the Commissioner whether he can report on the work done so far in connection with the creation of the European Drought Observatory, and also about the directive on forest fires."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, summers are hotter and storms are more severe."
"Rainfall is more erratic and we have more droughts causing life-threatening fires across our continent."
"Hardly a country has escaped a natural disaster in the last few years and this is not counting the man-made catastrophes such as Chernobyl and, more recently, the toxic dam in Hungary."
"Citizens look to their elected representatives to ensure the planning for their protection is efficient and reliable and in place."
"We have had many promises and reports from the Commission, yet little concrete action has been forthcoming."
"We have been promised progress in setting up a network of competent national services in Member States."
"A map of assets, that is readily available and ready to use when disaster strikes, was promised in 2009."
"National authorities should now be requested to put core equipment on standby, available for rapid European assistance when needed."
"In my own region, we have in Bracknell the world-renowned medium-range weather forecasting centre."
"Its information assists mariners, aircraft and emergency planners from a range of real-time sources around the world, but we need more than these sorts of facilities."
"We need to know where the trained emergency service teams are."
"We need to know where the emergency food supplies, the tents and the blankets are."
"We need to know where the facilities are that will save the lives of citizens of our Union when they need them."
"The Commission must come forward with these plans now."
"Tomorrow's disaster may be just around the corner."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by saying that I completely support what my fellow Member has said."
"The prevention of natural and man-made disasters is of enormous and increasing importance, and the Commission is systematically presenting us with a number of aims for procedure and timing."
"However, there is a very complicated problem, which I have already mentioned."
"The Solidarity Fund is the instrument which normally responds to these situations, but it does so after a very, very long period, from nine months to a year, and this is after a disaster."
"As has already been mentioned, and I shall continue to repeat this as we shall continue to repeat this for as long as it takes, in the case of Madeira, there was a massive disaster there a year ago, and it has still not received any aid."
"I should therefore like to stress this question anew: is it not time for the Commission to review the procedure for its own fund and funding model?"
"How can we maintain a fund to deal with increasingly drastic exceptional situations?"
"We do not know where it will happen, but we know that it will happen, and climate change is there to prove it."
"Therefore, the exception can never apply to a situation that occurs on a regular basis."
"Mr President, there is much room for improvement regarding current mechanisms for preventing natural and man-made disasters."
"Whereas in the case of preventive measures taken against natural disasters, we must try especially to improve systems for monitoring natural phenomena - be they changes in the weather or tectonic shifts - and then to improve the mathematical models for evaluating and forecasting changes, their consequences and the related warning mechanisms or subsequent evacuation, in the area of man-made disasters, we can work much more effectively."
"As we are aware of the risks of different human activities, especially commercial activities that threaten the environment, we know how to reduce in a preventive manner the risk of a possible disaster arising from the performance of any kind of risk-prone activity through good regulatory measures."
"A preventative regulatory framework, however, just like systems for supervision, inspection, sanctions and repression, must be comprehensive and must be implemented with complete thoroughness and emphasis."
"In the interests of protecting the health and lives of our citizens, we must therefore work systematically to improve these mechanisms for protecting against disasters."
"(FI) Mr President, we can endorse what has been said here."
"Disasters have just continued to increase in number."
"The EU could really do a lot about this: exchange of information, support and solidarity."
"Here, of course, one gains added value, which is only to be expected of the Union as far as these issues are concerned."
"I myself, however, would like to take advantage of this opportunity and ask the Commissioner a question."
"Three to four years ago, there was a huge forest fire in Russia, resulting in massive smoke damage in my own country, Finland."
"Many people actually suffered serious health problems caused by this smoke."
"At the time, the European Parliament here decided to call on the Commission to negotiate an agreement with Russia on how the EU could come to its assistance in such cases and provide the necessary help, which Russia then needed but which it did not agree to accept."
"I would like to know if the Commission has made any headway in this matter and implemented measures."
"Disasters are not merely confined to the EU: they also occur beyond our borders, and they often have an impact on the EU's Member States."
"I would like to know what progress has been made with Russia on this."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, over the past 15 years, the number of natural and man-made disasters has increased significantly and we see phenomena that are more severe and more frequent in almost all European Union countries with serious consequences for the economy, infrastructure and ecosystems."
"We need an urgent EU approach to develop preventive policies and to identify and adapt the relevant financial instruments."
"The European Union Solidarity Fund and national funds are no longer able to cope with frequent disasters."
"I would ask the Commissioner who is present when will it be possible to provide data and a map of areas at risk, as announced in his communication of 23 February 2009?"
"I regret, finally, that the Soil Directive for the improvement of land management has been blocked for some time in the Council."
"(RO) Mr President, after the ecological disaster in Hungary last October, I drew the European Commission's attention on more than one occasion to the issue of disaster prevention in the mining industry."
"In the case of the mining sector, accidents can often have a cross-border impact."
"This is all the more reason why the European Union has a duty to ensure that every possible measure is taken to reduce the risk of accidents and to improve the speed and efficiency of the response when these accidents, nevertheless, occur."
"I received confirmation from the Commission, in response to my questions, that the waste discharged into the environment from the accident in Hungary, including into the Danube, was actually toxic, even though this had initially been denied by the authorities."
"This is a perfectly clear example of regulations which are not being applied, a situation which must change as quickly as possible."
"It is the European Commission's duty to take urgent action in the wake of the resolution adopted last year by Parliament, calling for a ban on the use of cyanide-based technologies in mining as they pose huge cross-border threats to ecosystems."
"(RO) Mr President, the report on the Community approach to the prevention of natural and man-made disasters, approved in September 2010, contains a few important references targeted directly at agriculture."
"The report makes particular mention of the fact that agricultural production is vulnerable to climate phenomena such as drought, frost, hail, forest fires, floods, landslides and others. The report also contains a number of important suggestions aimed at mitigating the impact of these problems."
"The author has already mentioned the idea of providing some assurances for agriculture."
"I would like to highlight the importance of tackling these challenges effectively, especially in the context of a future common agricultural policy whose aim is for agriculture to play both a role in food production and a major role in environmental protection."
"(HU) Mr President, last October, Hungary received expert assistance and material resources to deal with the damage caused by the red sludge disaster, yet no substantive assistance was provided."
"It was extremely difficult to explain to people why humanitarian assistance can be provided to citizens of countries outside of the EU, but not to EU Member States."
"It is obvious that the 'polluter pays' principle must be applied in the event of industrial disasters, but in most of these cases, these companies do not have enough money."
"The Commission promised to make environmental liability insurance mandatory for all companies engaged in hazardous activities."
"At the same time, I propose that - with adequate regulation - the Solidarity Fund should be opened up to the partial alleviation of industrial catastrophes, I emphasise, partial ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(DE) Mr President, the concept of disaster prevention, particularly where our Hungarian friends are concerned, clearly deserves a great deal of attention because something went wrong when dealing with the toxic sludge disaster in Hungary last October."
"In its report, the Commission found there to be clear failings on the part of the local authorities, which failed to classify the hazardous wastewater and made major errors in connection with construction work on the reservoir."
"The Commission also found that the European Waste Catalogue - the Mining Waste Directives - had not been transposed into Hungarian law."
"It is therefore important for the individual Member States to incorporate European standards into their legal standards in a binding manner."
"In addition to disaster prevention, the proper application of these European standards is also important, as is the exchange of best practice and helping the Member States to help themselves."
"Particularly during this Year of Volunteering, it is important and right for the Member States to go some way towards modelling themselves on the example of those Member States that have nationwide voluntary fire brigades, rescue services, etc."
"(RO) Mr President, one of the biggest challenges currently facing the European Union is the increase in the severity and repercussions of natural disasters."
"The statistics indicate that, in the last 20 years, 953 disasters have occurred in Europe, causing almost 90 000 deaths and economic losses amounting to USD 269 billion."
"To be able to counter the effects caused by these phenomena, a risk chart is required, along with a coherent plan for managing environmental factors."
"The preservation and extension of forested areas, as well as green belts in urban environments, must be a priority for all of us."
"It is vital for us to give the importance that is due to the activities of informing and educating the general public with the aim of preventing the repercussions of disasters."
"The International Day for Natural Disaster Reduction is a good example of this."
"I also think that all the instruments need to be made more effective ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(PT) Mr President, the concerns raised here with regard to preventing and responding to disasters is a matter of great sensitivity and of the utmost importance for our people, who cannot and should not be made to wait."
"We are talking about very sensitive situations that deal with the safety of people and their property, and that often touch us all because of the loss of lives, the destruction of families, and the devastation of whole livelihoods."
"However, all our demonstrations matter little when compared with the tragedies, which, through the media, affect us all, and make us aware that we cannot fall behind with the work we should be doing to avoid, minimise or, better assist these situations."
"Commissioner, my fellow Members have highlighted this matter very well."
"This is a case where the EU can better show the public that it is there, to help them prevent disasters and, above all, to offer its support when they most need it and are at their most fragile, if they do occur."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner Hahn, we are very well aware of the factors that have led to an increase in the number of disasters in recent years: we know about climate change, the explosive industrialisation in developing countries and the growing world population, among other things."
"However, it is also the case that many disasters are simply caused by man, and in this regard, we have to say that the 'polluter pays' principle should be applied."
"To always immediately call for help from the Union is the wrong way to go."
"However, European solidarity is indeed called for, of course, where disasters genuinely occur as a result of force majeure, when genuine natural disasters happen."
"In this regard, there is no doubt that our European solidarity should start with prevention - for example, in connection with protective structures to prevent avalanches, flood defences, mapping and monitoring systems."
"In addition, we really should have something like a European 'disaster service' that can be deployed if assistance is needed very quickly in order to avoid the severest of consequences."
"Mr President, there is much talk about buzz words here today, but the key buzz word is the first word up on the board: prevention."
"As the old adage says, 'prevention is better than cure' and certainly we have to try and prevent natural disasters based on recent trends, to get out some kind of a forecast and to put preventive actions in place."
"We also need some type of a trans-European insurance mechanism, because otherwise, affected areas will not be able to afford insurance."
"For instance, in my own area, in the town of Clonmel, insurance has gone up sixfold because of the risk of flooding."
"Finally, I want to ask how many countries can actually say that they have complied with the Commission's recommendations, especially in relation to the Floods Directive?"
"I know it has not been applied properly in my country."
"Countries have to take responsibility just the same as the Commission."
"By working together, we can at least alleviate the difficulties."
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, we all draw one certain conclusion from the massive, catastrophic forest fires which, nearly every summer, hit the Member States in southern Europe and of which Greece has terrifying and traumatising experience: the key word in dealing promptly and efficiently with natural and man-made disasters in Europe is 'solidarity'."
"Moreover, the Treaty of Lisbon has introduced a solidarity clause for the provision of assistance to Member States suffering the consequences of natural disasters."
"We need to prepare for the proper and effective application of this clause."
"Otherwise, it will be as if we are ignoring the 70% of European citizens who stand to benefit from assistance for which the European Union has made provision if their country faces a natural disaster."
"It is important not to let budgetary pressures affect policy and funding for citizens in relation to disaster prevention."
"It is also important ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, firstly, I would like to thank everyone for their wide-ranging contributions to the debate."
"Wherever a direct appeal has been made to the competence of my colleague, Mrs Georgieva, we will provide you with written answers, for example, with regard to the status of talks and negotiations with Russia on the question of information and monitoring."
"However, I would like to take this opportunity - since the European Solidarity Fund falls within my remit - to tell you that this Fund is an instrument that was created seven or eight years ago and that is not financed from the budget."
"Whenever a disaster occurs, a very complex procedure has to be followed - firstly, there is an assessment and then there is also the codecision of the European Parliament and the Council - which can result in delays."
"In the specific case of Madeira, I can tell you that within the next 14 days, we will get a signature and payment."
"The delay was also caused by the fact that the Member State was very late in providing a lot of the necessary information."
"This also needs to be taken into account."
"At the end of the day, we also need to be able to demonstrate, and it must also be possible to verify, what the funds have actually been used for."
"Nevertheless, the structure of the Solidarity Fund should also continue to be developed."
"Discussions to this effect are also ongoing within the Commission."
"The issue of drought assessment is - quite frankly - relatively difficult to incorporate."
"The situation is different with regard to technological disasters, for example."
"These issues need to be reassessed in the light of the experience we have gained in recent years."
"As regards the funds provided in the area of the structural funds for example, a total of EUR 7.5 billion is available Europe-wide in the current financial period for risk prevention and corresponding environmental protection measures."
"Of this, around 20% has already been allocated to specific projects."
"As MEPs for an electoral district or Land, you know as well as I do that administrative problems often arise between regions and Member States because it is not clear who is responsible for what."
"In practice, that often results in delays in the implementation of projects."
"Overcoming these problems would be an important achievement, because it is in the interests of the people and the regions for us to actually use the money that has been made available and not to founder on account of administrative or bureaucratic problems or to allow these problems to cause delays."
"Finally, I would like to say that we actually intend to put forward a legislative proposal at the end of the year for how we can take a more focused approach with regard to the way we monitor and respond to disasters throughout Europe."
"I would like to thank you once again for your commitment and persistence on this matter and I would like to ask you also to continue - and I will finish by saying this - to pay such a high level of attention to implementation and to utilising the financial resources that are, in principle, available in the Member States."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"In its communication of 23 February 2009 entitled 'A Community approach on the prevention of natural and man-made disasters', the Commission, amongst other things, undertook the task of correlating available and existing information sources on preventive measures and catastrophes."
"I would like to take this opportunity to note that the way the New Zealand Government handled the notification of those who are deaf and hard of hearing during its most recent catastrophe is an inspiring example that must be put into practice."
"At the end of 2010, the government of New Zealand published several resource materials, as well as a DVD, which prepared the affected players, the authorities and the population using sign language for a potential catastrophe."
"This practice saved lives as well as property."
"According to local civil organisations and the World Federation of the Deaf (www.wfdeaf.org), the government of Queensland and the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) should be proud - in spite of the tragedies which, regrettably, still occurred - of the success achieved by their excellent preparation and cooperation, and particularly of providing live and immediate communication that reached the deaf."
"In light of this, I hope that the Commission will review the good practice of this non-EU Member State and popularise and promote its implementation in Member States, as well as within the scope of the application of EU resources."
"Volcanic ash crisis (debate)"
"The next item is the debate:"
"on the oral question to the Commission on the volcanic ash crisis, by Marian-Jean Marinescu and Mathieu Grosch, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) - B7-0015/2011);"
"on the oral question to the Commission on the volcanic ash crisis, by Saïd El Khadraoui, on behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament - B7-0204/2011);"
"on the oral question to the Commission on the volcanic ash crisis, by Gesine Meissner, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe - B7-0202/2011); and"
"on the oral question to the Commission on the volcanic ash crisis, by Roberts Zīle, on behalf of the Group of European Conservatives and Reformists - B7-0203/2011)."
"Mr President, the volcanic eruption last April resulted in the closure of many sectors of European air space."
"The crisis that ensued affected more than 10 million travellers and had serious economic repercussions."
"The resolution of the volcanic ash crisis left a lot to be desired due to the lack of coordination between institutions, the lack of specifications and flexibility, not to mention failure to make optimum use of the technical resources."
"I said it then and I continue to maintain that it is of paramount importance for the necessary measures to be taken so that we can ensure that a new volcanic eruption will not have the same consequences."
"Responsibility for flight safety, which includes avoiding areas contaminated by ash, must lie with the operator and crew."
"Operators must be supplied with accurate data so that they can implement the best solutions."
"Pilots are trained to cope with exceptional air conditions and have the experience required to evaluate the risk and make decisions about redirecting the flight."
"The following elements are required to make this process operate as efficiently as possible: supervision and forecasting must be improved and more money must be invested in equipment on the ground and in the air."
"The technical structure must be able to supply accurate data in real time and constant forecasts, which can be provided by current technology."
"The use of several centres for collecting and supplying this information will improve the risk evaluation and relevant flight scheduling."
"The role of crisis management institutions must be clarified to ensure that operators receive this information which they need for making decisions."
"The regulatory body must be responsible for supervision, while Volcanic Ash Advisory Centres are responsible for notifying air navigation service providers about eruptions and high-risk areas."
"Service providers must inform air crews about the areas at high risk of ash contamination."
"The parties involved must be trained in effective crisis management using simulation exercises."
"I think that it is an absolute requirement for EASA to draw up the specifications required to clarify responsibilities and control at operational level."
"Achieving the Single European Sky and implementing SESAR would facilitate enormously the decision-making process and would reduce significantly the impact in the event of a crisis."
"I believe that these are the key points which need to be resolved so that we can ensure that we are prepared to manage such a situation successfully in the future."
"author. - Mr President, I welcome the opportunity that this oral question gives us to revisit the problems experienced by travellers and the wider aviation industry during last year's Icelandic volcano crisis."
"What became clear last year was that Member States and the EU as a whole had no plan for such an eventuality, the data used was incomplete, the meteorologists could not or, indeed, would not help, and everybody perfected the art of blaming someone else and adopted a policy of risk aversion rather than one of risk management."
"To be frank, Mr President, Member States bottled it last year."
"But, Mr President, that was then."
"What about the future?"
"Do we have a comprehensive plan to cover the next volcanic eruption?"
"Should this happen, will Member States coordinate at EU level in future?"
"Crucially, will they involve the aviation industry and, particularly, airlines before they issue their advice?"
"We have to avoid the mistakes made last year which gave us the nonsense of one country closing its airspace whilst a neighbouring country kept theirs open, leading to chaos, confusion and huge economic consequences."
"Finally Mr President, the Icelandic volcano highlighted one major thing: it has strengthened the argument for a Single European Sky better than any politician could have done."
"Our role now is to develop and deliver this as a matter of urgency, even though, as usual, the Member States are back to their old habits of dragging their feet on this much-needed project."
"Mr President, we have just spoken about natural disasters in the previous agenda item."
"In this case, it was a force of nature that brought air traffic to a complete standstill."
"Eyjafjallajökull - everyone probably knows of this volcano now - erupted last year and brought a large proportion of air traffic to a complete standstill."
"Incidentally, I just noticed once again during the previous speech that we have an excellent chair of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, because what he said is very similar to what I wanted to say."
"I will now try to change my speech somewhat."
"It was indeed chaos - Mr Simpson has already said that."
"As Europeans, with high-tech capabilities and with so much already coordinated, we were, in fact, helpless when it came to dealing with this disaster and finding solutions to it."
"We realised that there were too few agreements in place."
"We then set up a task force."
"The questions that concerned us with regard to this issue were whether the task force actually has any valid results already that could be discussed and has it published any studies?"
"I do not know of any at least."
"Have all of the international experts on such volcanic eruptions actually been consulted?"
"After all, as we already discussed here in plenary last year, there are other parts of the world where volcanic eruptions are much more frequent than in Europe and they somehow manage to have up-to-date data and to coordinate the whole situation."
"There is also something else that causes me concern."
"On 4 May, it was also mentioned in the Council of transport ministers that we need a linked-up European transport system."
"That can, of course, help in such cases."
"How far have we come in terms of being able to respond better in the event of a further volcanic eruption?"
"We cannot predict this, of course."
"It will just happen."
"I have one further question: do we know exactly what technology we would need to be able to deal with this situation better?"
"In Germany, we now have appropriate devices at all weather stations that collect the data and are able to pass on this up-to-date data very quickly to the people responsible at the airlines and also to pilots so that they can decide whether or not it is safe to fly."
"One further point which has not been mentioned yet but which I think is important in this context is the following: this ash crisis, and the subsequent problems it posed for the air transport industry, affected 10 million passengers and, of course, also many companies."
"Some passengers were stranded and were unable to continue their journeys."
"The question therefore arises as to how things stand with regard to passengers' rights."
"We have rights for air passengers, but I have the impression that, in this case, they have not always been fully utilised."
"Perhaps we should also revise these passenger rights once more."
"There are a lot of questions here."
"Mr Hahn, I do not know whether you will be able to answer them now, as transport is not actually your area."
"Otherwise, I am sure that the questions I raised in addition to the written question can be answered later."
"You will notice that this subject is of great concern to us."
"After all, the air transport industry is very important, and we therefore need a Single European Sky."
"Mr President, I should not so much like to repeat what Members have said, but why are we, in fact, asking this question?"
"Nearly a year has gone by since these events, and it is possible that they will simply be forgotten."
"Nevertheless, we wanted to ensure that this issue was still important to the Commission and we await the Commissioner's action on these promised issues as a lesson from last year's volcanic eruption."
"In effect, it proved that the aviation market is possibly the European Union's domestic market to an extent unlike no other mode of transport across Europe."
"That, in turn, means that taking decisions, as well as their preparation, possibly requires a process that differs from that required for other modes of transport."
"It is a question of the absence of these data and the non-participation of the operators in the decision-making process, as well as of the fact that the decision is taken at Member State level."
"In principle, of course, this has its basis in law."
"However, even though I belong to a political group that always supports the principle of subsidiarity, on this occasion, I think that, taking into account the actual situation last year, we ought to consider on the basis of this example whether decisions should not be taken at European level to a greater extent."
"Passengers are also concerned that different airlines behave differently towards passengers, and to always obtain compensation from these airlines through the courts is not the easiest thing."
"Clearly, we should not have a situation where different airlines can emerge from this crisis in different ways, with different costs."
"Finally, the third point I should like to stress is the lesson that can be drawn from this crisis, namely, that in the European Union, various 'islands' exist, as it were, that are not connected by different modes of transport to other European Union Member States."
"This means that when planning the TEN-T map this year and the TEN-T budget for the next financial perspective, as well as the cohesion policy budget, we should allow for investment in other modes of transport, so that we can connect these 'islands' to the rest of the European Union. Thank you."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the Eyjafjallajökull eruption in Iceland in April 2010 had an enormous impact which required the EU to act urgently."
"The Commission therefore proposed immediate actions to coordinate the EU's position and to strengthen the regulatory framework."
"This makes Europe a stronger partner at a global level."
"The Commission is actively engaged in practical work to refine the existing volcanic ash avoidance methodologies in aviation."
"For example, the Commission has launched a specific call under the Seventh Framework Programme called 'Technology support for crisis coordination for the air transport system following major disrupting events'."
"In parallel, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) is preparing rules for air-worthiness requirements and risk assessment for safe flight in airspace with volcanic contaminants."
"From an operational perspective, an approach has been developed in close cooperation with the EASA."
"This approach reflects practices in other parts of the world."
"The guiding principles are as follows: first, the airline is responsible for the safety of its operations."
"Before operating in airspace contaminated by volcanic ash, the airline must produce a safety risk assessment and have it accepted by its supervising authority."
"This process must be repeated when important changes occur."
"Second, the airline must show that the information sources it uses in its safety risk assessment are correct."
"It also has to show its own competence and capability to interpret such data correctly."
"Before starting operations, the airline must obtain from the manufacturers specific information regarding the susceptibility of the aircraft to the effects of airborne ash and the impact of such ash on its airworthiness."
"This must be reflected in the safety risk assessment."
"In dealing with disruptive events such as this, a key element is collaborative decision making between Member States and industry."
"To ensure comprehensive and coordinated actions, the Commission, together with Eurocontrol, established a European Aviation Crisis Coordination Cell, following the Council of Transport Ministers meeting of 4 May 2010."
"Since its creation, the cell has met on several occasions to develop its structures and procedures."
"To test and verify its timely functionality, this cell will be part of a volcano exercise planned for 13 and 14 April 2011 under the auspices of the UN's aviation body, the ICAO."
"The volcanic ash crisis highlighted the crucial importance of the Single European Sky."
"The Commission has therefore accelerated its implementation via, for example, the adoption of the SES Performance Scheme and the associated EU-wide performance targets, the adoption of implementing rules for network management functions, the designation of the network manager, the adoption of implementing rules and guidance material for the functional airspace blocks, the nomination of the former MEP, Mr Georg Jarzembowski, as the functional airspace blocks coordinator and the expected finalisation by April 2011 of the extension of the EASA's competence for safety regulation in the field of air traffic management."
"Let me therefore conclude by saying that the Commission is continuing to work on these very complex and technical issues."
"The Commission is working together with EASA, ICAO, Member States and industry to ensure the safety of European airspace."
"Mr President, Mr Hahn, I naturally consider your response to be the response of the Commission, and I also do not expect you to go into the specific questions put forward by the Committee on Transport and Tourism today."
"One thing was clear: more than 100 000 flights were cancelled and 300 airports and more than 10 million passengers were affected."
"We must learn lessons from such an event."
"That is also the reason for the question that we are raising today, because there was a very quick call for coordination and this was clearly not forthcoming."
"It is not possible to improvise coordinated action in the space of 24 hours."
"These are the questions that we want answers to today, and it is not only Parliament that wants these answers; the citizens of Europe want them, too."
"The first thing we want to know is has the information relating to both the effects and the location of such phenomena improved or not?"
"Secondly, what role will EU bodies play in this regard in future and what powers of decision will they have?"
"Will we continue to have 27 simultaneously existing decisions, or does the Commission already have other proposals, and to what extent will the airlines be involved here?"
"This question has come up very often."
"The Crisis Committee is supposed to meet - it does meet and will also carry out tests."
"It would be extremely important for this Parliament and therefore also for European citizens to be informed of the results of these tests."
"When it comes to coordination, it is important for this to be established outside the EU, too."
"We also need to agree on structures at international level, as the airspace and also certain disasters know no boundaries in this context."
"Another important factor as far as we are concerned is the passengers."
"We talk about 10 million passengers, but these 10 million passengers were not only tourists who had to or were happy to extend their holidays; there were also people who had to get home or had to get somewhere urgently."
"In this case, we cannot simply refer to passengers' rights; rather, we are under obligation to work in a coordinated way and to provide alternatives and greater use of other modes of transport."
"For example, we need a more rapid allocation of rail routes when this is necessary."
"This is also not possible to improvise in the space of 24 hours."
"These are questions that we want to raise on behalf of citizens and passengers, too."
"It is not just a question of explaining their rights."
"Last but not least - and you mentioned this - the airspace blocks, or what are referred to as FABs: the proposal is to have seven instead of 27."
"That could work."
"However, I would simply venture to predict today that we will not manage to do this by 2012, because the Member States do not want it."
"In this regard, we must also send a very clear outward signal that a reduction in the number of airspace blocks is absolutely necessary."
"It can work, too."
"Mr Hahn, I invite you to come to Maastricht - it is not very far for you to come."
"There, cooperation between three or four countries in respect of the upper layer of the airspace is already in place."
"That is where all of the problems that the countries bring up are solved."
"Go there, suggest it to the Commission, and use it as a model for Europe, for the seven FABs."
"We will then be able to regulate this within twelve months."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - Mr President, as I am not a member of the Transport Committee, some Members might wonder why I am so keen to speak on this very issue."
"But I was, like others, a victim of the ash cloud."
"I was travelling to Baku and could only get back with great difficulties."
"This concerns all European citizens."
"It was an opportunity for Europe to show its added value - and we failed."
"I think European citizens understood that the EU was not yet prepared for taking a single action, but we have to make sure that we are ready to take a single action in the next similar case."
"Therefore, I think that the need for the Single European Sky project is imperative."
"We all agree on that."
"Although I am not a member of the Transport Committee, I would like to mention that not only a Single European Sky is needed, but also a single European infrastructure connected to this."
"Therefore, here in this plenary session, I would like to draw attention to the need for Galileo and for GMES - as they are potentially a great European infrastructure if we can build them - to deliver on that purpose."
"This is why we are working to get the budget lines for those issues, but we have to explain better to European citizens why these projects are needed."
"This is why I wanted to take the floor to make the point that, alongside European policies, European infrastructure in this field is necessary."
"Mr President, Commissioner, a little less than a year ago, three hundred airports were closed in Europe in 23 out of the 27 countries of the Union."
"That caused considerable financial losses and, above all, as previous speakers have pointed out, more than 10 million people, not all of whom were on tourist trips, had to postpone their journeys and find other means of transport."
"This was a result of the havoc wrought by a wholly natural event, which placed us in an important context in relation to nature, and which caused unprecedented paralysis in the skies above Europe."
"It is, of course, difficult to predict a volcanic eruption and, even more so, the formation of a volcanic ash cloud - more difficult, of course, than predicting a snow episode."
"However, the crisis caused by this cloud highlights all the shortcomings and deficiencies of air traffic management in the Union as well as the weakness and absence of a number of management tools."
"On the basis of these three factors, I would like to put forward three proposals for recovery: firstly, regarding imperative comodality; secondly, concerning the need for the Community method to respond to such challenges; thirdly, and naturally at the heart of our concerns, relating to the rights of passengers, which are central to our concerns."
"As regards the first element, the crisis has highlighted the fact that it was absolutely crucial to strengthen comodality in European transport, since the cloud highlighted the limits not only of aviation systems at European level but, more especially, of rail travel, since countless travellers were unable to find an alternative."
"As demonstrated in the studies that have been carried out over the last year, one can image that, with more comodality, the scale of the crisis would not have been so huge and the paralysis would have been somewhat less."
"As regards the second element, as in the financial crisis and in the debates we are having on the Community method compared with intergovernmental operations, here, in the area of transport, intergovernmental operations or a fragmented response from 27 Member States are not what will resolve the difficulties we have encountered and which may return, but rather a genuinely Community method."
"That would require strengthening the competences of Eurocontrol in a Community system and, of course, as has been pointed out, completing the Single European Sky as a matter of urgency."
"Thirdly, there are the passengers, who are at the heart and the centre of our concerns ..."
"(The President interrupted the speaker)"
"As I said in my introduction, you will have gathered that what I left until last was the crucial issue."
"Mr President, firstly, I would like to thank the Commission - something I do not often do - for very consistently placing the focus on safety, even in the face of protests from some airlines, which tried to make light of the problem because such problems have a financial impact."
"However, safety must remain the guiding principle for the future, too."
"A few improvements that we can achieve at European level are necessary, however."
"For example, how about improving our common measuring systems?"
"Do we now have strategies in place for how and with what division of labour such pollution incidents can be measured so that we can issue halfway reliable statements more quickly?"
"I know that this is extremely difficult to do, particularly on account of meteorological conditions, but I would like to know whether any progress has been made here with regard to coordination, so that we are at least taking measurements and evaluating them according to the same criteria."
"Overall, this crisis caused by the volcanic ash has shown how vulnerable our highly equipped air transport system now is - that is something that is obvious to all of us already at our airports."
"Under normal operating conditions, two or three delays already have a whole series of consequences, making use of the service under normal operating conditions more and more difficult, let alone if there is the additional problem of external weather events or something like a volcanic ash crisis; the situation then becomes one of utter chaos."
"We have no error-tolerant system, and in this area, we also need to make improvements, as a system is only as good as its ability to respond in an error-tolerant manner in relevant cases."
"It has also become apparent that we are facing a serious shortcoming, namely, the general lack of cooperation between rail, road and air transport."
"Precisely because we have insufficient cooperation, it was hardly possible to take appropriate compensatory measures on the ground."
"With regard to the Single Sky, the necessity of which has become apparent here - as coordinated measures would, in any case, have been better - I would say that, as long as each Member State is convinced that it is the only one that is truly capable of controlling its own airspace efficiently and that all of the others are absolutely incapable of doing so - and I am talking here about our airspace in Central Europe - we will not make any progress in this regard."
"This egotism damages European cooperation and, ultimately, also the European idea."
"We need to be clear about that."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, it has been said in the debate but I will reiterate that we are all aware of the huge extent of the disruption caused by the volcanic ash cloud."
"As has been mentioned, over 100 000 flights were cancelled, tens of millions of business and holiday passengers were not able to travel as planned, goods and cargo were delayed or not transported at all, businesses were affected and our European carriers and airports suffered catastrophic financial losses."
"All in all, it cost the European airlines more than EUR 2 billion."
"Institutions across Europe and in Member States who were responsible for dealing with such issues were absolutely paralysed and, quite frankly, if it had not been so serious, it would have been practically laughable."
"In all this chaos, one thing was clear."
"Air transport is enormously important for the European economy and as individuals, we depend on a thriving and efficient air transport industry where safety for crew and passengers is the first prerogative."
"As such, I am delighted to support this oral question, not least because during our previous plenary debate on this issue, I called for the European Union to look at international best practice on dealing with volcanic ash and, more particularly, highlighted America, which has always applied a more measured approach in this regard."
"I certainly welcomed the fact that the Commission, in its assessment of the crisis, accepted that Europe needed to revise procedures through the International Civil Aviation Organisation."
"International best practice tells us that responsibility for dealing with potential hazards related to volcanic ash must be transferred to the airline operators as part of their safety management systems."
"The role of the authorities is to audit the airline safety management system to ensure that it meets the required safety standards."
"This is the procedure applied by the US and other countries which have managed to deal with volcanic eruptions without major disruptions to air traffic."
"Clear and decisive joined-up leadership is essential and we need the European Aviation Safety Agency to ensure that EU Member States adapt their current procedures to guarantee that airline operators will take responsibility and be supported in making such decisions in future."
"Lastly, the crisis in April and May last year made it absolutely clear that as a priority, we need to push for the full implementation of the Single European Sky and SESAR."
"Both European industry and the taxpayer have already invested huge sums of money in these projects and, as European lawmakers, we must continue to push forward well balanced, cost-effective and structural reforms."
"I welcome the comments by the Commissioner today."
"Let us hope that we move forward now in a positive way."
"Mr President, since we are again discussing today the crisis caused by volcanic ash, it would seem that this topic is still relevant and that questions remain unanswered."
"We understand that volcanoes do not follow any rules and we cannot exclude unforeseen circumstances."
"All of this is about the survival of the aviation industry, but aircraft are hampered not just by volcanoes, but also by storms, snow and similar phenomena."
"Understandably, it is impossible to eliminate, stop or predict everything that may happen in aviation."
"Clearly, aircraft safety, people's lives and their mobility must rank among our most important considerations."
"I am pleased that a comprehensive programme is being pursued by implementing the Single Sky initiative in order to modernise air traffic management."
"I agree with my fellow Member who said just now that a common infrastructure also needs to be established."
"However, while I am on the subject, I would like to say that today, we should consider and discuss the development of alternative transport."
"We need and must achieve greater progress in this area."
"This crisis had a particular impact on the European Union's eastern Member States, which remained separated from part of Western Europe and, unlike the other European Union Member States, did not have sufficient opportunity to choose alternative modes of transport."
"We now know that we urgently need to establish a alternative secondary mobility system, trans-European networks, rail networks, an alternative to air transport, such as has wisely been done with regard to electricity and telecommunications networks."
"Therefore, given the financial perspectives, more ambitious goals need to be set when reviewing the trans-European networks."
"Land transport and, above all, railways should be able to replace air transport more smoothly if the latter is withdrawn."
"The time has come to consider specific alternatives and to implement these as quickly as possible."
"Mr President, like other Members here, I am not a member of the Committee on Transport and Tourism but I come from Northern Ireland, an island on the edge of Europe."
"You can, therefore, imagine how vitally important good air and sea connections are, not only for our economy, but also for personal travel."
"I have been dealing over the last number of months, indeed even this week, with residual cases from individual constituents who have been affected by this particular crisis."
"At the time of the volcanic ash crisis, the costs were estimated to be in excess of GBP 200 million a day in UK flights alone."
"Therefore, in order to avoid this, we must have much greater cooperation and much more cognisance of best practice so that we have a plan in place to prevent future disruptions and such a horrendous impact on the economy."
"As I have said, I have had a lot of complaints from individual constituents, most of which centred on the airlines, their treatment of these individuals and their failure to recognise their duty of care."
"I would ask the Commission to look at this as well."
"(FI) Mr President, we, of course, know about the sad stories that were heard when the ash cloud formed."
"Many people were unable to get to the funerals of their relatives, their children's weddings or similar occasions."
"They were very personal, regrettable incidents, not to speak of the financial cost incurred through the suffering of 10 million people."
"As you see, nothing actually worked."
"We were unable to reply that the EU had a solution to these situations, and here, the Chair of the Committee on Transport and Tourism correctly said that this risk could not have been anticipated, it could not have been controlled, and the whole thing was more like complete chaos."
"Now, the Commission should give the public the answers it wants as quickly as possible: the answers to whether we have technical solutions or whether the airlines will discover them."
"If there are any, what might they be?"
"What will the rights of passengers be in the future, if the same situation arises, where people cannot fly or get home?"
"When will there be an effective common European airspace?"
"The answer people want, obviously, is as soon as possible, so that this cannot continue for much longer."
"What is the alternative plan?"
"What means of transport are to be used?"
"This time, people were at a loss."
"Others ordered taxis from Spain to Finland, paying thousands of euro in fares."
"This situation cannot be repeated in the future: there should be a plan in place for how people can be better served as regards these alternative arrangements."
"In this connection, I wish to raise another issue mentioned here, and another natural upheaval: snow."
"Tens of thousands of people in December were stranded at airports in Europe when it snowed."
"In my own country, Finland, there is continual heavy snow and there are harsh frosts, but things work."
"We therefore have to get European airports to work properly too."
"This is not too difficult and we cannot just give up: matters should be dealt with so as to guarantee citizen's access to justice."
"(RO) Mr President, the Icelandic volcano eruption, as well as the huge volumes of snow which fell last year, seriously disrupted European air traffic, with significant economic and social consequences."
"With the aim of avoiding such situations in the future, I would like to ask the Commission what main new regulations it has in mind for improving the legislative framework for the rights of passengers travelling by air."
"In spite of the Volcanic Ash Advisory Centres in London and Toulouse, which are part of an international network of nine such centres set up by the ICAO, and the specialist London centre producing volcanic ash cloud risk charts, we also need to improve the European infrastructure by introducing a system for measuring the concentration of volcanic ash clouds in real time."
"Regulation (EC) No 1070/2009 on improving the performance of the European aviation system requires Member States to take the necessary measures to guarantee implementation of the functional airspace blocks by 4 December 2012."
"I wish to ask the Commission whether the implementation of the Single European Sky will comply with the specified timetable."
"The European Union also needs to provide comodality and a system for booking and issuing tickets for European routes involving several modes of transport."
"The European Union requires a high-speed railway system which will link all of Europe's capitals and cities."
"Mr President, the volcanic ash crisis last year prompted the cancellation of close to 100 000 flights, resulting in absolute chaos for passengers."
"It is the effect that this crisis had on passengers that I wish to draw the Commission's attention to today."
"Over 10 million people were affected and the cancellations resulted in significant economic costs for thousands of passengers."
"While airports have signs and leaflets informing travellers of their rights, this is often of little use when faced with cancellations or major travel disruptions such as that caused by the ash cloud."
"Under EU legislation, passengers have a right to information and assistance from their airline."
"However, in reality, the majority of passengers whose travel has been disrupted will spend a lot of time and money chasing down information, seeking alternative tickets or compensation with airlines."
"This is an issue that the Commission needs be more effective on."
"The biggest frustration that passengers face in situations like this is trying to get information, trying to get in contact with the airlines."
"Although they are aware of their rights, this is of little help to them if they are stranded in an airport or on hold to an airline."
"While I appreciate that, at the time of the ash crisis, airlines were under unprecedented pressure to deal with thousands of passengers - and I must admit that some did admirably - in general, it is very difficult for people to get information and assistance when it is needed."
"The travel chaos as a result of the bad weather in December 2010 further demonstrates this."
"Passengers require up-to-date information but they need to be able to reach the airlines in order to exercise their rights."
"Airlines, airport customer services and information need to be more accessible to passengers whose travel has been disrupted."
"It is not enough to inform European Union citizens of their passenger rights; they must be assisted in exercising them in times of travel chaos."
"(DE) Mr President, this was a natural disaster which had terrible consequences for many people."
"However, if we compare it with the floods and the simultaneous hurricane in Australia or with the earthquake in Christchurch in New Zealand, we all escaped unharmed."
"Safety had absolute priority, and rightly so."
"Commissioner Kallas made the right decision in agreement with the EU transport ministers in the Member States."
"I cannot understand the criticism directed at the airlines."
"They clearly suffered a loss - a figure of 2 billion was mentioned. However, it is wrong to lay the responsibility as to whether or not flights go ahead at the feet of the airlines."
"That decision must be made at a political level."
"Safety must be given top priority."
"Imagine if an aeroplane had crashed as a result of the volcanic ash."
"We would have had a completely different debate, namely, how irresponsible it was to even allow one aeroplane to take off."
"We need a plan B, as has quite rightly been said, and the rail system is the alternative."
"As a result of their exemption from fuel tax, airlines receive EUR 30 billion per year from European taxpayers."
"This money must be invested in the rail system, at least in parts of it, so that we have an alternative in the event of this sort of disaster."
"Safety first - that is what people are calling for, and rightly so."
"It must also be the case in the future, too."
"(PL) Mr President, this situation showed that Europe was not, in fact, prepared for this crisis."
"Despite what we are hearing in this Chamber, the experts say that the reaction on our part was excessive and some flights could certainly have been allowed."
"However, this nonetheless shows the undoubted scale of the paralysis in which we found ourselves."
"Of course, the previous speakers who spoke about a certain alternative in the form of developing the rail network are right."
"That is obvious."
"In the field of aviation, the answer to this problem is definitely better coordination and strengthening of the role of the European Aviation Safety Agency."
"In addition, it is good that in November, the European Parliament adopted a suitable regulation on this matter."
"It was a step in the right direction."
"(HU) Mr President, the volcanic eruption forces us to rethink transportation priorities."
"The time has come to begin favouring rail in medium-distance transport up to 1 500 km, for which subsidies, taxes, and other regulatory mechanisms could be used as needed."
"An important consideration is that significant internal market demand is noticeable in connection with the modernisation of railroad tracks as well as the manufacturing of rolling stock, both of which could create numerous jobs."
"In view of check-in and airport transfer times, aeroplanes - in comparison with high-speed trains - provide a zero minimal time benefit while causing considerable carbon dioxide and noise pollution."
"Even though we cannot prevent volcanic eruptions, we can improve the technology used to predict them and how we evaluate the resulting situation."
"However, a genuine solution can only be provided by transforming transport, energy and industrial policy, because volcanic eruptions cause either no disruption, or only local disruption, to rail transport."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as many of us have said just now, the eruption of the Icelandic volcano last April was a painful illustration of the fragmentation and ineffectiveness of the European sky."
"Each of us in this Chamber was directly affected."
"Five million of our citizens were stranded with no real alternative form of transport available."
"One year after that exceptional event, new European measures have so far failed to materialise."
"Commissioner, you said that a first crisis exercise, linked to volcanic ash, is scheduled for 13 and 14 April under the coordination of Eurocontrol, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and the International Air Transport Association (IATA), but it is essential that the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) exercises real leadership to coordinate safety measures at European level."
"It is certain that the information provided by the Visual Approach Charts (VAC) of London and Toulouse must be refined using more modern technologies."
"As we saw last April, however, the data may be contradictory and may lead each Member State to take decisions concerning the closure of their air space that are motivated less by information than by emotion."
"In this context, the role of the EASA is vital in proposing a harmonised interpretation of the data, as well as in ensuring the centralisation and proper dissemination of the information."
"Beyond the information provided by the VACs, the EASA must put in place a mechanism for collecting the available data in close cooperation with the Member States, the airlines and their pilots."
"This centralisation of information and the coordination of all those involved will prevent the chaos and the inconsistencies we witnessed last year."
"So I expect the Commission, together with the EASA, to be able to submit specific proposals in the very near future, which will be integrated fully in the implementation of the Single European Sky."
"Mr President, the volcanic ash cloud crisis caused huge disruption during last April and into May."
"As Mrs Foster said, many of us realised how dependent we are on modern air travel."
"Certainly when you come from where I come from, where it is impossible to get to your work unless you use the aeroplane, then that really brings it home to you."
"Everybody who travelled during that time probably has stories to tell, and some people were very badly affected."
"In addition, the economic losses airlines and other businesses suffered as a result of grounded flights and stranded passengers were substantial."
"People have said that this could happen again."
"I think this is what we have got to be prepared for, because there did seem to be an awful lot of indecision."
"Let me be very honest: as someone who flies every week, when I am up there at 39 000 feet, I want, above all, to be safe and secure, so I do not ever argue about security."
"We have got to make sure that the safety of the passengers is paramount."
"I think that is the overlying situation that we should support."
"(PL) Mr President, I will say it again: 100 000 cancelled flights, 10 million passengers who did not reach their destination, EUR 2 billion of losses to the airlines."
"I do not recall a similar paralysis of air traffic in Europe ever happening before."
"The European Commission, under pressure from public opinion and the aviation industry, announced quick and decisive action as early as April last year."
"Unfortunately, the volcanic ash has settled, and the Commission's ambitions have fallen with it."
"To date, a European crisis management plan for similar situations has not been drafted."
"It has also not been possible as yet to agree on a common position between safety experts, aircraft manufacturers, airlines and market regulators."
"It is, therefore, necessary to ask the following questions today: what has been done about this over the last year?"
"If a similar volcanic eruption occurred today, would we react differently than a year ago?"
"When will we be presented with specific measures?"
"We are conducting a sustained dialogue on the Single European Sky, on body and liquid scanners, and on procedures for natural disasters such as a volcanic eruption or a severe attack of winter."
"Meanwhile, air traffic over Europe continues to increase year-on-year."
"The time for discussions is ending."
"The European sky needs immediate and good solutions for the future, and I strongly encourage the Commission to complete this work. Thank you very much."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the volcanic ash of last year showed us in an impressive way where our weaknesses lie."
"The question therefore arises as to how we should deal with such situations in the future."
"It is, of course, first and foremost a question of the safety of those people who board an aeroplane."
"Of course, we must also keep in mind how we intend to deal with the financial losses."
"My question to the Commission is therefore - Mr Hahn, perhaps you could also pass this on to Mr Kallas - what, in specific terms, are we planning?"
"I would argue that it is particularly important for us to take over the coordination when it comes to test flights and limit values."
"That is very important in order for us to know which aeroplanes can take off and when."
"I have another comment, Commissioner: it is extremely important - and this has already been referred to many times - to establish the Single European Sky."
"What does the Commission intend to do in terms of exerting pressure on the Member States to actually fulfil their obligation in this regard?"
"After all, they have put their signatures to it."
"Another important point, which has already been made several times today, is what happens now with regard to passengers' rights in air transport."
"We have Regulation (EC) No 2061 from 2004."
"What does the Commission intend to do in this regard?"
"We are aware of the problem of the financial losses suffered by the various airlines."
"I would also like to point out once again that we need alternatives to air transport, and by that I mean the rail system."
"I am also one of those who believe that we must link the large cities - Europe's capital cities - together."
"In this case, too, the answer is that we need more involvement from Europe, not less."
"I would be pleased if the Commission would give its attention to these issues."
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to thank Mr Marinescu for pressing so strongly for this debate."
"Almost one year on from the event, we are gathered here to discuss this delicate issue, which caused extensive damage to passengers and businesses involved in both the air sector and, lest we forget, in other industries, too."
"I therefore consider it necessary to adopt a two-pronged approach."
"On the one hand, enhance coordination between the authorities and stakeholders, finally addressing the reform of Eurocontrol, which is not, of course, a body reporting directly to the European institutions, but which was, in any case, crucial in the management and lack of effective management of this crisis."
"The inadequacy of purely mathematical models, which led the authorities of individual countries to an almost total shutdown of the airspace even when there was no need, has been demonstrated."
"In the absence of a model tested in the field and more advanced technologies, an excess of caution led to very heavy damage and inconvenience."
"In addition, we must make decisive progress towards achieving the Single European Sky, developing all the functional airspace blocks (FABs) more quickly to reduce fragmentation in the management of airspace and to ensure their more effective management."
"On the other hand, it is necessary to guarantee the rights of travellers."
"In this regard, I hope that the Commission can submit its revision of the directive on package travel as soon as possible to clarify the framework of guarantees and liability in extraordinary situations and also any changes to the regulation on passengers' rights when extraordinary situations are protracted."
"It would also be necessary - other fellow Members have said the same - to launch an emergency plan to provide alternative mobility, alternative means of transport if a similar situation should arise again."
"(FR) Mr President, I would like to thank the Members who spoke earlier to highlight all the shortcomings of European air transport integration in connection with the use of air space, ground structures and trade networks."
"I would also like to emphasise, more specifically, the non airspace-related aspects that the volcano crisis revealed; that is to say; the lack of alternative networks to air transport, in particular, rail networks, as mentioned this morning, and, above all, the lack of integrated information systems to enable passengers to quickly find information relating to available alternative forms of transport."
"This accident must prompt us to work towards developing alternative, efficient and competitive modes of transport."
"In this regard, the review of the first rail package as well as the revival of infrastructure policies through trans-European transport networks should move in this direction."
"In addition, I call upon the Commission to give serious consideration to establishing a single information and reservation interface for all interconnected modes of transport."
"(PL) Mr President, Europe was not prepared for such chaos, and the institutions responsible for crisis management were not up to the task."
"As a result of the air traffic embargo, the airlines lost USD 400 million every day."
"To lost ticket sales should be added the cost of accommodation, meals and transport for passengers who were stranded at airports."
"Seismic and volcanic activity are not a novelty to the world, and other volcanic eruptions are possible in the future."
"Unfortunately, there is no suitable medicine for such a situation."
"At such times, the European Union should concentrate on ensuring its citizens alternative means of transport to flying."
"A good solution, as part of the TEN-T network being set up in the Union, will be the creation of a common network of railway connections and concentrating on improving high-speed rail transport."
"This would certainly be effective in helping resolve problems of this kind. Thank you."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr Hahn, I am not a member of the Committee on Transport and Tourism either, but I believe that it is important for all of us to learn lessons from the ash crisis."
"As has already been said today, 'safety first' must, in future, be the guiding concept when it comes to finding a solution."
"We need to develop the railways and we need to develop a European rail network."
"However, we also need a form of overall coordination for passenger and freight transport, irrespective of whether it is by air, rail or road, in the event of earthquakes, ash clouds, floods or similar disasters."
"National contact points, like those we are now setting up in the health sector for cross-border patient care, would seem an almost obvious solution to this - national contact points to which people of all generations can turn."
"The fact is that I can also see a certain intergenerational inequality at the moment in air transport."
"It is almost impossible these days to obtain information without the Internet."
"We should work together to resolve this issue, too."
"Mr President, as many colleagues have stated, the volcanic ash crisis caused significant air traffic disruption and economic damage in 2010, damage that is still unquantifiable."
"Over 10 million passengers were directly affected as 100 000 flights were cancelled across Europe."
"I come from Ireland, and Irish air passengers faced extreme difficulties due to this ash cloud, as Ireland does not have land crossings to mainland Europe."
"I had to take sea crossings and trains, taxis and cars to get here to Strasbourg, which took me over 24 hours without sleep."
"Of course, that is a small price to pay; we have to ensure that safety is paramount."
"The situation did, however, highlight the overwhelming need for a common policy."
"I welcome the recent initiatives by Commissioner Kallas to implement the Single European Sky and to establish functional air space."
"I also welcome the statement here today by Commission Hahn and I fully support these measures, as volcanic ash clouds recognise no political or geographical boundaries."
"(HU) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as my fellow Member, Mr Marinescu, has already pointed out, the volcanic ash crisis demonstrated that Europe was neither strategically nor technologically prepared for this situation."
"I would like to draw the Commission's attention to the fact that this also had a strong effect on the dissemination of, and access to, information."
"Due to the communications chaos, the negative effects of the crisis were felt by disadvantaged groups such as families with small children and persons with disabilities, who were unable to react appropriately."
"I ask the Commission whether, after April 2010, and in a similar crisis situation, every travelling citizen will have access to adequate information in order to appropriately exercise their right to information."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to thank the honourable Members for their understanding, knowing that I am not familiar with this issue."
"Members, you are right that my colleague, Vice-President Siim Kallas, is doing an excellent job and you will receive written answers to your specific questions where necessary."
"Having said that, I would like to thank you for an interesting debate, particularly as, like you, I was personally affected by events in various ways."
"Therefore, I would like to conclude by stating the following."
"Last year's volcanic ash crisis clearly highlighted the need for us to work together to find solutions to avoid a repeat of the airspace closures we witnessed."
"That being said - and as was the case in April last year - actions taken in this regard cannot diminish the levels of safety that the aviation industry is renowned for around the world."
"Crisis situations are not new to the European Union and the EU response to this crisis was timely and efficient."
"It showed the importance of centralised European action in a widespread crisis situation."
"Looking specifically at the Eyjafjallajökull event, the concept, aims and objectives of the Single European Sky initiative have once again been highlighted."
"As recognised by the Council of Ministers, there is a need to accelerate its implementation to derive all the benefits of its application."
"From the Commission perspective, the focus remains on ensuring a harmonised approach and application of agreed measures to future crisis situations."
"This will be of benefit to all citizens in Europe."
"It is our intention to revise air passenger rights in 2012."
"Last but not least, the participation of the industry is essential in order to facilitate a coordinated decision-making process."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"in writing. - The closure of large sectors of European air space in April and May last year due to the volcanic eruption in Iceland caused severe traffic disruption and economic damage and affected 10 million passengers directly."
"I believe the primary responsibility for the safety of flights rests with the operators."
"Therefore, they must be provided with accurate data."
"Pilots are trained to manage extraordinary flight conditions, the commercial airlines' safety manuals are reviewed, overseen and confirmed by regulatory authorities, and airlines have the necessary experience of operating over volcanic areas, as is shown by their safety record."
"The airline operator (the pilot) should therefore be responsible for assessing the risk and ensuring the safety of flights by, for example, choosing routes or deciding if rerouting is necessary, taking into account all the information available (provision of more information and improved technical equipment on board aircraft)."
"I hope the Commission will liaise with the appropriate authorities to ensure that in the future, they are allowed to get on with their job."
"A debate was held in the European Parliament today on the volcanic ash crisis."
"The volcanic eruption in Iceland last year resulted in serious disruptions to air traffic over Europe."
"It caused major economic losses and directly affected 10 million passengers."
"It certainly is not in the interest of the Union to resist the forces of nature, but better prediction of the possibility of a similar crisis occurring in the future would definitely allow economic losses to be reduced and would result in greater convenience for the citizens of Europe."
"During the debate, there was discussion of matters relating to progress in the implementation of investments in technological equipment and data transfer systems for the provision of real-time weather forecasts."
"Questions were put to the European Commission concerning transparency of collaborative decision-making processes and better coordination of responses."
"Consideration was also given to the consequences of an increase in air traffic in the future and what measures should be taken to make the European Aviation Safety Agency responsible for carrying out operational changes."
"in writing. - (PT) The number of natural disasters has been increasing in both intensity and frequency."
"The recent case of the volcanic ash cloud recorded in Iceland in April and May of last year seriously affected the whole of European airspace, during which time 75% of the airport network was inactive, and led to considerable economic losses and affected around 10 million passengers."
"In order to prevent further disruptions to air traffic, there is an urgent need to think of crisis management measures."
"This means that there needs to be an investment in technological equipment on land and in the air to provide accurate information in real time."
"In addition, it is vital to define the role and function of the various institutions in crisis management so that there is concerted coordination, to avoid greater losses to the different players."
"This event shows that it is crucial to develop the integration of European airspace through the Single European Sky initiative."
"The continual growth of air traffic, the fragmentation of European airspace and unforeseen events such as the volcanic ash cloud show that the EU should coordinate and harmonise its air procedures so as to bring added value to the European air sector."
"(The sitting was suspended at 11:35 and resumed at 12:00)"
"Statement by the President"
"Colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, dear guests, tomorrow, on 11 March, we will be marking the European Day for the Victims of Terrorism for the seventh time."
"The day is dedicated to more than 5 000 victims of terrorism in Europe."
"Terrorists declare war against civilians."
"They strike in places where ordinary people should feel safe in their countries."
"It is shameful, deceitful and cowardly."
"That is why terrorism can never be justified."
"We Europeans are strong and united."
"No terrorist or criminal organisation is able to weaken our faith in the values which underpin our united Europe."
"Ladies and gentlemen, please rise to observe a minute's silence for the victims of terrorism."
"(The House rose and observed a minute's silence)"
"Establishing European statutes for mutual societies, associations and foundations (written declaration): see Minutes"
"Heavy goods vehicle collisions (written declaration)"
"To begin with, I am going to read you two written declarations."
"The first has been submitted by Mr Tarabella, Mrs Bastos, Mr Canfin, Mrs Vergiat and Mrs Weber on establishing European statutes for mutual societies, associations and foundations."
"It has been signed by the majority of Parliament's component Members."
"Therefore, in accordance with Rule 123, it will be forwarded to its addressees and published in the Texts Adopted of this sitting, together with the names of the signatories."
"The second written declaration has been submitted by Mrs Hall, Mrs Ayala Sender, Mrs Durant, Mr Koch and Mrs Wils on heavy goods vehicle collisions."
"It has been signed by the majority of Parliament's component Members."
"Therefore, in accordance with Rule 123, it will be forwarded to its addressees and published in the Texts Adopted of this sitting, together with the names of the signatories."
"Mr President, in view of what we have just been speaking about, I would like to say that security in this building has been stepped up and I wish to extend our thanks to the men and women who protect us."
"I would like your reassurance that the investigation into Brussels security breaches, some involving firearms, is being vigorously pursued."
"These breaches have put our staff, our guests and ourselves at serious risk."
"May I also have your assurance that senior management will be held accountable where appropriate, and that these soldiers will not be sacrificed in order to protect the generals?"
"(Applause)"
"I would like to assure you that this matter is being kept under constant review with a view to strengthening the security of our House."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in connection with the signing of Written Declaration 84/2010, I wish, of course, to thank all my co-signatories: Mrs Bastos of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats);"
"Mr Canfin of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance; Mrs Vergiat of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left; and Mrs Weber of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe."
"Together, we were able to collect a majority of signatures."
"Thank you to the social economy actors who took action and who made it possible for this Parliament to send a clear signal to the Commission to finally recognise a single European statute for mutuals, associations and foundations."
"(Applause)"

"Media law in Hungary ("
"- Before the vote:"
"Mr President, before the planned vote on the resolution on media law in Hungary, I would like to draw the attention of fellow Members to the latest developments in the situation and to put forward a concrete proposal."
"Four days ago, the Hungarian Parliament adopted the amendments - all the amendments - requested by the European Commission despite the negative vote, by the way, of Hungarian Socialist and Green Members."
"Commissioner Kroes was present during the vote and she announced that the amended version of the law was consistent with European law and, in particular, with the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"Yet the resolution of the left-wing groups, which will be put to the vote at midday, completely ignores these facts."
"The text is virtually the same as that of three weeks ago and makes no mention of the vote of the Hungarian Parliament."
"My question is this: is this Parliament living in the real, or an imaginary, world?"
"Is this resolution directed against the Hungarian Government or against the European Commission, which no longer has any problem with the law?"
"(Applause)"
"In particular, I would ask the Chair of the Liberal Group: do you, or do you not have confidence in Commissioner Kroes?"
"The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) thinks that this Parliament would lose its credibility if it adopted texts that do not correspond to reality."
"Must we become a theatre for settling national political scores?"
"(Applause)"
"Given these conditions, the PPE Group withdraws its own resolution and calls on the other groups to do the same."
"The credibility of Parliament is at stake."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the proposal is completely clear."
"As I understand it, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) has withdrawn its resolution."
"We have, therefore, only one resolution, which has been submitted by several of the political groups."
"I would like to ask the representatives of the political groups to comment on this."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Daul talked about reality."
"Well, it is reality that the Hungarian Government or the Hungarian Parliament has amended the law, and that is a good thing, because I can remember the debate in this Chamber when some people said - including you, Mr Daul - that nothing needed to be amended; everything was fine."
"Suddenly, it now needs to be amended."
"(Applause from the left)"
"However, it is also reality - and you can read this, too - that both the media freedom representative of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the representative of the Council of Europe say that these amendments are inadequate."
"That is the reality, Mr Daul."
"That is the reality."
"(Applause from the left)"
"In our group's meeting yesterday evening, which I chaired, we discussed the law and the amendments and - like the OSCE and the Council of Europe - we came to the conclusion that these amendments are inadequate."
"Whatever decision is made today - whether you win, Mr Daul, or whether we win - we will not give up the fight for freedom of the media, Mr Lange."
"If you do so, that is your business."
"(Applause from the left)"
"Freedom of the media is an inviolable element of democracy."
"We want democracy and we want freedom of the media."
"We therefore ask you to vote accordingly today."
"We know that there are also some Members in your group who agree with us."
"We must fight for freedom of the media - in Hungary and elsewhere, too."
"(Applause from the left)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, fellow Members, as I understand it, the four political groups are not withdrawing their declaration."
"We could end the debate here and proceed to the vote, but I understand that the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe in the European Parliament also wants to make a statement."
"Please take the floor."
"Mr President, we have been addressed specifically here."
"Of course, we have confidence in Commissioner Kroes's work."
"Her examination of the secondary law was exemplary."
"We wish the Commissioner examining the primary law had done her work in the same way, as this is where the problem lies."
"(Applause from the left)"
"The reality of the situation includes those things just mentioned by Mr Swoboda, namely that, in the opinion of both the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the amendments are inadequate."
"Hungary's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Public Administration and Justice, Mr Navracsics, has himself admitted that this was not a significant amendment of the media law."
"I could mention the protection of journalistic sources, which still remains unregulated, or the composition and powers of the media authority."
"All of these are matters that still need to be discussed."
"I would therefore like to state, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, that we will not withdraw the motion for a resolution, but rather request that the vote take place."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we are going to take a vote on the resolution of the four political groups."
"2."
"Southern Neighbourhood, and Libya in particular, including humanitarian aspects ("
"(PT) Mr President, there is a new supervening element that is not reflected in the resolution, and I call upon Parliament to join me in expressing our indignation and concern."
"This concerns what happened to the team of BBC journalists who were illegally detained and tortured, and also subjected to mock executions, and who saw many other Libyans detained in prison in totally inhumane conditions."
"This also shows that journalists are not being allowed to carry out their work freely in Libya."
"This is an important matter, and I call upon Parliament to join us in expressing our indignation and concern, which we must convey to the Council."
"Mrs Gomes, do you have a specific amendment in mind?"
"We can only give consideration to a specific amendment, not a general appeal."
"(PT) Mr President, the information I have is that the Liberal Group should like to propose the oral amendment, which has been agreed, but if this is not the case, I will be more than happy to pass it on."
"All right, I understand."
"It is a general comment. Thank you."
"(PL) Mr President, with respect, we heard you say that the resolution has been adopted, but I did not see the result, at least not on my screen or on the one in the seat in front of me."
"I think we should also be given the results, by which I mean the particular result of this vote."
"Here is the result: 316 people voted in favour, 264 voted against and 33 people abstained."
"Mr President, I would like to remind the House of the double standards which we are applying."
"In the case of the Hungarian media law, an event which took place on Monday was not reflected in our resolution."
"Now we are trying to include something which happened only yesterday."
"This is a clear double standard which this House is applying, which is deplorable and unacceptable."
"Mr President, I do this in the name of all the Group leaders and also of most of the coordinators because yesterday, after the debate, there was a general feeling that there is a need to strengthen paragraph 11."
"The oral amendment I am presenting is the following: 'Calls on the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy to establish relations with the Interim Transitional National Council and to start the process of making them official, so as to encourage transition towards democracy, ensuring the involvement of a wide spectrum of representatives of the Libyan society and empower women and minorities in the transitional process, and to support it in the liberated area so as to relieve the population and to meet its basic humanitarian needs, including medical assistance'."
"That is the oral amendment in the name of the seven Group leaders and also of all the coordinators, with whom it has been agreed."
"3."
"EU approach towards Iran ("
"Mr President, at the initiative of the Group of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, and with the approval and consent of the other groups, I propose that the following oral amendment be inserted after paragraph 6:"
"'Strongly condemns the illegal detention of Iranian opposition leaders, Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karoubi, together with their wives, by Iranian security forces and calls for their immediate and unconditional release; points out that the detention was carried out in violation of Iranian law; condemns the attitude of the Iranian authorities to the opposition exercising its legitimate right to protest and declares its solidarity with the Iranian people in their democratic aspirations; deplores the hypocrisy of the Iranian Government, which used excessive force, intimidation and arbitrary arrests against peaceful demonstrators demonstrating in solidarity with the Egyptian people on 14 February 2011, whilst claiming to support freedom in Egypt';"
"(SV) The oral amendment concerns the deletion of a single word, and that is the word 'and'."
"I will read the text in English and then I will explain why:"
"'whereas there has been a remarkable deepening of relations between Iran and Turkey;' the next word 'and' is deleted and the recital continues 'whereas Iran is using its state and non-state allies Syria, Hezbollah and Hamas, and also the Muslim Brotherhood, to destabilise the region'."
"(SV) We want to delete the word 'and' in the middle because we do not want to link relations between Turkey and Iran with Iran's relations with Hezbollah and Hamas."
"4."
"16th session of the United Nations Human Rights Council (Geneva, 28 February - 25 March 2011) ("
"Chair of the Subcommittee on Human Rights. - Mr President, I have some very good human rights news."
"Sakharov Prize candidate, Haitham al-Maleh, an 80-year old Syrian human rights lawyer, was pardoned and released two days ago."
"This is a wonderful example of how the European Parliament can strengthen human rights."
"Now that he is free again, Haitham al-Maleh is full of vigour in his aim to help release the thousands of political prisoners in Syria."
"(Loud applause)"
"Thank you for telling us this news."
"It is sure to give us a great boost in our work."
"- Before the vote on paragraph 8:"
"(FR) Mr President, I would simply like to point out that, when you put paragraph 8 of the original text to the vote, the French translation indicated that it was paragraph 19."
"So there was a misunderstanding over the voting instructions."
"We will look into it."
"Thank you for your comment."
"Madam President, I simply would like to take the opportunity to say thank you to the 400 colleagues from across this House who signed Written Declaration 81;"
"I would also like to say thank you to my staff for all their hard work and to the Written Declaration services for their support, but most of all, I would like to thank the campaigners whose dedication made this possible."
"I am proud to be a member of a Parliament where it is possible for ordinary citizens to come and to make their case and where MEPs listen and are persuaded."
"That is democracy at its best and it shows that the European Parliament is not remote from its people."
"Voting time"
"The next item is voting time."
"(For the results and other details on the vote: see Minutes)"
"Explanations of vote"
"We now come to the explanations of vote."
"Oral explanations of vote"
"(SK) Madam President, I voted in favour of the resolution jointly submitted by the Group of European Socialists mainly for the reason that little has changed in terms of the importance and topicality of the resolution, even though certain changes have occurred in Hungary between the drafting of the resolution and today's vote on it."
"In the first place, I would like to stress our disappointment over the fact that the Commission decided from the outset to focus on just three areas in relation to the controversial Hungarian media law."
"We are insistent that, after the Hungarian Government and Parliament had dealt with these three areas in a relatively acceptable way, the Commission should have continued by closely monitoring the compliance of the Hungarian media law with European legislation - specifically, the Charter of Fundamental Rights in particular."
"We would also like to call on the Hungarian authorities, in future amendments to the law, to engage to a greater degree with the parties involved, including civil society, because that is the only way a law can be drawn up in a truly democratic country."
"In this way, the contributions and recommendations will surely be stimulating, whether ours - those of the European Parliament, the Commission, or the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe - or those of the Council of Europe's Commissioner for Human Rights."
"(FI) Madam President, surely all those in this House who endorse the principles of the European Union think that freedom of the media is very important."
"This freedom, of course, entails responsibility."
"I nevertheless voted against this proposal."
"The information which I have received regarding this matter and which has been gone through here shows that the Commission made requests to Hungary, Hungary responded to them and it amended its media laws accordingly."
"In my opinion, that ought to have been enough."
"In this respect, I am of the opinion that this should not be made a political issue in this way, where the left are seemingly against the right, or whatever the situation is: the same standards must apply to everyone in this matter."
"If the Commission accepted this amendment by Hungary, then I accept it too."
"It is my view that this is a matter of basic principles and so I am afraid that I voted against this report by my own group, or its idea, because I believe that what Hungary has done is exactly what the Commission asked it to do."
"Madam President, before pronouncing on media freedom in Hungary, we might care to look at what we do as a Parliament."
"We might like to think about the hundreds of thousands of euro in public subsidies that we give to the European Union of Journalists; we might like to think of the tens of thousands of euro that we spend every week flying local reporters, in particular, out to Brussels and Strasbourg in order to show them a good time; and we might like to think of the way in which dozens of accredited correspondents in Brussels are getting second incomes as advisers on media issues or editors or writers on EU-funded free sheets."
"If I were a Hungarian, I would have serious questions about not just the media law, but the creeping autocratic tendencies of the government; but I am not a Hungarian, it is not my business."
"I am, however, a Member of this House, and I think the way in which we use taxpayers' money in this nakedly propagandist way is something that ought to offend our basic principles of decency, fairness and democracy."
"We should cantilever the great tree trunk out of our own eye, before we start worrying about the speck in that of Hungary."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of this important resolution."
"It is essential that the European Union make every effort within its powers to end the emergency, in coordination with the United Nations Security Council, as quickly as possible."
"Expressing a clear condemnation, proposing a no-fly zone, establishing an arms embargo and other sanctions, providing humanitarian aid, evacuating European citizens, ensuring assistance to civilian populations affected are, however, all ex post measures that merely seek to stem the disaster."
"The European Union, however, must play a stronger political role on the international stage and be able to address major challenges."
"After facing the emergency, I think we should stop and reflect to see how the EU can work in future to prevent future situations where weak democracies break down and develop into humanitarian disasters."
"Madam President, I voted, of course, for this resolution."
"But I think it is urgent that the European Council, which is meeting tomorrow, acts as soon and as decisively as possible, firstly, to establish a no-fly zone over Libya to prevent its government from continuing to kill its citizens and, secondly, to establish relations with the Interim National Council."
"We added this call to our resolution."
"But, all in all, I think a passage in the resolution needs to be stressed: that the revolutionary changes in North Africa have made it clear that the EU's positive impact and long-term credibility in that region will depend on its ability to conduct a cohesive common foreign policy that is value-based and will clearly side with the new democratic forces."
"Madam President, I voted in favour of the resolution."
"I would like to stress that the Partnership for Democracy and Shared Prosperity with the Southern Mediterranean, recently launched by the Commission, is a remarkable first step in the right direction."
"The EU was largely absent at the beginning of the North African crisis and the transition to democracy, but now it seems to have started to be more active and more effective in this area."
"(FI) Madam President, the Libyan people must have the right before anyone else to decide the future of their own country."
"As the notions of true democracy and freedom come from the people, they cannot be forced from outside."
"Tomorrow's extraordinary summit of the European Council must reach agreement on the EU's role in the region."
"The EU should do all it can to support the wave of democracy in the Arab world."
"No time should be lost: we need to move from words to deeds."
"The EU must be consistent in its policy and acknowledge its responsibility in the area now and in the long term."
"If the attacks on the civilian population continue, and that seems to be the case, the EU must negotiate a UN mandate and action to create a nofly zone over Libya to avoid a human catastrophe."
"We also need to retain the option of military intervention in this situation."
"(PL) Madam President, we are witnessing the end of one of the last long regimes of post-war history."
"However, Muammar al-Gaddafi has not been able to bring himself to make an honourable resignation, and in order to maintain his dictatorial rule, has declared war on his own people."
"By turning his guns on the citizens, he has questioned the foundations on which modern civilisation is based."
"He has committed a crime against humanity."
"We face, therefore, the obligation to support the Libyan people in their fight for freedom, democracy and fundamental human rights."
"We have to take action in cooperation with the UN to restore stability in Libya and to punish those guilty of crimes, including Colonel Gaddafi."
"Particularly urgent is the need to ensure humanitarian aid to civilians and to give shelter to Libyan refugees."
"As long as 25 years ago, President Reagan's administration tried to bring an end to Gaddafi's rule."
"We must, today, take all measures permissible under international law to remove him from office, so I support Parliament's resolution."
"(FI) Madam President, I voted in favour of this resolution, although I think it contains certain worrying features."
"Firstly, I want to say that my group met with representatives of the Libyan opposition forces this week and they said that they did not want any armed intervention by the West."
"This they made quite clear."
"I think that the EU should not be a flag waver in this affair, but should act together with the UN and the Arab countries."
"Despite that, this resolution talks about humanitarian intervention, which all too often sadly means armed intervention."
"Parliament is actually adopting a position in favour of intervention, albeit with the use of fine rhetoric."
"My other concern is this nofly zone, which I am afraid will result in the bombing of Libya."
"I think that this should be a UNled mission, with the whole Arab world, Africa and the EU acting together."
"Madam President, those calling for military intervention - and a no-fly zone is, of course, a form of military intervention, requiring as it does a willingness to strike at air facilities on the ground - should remember three points."
"First, as we have heard, the Libyan opposition does not want foreign intervention."
"There are posters up all over Benghazi saying so."
"Second, the Gaddafi regime does want foreign intervention: it would justify the dictator's argument that he is defending his country against foreign invaders."
"Third, we cannot afford it."
"The first ship in the area after the humanitarian crisis began was HMS Cumberland from our own country, which was in the area because she was on her way to be scrapped!"
"And our Navy still has more reach than those of most of the other Member States."
"There might have been an argument for some direct strike against the Gaddafi regime in the 1980s when it was plainly engaged in international terrorism."
"It is striking that those who are now demanding some form of intervention were not in favour of such action when it would have been justifiable under the norms of international law."
"There is something disgusting about the spectacle of all these European leaders fawning and slobbering over this appalling regime."
"We have made quite enough problems for ourselves by our interventions to date."
"I think we have done quite enough."
"(SK) Madam President, I welcome the resolution, and I have therefore supported it."
"It is not enough, however, to adopt a resolution."
"Last week in Egypt, four thousand Muslims attacked a Coptic village not far from Cairo."
"They burned two churches and prevented fire-fighters from entering the village."
"The army did not want to interfere at first."
"When they did finally intervene, Muslim representatives sent them away, saying that everything was in order."
"The 12 000 Christians living in the village were placed under a curfew."
"There was a time when Europe knew who was good, who was bad and why."
"Thanks to the support of those good people, leaders such as Havel, Walesa and Čarnogurský were prepared for the fall of communism."
"Today, however, EU politicians are shaking hands with dictators and turning a blind eye to the persecution of Christians."
"They do not think in terms of good and evil, because pragmatism does not recognise such categories."
"Until this changes, we may do more harm than good to North Africa."
"Madam President, I voted in favour of this report because it clearly distinguishes between the two main dossiers on Iran: human rights abuses by the current government and the Iranian nuclear programme."
"The report supports the Council's double-track approach to the nuclear issue: sanctions on the one hand, but an offer of dialogue on the other."
"It is indispensable to denounce the extremely serious human rights violations occurring in Iran today."
"The perpetrators, who belong mainly to state institutions, are acting with impunity."
"At the same time, we should avoid irresponsible calls for an international armed intervention against the current tyranny."
"An armed attack against Iran in the name of human rights would be considered by all Iranians, regardless of their political positions, as an attack against the country and an additional violation of their fundamental rights."
"The only winner in such an eventuality would be Mr Ahmadinejad."
"Madam President, having voted in favour of this resolution, I think it is now time to apply the same approach to the Tehran regime as we have been applying to Libya and Colonel Gaddafi."
"In other words, cherishing hopes for confidence-building is not a realistic option any more."
"We should support more opposition in Iran."
"I am especially worried about the Ashraf opposition camp, which has been under siege and under pressure since July 2009."
"The humanitarian situation there is intolerable."
"Parliament adopted a resolution in April 2009 and a written declaration last November on the subject of that camp, and I would advise Baroness Ashton to take this serious message to the European Council tomorrow."
"(PL) Madam President, Iran, under the government of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, is a cause of grave anxiety due to the nuclear ambitions of its rulers."
"The continued refusal to cooperate with the International Atomic Energy Agency and the related absence of monitoring of the Iranian nuclear programme make it necessary to consider taking emphatic action with respect to Iran."
"In view of the fact that it is an authoritarian regime, we have to reckon with the possibility of its posing a threat to other countries, in particular, neighbouring ones."
"Particular fears are aroused by the anti-Israel rhetoric which the President of Iran has been expressing for quite some time."
"I consider the position of the Iranian authorities on this matter to be unacceptable and I condemn it categorically."
"In voting for the resolution, I express my opposition to Iran's aggressive foreign policy, and also demand the release of political prisoners, a cessation of the persecution of human rights defenders and a commencement of cooperation with international organisations, including UN bodies."
"I also support the diplomatic efforts of Turkey and Brazil in pursuit of a resolution of the nuclear question."
"Madam President, the Iranian revolution of 1979 will one day be seen as an epochal event on a par with the French revolution of 1789 or the Russian revolution of 1917."
"Like them, it immediately spilled out from behind its borders and sought to replicate itself around the world; like them, it disregarded all established norms of international law, of national sovereignty, of territorial jurisdiction."
"What was the signature act of the revolution?"
"It was the siege of the US Embassy."
"Now stop and ponder for a moment how extraordinary that was, given the precedent of relations between countries."
"Even in the Second World War, when mutually opposed ideologies fought to extirpate each other, diplomats were peaceably evacuated through neutral countries."
"If the United States were to invade Cuba tomorrow, one assumes that there would be a peaceable exchange of diplomatic personnel."
"What the Iranians were signalling was that their rules did not match ours; they no longer cared about the idea of state sovereignty and they have carried on as they started, sponsoring their militias from the Silk Road Khanates to the Balkans, even as far afield as Buenos Aires."
"We would be in a stronger position to condemn such a regime if we in the European Union gave a little more regard to the principle of national sovereignty and the principle of national self-determination."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I wished to explain why I abstained from the final vote on the report on Iran because, while I agree with all the criticism against the lack of respect for human rights in Iran, especially with regard to the death penalty, the persecution of sexual minorities, and the lack of respect for freedom of teaching in schools and universities, I am nevertheless convinced that much of the news and information this report refers to comes directly from the US propaganda mill and I cannot trust it"
"Finally, as a Liberal Democrat, while I am, of course, convinced that Iran has every right to pursue the development of nuclear research for peaceful purposes, neither would I deny its right to have nuclear weapons in a region where the only power that has them and is allowed to have them is a racist, colonialist state like Israel."
"(FI) Madam President, regarding this UN human rights resolution, I wish to say that it is very important that we in the European Union stand up for human rights until the end."
"Unfortunately, this human rights resolution was not wellbalanced."
"When you read it, and especially point 19, you get the feeling that one state, Israel, is being condemned far too much and that people are trying to lay the blame here on that country."
"We are all aware of the situation in the Middle East at present."
"Countries there are witnessing uprisings, in which thousands of innocent people have lost their lives."
"In this respect, this should have been a resolution on human rights, not on the Middle East."
"If the aim had been to find a balance here, instead of attempting to blame Israel in this biased way, mention could perhaps have been made of Gilad Shalit, the Israeli soldier who has been deprived of human rights for 1 720 days as a prisoner of the Palestinian Arabs or Hamas."
"When we produce these human rights declarations, we must aim for a balanced, fair approach."
"That is the only way that they can be taken forward sustainably and which will enable us, furthermore, to retain credibility as guardians of human rights both in Europe and further afield."
"(GA) Madam President, I was delighted that the motions for a resolution on human rights were adopted, and it was right for the European Union to do so."
"But I have a short explanation to make."
"Madam President, regarding Amendment 2, paragraph 8, my Irish colleagues and I in our group voted in favour because we consider sanitation and, above all, clean water, to be a fundamental human right, and from my own experience of working in Africa on a voluntary basis, I saw the difference access to fresh water makes to the lives of people."
"So I feel that, by accepting it as a fundamental human right, this may create the urgency to ensure that all citizens of the world have access, above all, to clean fresh water."
"(GA) Therefore, I was delighted that it was adopted - that is what I had to say."
"Written explanations of vote"
"This motion for a resolution has been adopted in view of the worrying state of media law in Hungary, which calls into question the requirement of balanced coverage for all providers of audiovisual media, respect for proportionality and the fundamental rights of expression and information."
"This means that the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and Parliament share legitimate concerns about the fact that this legislation contradicts international standards on freedom of expression, the abolition of political and financial independence for public media services, or the scope of regulation."
"These concerns are even more worrying given the warning issued by the Council of Europe's Commissioner for Human Rights."
"Based on these findings, the recommendations of this motion should be adopted, as they concern revising legislation on media based on observations by the Commission, the OSCE and the Council of Europe, and should urge the Commission to draw up a draft directive on the freedom and pluralism of the media by the end of the year in order to address the EU's inadequate legislative framework, and thus avoid similar situations in future."
"Media pluralism and freedom is one of the EU's fundamental principles, guaranteeing the freedom to express opinions and to receive and communicate information without control, interference or pressure from public authorities."
"International organisations have expressed concern over the Hungarian media law, and having conducted an investigation, the European Commission concluded that it is incompatible with the Audiovisual Media Services Directive and the acquis communautaire in general."
"I agree with the proposal made in the resolution that the Hungarian authorities must review the media law further on the basis of the comments made by the European Commission, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Council of Europe's Commissioner for Human Rights, the Committee of Ministers and Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, ensuring this law's conformity with EU law and European values, as well as standards on media freedom, pluralism and independence."
"The Hungarian Government has done a good job of dealing with all the brouhaha surrounding this controversial law in such a way that it has made it clear that freedom of the press and media pluralism have been and remain fundamental pillars in Hungary."
"The European Commission has done some fine work here."
"Moreover, the Commission will, rightly, continue to monitor this issue, not only in Hungary, but in all Member States of the European Union."
"The initiative, announced by Commissioner Kroes, to bring together different stakeholders to form a group of experts, who will then be tasked with tackling the media pluralism situation in Europe, is an important step forward."
"This group will assist the Commission in outlining new steps for the media landscape."
"We have been tasked with guaranteeing media pluralism and freedom of the press in Europe."
"I therefore assume that the European Parliament will actively contribute to this."
"Democracy is by no means a matter of fact."
"It evolves, progresses and, unfortunately, also regresses over time."
"Yet, at this level, the Hungarian measures on the media are a serious step backward."
"The agreement of all the European progressives made it possible, initially, for the issue to be put at the top of the European political agenda, which is a good thing."
"It is now a question of being precise and firm on the points that continue to pose a problem."
"The independence of media governance and freedom of expression are not negotiable."
"I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution, because the Hungarian media law should be suspended and reviewed on the basis of the comments and proposals from the Commission, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Council of Europe, in order to ensure that it is fully in conformity with EU law and European values and standards on media freedom, pluralism and independent media governance."
"Furthermore, the European Parliament recalls that the Copenhagen criteria for EU membership, as established in 1993 at the Copenhagen European Council, relating to freedom of the press and freedom of expression should be upheld by all EU Member States and enforced through relevant EU legislation."
"Thus, the European Parliament calls on the Hungarian authorities to restore the independence of media governance and halt state interference with freedom of expression and balanced coverage."
"Moreover, I believe that over-regulation of the media is counterproductive, jeopardising effective pluralism in the public sphere."
"In addition, Parliament calls on the Commission to propose a legislative initiative on media freedom, pluralism and independent governance before the end of the year with a view to defining at least the minimum essential standards and in order to ensure, guarantee and promote an adequate level of media pluralism and independent media governance in the EU Member States."
"Media pluralism and freedom definitely constitute an important pillar of democratic rule of law."
"The media law in Hungary does deserve criticism, but we have seen that the Hungarian Government was targeted and attacked in a hasty and unfounded manner and this should not have happened, especially at the start of the Hungarian Presidency of the European Union."
"However, I am pleased that the Hungarian Parliament has recently approved amendments to its controversial media law to address points proposed by the European Union, and in doing so, took the wind from the sails of those ideologists inciting tensions."
"The key requirement that 'balanced coverage' would not apply to websites, blogs, debates and foreign newsletters was met."
"The European Commission should now continually monitor the application of the law."
"Credit should be given to the constructive dialogue that took place between Hungary and the EU and which resulted in the legislative amendments being approved."
"The foreign media and journalists working in Hungary are no longer threatened by large penalties for violating Hungarian media law, but there are 'other legal consequences'."
"However, Hungarian media owners are still subject to penalties, including those which have formally transferred their headquarters to other countries in the EU in order to avoid the media law in Hungary."
"Although we may disagree with this amendment, it is fully within the competency of the Hungarian Parliament and EU representatives should respect it."
"The freedom of expression of each individual, the free movement of information and the freedom and pluralism of the media are the cornerstones of European integration and its core values."
"The development and implementation of a regulatory framework for the media should respect the democratic standards for the organisation and governance of communication systems."
"I call upon the Hungarian authorities to restore independent governance of the media and to put an end to state interference in freedom of expression."
"Excessive regulation of the media is counterproductive, as it harms real pluralism in the public domain."
"I call upon the Hungarian authorities to involve all interested parties in reforming media law, including the opposition parties and civil society, so that they can participate in a meaningful way in the reform of this legislation, which regulates such a fundamental aspect for the functioning of a democratic society."
"The freedom and pluralism of the media are fundamental rights which ensure the freedom to express opinions and to receive and communicate information without any kind of interference or pressure from the public authorities."
"The European Commission, as the guardian of the Treaties, expressed its concern and requested information from Hungary on a possible violation of this right, namely, the fact that Hungarian media law may not comply with the directive on audiovisual media services."
"I was pleased to learn that on 7 March, the Hungarian Parliament adopted the amendments that had been agreed between its government and the Commission, although I cannot understand why the socialists and Hungarian green party voted against it."
"Given the statements by Commissioner Kroes, it seems that there is no longer any doubt that Hungary has followed the Commission's recommendations, and that the altered version of the law in question respects European legislation."
"Freedom of the press can brook no compromise; this is the message that Parliament wished to convey not only to Budapest but also to the European Commission."
"The European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on the Hungarian Government to suspend and to carry out an 'urgent re-examination' of the controversial Hungarian media law package, even though it was recently amended under pressure from its European partners."
"However, there is still concern, especially as regards the Media Council, the body responsible for supervising the media, which is composed entirely of individuals who are aligned with the party of Mr Orban."
"In reality, this supervisory body is the perfect instrument for censoring the media."
"For this reason, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, guarantor of the freedom of expression of citizens in the EU and around the world, has called for an end to state interference, in order to restore independence to the media."
"I voted for this resolution as I think that the European Union must be prompt in preventing and combating any possible attacks against the fundamental values of democracy, with the freedom of expression being one of them."
"I believe that it is essential for Hungary and other Member States, like Romania, to reconsider their attitude to the press, in line with the democratic principles set out in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and in the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights."
"I voted in favour of the resolution on media law in Hungary, as the freedom of the press is one of the fundamental values of the EU."
"I believe that the Commission should pursue a detailed examination of whether the Hungarian media law conforms to European legislation, particularly with the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"I believe that it does not make any sense for Parliament to deliver an opinion on this issue at a time when all guarantees of freedom of expression have been given, including by the Hungarian Prime Minister, Mr Orbán."
"Moreover, this is a question of principle, so I shall refrain from appraising political, legislative and jurisdictional acts that lie strictly within the competence of the legislative, executive and judicial authorities of a Member State other than my own."
"Freedom of expression and information, including the freedom to express opinions and the freedom to receive and communicate information without interference or pressure, are social values which many have fought for over the years, including in Portugal."
"The Communists have been, and are now, in the front line of this fight."
"Unfortunately, there are still reasons to continue with it in various EU countries."
"The pluralism and freedom of the media continue to provoke concern in various Member States."
"It is often forgotten that some of the contributing factors for this are the way in which the ownership of media bodies is concentrated in a handful of large business groups, the attack on the rights of media professionals and the existence of increasingly precarious working relationships."
"Added to this, there is interference by the political powers that still exist in many countries, and which is a cause for concern."
"Freedom of expression and information, with the resulting pluralism of the media, including the freedom to express opinions and to receive and communicate information without any kind of interference or pressure from the public authorities, has been achieved by civilisation."
"Unfortunately, however, in various countries in the EU, we often see attacks on these fundamental rights."
"The pluralism and freedom of the media continue to provoke concern in various Member States, particularly in Hungary, Italy, Bulgaria, Romania, Estonia, and others."
"Even in Portugal, several cases have been reported of attacks on media pluralism, which do nothing to dignify democracy."
"However, we disagree that there is a policy of permanent political interference by the EU in the governance of each country, as stated in certain paragraphs."
"We voted on the resolution on media law in Hungary in view of this, taking its positive and negative aspects into account."
"I am convinced that a very broad majority in the European Parliament will uphold the fundamental rights of the media."
"These rights are now being called for in a resolution, although the amendments to this law which were adopted this week in the Hungarian Parliament have not been taken into account."
"I would therefore have liked all resolutions that were drawn up before this vote in Budapest to be withdrawn in order for them first to be updated and only then to be debated and put to the vote."
"Consequently, the vote in the European Parliament no longer had anything to do with freedom of the press, which should have absolutely priority, but was simply a trial of strength between the groups."
"I fully endorse the adoption of this resolution from the European left criticising the inadequacy of the amendments made by Hungary to its media law, while the right welcomes them."
"Though Mrs Kroes also seems satisfied with these changes, the European Parliament considers that the Commission only focused on a few technical aspects to the detriment of the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"Also, not only is our resolution addressed to Hungary but notes that, unfortunately, freedom and pluralism of the media can be undermined in countries with conservative governments."
"In this sense, the Members of the European Parliament have demonstrated that they are mindful that fundamental rights and liberties, which are the very principles of the democracies and of the European Union, must be respected."
"I voted in favour of this document, because the Hungarian authorities must restore the independence of media governance and halt state interference with freedom of expression and balanced coverage."
"Over-regulation of the media is counterproductive, jeopardising effective pluralism in the public sphere."
"in writing. - The ECR wholeheartedly supports a free and plural media across the European Union and stresses the importance of freedom of information for all European citizens."
"However, given the constantly changing situation surrounding the Hungarian media law and a lack of opportunity to meet the Commission following the new amendments to this law which were adopted this week, we feel that now is not the appropriate time to have another resolution on the issue."
"For this reason, the ECR Group has abstained."
"in writing. - I voted for this resolution because I believe the Hungarian media law should be suspended as a matter of urgency and reviewed on the basis of the Commission's, the OSCE's and the Council of Europe's comments and proposals, in order to ensure that it is fully in conformity with EU law and European values and standards on media freedom, pluralism and independent media governance."
"I support the amendment of the provisions in the Hungarian press law regarded by the European Commission as less democratic, and I welcome the amendments made to the regulatory act by the government in Budapest."
"However, I did not vote for the resolution signed by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left because I feel that the measures being proposed are excessive if we consider similar laws in other Member States, but which have not been sanctioned publicly."
"A free press is irrefutably a measure of the degree of democracy in a society."
"In the European Union it is well known that freedom of expression is virtually unrestricted."
"However, we must not confuse this fundamental right with the freedom to utter any information without consequence or responsibility and without having conclusive proof."
"This is precisely why clear laws are required, which will set the boundaries within which any journalistic activity needs to operate."
"The Hungarian press law was drafted in this context, in the wake of the European directive in this area."
"I also believe that we need to discuss the topic of the Hungarian press law on a fully informed basis, given that we can be misled by biased interests and political disputes."
"This motion for a resolution is inappropriate in both timing and form, as everyone knows that following the initial criticism made about media law in Hungary and the recommendations made by the Commission, the Hungarian Government has revised its position and altered everything about the law that was the target of criticism by the Commission."
"Therefore, the law voted upon by the Hungarian Parliament on 7 March was a version that complied perfectly with European legislation."
"That is why I do not understand the Left's insistence on voting on this motion, so I voted against it."
"I voted in favour of resolution because I believe that the new media law in Hungary does not give sufficient guarantee of freedom of expression and pluralism, and is therefore counterproductive for the establishment of real pluralism in the public sphere."
"The Hungarian Government should provide an effective guarantee of freedom and pluralism in the media, and should therefore revoke the law, or modify it substantially, based on the observations and proposals of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe, the Council of the European Union and the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights, and by means of an open, transparent debate in which all stakeholders, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and citizens can participate."
"Freedom of expression and, hence, freedom of the press, are some of the most important fundamental rights."
"We must work tirelessly to preserve them, even when the expression of certain opinions troubles us."
"This freedom is also our freedom and it is a guarantee of the free exercise of our mandate."
"Transparency is not possible without a free media."
"There is a great temptation to seek to control information and journalists, including in our Western democracies."
"Free and professional information is always preferable to 'rumour', which often replaces the press when the latter is muzzled."
"Modern means of mass communication play an absolutely critical role in democratic life and are fundamental to providing universal access to knowledge, entertainment and social life."
"Therefore, what I call the 'just state' must assume responsibility for supporting the development of a free media both domestically and internationally, promoting the pluralism of information and the richness of cultural creation, and facilitating access for all to this content."
"in writing. - It is known that according to commentaries and proposals from the European Commission, the OSCE, and the European Council, the media law in Hungary should be revised as soon as possible in order to ensure its correspondence to EU legislation and European virtues and standards which relate to the freedom of media information, pluralism and the independence of the mass media."
"The new law is blamed because it implies that there would be only one person appointed responsible for the management of the national mass media and telecommunications."
"The new legislation undermines the pluralism and freedom of the mass media and removes its political and financial independence."
"All causes which lead to such a negative result should be examined."
"Possibly the permissiveness of governments ruling some of the EU Member States gave the government of Hungary an illusion that commonly adopted rules can be cynically breached."
"For instance, the Latvian Government still has not implemented the European Parliament's resolution of 11 March 2004."
"And what has happened as a result?"
"Nothing so far."
"Possibly the Hungarian Government was inspired by Latvian 'independence'."
"I voted 'for' in the hope that the ice has broken up."
"The attacks of the European left on the law on press freedom recently adopted in Hungary should be read within the context of the piece of theatre whereby tools made available by our institutions are often used in an improper and instrumental manner to support international or domestic political and media disinformation campaigns."
"In this case, such attacks are completely misplaced, because the debate has been opened and also closed: the Hungarian Government has readily accepted the comments made by the European Commission, and Prime Minister Orban said, back at the start of January 2011, that the media law would be amended in accordance with those comments."
"Attacking the country that chairs the European Union at a time when it should be supported in the performance of its duties has the effect of weakening the Union as a whole and depriving it of its authority."
"The constant refrain of the lack of press freedom is old news, as are the continuous and anachronistic references to the Italian situation, in which, paradoxically, the major newspapers are controlled by left-leaning media groups and information runs freely, sometimes too freely, on the web."
"Following the amendments adopted by the Hungarian Parliament last week, the Hungarian law is now completely in line with EU legislation and provisions on fundamental rights, as the European Commission has also agreed."
"As such, the joint motion for a resolution is now redundant, which is why I voted against it."
"As I had the chance to say when I took part in the debate on the priorities of the Hungarian Presidency, these are aspects of Hungary's internal affairs which may be regulated, as before, as part of a healthy, normal relationship between the Commission and the Hungarian Government and Parliament."
"As an advocate of freedom, particularly freedom of expression and of the press, I can only be delighted with the results."
"in writing. - This law has effectively been designed with the intention of restricting media activities in Hungary and limiting critical scrutiny of the government, as part of wider restrictions on pluralism in Hungary."
"This is in direct conflict with the core principles of the EU, as set out in the Treaties and the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"The Commission and the Council must continue to push for the complete overhaul or withdrawal of the law on this basis."
"Parliament has made it clear that the Commission should not simply roll over and give in to the Hungarian Government on this crucial issue."
"The Hungarian media law must also be seen as just the latest attempt to limit media freedom in Europe."
"It highlights the urgent need for the Commission to come forward with robust legislative proposals for upholding this core EU value."
"I voted against this resolution because I believe that the political groups of the left who sit in this Chamber have exploited a national political issue, which in any case has already been resolved, as evidenced by the recent agreement between the Hungarian Government and the European Commission."
"I believe that such national issues should not be brought into question in this House as they are the direct responsibility of individual Member States."
"On the substance of the matter, it is right and proper to protect the freedom and pluralism of information as a core value of all European Union countries, but freedom of the media must not contradict public morals and, above all, must not invade anyone's privacy."
"The news industry should be more aware of the consequences that an unbalanced use of its power and influence can have on the life and liberty of citizens."
"This is because all too often, personal freedom has been quashed in the name of press freedom."
"in writing. - I am very pleased that this resolution was passed highlighting the European Parliament's commitment to freedom of expression and the independence of the media throughout Member States."
"I voted in favour of the joint motion for a resolution."
"Although Hungary and the European Commission have reached an agreement on the points put forward by the Commission, I support the call made by my fellow Members for a thorough examination of the text of the law."
"The improvements achieved by the Commission are remarkably selective and the concerns expressed by Parliament and by various international organisations, such as the OSCE and the Council of Europe, have been largely disregarded."
"The concern about the appointment, composition and powers of the media authority, in particular, is perfectly understandable."
"Freedom of the press is too important a part of our democracy for it to be subjected to legally restrictive interpretations."
"in writing. - (DE) I voted against this resolution tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe."
"The motion's authors are not as concerned about freedom of the media in Europe as they are of disparaging a civic government that was elected by an overwhelming majority of its country's people and which has the difficult task of rebuilding a country that suffered badly as a result of mismanagement by the previous socialist government."
"Even the European Commission was unable to find any serious violations of the freedom of the media in the Hungarian law, which, incidentally, has already been amended."
"Europe's left is very quick to see the speck of sawdust in the eye of non-socialist governments, but stupidly pays no attention to the plank in the eyes of socialist governments."
"It is difficult to understand the position of the German Liberals, who, with this resolution, are calling for regulation of the media landscape at European level, whereas the German and European media representatives consider this proposal, in particular, to be a restriction of media freedom and an infringement of subsidiarity."
"I am in favour of this motion for a resolution, as I believe that Gaddafi's regime should be destroyed immediately, given the way that he is repressing the Libyan population in their political protests and as a way of preventing more deaths."
"I recall that the international community has shown complete unanimity in the UN Security Council on the imposition of sanctions on this regime."
"I strongly support UN Security Council Resolution 1970/2011 and the measures to be taken by the Security Council, including the embargo, banning equipment that is being used for domestic repression and freezing the funds of people involved in human rights abuses, calling attention to the need to implement the EU-Africa Resolution, which allows the freezing of goods that have been acquired illegally."
"A gesture like this is needed from the European financial institutions and the Member States as part of the ban on mercenary activity."
"Swift and effective humanitarian action is needed from the EU and the UN."
"I should like to finish by saying that the events in Libya, Egypt and Tunisia require a paradigm shift of European foreign policy as regards the southern Mediterranean countries, and I would like to show my solidarity with the Libyans."
"I voted in favour of this resolution."
"The massive protests in numerous Arab countries have shown that undemocratic and authoritarian regimes cannot guarantee credible stability and that democratic values are central to economic and political partnerships."
"The EU has a vital interest in a democratic, stable, prosperous and peaceful North Africa, but recent events in Libya, Egypt and Tunisia have highlighted the urgent need for a revision of the EU's external policy towards the Mediterranean region."
"The EU must revise its democracy and human rights support policy so as to create an implementation mechanism for the human rights clause in all agreements with third countries."
"I agree that the European Neighbourhood Policy review must prioritise criteria relating to the independence of the judiciary, respect for fundamental freedoms, pluralism, freedom of the press and the fight against corruption."
"I voted for this resolution, which is a step in the right direction as regards the reaction of the European Union to the revolution, which is degenerating into civil war, in Libya."
"Revolutions are a dream that becomes reality, but civil war is a nightmare."
"With the opponents losing ground under fire from Gaddafi's troops and mercenaries, and the Colonel sending emissaries to European capitals in an attempt to save his regime, we need to show the Libyan people that we stand by them."
"We have heard the appeal that the Interim Transitional National Council made on 5 March."
"It is our duty to support this alternative and to protect the Libyan people against the forces of the regime."
"With no direct military presence on Libyan soil, a no-fly zone should be considered."
"But the decision rests with the UN."
"However, this option could only be envisaged with the explicit consent of the Arab League."
"At a political and diplomatic level, we have to ensure that Colonel Gaddafi is isolated and help the Libyan people to finally regain their freedom."
"The dramatic developments in Libya and North Africa continue to encroach on the borders of Europe: the humanitarian crisis in Libya, in fact, could turn into a wave of migration unprecedented in history."
"According to recent estimates, the political turmoil in North Africa could lead some 300 000 refugees to end up on the southern shores of the Union."
"I agree with and support, therefore, the appeal launched by six EU Mediterranean Member States for the creation of a Solidarity Fund to help alleviate the effects posed by immigration."
"I support the creation of a common European asylum system and the fair distribution of costs relating to immigration between Member States."
"Furthermore, in order to limit mass immigration to Europe, I call for consideration to be given to the sending of humanitarian aid to affected populations, both to support the process of democratisation and economic growth in the region."
"I therefore urge the Commission to prepare an emergency plan that also considers how we can deal with even the worst-case scenario in which a massive number of immigrants decide to head north to the shores of Europe."
"In my view, such an emergency plan must be supported by the principle of solidarity between EU Member States."
"The recent protests in several Arab countries show that regimes that are non-democratic and authoritarian cannot ensure credible stability, and that democratic values have a key role in economic and political partnerships."
"I should like to call for close engagement with the work of the task force created to coordinate the EU response to the crisis in Libya and the rest of the Mediterranean region."
"The Union for the Mediterranean needs to adapt to the new times and circumstances, and to reflect and act upon the recent events, with the aim of submitting proposals on a better way of promoting democracy and human rights in their Member States and in the region, which includes Libya, and on possible reforms to make its own role stronger and more coherent and effective."
"I voted in favour of the resolution on 'Southern Neighbourhood, and Libya in particular, including humanitarian aspects', because I believe that Colonel Gaddafi should abandon power immediately so as to allow a peaceful political transition and prevent any more spilling of blood."
"I vehemently condemn the violations of human rights in Libya and, in particular, the violent repression of pro-democracy demonstrators, journalists and advocates of human rights, and I should like to express my solidarity with the Libyan people."
"On the very day of voting for this resolution, it is still not clear how the revolutions, which have been attempting to overthrow authoritarian regimes, which have long remained in power all over the Mediterranean, will develop."
"In the case of Libya, the news about the successes and failures of the rebels and the forces that are still supporting Gaddafi's dictatorial regime are contradictory, and they appear to be facing a real civil war."
"Nevertheless, there are many sources denouncing unprecedented brutal violence and repression led by the Libyan regime, and the large number of victims that this has allegedly caused."
"The United Nations itself has rightly condemned the atrocities that have been committed."
"Today, it is clear that the rebels do not want to live under regimes that do not respect their rights and which do not ensure a modicum of respect for the rules of democracy and the rule of law."
"The European Union cannot alienate itself from what is happening."
"First, it should demand an end to the violence, persevere in its condemnation and sanctions imposed on those responsible, support those who are fighting for our common values and seek to show solidarity, as well as follow more closely and better understand the aspirations, wishes and tendencies of the movements which yearn for change."
"This resolution is worrying and unacceptable."
"This is particularly true in the context of the most recent events in Libya, which show the urgency of a peaceful and political solution like never before, without external interference."
"In the face of the dangerous and severe build-up of actions, which, instead of helping to reduce tension, are aimed at preparation for acts of aggression by the US and NATO against Libya, the majority of Parliament is endorsing acts of interference, aggression and occupation in Libya."
"Any aggression against this country, regardless of pretexts and mandates, would have serious consequences for a people that is already living in a situation of deep tension and insecurity."
"It would be deeply damaging to all those in Libya who are continuing to fight for their rights, democracy, sovereignty and peace, and would introduce serious elements of instability and conflict into the region."
"Any military attack on Libya, which would be inseparable from the aims of controlling the Libyans' natural resources, will be directed not only against the Libyan people, but against all the people in the region who have arisen and are continuing to fight for their social and political rights, for freedom, democracy and the real sovereignty and independence of their countries."
"We should like to express our deep concern about the most recent events in Libya, but we advocate a peaceful and political solution, without external interference."
"Unfortunately, the resolution by Parliament now advocates military intervention, since you cannot have a no-fly zone without military intervention."
"This resolution, therefore, instead of contributing to a peaceful solution, seems to be aimed at preparing for acts of aggression by the USA, NATO and perhaps the EU against Libya."
"We would thus like to express our firm opposition to any external military intervention in this country."
"Any aggression against Libya, regardless of pretexts and mandates, would have serious consequences for a people who are already living in a situation of deep tension and insecurity; it would be deeply damaging to all those in Libya who are continuing to fight for their rights, democracy, sovereignty and peace, and would introduce serious elements of instability and conflict into the region."
"Any military attack on Libya by the USA and its allies, which would be inseparable from their aims of controlling the Libyans' natural resources, would be directed not only against the Libyan people, but against all the people in the region who have arisen and are continuing to fight for their social and political rights, for freedom, democracy and the real sovereignty and independence of their countries."
"We are supporting these struggles."
"We therefore voted against this resolution."
"This resolution, adopted by a large majority and to which I contributed, shows that the European Parliament is not remaining silent on the situation in Libya."
"Quite the contrary, through its position, it is calling on the European Union, the Member States, and Baroness Ashton to support its proposals."
"It pledges its support for the Libyan people and advocates, among other things, recognising the Interim Transitional National Council of Libya and supporting the establishment of a no-fly zone in accordance with a United Nations mandate and in coordination with the Arab League and the African Union."
"It also condemns in the strongest possible terms the human rights violations in Libya by the regime and calls on Colonel Gaddafi to stand down immediately."
"My only regret is the issue of the refugees and migrants, which, I believe, has not been adequately taken into consideration and presented as a common challenge for these countries and for the European Union."
"I voted in favour of this document, because the EU must become involved in and support the Southern Neighbourhood, with specific reference to the development of the rule of law, good governance and the constitutional and electoral prerequisites for stable, pluralistic and peaceful democracy in the region."
"The Union for the Mediterranean must adapt to the new era and circumstances and reflect and act on recent events, in order to put forward proposals on how best to promote democracy and human rights in its Member States and in the region, including Libya, and on possible reforms, in order to make its own role stronger, more coherent and more effective."
"I endorsed the resolution on the Southern Neighbourhood, which devotes particular attention to the situation in Libya."
"In Libya, people who are fighting for their country's freedom are being killed."
"We should be helping them."
"Our resolution does help them, because it unequivocally condemns the dictator and supports those who want to make fundamental changes in Libya."
"We do not know when or how the civil war will end."
"We would like it to end quickly and for it to end in victory for the pro-democracy forces."
"The European Union should make contact with the Interim Transitional National Council without delay and begin the process for its official recognition."
"It should also encourage Libyans to make changes and to move towards democracy."
"Thank you very much."
"in writing. - I welcome the push for democracy in Libya and in neighbouring countries."
"I call for full respect of human rights in the region."
"However, I abstained on this resolution because of its call for a no-fly zone."
"To enforce a no-fly zone, we would have to bomb anti-aircraft missile sites, with a threat to civilian life."
"We would also allow the regime to claim that the West was attacking Libya, rather than attempting to defend the people of Libya."
"The negotiations necessitated by the developing situation [in Libya] should be carried out in a sensitive and proper manner."
"Additional and appropriate measures could then be taken based on a thorough analysis of the situation."
"These measures could provide the possibility for a direct solution and for support in the social sector and other areas."
"The aim should be to find a solution which will have a clear, and well-founded long-term vision, which will help preserve the sovereignty of this country, and which will rightly be tolerant of its traditions."
"The possible establishment of a much-discussed no-fly zone is one of the steps which, as has been said, should be carried out primarily with a view to protecting civilians."
"In this context, I consider it important that the mandate is clearly accepted by as many countries as possible and, in particular, that it should be in compliance with the mandate of the UN Security Council."
"When preparing motions for a resolution, the wealth of natural resources in this country should not be the only influencing factor."
"I voted for the text and the proposed measures concerning airspace in order to help the people in action against the tyrant who is bombing them."
"My vote was cast within the following strict framework: all acts of war, such as the creation of a no-fly zone, can only be decided by the UN and the UN alone."
"This action must be placed under the authority of the military command of the UN and the UN alone."
"All decisions must be taken in consultation with the organisations of the African Union and the Arab League."
"I am totally against the US idea of preventive bombing and against NATO intervention."
"Any other development would necessitate a different text and different provisions."
"What is happening in Libya is completely unacceptable, and the international community has to take more concrete measures that mean automatic suspensions for all types of attacks on civilians."
"A civil war in Libya seems worryingly imminent and must be avoided at all costs."
"The EU has to take a leading role in this process and help to find solutions that avoid exacerbating the conflict that is currently occurring in this country."
"I voted against the European Parliament joint resolution on Libya because it calls for the establishment of a no-fly zone over the country, which is the first step toward military intervention."
"We cannot in any way endorse the military solution for the Libyan crisis or for any other crisis."
"We were highly critical of the military interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan and must not make the same mistake now."
"The examples of those two countries should teach us that violence only begets more violence, which, in the end, has devastating consequences for civilians."
"In the case of Libya, I condemn the violence that Gaddafi is using against his people, and I sympathise with the people's protest movements."
"However, I believe that the solution in Libya must come from a cessation of violence and through diplomatic channels."
"The Libyan revolution was launched in the name of freedom, dignity and democracy by young people driven by a sense of statehood."
"One can only support this wonderful, awe-inspiring aspiration and firmly condemn those who attempt to suppress it by force, without hesitating to kill and wound thousands of civilians."
"I very much hope that the UN, in coordination with the Arab League and the African Union, will give a mandate to establish a no-fly zone over Libya in order to protect the population against possible attacks."
"I also hope that the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Baroness Ashton, will establish relations with the Interim Transitional National Council as soon as possible for it to be recognised as a legitimate interlocutor pending democratic elections."
"Over the last few weeks, we have witnessed the spectacular and promising upheaval of the geopolitical framework of this extremely sensitive region."
"I am convinced that an unprecedented perspective is opening up, which is creating the necessary conditions for the peaceful settlement of the conflict between Israel and Palestine."
"We must seize this opportunity to rid the Middle East of a conflict that has already caused too much pain, tragedy, resentment and misunderstanding."
"in writing. - I am 'overjoyed' by the number of loud statements and expressions of condemnation!"
"Where were you before?"
"Was Gaddafi born yesterday?"
"There was no terror in Libya?"
"Today, the cynicism of some EU leaders causes a sensation of disgust!"
"Until recently, all the leaders of the largest EU Member States were cuddling up to the Libyan leader and ingratiating themselves with him."
"And today they are ready to crucify Gaddafi!"
"It is better not to intrude in the internal affairs of another country, is it not?"
"Let the Libyans solve their problems themselves, otherwise we might see get a full-scale rebellion in Arab countries!"
"I abstained."
"In the fight to retain power, Gaddafi is using heavier and heavier artillery (such as the bombing of rebels) and is not afraid of a high death toll."
"These measures have been condemned in the strongest possible terms by the outside world, and the European Parliament is calling for a no-fly zone, in order to stop Gaddafi's bombers from attacking civilians, recognition of the Interim Transitional National Council and the pro-democracy movement as legitimate representatives of the Libyan people and the breaking off of all relations with Gaddafi."
"It remains to be seen whether the Heads of State or Government will comply with this call."
"On account of the possible resettlement and distribution of migrants in Europe, I abstained from the vote."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of this joint resolution concerning the current situation in Libya."
"Too many abuses and serious violations have been perpetrated by the Gaddafi regime against the population and I think it is our duty to adopt a common strong European stance."
"The measures proposed in the resolution adopted are a step in the right direction, starting from the desired closure of airspace over Libya, namely, the creation of a no-fly zone to prevent the regime from attacking the civilian population from the sky."
"I feel that it should be an obligation for the international community, and the European Union in the first instance, to establish relations with the Interim Transitional National Council of the insurgents in order to help initiate a process of democratisation in the country."
"The time has come for Europe to stand firm in asserting its voice to end this dramatic situation, which could also have severe repercussions throughout the EU, beginning with a massive wave of migration to Italy, in particular, and Europe in general."
"The severity of the situation currently being faced by the people of Libya, who are the victims of violent repression by the Gaddafi regime, which has caused countless deaths, injuries and refugees, requires determined and concerted action by the international community, and the EU should assume a leading role and adopt a firm stance in condemning those responsible for the atrocities committed, in the adoption and implementation of sanctions and appropriate measures, and also in supporting the legitimate democratic aspirations of this people."
"in writing. - I see paragraphs 10 and 11 (as amended) as being especially important in this text:"
"Calls on the HR/VP and the Member States to stand ready for a decision in the UNSC on further measures, including the possibility of a no-fly zone aimed at preventing the regime from targeting the population; Underlines that any measures enacted by the EU and its Member States should be in compliance with a UN mandate and seek coordination with the Arab League and the African Union, encouraging both organisations to steer international efforts;"
"11. Calls on the HR/VP to establish relations with the Interim Transitional National Council and to start the process to make them official so as to encourage transition towards democracy, ensuring the involvement of a wide spectrum of representatives of Libyan society and to empower women and minorities in the transitional process, and to support it in the liberated area so as to relieve the population and to meet its basic humanitarian needs, including medical assistance'."
"With this resolution, the European Parliament is calling on EU governments to recognise the Interim Transitional National Council as the official authority of the Libyan opposition."
"The resolution approved urges the EU to prepare for the possible establishment of a no-fly zone to prevent Colonel Gaddafi from striking out at the population and to assist the repatriation of those fleeing violence."
"I also believe it a strategically important option for the European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Baroness Ashton, to establish contact with representatives of the rebel Interim Transitional National Council in order to speed up the process of official recognition of that body."
"It is time that Colonel Gaddafi gave up power and put an end to the systematic violation of human rights which is operating in his country."
"On paragraph 15: with regard to Article 80 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, it remains the case that I - like the Austrian Government - advocate solidarity on a voluntary basis."
"It should be up to the Member States - according to the capacities of each one - to decide how far this solidarity can extend."
"I voted for the resolution of the European Parliament on Libya, which is a clear message of political support for the Libyan revolution."
"First and foremost, the European Parliament expressed its solidarity with the Libyan people and condemned the human rights violations and the violent repression being perpetrated by the Gaddafi regime."
"The no-fly zone is envisaged in paragraph 10 of the resolution and places it within the framework of the UN to prevent the regime from targeting the civilian population in coordination with the Arab League and the African Union."
"However, this paragraph may be subject to various interpretations."
"To some, it is simply about preventing the planes of Muammar al-Gaddafi from firing on the civilian population."
"This interpretation may give it a preventive role going as far as to prevent said planes from assassinating the Libyan population."
"To others, it is the first step towards possible military intervention."
"I abstained on this ambiguous paragraph."
"I therefore welcome the adoption of this resolution although I regret that it does not acknowledge the past errors of the Union in its relations with Libya, including on the subject of immigration."
"I voted in favour of the joint motion for a resolution."
"As an immediate neighbour and being under an obligation to comply with the principles of international law, which also include the right of peoples to self-determination, it is essential that we provide assistance to the people of North Africa."
"The method for doing so should, however, be chosen carefully: the request by the Libyan Interim Transitional National Council to refrain from direct military intervention must be respected also so as not to make the humanitarian situation of civilians even worse."
"I am in favour of this report as I believe that the government of Iran should respect the legitimate requests of its people for fundamental freedoms and the improvement of economic and social conditions, along with the desire for cooperation on the part of Iran with the international community."
"The approach to be adopted by the EU should treat the issue of human rights as a fundamental factor, on the one hand, and, on the other, recognise the stabilising role of Iran in the region on condition that it normalises relations with its neighbours and other international players, gives up its nuclear programme and improves human and democratic conditions."
"I also agree with the Council's position of a dual approach to the nuclear question: sanctions on the one hand, but offering dialogue on the other."
"As a final note, I should say that the EU should not be simplistic by putting the issue to Iran with reference only to its nuclear programme, but should also take account of human rights issues and the stabilising potential of the country in the region."
"Mr President, the painful parts of the Iranian issue are the massive violation of human rights, especially the use of the death penalty as a method of punishment."
"Whereas, on 12 May 2010, the EU called once again on Iran to introduce a moratorium on the death penalty, in accordance with United Nations General Assembly resolutions 62/149 and 63/168, Iran continues to hold the world record for executions of children and women and on the basis of sexual orientation."
"The controversial nuclear programme also raises serious concern due to a lack of transparency and non-cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency and a failure to comply with obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty."
"A further problem relates to telecommunications and the Internet, which are constantly being interrupted to the detriment of the international obligation to defend freedom of information."
"I therefore support this report and hope to see an improvement in the situation very shortly."
"The Islamic Republic of Iran (hereinafter referred to as Iran) is facing an array of governance challenges, from power struggles between competing factions within the country's ruling elites to a crippling social and economic malaise, a problematic regional security environment and rising popular discontent at home."
"The policies pursued by the Iranian regime do not respond to the justifiable demands of Iranian citizens."
"Popular discontent with the Iranian Government as a result of the grave socio-economic situation, combined with a lack of freedom and of basic respect for human dignity within the country, represent the main challenges to the regime's survival."
"Furthermore, there continues to be a high number of human rights violations in the country."
"According to annual reports on the death penalty in Iran, the number of executions in 2009 was the highest for the past 10 years, making Iran the country with the highest number of executions per capita in the world."
"I agree with the report's call for Iran to abolish definitively the death penalty for crimes committed before the age of 18 and to amend its legislation, which violates the international human rights conventions that Iran has ratified, including the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and call upon Iran to issue official statistics concerning the application of the death penalty."
"I voted for this report, because I think that Iran should put an end to all forms of discrimination, a situation which particularly affects women."
"Human rights and fundamental rights continue to be violated with impunity in Iran."
"The Iranian authorities should put an end to all forms of torture or any other kind of cruel and inhumane treatment once and for all, in law and in practice."
"Iran has a long and rich history, and a special identity that should be taken into account at a time when concerns are growing about the recent political and social developments in that country."
"Without relinquishing European values and the priority given to democracy and human rights, I believe that channels of dialogue should not be closed with Tehran, and that there should thus be an attempt to motivate the changes that this country so badly needs."
"I note with concern the recent attacks on members of the opposition and I hope that the Iranian regime understands how counterproductive this attitude is, and how likely it is to isolate them internationally."
"Once again, we should like to state that we do not share but rather condemn a restrictive and basic view of human rights."
"The EU often acts in a hypocritical way towards them in order to hide very different objectives."
"If this were not the case, many of the considerations and criticisms made here would extend to other countries in the region, such as Israel or Saudi Arabia, and the same criteria would apply to them that are now being applied to Iran."
"It is important to note that the existence of peace and security in the region is incompatible with the continued occupation of the Palestinian territories by Israel and the policy of aid which is granted to it by the USA and NATO, along with the complicity of the EU."
"The resolution neglects to mention this."
"The violation of human rights is a reprehensible act in Iran or in any other country in the world."
"In this report, the majority of Parliament resorts to its habitual hypocrisy, using an alleged human rights defence to mask the fact that its aim is to protect the strategic economic interests of the major powers, particularly its oil, rather than the freedom of the Iranian people."
"Invoking this freedom is a mere pretext."
"If the objective were effectively respect for human rights and the security of the region, it would be necessary to unmask this situation in other countries in the area such as Israel and Saudi Arabia, and to apply the same criteria to those countries."
"In addition, the report conceals the threat to peace and security in the region which arises from the continued occupation of the Palestinian territories by Israel and the policy of aid granted to it by the USA and NATO."
"We are against interference in the domestic matters of any country, whether they are against national sovereignty or against international law."
"We are therefore against the manipulation or use of certain forces or Iranian opposition parties and against campaigns that seek to preserve the interest of the EU and its allies, rather than the interests of the Iranian people."
"Mr Belder's report stresses in a pragmatic manner all the things that the EU should be concerned about with regard to Iran."
"Uncontrolled nuclear testing, a lack of fundamental freedoms, a climate hostile to foreign investment, government abuses and the divide between leaders and civil society."
"I think these are sufficient reasons to vote in favour of the EU's adopting a pragmatic attitude towards a major player in the regional setting of the Middle East and to support Mr Belder's report."
"I voted in favour of this document because democratic change cannot be imposed from outside or even by military means but has to be achieved through a peaceful democratic process."
"As you know, the proliferation risks in connection with the Iranian nuclear programme remain a source of serious concern to the European Union and to the international community, as expressed very clearly in many United Nations Security Council resolutions."
"The stabilising influence which Iran could potentially regain would be beneficial to the entire region, provided that it normalises its international relations, in particular, with its neighbours, dispels once and for all the concerns regarding the real aims of its nuclear programme and guarantees respect for human rights and democracy."
"in writing. - I voted for this report, which condemns the human rights situation in Iran and calls for measures to be taken to prevent Iran becoming a nuclear power."
"I am concerned that the resolution recognises 'Iran's right to enrich uranium' which is of course correct under the rules of the IAEA, but, given the continuing impasse in the negotiations, is contrary to the UN Security Council resolutions."
"President Ahmadinejad's regime continues to trample on the fundamental rights of the Iranian people with impunity, while the government itself is shaken by a number of uncertainties."
"On the one hand, the population has hopes of democratic change while, on the other, the Iranian Government and Parliament are disturbed by the presence of factions within the elites competing for power."
"Undoubtedly, however, democratic change cannot be imposed from the outside, but it should be the result of a democratic and peaceful process, finally conceding to calls for welfare and freedom from recent mass Iranian movements."
"The nuclear question is also still an issue."
"From our side, the EU should work for a diplomatic solution, based on an approach that combines pressure with ordinary dialogue."
"It would be advisable, for example, for the European Council to contribute to the freezing of assets of individuals linked to Iran's nuclear and weapons programmes."
"In the future, relations between the EU and Iran should, however, focus on analysing the numerous human rights violations."
"The Union should, in short, use all means at its disposal to draw up a univocal European Union position and let the Iranians know we are thinking about their future."
"Their human rights are our rights too."
"Iran's past and cultural history have to be considered as we approach its current political and social development."
"The constant violations of human rights in Iran are a cause for concern, but they cannot prevent a dialogue with it with the aim of putting an end to such incidents; we must be proactive in seeking solutions which will bring them to an end."
"The recent attacks on members of the opposition are worrying, and it is necessary to make the Iranian regime see that such behaviour only leads to greater international isolation."
"Iran's government has been facing serious challenges recently, creating growing levels of public discontent."
"Security forces responded with brute force and summarily arrested peaceful protesters; courts launched show trials en masse against students, scientists, women's rights activists, lawyers, journalists and members of the clergy."
"Numerous Iranians were executed for political reasons and untold numbers remain in prison."
"Iran is one of the three countries worldwide with the highest number of executions."
"We must do everything in our power to eliminate negative discrimination and social repression in Iran as soon as possible, thus ensuring that the country can take its first steps towards democratic change."
"However, this cannot be achieved from the outside or even by military means; it must be a peaceful and democratic process, which is why I support this proposal with my vote."
"Despite the fact that this report has been improved slightly after a number of amendments, I voted against it because it advocates a policy of sanctions that, in my opinion, will not improve the situation of the Iranian people; in fact, quite the opposite."
"In my opinion, the European Parliament report should diffuse the tension rather than increase it, because if diplomatic channels are exhausted, it will aggravate the already complicated situation for the people of Iran."
"In my opinion, the threats issued to Iran by the international community are not the best way to find a reasonable compromise in the dispute over the nuclear programme."
"That is why I voted against this report."
"I supported this resolution because, beyond the nuclear issue, the rapporteur did not shy away from addressing the internal situation of the country, the aspirations of the people for more democracy, and the human rights situation."
"We have a duty not to disappoint a young population, a population aspiring to live in a democracy and to respect each other's ideas."
"We have to support a people who aim to shape a rule of law in order to offer future generations a destiny founded on tolerance, freedom, justice and prosperity."
"We have to denounce the rapes, murders, summary executions, arbitrary arrests and harassment as unacceptable."
"Any violation of human rights is unacceptable."
"Yet, since the re-election of President Ahmadinejad in June 2009, we have seen an increase in such violations."
"Iran has the highest rate of executions per head of population in the world."
"The country is second to China as regards application of the death penalty by stoning in terms of the number of executions, and first on a per capita basis."
"It is time that Iran fulfilled its obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which it ratified of its own free will."
"Iran, as a signatory to the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, has, for a long time, arrogantly ignored its commitments, in particular, by concealing its nuclear operations."
"If Iran wants to maintain good relations with the EU and other democratic states, it must unequivocally remove all doubts as to the purpose of its nuclear programme."
"I also consider the consolidation of relations between Iran and Turkey, which assures the Union that it recognises shared values in an effort to obtain EU membership, while at the same time displaying open sympathy for the Iranian regime, to be a matter of concern for the EU."
"I would like to say that Iran holds the world record for the number of juveniles executed, and the number of executions per capita."
"The show trials of political opponents, and the exceptionally cruel punishment of stoning, which is used legally in Iran today, as well as other forms of cruel and inhumane torture, treatment and punishment, are characteristic of a regime which deserves robust moral condemnation."
"Apart from what has already been mentioned, the EU's priorities must include steadfast insistence on the declaration of a moratorium on executions until the death penalty is abolished, a call for an end to impunity over human rights violations and, of course, no more destabilisation of the region."
"in writing. - It is hilarious and, at the same time, very sad to talk about respect for rights and freedoms in a country which is ruled by a person who threatens to massacre the United States, Europe and Israel."
"There is no sense in negotiating with him about human rights and values and freedoms."
"Such people understand only power."
"It is necessary to stop being ceremonious and to start transferring from word to deeds."
"Complete isolation, severe sanctions, and a clear and consecutive position will yield a result."
"Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is a danger for global society."
"The lack of transparency in the Iranian Government and the limited cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency over the nuclear programme are certainly far from reassuring."
"The deterioration in the situation of fundamental human rights and its ability to destabilise the region through Hezbollah and Hamas are elements that add to the concerns that Iran is spreading throughout the world."
"Electoral fraud, violent repression of demonstrations and executions, which amounted to 680 in 2010 (twice as many as in the previous year) and the arrest of opposition leaders leave no doubts over the use of power and violence by the regime."
"The EU sanctions of 26 July 2010, in line with those of the UN, were proper and necessary."
"The Union must pay greater attention to Iran's nuclear policy in order to monitor developments in the field of conflict."
"The EU should support international diplomacy for the protection of human rights."
"The twin-track approach keeps the door open to dialogue, but it takes at least two to have a dialogue, and in the absence of goodwill on the part of Iran, sanctions should be strengthened and more targeted."
"We cannot accept that executions continue to rise to such an extent and that Iran's nuclear policy is beyond the control of the international community."
"I voted for the report by Mr Belder."
"We have been asking for a change of regime in Iran for far too long."
"Human rights are constantly being violated by the brains behind the current regime, whether we are talking about the disgraceful conditions in which the residents of the Ashraf opposition camp are kept, the constant violation of women's rights, discrimination against homosexuals, the censorship of artists, etc."
"At European level, what we can do is apply effective sanctions against the leaders of the regime."
"However, applying sanctions is not enough."
"The people in the country who are struggling to defend their human rights must be encouraged."
"Should the European Union not support all defenders of human rights in Iran?"
"The current push for democracy in North Africa should be extended to Iran."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of this report which outlines the severe situation which is being experienced in Iran, denouncing the practices of repression and the systematic violations of human rights perpetrated by the Iranian authorities and highlighting the need to earnestly seek a diplomatic solution to the nuclear issue."
"In particular, I should like to join in expressing solidarity with the Iranian people, who have been legitimately calling for democratic change in the country following the presidential elections in 2009."
"in writing. - This is the first report on Iran in Parliament since the Gahler Report in 2001."
"Since all negotiations on agreements between the EU and Iran have been on hold for years, the only way for Parliament to express a more in-depth position on this country is via an own-initiative report, which was initiated through a Green proposal."
"The EFD was given the task."
"4 political groups (Greens, S&D, ALDE and GUE) formulated joint amendments to the draft which were, to a large degree adopted, albeit by a slight majority."
"Important issues are: EU contacts with Iran (paragraph 32) where, as regards the background of the controversy over whether the EP's Iran delegation should be allowed to travel to Iran, the text now calls - contrary to the wishes of the rapporteur - for contacts with a broad range of actors, without making a direct reference to the delegation; sanctions (paragraph 42), where the text calls for targeted sanctions on the main human rights offenders - so far, there are only sanctions on persons linked to the nuclear dossier; and the opening of an EU embassy in Tehran - in parallel with almost all Member States that have a representation in the country."
"I support the text of this report because it highlights the main aspects that make Iran one of the most dangerous countries in the international arena, both in humanitarian and political terms."
"The country is now devastated by the arbitrary use of violence by security forces, who responded with a ruthless crackdown on peaceful demonstrations by arresting thousands of demonstrators."
"This gratuitous use of violence caused a progressive deterioration of the basic human rights of the Iranian people, who are continuously subjected to a punitive system contrary to any convention on the civil and political rights of man."
"As if that were not enough, the death penalty by stoning is still in force in this country, with an increasing number of executions, not to mention the fact that we still have no evidence that the nuclear installations in the country are being used for exclusively peaceful purposes."
"We are in favour of this report because it deals with the Iranian issue with the necessary toughness and severity, highlighting the contrasts in the country and the unacceptability that this situation should continue."
"The Iranian regime constantly applies repression against anyone who dares to rebel against absolutism, usually by applying the death penalty."
"In fact, it is the country holding the record for the highest number of child and per capita executions in the world."
"We also note that often, the death penalty is carried out by stoning for crimes as minor as allegations of adultery and apostasy."
"The report also highlights the repression of Christians and the Baha'i community."
"Iran continues to lose international credibility because of its political rhetoric and aggressive support for Islamic fundamentalism."
"I also want to stress the continuing acts of psychological and physical violence to which the dissident refugees in Camp Ashraf are continually subjected by the Iranian Government."
"in writing. - I am pleased that Mr Belder was able to bring this report to the House and successfully push through elements concerning human rights in Iran, in particular, the strong condemnation of the detention of Iranian opposition leaders Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karoubi, together with their wives."
"However, I do not agree that Iran has a 'right to enrich uranium', which is allowed under IAEA rules but, given the continuing impasse over negotiations, is contrary to UN Security Council resolutions."
"in writing. - I supported this report as I strongly believe that the Iranian Government should respond positively to the Iranian people's demands for basic freedoms and improved social and economic conditions."
"Through this report, the European Parliament condemns the use of the death penalty as well as numerous other abuses of human rights."
"I voted in favour of the report by Mr Belder on the EU's approach towards Iran."
"I share the concerns of the majority of Europeans with regard to Iran's nuclear programme and the assurances of the Iranian regime that it will only be used for civilian purposes."
"That notwithstanding, I am of the opinion that, in its cooperation with third countries in the energy sector, the European Union should only make use of sustainable, green and safe energy sources - in keeping with its climate protection targets."
"I also support the opinion of my fellow Member that the EU should devise a broader strategy towards Iran which goes beyond the nuclear issue and also addresses the human rights situation and other important matters."
"I voted for the report by Mr Belder because, despite the numerous problems related to Iran's domestic and foreign policy such as, for example, the possible use of nuclear weapons, the lack of transparency in certain government decisions, and, in some cases, the failure to respect fundamental human rights, I believe that a policy based exclusively on sanctions cannot bring great benefits."
"I therefore believe it is important for the European Union to preserve and, where possible, maintain forms of dialogue with the government in Tehran."
"I am unconditionally voting for this joint resolution, which highlights the importance of the issues discussed with regard to the rights of people belonging to minorities, and to promoting the defence of human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as of the rights of the child, while at the same time combating terrorism."
"I should like to draw attention to the conclusions, and I agree that the EU must enhance its practice of speaking with a single voice as this would increase its visibility and influence as a global player, and the delegations in Geneva and New York need to increase the coherence, visibility and credibility of EU action in the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC)."
"I agree with the resolution, which indicates that Member States should encourage the UNHRC to give equal attention to discrimination based on all the principles including gender, race, age, sexual orientation, religion or belief."
"I also agree with the review, which highlights the need for the UNHRC to be more active as a mechanism for early warning and prevention, to uphold special procedures and safeguard the independence of the post of High Commissioner for Human Rights, and to maintain the necessary financing in order to preserve its regional offices."
"The European Union and its Member States are committed to guaranteeing respect for human rights in their own policies."
"It is therefore very important for the EU to be able to assume a strong and influential position in international organisations, in particular, within the United Nations Human Rights Council, ensuring effective and consistent implementation of human rights policy internationally."
"I agree that the UNHRC's work and mandate must be reviewed, allowing the Council's methods of work to be assessed and enhanced, so that it is possible to react to human rights violations as efficiently and systematically as possible."
"On several occasions, the UNHRC has been unable to address serious human rights situations in an urgent and timely manner because of the absence of adequate instruments."
"The UNHRC should therefore be better equipped to address both chronic and emergency situations, through the expansion of the human rights toolbox, by using panels not just during but also in-between sessions."
"In turn, the EU must make the UNHRC a priority and coordinate better among the Member States, which would allow the EU to better use its influence within the wider UN system and would facilitate coordination and decision making in the area of human rights."
"I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution, because the European Union and its Member States should guarantee respect for human rights in their own policies, and the European Union's position in the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) should be stronger and more effective."
"Priorities for the Session of the United Nations Human Rights Council and the 2011 review are necessary, because only then can we assess how the Human Rights Council has implemented its mandate and determine the methods of work that must be enhanced so that the UNHRC is more efficient and responds to human rights violations promptly."
"The European Parliament regrets the fact that on several occasions, the UNHRC has been unable to address serious human rights situations in an urgent and timely manner because of the absence of adequate instruments, and actively seeks the creation of dedicated UNHRC mechanisms to respond promptly to the human rights crises in, for example, the Middle East, Iran and Belarus."
"Furthermore, it is very important for the UNHRC to be better equipped to address both chronic and emergency situations, perhaps through the expansion of the human rights toolbox, by using panels not just during but also in-between sessions."
"Parliament also calls on EU Member States to actively engage in the 2011 review of the UNHRC to strengthen compliance with its mandate."
"I voted in favour of this resolution as I believe that the agenda of the 16th regular session of the Human Rights Council lays down important issues which are of particular relevance."
"I wish to highlight the importance of the agenda, which includes reports on the 'rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities' and on the 'promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism', as well as extensive meetings on the rights of the child."
"The 16th session of the United Nations Human Rights Council will take place during a particularly turbulent historical period, which undermines its very composition, given that some of its members are far from complying with the provisions of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and promoting and protecting human rights, in accordance with its mission."
"The European Union must actively participate in this session and do all it can to ensure that its universalistic view of human rights based on personal dignity becomes increasingly widespread and effectively implemented in every country in the world."
"The designation of a European high representative for human rights may contribute to the greater visibility of the Union's positions and the insistence by the Member States of the Council on the 'one message, but with many voices' strategy, and has the potential to raise increasing support for European positions."
"The European Parliament has long had a policy of double standards concerning human rights."
"It is also well known that it has a narrow and self-serving conception of the declaration adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948: the Universal Declaration of Human Rights."
"Once again, in this report, the selective way in which various countries are mentioned is clear."
"Countries with which the EU maintains economic and diplomatic relations, and to which it attributes strategic importance, have been left out because of the strategic interests they serve, despite their serious violations of human rights."
"Examples of these countries include Israel, Columbia and Morocco, to name but three, on different continents."
"For our part, we do not have a restrictive view of human rights."
"We take the entire content of the declaration seriously, which we feel, most importantly, inspired our political intervention."
"Finally, we object to the idea of the European Union having a permanent seat on the United Nations General Assembly for the simple reason that it would not make sense in light of the spirit and principles of the organisation, contained in the United Nations Charter."
"The UN is, and must continue to be, an organisation of independent and sovereign states."
"The selectiveness surrounding the countries criticised in this report and the self-serving nature of this debate is clear."
"The hypocritical use of this report is obvious, as the countries with which the EU has good economic and diplomatic relations and those which are of strategic importance are not criticised, despite their violations of human rights, including, for example, Columbia and Honduras."
"There is no call for an end to Morocco's occupation of the Western Sahara or Israel's occupation of Palestine."
"Moreover, we cannot support the idea of the European Union having a permanent seat on the United Nations General Assembly because the UN is an organisation made up of sovereign and independent states and the European Union is not a state according to the UN Charter."
"The defence of human rights, including the fact that they are indivisible and cannot be ranked, and that they are a prerequisite for respecting the rights of people and for genuine social justice, peace, freedom and democracy, form the framework of our political action."
"You can count on us to defend human rights, but do not count on us for exercises in hypocrisy."
"I voted in favour of this document, because the United Nations Human Rights Council is a unique platform specialising in universal human rights and a specific forum dealing with human rights within the UN system, and it is also entrusted with the important task and responsibility of strengthening the promotion, protection and respect of human rights around the globe."
"I would like to underline the importance of the 16th Session of the UNHRC and particularly the UNHRC review process, which provides for a unique opportunity to assess how the Council has implemented its mandate and presents an occasion for the Council to enhance its methods of work in order to respond more efficiently and systematically to human rights violations."
"I welcome the fact that on the agenda of the 16th regular session are, among others, reports on the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities, and on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, as well as extensive meetings on the rights of the child."
"The 16th Session of the UN Human Rights Council offers a unique opportunity to evaluate the way in which the Council has fulfilled its mandate and, at the same time, a chance to improve the Council's working methods with the aim of ensuring a more effective and systematic response to situations involving the violation of human rights."
"I think that it is vital to set up, as part of the EU Council, a human rights working group which will include experts in human rights from all 27 EU Member States, based in Brussels."
"It would also be extremely useful to appoint a special high-level EU representative for human rights."
"I hope that the EEAS, in particular, the EU delegations in Geneva and New York, will, in the future, improve the coherence, raise the profile and boost the credibility of the EU's actions within the UN Human Rights Council by developing the EU's ability to interact and cooperate at an inter-regional level."
"I have just voted in favour of the European Parliament resolution on the priorities of the 16th Session of the UN Human Rights Council."
"Our resolution is particularly significant because we have today remembered the suppression of peaceful protests against the violent occupation of Tibet 52 years ago."
"The Dalai Lama announced his withdrawal from political life yesterday - this represents an historic loss."
"There are few people who are held in such high esteem by their own people and the world at large and who, at the same time, are so well liked as His Holiness."
"By withdrawing from political life, the Dalai Lama is in no way relinquishing his responsibility."
"He has stated that he continues to be committed to his spiritual role in relation to the concerns of the Tibetan people."
"His Holiness will transfer the political powers laid down in the Tibetan constitution to the freely elected government-in-exile."
"In this way, he will once again strengthen the democracy of the exiled Tibetan people, who are spread across all of the continents of the world."
"On 20 March, a new prime minister and a new parliament will be elected."
"I will witness the elections in Switzerland as an observer."
"We Europeans must help to further strengthen democracy and human rights for the Tibetan people."
"in writing. - I welcome this resolution, which emphasises the interdependence of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights and points out that access to water is a human right."
"I particularly welcome the adoption of Amendment 19 calling for a follow-up to the Goldstone report."
"In the midst of these difficult times that we are facing, especially in the North African regions, the 16th session of the UN Human Rights Council is of paramount importance."
"The European Union will therefore have to play a truly active role in this session and take every step to ensure its universalistic view of human rights based on respect for human dignity is followed by every country in the world."
"It is also important for the EU that a European high representative for human rights be appointed in order for its view on defending human rights to be increasingly widespread."
"Unfortunately I could not vote in favour of this European Parliament resolution on the priorities of the 16th Session of the UN Human Rights Council, because it lays down a number of points with which I disagree."
"The resolution calls for coordination with the United States in the area of human rights, it welcomes the appointment of Morocco as a co-facilitator in the Human Rights Council of the United Nations, and encourages the EU to maintain 'common positions' with regard to certain countries."
"It also insists on the virtues of the EU financial instruments, which are merely an example of the way in which the EU manipulates such an important issue as human rights, by funding those groups that guarantee European interests in third countries."
"In my opinion, these are reasons enough to not vote for this resolution, and I therefore abstained."
"The unrest in Maghreb gives us a very stark reminder that it is not easy to defend human rights and that this often conflicts with economic and/or military interests."
"Similarly, measures are taken in the name of combating terrorism that are not compatible with human rights."
"In this regard, the EU also needs to take a look at its own behaviour - for example, in the case of the illegal CIA overflights."
"Despite these shortcomings, it remains important for the EU in particular to devote itself to the protection of human rights."
"Protection of the rights of minorities, particularly the improvement of the situation for Christians and other religious minorities in Muslim countries, must be a particular concern of the European Union, with Christians in particular being subjected to severe persecution and being the main victims of religious violence."
"In view of this, I voted in favour."
"I voted in favour of this resolution because the United Nations Human Rights Council plays a very important role throughout the world in addressing issues relating to human rights."
"The review process is an excellent opportunity to assess how the Council has implemented its mandate."
"I agree with the proposal that the EU must speak with one voice in relation to issues being dealt with."
"Furthermore, the Member States must actively engage in reviewing the Council's work."
"I welcome the fact that on the agenda of the 16th regular session are reports on the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities, on the rights of the child, and on countering terrorism."
"However, in order to improve human living conditions, issues relating to the right to water and sanitation should be considered at the session."
"We must guarantee an effective mechanism to implement and protect what is a fundamental human right."
"Every effort must be made to ensure that commitments in this area are implemented internationally and every person has access to safe drinking water and sanitation facilities."
"Respecting, promoting and safeguarding the universality of human rights is part of the EU's legal, ethical and cultural acquis, and is one of the cornerstones of European unity and integrity."
"Every effort must therefore be made to increase the visibility and effectiveness of action on the part of the European Union and its Member States, and it is vital to ensure that the European Union is committed to actively participating in this important 16th session of the Human Rights Council (UNHRC) as well as in the UNHRC review process, which will take place in 2011."
"in writing. - A good report where, among other things, Parliament welcomes the fact that the agenda of the 16th regular session includes reports on the 'Rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities', and on the 'Promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism', as well as extensive meetings on the rights of the child; welcomes also this year's nominations of Special Rapporteurs on these key topics, and takes note of the reports to be presented by the Special Rapporteurs on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, on freedom of religion or belief, and on the situation of human rights defenders; calls on the EU Member States to contribute actively to these debates."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this resolution as it highlights the important role that the EU plays in working with the Human Rights Council."
"Given recent events in Libya, it is crucial that we continue to campaign for and seek to defend human rights at an international level."
"I abstained on the final vote on this resolution on both substantive and procedural grounds."
"The text of the resolution reinforces the idea of an EU policy of double standards in relation to human rights, especially on the issue of human rights violations in the occupied Palestinian territories."
"The few amendments tabled on this issue, which I supported, do not hide the fact that the Union refuses to implement the guidelines of the Goldstone report."
"The Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left has tabled its own resolution supporting the universality of human rights in all social, economic and cultural fields."
"On the other hand, the challenge of this resolution was to vote on the mandate of the European Union delegation to the United Nations Human Rights Council for its 16th session, although the session had already begun on 28 February, with Baroness Ashton having made several speeches."
"Voting on this resolution when the session of the Human Rights Council has already begun makes little sense; the European Parliament should have explained its upstream position."
"I voted in favour of the resolution on the priorities of the 16th Session of the UN Human Rights Council."
"I share the opinion that the Human Rights Council could be extremely valuable as a kind of 'early warning system' and preventive mechanism, and I expect the External Action Service to involve itself accordingly in this body."
"With regard to the review of the Human Rights Council, I obviously also support the call for an all-inclusive and, above all, transparent process."
"That concludes the explanations of vote."

"1."
"Pakistan - murder of Shahbaz Bhatti, Minister for Minorities"
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Pakistan - murder of Shahbaz Bhatti, Minister for Minorities."
"author. - Mr President, I think all of us have been very deeply shocked and appalled by the assassination of Minister Shahbaz Bhatti, not least because he is someone known to us in this Parliament: he has visited here, he has met many of us; but also because this is another highly symbolic killing, striking at someone who was looking for reconciliation and work across all minorities in Pakistan."
"We should also add our condolences not only to his family, but also to all the families of those who have been killed in terrorist attacks in Pakistan."
"This week, we have seen two such attacks, which have killed and injured more people than, for example, the London bombings."
"The whole population is suffering, and intimidation is undermining democracy in Pakistan."
"We are seeing a change in the demographics of certain constituencies, for example, Quetta, as intimidation works to force people out."
"Our resolution is important in terms of wanting to continue and support the work, in terms of tolerance and mutual understanding."
"I would like to make the point that we need that in the European Union, too, where certain recent ministerial statements, in my view, have not helped that."
"So we expect leadership in Pakistan and in the European Union."
"author. - Mr President, despite the request made by the Pakistani Minister for Religious Minorities, Shahbaz Bhatti, for more protection after numerous threats, an assassin managed to murder him on 2 March."
"Our sympathies go out not only to his loved ones, but also to all Pakistanis who seek a more tolerant society."
"This is a real blow to Pakistan as well as to humanity as a whole."
"Why did the Pakistani authorities deny the Minister's request for a bullet-proof official car, as well as his request that he select his own bodyguards that he trusted?"
"By calling for reforms in the inhumane blasphemy laws, he was a human rights defender."
"We equally want to pay tribute to the work of Naeem Sabir Jamaldini, the coordinator of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, who was murdered on 1 March."
"We need practical action such as investigations, including within the government."
"These have to take place in line with international standards because impunity has to end."
"The European Union should monitor the situation and try to fund civil society through the Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights."
"Mr President, over the last 10 months, the European Parliament has adopted a total of three resolutions on religious freedom in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan."
"In May 2010, we talked about this subject here in Strasbourg in the company of the Minister for Minorities, Shahbaz Bhatti."
"Today in Parliament, we are debating the circumstances of his death."
"The murder of a high-ranking state official, which took place on 2 March, means only one thing: in Pakistan, no one is safe from the radical Islamists."
"In danger are not only those who criticise the archaic law which prescribes a sentence of death for religious blasphemy, but also those who publicly stand up for the victims of intolerance, such as Mr Bhatti."
"After 10 months, it can be seen that current European Union policy towards Pakistan is not bringing the intended effects."
"Therefore, I support the idea contained in our resolution of holding round-table meetings on the situation of minorities in Pakistan."
"I think the newly created European External Action Service must react clearly to events in Islamabad before more people become victims and before it is too late."
"Mr President, Shahbaz Bhatti and all his family are an astonishing example of what brave, principled, loyal people can achieve."
"He had only held office for six months when the Pakistani Parliament adopted a significant reform that guaranteed a 5% quota to the country's minorities in public positions."
"That was just one of the numerous democratic reforms which Bhatti pushed forward and of which the Pakistani Government should be very proud."
"Most significant of all is perhaps the 'Interfaith Harmony Dialogue', which he began at local level, and which aimed to diffuse tensions and tackle the problems that give rise to terrorism."
"I saw in the idea the ingredients for the Nobel Peace Prize and I hope that the work to promote human rights and democracy in Pakistan will not cease, even though extremist elements gained a temporary victory when they disposed of the country's most strategic human rights activist."
"If dialogue succeeds in a country which is a centre of radical Islam, the positive effects will radiate everywhere in the world."
"Only about a month ago, I met Mr Bhatti."
"We talked about his possible death."
"He was not naïve."
"He understood very well what bravery could lead to."
"I will die before too long, he said, but meanwhile I will try to change unjust legislation as much as I can."
"I will die, but the law will remain and it will affect the lives of millions."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, I am afraid the situation in Pakistan is getting worse."
"Attack after attack seems to be taking place and the government seems to have lost the will to intervene."
"Last January, Governor Taseer was assassinated, and last week, the only Christian federal minister, Mr Bhatti, was assassinated, too."
"The European Union and Member States are maintaining contacts with Pakistan in many ways."
"Cooperation is afoot as regards Afghanistan, many hundreds of millions in aid are pouring into the country for education and reconstruction and efforts are being made to foster interfaith dialogue."
"However, the time has come for us to put our foot down."
"The Pakistani education system must be reformed and the preaching of hatred for Christians to young children must be stopped."
"The aid for reconstruction after the flooding should be distributed fairly, and that includes to non-Muslims."
"That is not only in the interests of the West."
"If the Pakistani Government and the security services do not get the situation under control, the country will sink into the morass of extremism."
"There is very little time left to reverse that tide."
"Mr President, there is often only so much we can achieve here in the European Parliament in our resolutions on urgent matters, but, in cases like these, where there are at least two issues concerning freedom of speech and religious freedom in countries like Pakistan, there at least two things we need to achieve to make our voice heard."
"First of all, I should like to say to the defenders of tolerance in Pakistan and to the defenders of religious freedom in Pakistan that they are not alone."
"This is a very modest aim, but I believe that it is a first step towards some dignity and respect in the debate, and this message will reach those in Pakistan supporting religious freedom, so the first thing I should like to do is tell them that they are not alone."
"The second thing I should like to do is make it very clear to the Pakistani Government that it cannot stop the extremists in Pakistan from thinking that they speak on behalf of everyone because this is the vicious circle countries often fall into when it comes to blasphemy laws, as is the case now in Pakistan, or as was the case, for example, in Indonesia."
"We are dealing with a minority of very vocal extremists who speak very loudly and who eventually start to believe that they are speaking on behalf of everyone because they manage to intimidate the rest of society."
"Consequently, in this case, if governments are not first in line to defend freedom in their own countries and fight against impunity, and if governments do not impose a bastion of dignity, the whole country will run the risk of being plagued by intolerance."
"The Pakistani Government must therefore fully investigate Shahbaz Bhatti's murder and must carry out investigations until conclusions have been reached as it did in the case of the Governor of Punjab."
"What it certainly cannot do is allow the investigations to be corrupted by the kind of practices the police and the Pakistani secret services have been using in investigations, which have destroyed investigations, including even those relating to the murder of the former Prime Minister, Benazir Bhutto."
"It is therefore vital that the Pakistani Government ensures that the extremists do not take charge of public discourse and, for our part, that we maintain our solidarity with the defenders of tolerance in the country."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Shahbaz Bhatti was killed in the name of so-called blasphemy laws by a group of fundamentalists who, as is happening more and more, used the name of God to promote their own schemes for power."
"With this resolution, we want to applaud and thank Shahbaz Bhatti for the example he has set us over the years."
"I hope so painful a sacrifice serves as a warning to the governments of the European Union and to the High Representative for Foreign Policy so that specific actions can replace the few words that have been spoken with such a lack of force to date."
"In fact, in recent months, the European Union, or rather the Council and the Commission, unlike Parliament, have wasted time discussing whether or not they should include the word 'Christian' in their weak condemnations, while Christians continue to be brutally slaughtered, often because they approached the West, even though there is nothing western about them."
"I therefore believe that the Commission and Council would do well to look to Parliament on this occasion."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - Mr President, I, too, wanted to pay tribute to the courage and the work of Shahbaz Bhatti."
"I know many colleagues in this House have met him personally and his determination to work for minority communities in Pakistan, to hold up their rights, is an example to us all."
"The fact is that he put his life on the line; he knew that the threats were increasing, and his bravery should be recognised."
"He has lost his life and we in this House have lost a friend."
"So what can we do?"
"I think there are a number of important points in this resolution."
"Paragraph 13 about calling on the competent EU institutions to include the issue of religious tolerance in society is vitally important."
"I would also call on the Commission, in talks and in trade issues as well, to bring up the issue of human rights too."
"Paragraph 19 about the institutions and the government of Pakistan is also important, as is the call for recognition of democracy and human rights."
"I think that, at the end of the day, we all would like to make sure our condolences are sent and I hope the President of Parliament will send a personal letter to Shahbaz Bhatti's mother."
"His funeral was last week and I think that is also important."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, the murder of Mr Bhatti is the second murder of a high-profile Pakistani official in two months."
"The murders of both Mr Bhatti and Governor Salman Taseer must be investigated thoroughly and the perpetrators have to be brought to justice."
"Apart from Mr Bhatti's murder, I would like to take up another burning human rights issue in Pakistan, namely, the situation of the Province of Balochistan."
"The Baloch minority continues to be persecuted and, according to Amnesty International, at least 90 Baloch activists - teachers, journalists and lawyers - have disappeared or have been murdered."
"Other people, such as aid workers, teachers, journalists and government officials, have also been subject to persecution and threats."
"The European Parliament and the EU need to send a clear message to Pakistan and urge the Pakistani Government to do its best to avoid this kind of situation."
"Mr President, these assassinations are, of course, intolerable, but what is more intolerable is the climate of impunity that exists, despite the increase in attacks."
"Unfortunately, the citizens of Pakistan and the families of the victims cannot expect much from a judicial system that is blighted by corruption, intimidation and poorly-trained investigators and prosecutors."
"Investigations take years and are based on discriminatory laws."
"The criminal dimension of the judicial system, in particular, needs to be reformed and gain real credibility both nationally and internationally."
"According to a poll carried out in universities by the Heinrich Böll Foundation, young Pakistanis believe that the credibility of the judicial system is more crucial for the survival of the country than military force or the parliamentary system."
"The European Union must therefore use all the necessary instruments at its disposal to strengthen judicial cooperation with Pakistan."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, one by one in Pakistan, the voices of reform and progress are being extinguished."
"Shahbaz Bhatti knew he was in danger, both as a Christian in a country where religious intolerance is rife, and as Minister for Minorities who fearlessly denounced his country's draconian blasphemy laws."
"However, he refused to be cowed by the Islamist fanatics who threatened him with death."
"Only two months earlier, the Governor of Punjab, Salman Taseer, had been assassinated by his own bodyguards, but Bhatti was not even provided with bodyguards and, therefore, presented the easiest of targets to the heavily armed terrorists who cut him down on his way to a cabinet meeting."
"Why was Mr Bhatti not shadowed by armed close protection officers?"
"This is one of the many questions we must ask President Zardari."
"I hope he can answer."
"I hope the Vice-President/High Representative will press him to set more of an example in opposing the alarming radicalisation of Pakistani society."
"Above all, this is a human tragedy."
"A man of great courage and principle has lost his life and we as democrats honour his name and salute his life's achievements today in this debate."
"We send our condolences to his loved ones in their hour of grief."
"Mr President, the provisions of Islamic Sharia law literally state that anyone who offends Islam shall be condemned to death."
"I do not know what actions may be considered an insult to Islam in the Islamic world, but cases of murdering defenders of human rights and religious freedoms in Pakistan, as well as in other Islamic countries, show us that some Islamic spiritual leaders regard our civilised values, which give people a broad freedom to decide, as a threat to their faith and do not hesitate to declare, in accordance with their law, a fatwa against anyone who openly promotes adherence to human rights and civic freedoms in their territory."
"Shahbaz Bhatti, a minister in the Pakistani Government, Salman Taseer, Governor of the Province of Punjab, or Sabir Jamaldini, Coordinator of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, have become for us innocent victims of the fanatical application of Islamic law."
"The example of these victims is supposed to terrorise not only the Pakistani people from seeking greater freedom, but also the politicians running the country from reforming the political system, so that they will continue to respect a set of rules harking back to medieval times."
"However, if we do not want to bring the reformist politicians in Islamic countries into conflict with their religious authorities, we should, in my opinion, strive to find a platform for constructive dialogue with Islamic spiritual leaders regarding the peaceful coexistence of civilisations ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(PL) Mr President, we are talking about the murder of a government minister and of a man who avowed his Christian roots and was a Catholic."
"We are talking about another murder in Pakistan which shows that, in fact, the authorities there are not in control of the situation, and this is a problem."
"We are not at this point saying that the President or government of Pakistan have shown ill will."
"Our charge is related to the fact that they are not even able to guarantee the security of people who are part of government structures but who profess a different faith from the rest of the country."
"This is the tragedy of this country, which, step by step, is becoming increasingly aggressive and full of hatred towards religions other than Islam."
"This is a real problem."
"I am certain we should speak out about this."
"We now come to the catch-the-eye procedure."
"Very many Members have indicated to me - and since some of the group chairs and deputy chairs are here, I will mention this now - that we need a bit more flexibility when it comes to these urgency debates when so many Members are clearly interested in a particular subject."
"I will now, to some degree, take into account to what extent Members are listed as speakers in later debates."
"(DE) Mr President, a week before he was murdered, I spoke with Shahbaz Bhatti in his office in Islamabad and he was aware of the danger he was in."
"However, he was more concerned about his impression that, particularly in recent months, also in connection with the murder of Salman Taseer, the Punjab Governor, many people have shied away from the challenge of the extremists."
"Ministers, parliamentarians, journalists, lawyers, even human rights activists, who have always got involved before, no longer have the confidence to stand up against the challenge of these extremists."
"I believe we must call on everyone in Pakistan to stand up against this intolerance, otherwise they will be swept aside together or individually."
"Sherry Rehman, that courageous politician who put forward amendments to the blasphemy law, is in particular danger."
"I therefore call on the Pakistani Parliament to protect her now by finally making the amendments to the blasphemy law that she proposed."
"That would clearly signal a united stand against extremism."
"(RO) Mr President, the murder of Pakistan's minorities minister, Mr Bhatti, comes in the midst of the whole controversy about amending the law which stipulated the death penalty for blasphemy in this country, an amendment which he supported."
"I think that the intolerance on which the laws on punishing blasphemy are based has also led to the appalling murders of leading figures who fought for the freedom of expression and belief in Pakistan."
"At the same time, the incident involving Mr Bhatti has been condemned by a large section of Pakistan's political establishment, in the media, and by people from a variety of ethnic origins and religious beliefs, which is a positive sign."
"It is therefore the duty of this country's government to prevent a recurrence of violent incidents based on intolerance and to continue its efforts to respect the democratic values enshrined in the Pakistani Constitution, the universal principles of human rights and the freedom of thought."
"(FR) Mr President, I, too, was deeply shaken by the cowardly assassination on 2 March 2011 of Mr Shahbaz Bhatti, the Christian Minister for Minorities in the government of Pakistan."
"This terrorist assassination follows numerous other assassinations of courageous, tolerant Pakistanis who are passionate about human rights and defenders of the human rights of both men and women."
"We once again urge the government of Pakistan to do everything possible to shed light on this cowardly assassination and to ensure that the protection of people threatened by fanatical religious extremists is truly effective."
"I am naturally thinking, first and foremost, but not only, of Mrs Sherry Rehman."
"Once again, I vigorously call on all the competent institutions of the European Union to include in negotiations, with a view to preparing future cooperation agreements, including the cooperation agreement between the Union and Pakistan, a clause ensuring respect for religious freedom and human rights."
"(Applause)"
"(PL) Mr President, once again, we are talking about the question of human rights violations in Pakistan, this time because of the recent murder of government minister Shahbaz Bhatti, who opposed the country's blasphemy legislation and defended the rights of religious minorities."
"He opposed intolerance and religious discrimination."
"The European Parliament resolution on this brutal murder is our expression of opposition to the growing brutal religious extermination in Pakistan, but also unequivocally testifies that we are not leaving religious minorities, whose rights are very commonly violated, to fend for themselves."
"It is our duty to condemn acts of lawlessness which threaten the freedom and life of other people."
"Therefore, I would like to emphasise how important it is to support non-governmental organisations which fight for human rights in their efforts for greater democratisation in Pakistan and a cessation of the violence."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, in January, we deplored the murder of the Governor of Punjab, Salman Taseer."
"A few weeks later, these acts of violence continued with the assassination on 2 March 2011 of Mr Shahbaz Bhatti, the Minister for Minorities in the government of Pakistan."
"Vice-President Ashton strongly condemned the murder and expressed deep concern over the climate of intolerance and violence in Pakistan linked to the debate over the controversial blasphemy laws."
"Mr Bhatti was the only Christian in the government of Pakistan and a well-known advocate of respect for human rights and religious freedom."
"He was one of the few voices left who dared to speak out and knew he was under threat after the murder of Salman Taseer."
"Yet this did not stop him from defending his rights which, after all, are enshrined in the Pakistani constitution."
"Vice-President Ashton has called on the government of Pakistan to take its responsibilities and provide adequate protection for those in official functions or in civil society who are threatened."
"The EU welcomes Prime Minister Jamali's declaration that the government will do its utmost to bring the culprits to justice."
"Our respect goes to Mr Jamali for attending Mr Bhatti's funeral."
"The government must now live up to its commitments and bring to justice the perpetrators and instigators of such crimes."
"Mr Bhatti and Mr Taseer were outspoken critics of the blasphemy laws and at the forefront of efforts to amend them."
"However, in the climate prevailing after the Taseer murder, the amendments were withdrawn from parliament."
"The blasphemy laws, which carry the death penalty, are incompatible with the common values we seek to promote in our relations with Pakistan."
"They have also led to miscarriages of justice and discrimination against religious minorities."
"While we strongly support Pakistan's democratic government and will do what we can to assist it as it seeks to cope with an unprecedented wave of terrorist acts, its members should stand up for the principles they subscribe to."
"Freedom of religion or belief is a universal human right; freedom of opinion and expression is intrinsically linked to it."
"The Council has just adopted conclusions recalling the commitment of the EU to safeguard these fundamental rights and to step up efforts to promote and protect these rights everywhere and for everyone."
"I have received six motions for resolutionstabled in accordance with Rule 110(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of the debates."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"I should like to offer my condolences to the family of the murdered Pakistani Minister for Minorities, Shahbaz Bhatti."
"I hope the perpetrators of this crime will quickly be apprehended and duly punished."
"This brutal incident, the victim of which was a high-ranking state official fighting for equal rights for minorities in Pakistan, is further evidence of how difficult the situation is in that country."
"Unfortunately, our current policy has not brought the expected results."
"In view of this, the European Union must take specific steps which will help to increase respect for the letter of the law and democracy in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan."
"In my opinion, a significant intensification of our work, by organising and holding annual EU-Pakistan meetings on the situation of minorities in Pakistan with the involvement of the European Parliament, can bring tangible benefits."
"In accordance with the text of the resolution we have adopted today, I fully endorse the financial support being given on our part to organisations which defend human rights and which are fighting the blasphemy laws."
"I hope we will be able to increase the scale of that support."
"I hope, too, that we will be able, with the help of suitable diplomatic instruments, to persuade the government of Pakistan to respect the provisions enshrined in the democracy and human rights clause of the Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan."
"in writing. - Shahbaz Bhatti, Minister for Minorities in Pakistan, sought to reform the country's blasphemy laws and he was killed."
"The Pakistani Taliban reportedly took responsibility for the murder and pronounced the same fate for any further critics of the blasphemy laws."
"It is time for strong action to protect the reformers and human rights defenders who are risking their lives for freedom."
"I call upon the Council and the European External Action Service to ensure the protection of the other human rights defenders at risk in Pakistan and the effective and timely investigation of Minister Shahbaz Bhatti's assassination."
"The perpetrators must be brought to justice and the response of the government must be firm in order to have a deterrent effect."
"in writing. - To lose one advocate of freedom of religion is a misfortune; to lose two is downright carelessness."
"When we discussed the murder of Governor Salman Taseer, I warned about the rise of religious extremism in Pakistan."
"Less than two months later, another tragedy has come to pass."
"The Taliban Movement in Punjab has claimed responsibility for the assassination of Minister Shahbaz Bhatti."
"His request for the use of a bullet-proof car had been denied by the Pakistani authorities."
"Such negligence by the authorities makes them an accomplice to the killing."
"I would like to hope that the European Union will address the murders of those high-ranking officials in Pakistan with the authorities there and call on them to repeal the blasphemy laws that have caused the escalation of religious violence."
"Two months ago in plenary, and it was also during a debate on human rights, we condemned the attack on the Governor of the Province of Punjab, Salman Taseer."
"The subject of discussion was the same as the one we are talking about today - attempts at reforming the controversial blasphemy legislation."
"The two tragic events are closely related to each other, because the victims had worked together on behalf of national minorities in Pakistan, including religious minorities, and in defence of those who have fallen victim to the ideology of intolerance spread by the Taliban."
"Unfortunately, the Western world can only look on at the advancing radicalisation of attitudes in the country, where not even a decade ago, Benazir Bhutto was introducing democratic reforms."
"Pakistan is sinking into chaos - the Taliban are terrorising the country and with increasing frequency are carrying out attacks like the one which took place in Punjab on 8 March, for example, in which 25 people were killed."
"Reports have now appeared of the next person whom the extremists have sentenced to death - Member of the Pakistani Parliament, former journalist and defender of women's rights, religious minorities and freedom of speech, Sherry Rehman."
"It was she who submitted to the Pakistani Parliament a draft of amendments to legislation on punishments for blasphemy."
"At the next part-session, will we be condemning an attack made on her?"
"2."
"Belarus, in particular the cases of Ales Michalevic and Natalia Radin"
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Belarus, in particular, the cases of Ales Mikhalevich and Natalia Radina."
"Mr President, I think it is important to remember that this is not the first time we have talked about Belarus in this Parliament, and from that point of view, this resolution is important insofar as it clearly condemns the arrests and imprisonment of members of the opposition and the violation of fundamental rights to which these people have been subjected."
"Freedom of expression, freedom of assembly and freedom of movement in countries such as Belarus should be a priority, and it is therefore necessary to call for the immediate and unconditional release of these people, who cannot be called anything other than political prisoners."
"Secondly, I think it is also important to condemn - and this is what the resolution does - the use of torture in these countries, as in others, in the strongest, toughest, clearest and firmest way possible, even when this occurs in the European Union, which, unfortunately, is sometimes the case."
"However, in a country with which our neighbourly relations are continuing to grow, and with which we are strengthening our relationship, the use of torture as a form of treatment in prisons, especially when it is fuelled by political motivation, is something that demands our total rejection and full condemnation"
"Finally, I would also like to openly condemn the sentence imposed on the young opposition activist simply for having taken part in the demonstrations on 19 September 2010."
"I think Parliament is right to position itself clearly against these options, and I insist that its voice must be heard."
"author. - Mr President, a large number of opposition figures, including former presidential candidates but also journalists and human rights defenders, were arrested after the events of 19 December 2010 in Minsk and they have been kept in KGB detention centres ever since."
"There have been reports of torture and of forced confessions at the hands of the KGB."
"These developments fit into a larger pattern of repression and politically motivated trials against opposition activists, civil society, the media and human rights defenders that continues to this day."
"We urgently call upon the Belarusian authorities to allow political opposition, civil society, free expression and media pluralism."
"The rule of law needs to be adhered to."
"The credibility of the Belarusian authorities would be won if investigations carried out in line with international standards, with international experts, were to start right away."
"We should consider restrictive measures, including economic sanctions on Belarusian government-owned companies, but we hope this will not be necessary."
"We would welcome it if more countries in the international community were to join the call for such actions, because the status quo is unacceptable."
"author. - Mr President, Belarus is so often on our agenda and this is because we care, because we want to see a democratic Belarus where human rights are respected."
"I have the impression, however, that the messages that we send so often to the Belarusian authorities are not heard - neither those from the European Parliament, nor those from the European Council."
"The decisions of the Council have had no effect so far on the situation in Belarus."
"After a year of very modest progress, 19 December 2010 became a turning point for Belarus."
"Since then, the country has been falling into self-isolation: this can save the regime for some time, but it is at the expense of the future of the Belarusian nation."
"This has to be understood, and we will not stop reminding Lukashenko and his friends of it."
"I hope that President Lukashenko will take good note of the events in the southern neighbourhood and understand that the only responsible behaviour is democratisation and the social and economic reforms in the country."
"We in the European Parliament will not give up; we call for the immediate and unconditional release of all detained protestors and for the dropping of all politically motivated charges."
"At the same time, we still believe that Belarus has time to change; we are working together with the other five eastern neighbours to find a solution leading to democratisation and to the creation of a situation in Belarus where free and fair elections can take place at the end of this year or at the beginning of next year."
"Mr President, Belarus is a country which shares a border with the European Union but which seems to be 1 000 light years removed from it."
"It is as if Belarus were inhabited by people who are guided by different standards."
"However, this is not the case."
"There are also Europeans living there - people who want to feel they live in a common Europe."
"The problem is the president of the country, who makes use of methods known from the Soviet Union of several decades ago - what President Lukashenko offers us is a singular journey into the past."
"Unlike Mr Vigenin, who spoke a moment ago, I think we should believe in our European voice and that Parliament and the European Union can put pressure on the Belarusian authorities so that they will respect human rights."
"This is a question not so much of policy but of fundamental morals and ethics."
"We should say to our Belarusian brothers today that they are not alone."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there have always been reports of human rights cases outside the European Union so I shall take the liberty, in this urgent debate, to begin with our vote today on the freedom of the press in Hungary, or rather in the European Union, because respect for fundamental rights in our House and respect for human rights outside the European Union are inextricably linked."
"Given that we have managed to discuss the problems we are facing within the European Union in a vote that divided this House and split it in two, and which has given us a lot of work over the past two months, we can now confront President Lukashenko of Belarus with our heads held high."
"We can tell President Lukashenko that he must stop his repression of demonstrations, his repression of opponents and his repression of the press in his own country, because he himself represents a government that thinks it has a monopoly on the right to decide what is right and what is wrong, what is balanced, what is neutral and what is objective, not only in its own assertions, but also in those of the opposition and those of the foreign press."
"We even saw President Lukashenko confronting the international media with profound arrogance, following the repression of the demonstrations in December."
"This is why I believe we can have hope that the voice of the European Parliament, the voice of the Commission and the voice of the Council will be heard in Belarus, and that we will achieve a moral authority, beyond that which we also need to preserve through our example in this House."
"Mr President, during last week's meeting of the Visegrad Group in Bratislava, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Slovakia, which is currently chairing the group, sent a clear message to President Lukashenko of Belarus."
"As long as there is even one political prisoner in the prisons of Belarus, the country can expect to be totally isolated in Europe."
"Even today, unfortunately, three months after the presidential elections, the situation in the country is still critical."
"Democratically-minded people are investigated, arrested, imprisoned and held in inhumane conditions just as we have been discussing today, with no possibility of legal assistance and with no possibility of visits from family members."
"It is therefore also important for the EU to adopt a tougher stance towards the last dictator in Europe."
"It may also be necessary to widen the scope of the economic sanctions we are applying, as all the evidence suggests that words, however tough, will not improve the situation for people in Belarus."
"Mr President, this resolution is a clear signal to the Belarusian authorities that the European Union cannot and will not tolerate restrictions on the right to demonstrate, nor will it tolerate political prisoners in the country and, in particular, torture in detention facilities."
"Brussels is intensifying its assistance to Belarusian civil society, non-governmental organisations, the independent media and students."
"Furthermore, we need to abolish as a matter of urgency the expensive visas which prevent Belarusian citizens from travelling to the European Union, reduce the fee and negotiate a relaxation of the visa regime."
"I feel that in this situation, it would still be useful for a European Parliament delegation to travel to Belarus, despite the fact that there are obstacles, and if a whole delegation is unable to travel, then Members of the European Parliament should travel there individually in order to better understand the situation and exert some influence."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, it was in January when we adopted a resolution on Belarus."
"It is not a good sign at all that we have to express our concerns on the situation there again and again, with no positive reaction from the Belarusian authorities."
"Although the European Union has re-established sanctions and taken a hard line on Lukashenko's regime, fundamental rights such as freedom of assembly and of expression are still violated and trampled upon."
"Furthermore, the reports on continuous mental and physical torture of political prisoners and attempts at recruiting informants to the KGB give the European Union a clear signal that Lukashenko's regime did not get our message from the previous time."
"Perhaps we ought to speak up and make it even clearer that the situation in Belarus is unacceptable."
"I would like to ask the Commission to report on further measures that can be taken against Lukashenko's regime."
"I would also like to call on European enterprises and investors to withdraw from Belarus if they have no desire to be handling blood money and directly or indirectly supporting Lukashenko's criminal regime."
"Mr President, Mrs Ojuland is right when she says she has the impression we are always talking about the same thing and never seeing the expected results."
"However, unfortunately, she is mistaken in saying we are unanimous on this."
"I would like to ask all of us here to speak with one voice, and to speak as strongly as Mr Protasiewicz, who has sent a clear signal to all those fighting for liberty and democracy in Belarus that we are with them, and who has given a clear warning to the regime in Belarus that what they are doing is unacceptable."
"Well, alongside that voice, which ought to be supported by everyone, there are also other opinions being expressed, and unfortunately by one of the authors of the resolution, that incidents of torture occur in Belarus just as they do in some European countries and in some of the European Union's Member States."
"This is unacceptable."
"Mrs Ojuland is right that we are being listened to, and that it is not only we who are listening to each other, but that there is also someone else who is listening to us."
"If there are going to be such divergent opinions, then in my opinion, we are going to continue to be ineffective."
"Thank you very much."
"(FI) Mr President, Europe's last dictator, Lukashenko, has ruled Belarus with an iron fist for more than 16 years."
"The country's media and judiciary are under his sovereign control, and he also has no hesitation in using them to crush the political opposition, as we saw in the recent fraudulent Presidential elections in December."
"At that time, special troops and the police, of course, violently broke up demonstrations and arrested hundreds of people, including nearly all opposition presidential candidates."
"The EU's demands to release political prisoners and end the violence against citizens have been totally ignored by the Lukashenko administration."
"It is now imperative that the EU introduces more robust economic sanctions, since Lukashenko has simply exploited the Eastern Partnership programme and all the benefits of neighbourhood policy."
"We cannot accept such brutal violations of human rights anywhere in the world, but least of all in the backwoods of Europe."
"(FI) Mr President, we do not actually have to go beyond Europe's borders to find countries that violate fundamental rights."
"In Belarus, you can be indicted and go to prison merely for taking part in a protest, standing in elections, or stating your opinion."
"Political awareness on the part of the people and civil activism are not a burden for society: they should be something that enriches it."
"It is difficult, however, to believe that democracy could be strengthened in Belarus merely through EU coercion."
"There is also a need for dialogue at grassroots level and participation in civil society."
"The EU should support democratic development in Belarus and continue to organise cultural and educational projects with it."
"The European External Action Service should actively monitor developments in Belarus and support the Belarusians so that European values might also be internalised there."
"(Applause)"
"(RO) Mr President, two days ago, on 8 March, International Women's Day, Natalia Radina was unable to enjoy this celebration because she was under house arrest."
"On the same day, Ales Mikhalevich celebrated his 53rd birthday in prison."
"The simple reason for this is that he is a free man, a man who dared to enter the presidential contest and, in a dictatorship like Belarus, the penalty for making such gestures of freedom is to have one's movements restricted and get sent to prison."
"I would like to highlight two points in our resolution which I regard as extremely important."
"I feel that we need to support the extension of the restrictive measures imposed by the European Union by producing a list which includes the prosecutors, judges and members of the secret police involved in the recent human rights violations in Belarus."
"Secondly, I also believe that we must do everything we can to support civil society in this country, which can give us some hope."
"(Applause)"
"(RO) Mr President, I would like to begin my speech with an appeal to the Belarusian authorities to stop the censorship against the democratic forces and independent press."
"I also propose reopening the OSCE Office in Belarus."
"Human rights were dealt a heavy blow at the time of the presidential elections in December 2010."
"The demonstrations organised by the opposition against election fraud were mercilessly crushed by the security forces."
"Those arrested include one of the presidential candidates, Ales Mikhalevich."
"He publicised the torture he was subjected to in prison, a fact, however, which has been denied by the authorities."
"Journalists close to the opposition were also targeted at the same time."
"In spite of the ban on making statements, they confirmed Mikhalevich's assertions in the hope of attracting the EU's attention to the critical situation in Belarus."
"The circumstances under which the arrests were made are vague, but the treatment they state they were subjected to amounts to serious human rights violations."
"(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to express my very sincere thanks for giving me the opportunity to speak, because several days ago, when I spoke to Ales Mikhalevich, whom I have had the opportunity and honour to know and be friends with for over a decade, I promised him I would do everything possible to speak today."
"Although I know this is not the place to be sending personal messages, I would like to say: 'Ales, we are with you, as Mr Protasiewicz has said'."
"I think that today, it is very important to say to the opposition that we are going to support them - and we should say this not only to the opposition."
"It is important to say this to those who are involved in carrying out the persecution - the prosecutors who conduct investigations as they are told to do, the judges who hand down unjust sentences, the directors of workplaces who fire people for their political activity, the rectors of universities who expel students for taking part in demonstrations - we should say to all of them: 'We will remember."
"We will remember what you do and how you act today, and there will come a time when you will all suffer the punishment you deserve'."
"(RO) Mr President, I, too, would like to join those calling on the Council, the Commission and the international community to increase their support for civil society and the democratic opposition in Belarus, in response to the events which have taken place since December 2010."
"The arrest and detention of more than 600 civil society activists, journalists, teachers and students, the majority of presidential candidates and leaders of the democratic opposition, along with the disproportionate use of force following the demonstrations organised in protest against Lukashenko's election, are characteristic features of a dictatorship and show deep contempt for respect for human rights."
"The case of Ales Mikhalevich, one of President Lukashenko's opponents, who was tortured during his pre-trial detention, and that of journalist Natalia Radina are significant in a current situation which we are duty-bound to counteract by supporting the efforts of civil society in Belarus, the independent press and the opposition to encourage democracy."
"Mr President, the fact that in Belarus, President Lukashenko's secret police is still called the KGB tells us all that we need to know about his mentality and methods."
"Twenty years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, he remains the archetypal homo sovieticus, a strong man whose addiction to power is as strong as his instincts for crushing dissent."
"Lukashenko used the KGB, or uses the KGB, as a political tool to silence the popular protest, including the cases of Ales Mikhalevich and Natalia Radina, that followed yet another disappointingly rigged presidential election in December last year."
"More than 700 people were arrested."
"Stories abound of opposition activists being abducted, detained extrajudicially, and then tortured mentally and psychologically by the KGB."
"Belarus matters to us so much because it is a European country and has become a Cuba on our own doorstep."
"If the EU is to have any moral force in the world with regard to promoting democracy, human rights and the rule of law, it must surely start in Europe itself, our own continent."
"I do not dispute the need to engage with the Lukashenko regime."
"An empty chair policy would be counter-productive with the EU, but we need to increase support to the opposition in Belarus and tighten EU smart sanctions on Lukashenko and his KGB cronies."
"Mr President, the events of the past months in Belarus clearly show how civil and political rights continue to be violated systematically by the government."
"The arrests of the supporters of the opposition in December reflect the way in which an attempt is being made to silence Lukashenko's opponents using violent means."
"The imprisonment of Ales Mikhalevich and six other opposition presidential candidates on the unjustifiable pretext that they had provoked violent demonstrations contravenes political rights."
"Similarly, the imprisonment of journalist, Natalia Radina, for more than a month makes the likelihood of free expression of opinion in Belarus an even more distant reality."
"We need to take seriously the accusations of inhumane treatment and torture in KGB prisons made by Mikhalevich, Radina and others, and these should be investigated by an impartial body."
"I want to remind Belarus of the international commitments it made by ratifying the UN Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the UN Convention against Torture, and, as a consequence, the responsibility it has towards the international community and, in particular, its own citizens."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, we are concerned about the worsening situation in Belarus, which unfortunately comes as no surprise."
"The widespread detention and prosecution of civil society activists, including presidential candidates, in the post-election period led us to expect harsh sentences to follow."
"As of today, we already know of four cases where individuals have been sentenced to several years in prison."
"We fear that many more such sentences, involving up to 40 people who now stand accused, will follow in months to come."
"What is more, we have been appalled by reports of the torture and ill-treatment of people detained on political grounds, including ex-presidential candidate Mikhalevich."
"All these despicable events may call for an update of our EU response."
"The situation today is as follows: as you know, the EU reacted to the fraudulent elections of 19 December and to the subsequent repression by putting nearly 160 people on a sanction list."
"This was a very clear and strong message of condemnation to the authorities."
"At the same time, the Commission and the European External Action Service have swiftly designed new dedicated assistance tools to provide urgent support to the victims of repression, their families and civil society, up to an amount of EUR 1.7 million."
"This assistance is being delivered with the initial focus on providing legal assistance and counselling to victims of repression and on support to civil society organisations and civic campaigns."
"We are also finalising a re-orientation of our mid-term assistance to Belarus to increase support to civil society."
"The Commission is quadrupling its aid to Belarusian civil society for the period 2011-2013 to a total of EUR 15.6 million, with particular attention given to strengthening independent media and supporting students, including by maintaining funding for the European Humanities University."
"It is now time to reflect on whether an additional response is needed."
"The High Representative issued an immediate condemnation following the first sentence on 18 February, and she recalled that political motives had no place in a legal process."
"The EU also strongly condemned the harsh sentences and torture allegations at the OSCE and is discussing the matter at the UN Human Rights Council."
"Finally, the European Union will discuss whether the latest events call for a further expansion of our existing sanction list to add new names such as those responsible for issuing the latest sentences and leading the recent crackdown."
"The EU stands ready to consider further targeted measures in all areas of cooperation as appropriate."
"Parliament's resolution will certainly be a useful and timely contribution to our reflections and discussions."
"I thank Members for their attention."
"I have received six motions for resolutions tabled in accordance with Rule 110(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of the debates."
"3."
"Situation and cultural heritage in Kashgar (Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, China)"
"The item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on the situation and cultural heritage in Kashgar (Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, China)."
"author. - Mr President, Uyghurs have practically become a minority in their historic homeland."
"They need international support to preserve their culture and identity."
"In fact, the fate of the ancient city of Kashgar is in the balance."
"A modernisation programme has slated up to 85% of the traditional old city of Kashgar for demolition."
"It is important to prevent the historic fortress being replaced by modern apartment blocks."
"If the Chinese authorities are serious about convincing us that all will be well, they have to first of all convince the native population of East Turkestan that their cultural heritage really will be respected and that the Uyghur language will be taught in schools on an equal level with the Chinese language."
"I call on the Chinese authorities to accept possible contributions by ICOMOS, which has impressive experience in the management of urban historic landscapes, and I ask the Chinese Government to agree to lift Kashgar to UNESCO world heritage status that will include several cultural sites along the ancient Silk Road."
"author. - Mr President, under the banner of reform and development, the ancient Silk Road city of Kashgar is being demolished."
"It is not only a blow to global cultural heritage, but most of all, the city is very important for the Uyghur and the Hui populations, and for China's cultural diversity as a whole, which is now being destroyed."
"China has stepped up efforts to boost relations through cultural diplomacy throughout the world, but no one will be interested in a marketed, homogenised culture of a country which has such cultural diversity."
"In the interests of economic opportunity and sustainable relations with the rest of the world, respect for human rights and minorities in the broadest sense is essential."
"We urge the Chinese Government to assess the possibility of including Kashgar in the joint application with Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan for the Silk Road UNESCO world heritage designation."
"The High Representative should step up the human rights dialogue with China and make it more action-oriented and effective."
"Mr President, today's debate on the rights of ethnic minorities in China comes a day after the Dalai Lama officially announced that he is resigning from his political role in Tibet."
"In the coming months, we should watch the development of the political situation there carefully."
"Today, however, we are talking about another minority group which is suffering discrimination in China - the Muslim Uyghur population."
"China is justifying its policy towards them by the need to fight terrorism, and for the Chinese authorities, the persecution of the Uyghur people also means the destruction of the Uyghurs' cultural heritage."
"Particularly disturbing are the reports of the reconstruction of the city of Kashgar."
"This will, in practice, mean the destruction of its historical centre, one of the most interesting and best-preserved examples of Muslim architecture in Central Asia, which attracts more than a million tourists every year and would be eligible for inclusion on the UNESCO world heritage list if China applied for this status."
"I am confident that the European Union's diplomatic service will demonstrate its effectiveness in talks with the Chinese authorities, and will remind them of the need to respect the rights of ethnic minorities and protect their cultural heritage."
"Thank you."
"Mr President, it is clear that Kashgar is the symbol, par excellence, of Uyghur cultural identity in the Chinese province of Xinjiang."
"On 27 January, I organised a conference in Brussels, where I learned of the impact which the destructive Chinese urbanisation plans are having on the Uyghur population."
"It is, indeed, the case that, under the guise of public security and modernisation, China wants to leave no more than 15% of the original city intact and, in fact, transform Kashgar into one huge open-air museum."
"I think it is high time that we responded powerfully to this, before it is too late."
"After quashing the demonstrations in Urumqi in July 2009, the Chinese authorities were called upon by this House to make every effort to bring about an open, permanent and respectful dialogue with the Uyghurs and pursue a more integrated and comprehensive economic policy in their area, aimed at encouraging local involvement and, above all, protecting Uyghur cultural identity."
"Unfortunately, the current Chinese policy in Kashgar is proving to be quite the reverse of what was called for then."
"Not only the destruction of Kashgar, while denying the local population any say in the matter, but also the Chinese refusal to allow Kashgar to compete for UNESCO world heritage status, is illustrative of the way in which the Chinese Communist Party deals with cultural diversity."
"author. - Mr President, the EU's motto is 'Unity in diversity'."
"Sadly, such a sentiment does not resonate in the People's Republic of China, whose Communist rulers are obsessed with unity, but not much thought is given to celebrating diversity."
"Undoubtedly, the attempt to impose Han Chinese majority culture on tiny minorities in the world's most populous country is causing much tension and resentment."
"We already know about the suppression of the ancient Buddhist Tibetan culture over the last 60 years; now we see the same threat looming over the city of Kashgar in the restive province of Xinjiang."
"For 2 000 years, Kashgar has been a thriving city on the Silk Road with a rich, unique and flourishing central Asian culture, but now it is facing wholesale demolition and rebuilding."
"It is hard to escape the idea that this is Beijing's attempt to break the will of the Uyghur separatists."
"I personally have no brief or sympathy for the separatist cause, some of whose supporters, I am afraid, have links to al-Qaeda, but I urge the Chinese Government to think again."
"The destruction of an ancient city like Kashgar would simply strengthen the resolve of all of those who would wish to foment violence against the state."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, to tell you the truth, out of the three urgent debates taking place this afternoon, this really is the one in which we feel the most impotent."
"We have talked about Pakistan and Belarus and we then have reason to believe that the European Union has not only moral authority but also leverage or power over external authorities to try to ensure, at least, that they are on the right track."
"In fact, when we talk about China, we know that this leverage is reduced because a lot of what we say in this House contradicts what the European governments in our capitals do: that is to say, what Mr Sarkozy, Mrs Merkel or politicians in my own country, Portugal, do, like Mr Sócrates, who only very recently diverted a demonstration against Chinese authorities so that the Premier, who was visiting Lisbon, did not have to come face to face with those protesting against his regime."
"In other words, it is Europe itself that is repeatedly participating in this dream world or fantasy world, which the Chinese leaders are creating for themselves, in which there is no opposition and in which one development model suits all, and is the same in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, or in Tibet."
"Therefore, it is really difficult for the European Parliament to say what we are going to say today, which is also what is written in our resolution: we are calling for the Beijing authorities to stop committing this demographic genocide against Uyghurs; we are calling for them to preserve the cultural and ethnic diversity of the regions that make up China; and we are calling for them to preserve places of architectural or heritage value."
"However, the leaders of our own countries are throwing themselves into the arms of the Chinese leaders, pardoning them for everything that they have done in their country, and are giving them free rein in the name of a development model that ultimately we respect only to a very basic degree."
"It has therefore been demonstrated once again that moral authority begins to take shape at home and that, in any case, when we in the European Union are talking about others, we are, first and foremost, talking about ourselves, and we need to review our attitude towards China."
"Mr President, as has already been said, Uyghurs are not a minority but a people with an ancient Silk Road culture who gradually succumbed to Chinese rule, which was initially very relaxed."
"The Uyghurs are supported, in particular, by the World Uyghur Congress based in Munich, and the cultural heritage of Kashgar is supported by the Blue Shield movement, the president of which, Karl von Habsburg, was here in Strasbourg this week to provide us with information."
"If we are to support the Uyghurs, let us do so by means of a friendly appeal to the Chinese, because the Uyghurs are threatened with cultural ethnocide."
"Moreover, China, as the oldest cultural nation in the world, should clearly recognise that one of the characteristics of a cultural people is the protection of, and respect for, other cultures, particularly when it comes to small cultures in a huge empire."
"The Chinese only have to apply their own constitution, which states in three places that this cultural heritage must be preserved."
"I would therefore like to say very clearly that we want some give and take from our Chinese partners on this issue - we want the protection of the cultural heritage of the Uyghurs."
"Mr President, it is my personal view that, in this case, we must guard against one-sided judgments."
"There is a risk of counterproductive bias, both in relation to the situation on the ground and to the partnership between the European Union and China."
"The bloody violence in recent years in Xinjiang is glaring proof that resorting to force is the least satisfactory option."
"This is why I believe that it is our duty to encourage interethnic dialogue."
"It is my opinion that the European Parliament resolution must not affect the right of the Chinese authorities to defend the integrity of their country and the safety of all their citizens, especially against terrorist threats in a region where al-Qaeda is attempting to establish a presence."
"We must clearly encourage balanced national development from both an economic and demographic perspective."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, it is well known that Uyghuria is in imminent danger of becoming a second Tibet."
"The People's Republic of China has announced a 'Kashgar Dangerous House Reform', the purpose of which is to raze 85 per cent of the Old City in Kashgar."
"Such philistinism must be stopped and the European Union must insist that the authorities of the People's Republic of China do not destroy this important cultural site on the ancient Silk Road."
"The UN Declaration of the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities, as well as the constitution of the People's Republic of China, must be respected, even by Beijing."
"The People's Republic of China is more and more exercising sinicisation of ethnic minorities such as the Uyghurs and the Tibetans."
"It is a cultural genocide in the 21st century, which we simply cannot accept."
"Mr President, Chinese official circles have long found it irksome to have references to other ancient and important cultures and civilisations whose monuments are today located in Chinese territory."
"Kashgar is the centre of the Muslim Uyghurs - one of the largest ethnic minorities in China."
"For millennia, the Chinese tried to subdue the lands of the Uyghurs, and many times they failed in their fight to subdue these lands."
"Even today, therefore, there is a certain aloofness in the position of the Chinese administration, and an effort to suppress any manifestation of the cultural traditions and identity that are linked to the rich cultural monuments of the Uyghurs and the city of Kashgar."
"I am not sure whether the official Chinese bodies are today capable of accepting the philosophy that the current Chinese state is built not only on the traditions and history of the Chinese empire, but also on the traditions and histories of other peoples."
"The behaviour of the Chinese towards Tibet, and towards the Uyghur monuments in Kashgar, bears witness rather to the fact that today's China is incapable of appreciating the wealth which other peoples and other cultures have brought to its shared state."
"It is therefore right to state from this place that we, in contrast to the Chinese authorities, appreciate and cherish all important cultural monuments located on the territory of the People's Republic of China, as well as those in Tibet and in Kashgar."
"Mr President, Kashgar is a city of three and a half million people, a bit smaller than the population of the entire island of Ireland."
"It is closer to Baghdad than it is to Beijing."
"It is on the great trading route of the Silk Road and has some of the best preserved Islamic architecture sites, some of which are buried beneath the desert."
"It also has the largest mosque tomb in China and is a treasure, there is no doubt about that."
"However, as has been said, it is under a great threat, ostensibly because the Chinese want to redevelop the city because of its susceptibility to earthquakes."
"That is not acceptable to us, because we feel that a great treasure would be lost."
"What can we do about it?"
"Perhaps very little, but at least highlighting it here today is important."
"We can, as we said, ask that it be included among the Silk Road world heritage sites."
"Perhaps we could also make people aware of the treasures that are there, so that the people there can preserve them into the future."
"It would be the world's loss, but a bigger loss to China."
"(FI) Mr President, this resolution actually concerns the preservation of an important cultural heritage and the right of minority peoples to their cultural identity."
"The ancient city of Kashgar is one of the best preserved Islamic cities in Central Asia."
"Kashgar's rich history goes back to China's Han Dynasty, and the city was an important staging post on the Silk Road."
"It linked Asia to Europe."
"The entire Xinjiang Region has enormous cultural significance for the entire world."
"China must take action to make Kashgar a UNESCO world heritage site and preserve the area for future generations."
"The European External Action Service should also ensure that local strategies extend to the right to its cultural identity."
"The European Union's delegation to China could also earmark funds to support the traditions of the Kashgar minorities and their cultural identity."
"Mr President, future generations depend on our actions today to protect timeless sites such as Kashgar."
"Kashgar is a fundamental pillar of the history of Islam in China."
"In 2009, the Chinese Government announced an urban reconstruction programme that plans to demolish 85% of the old city of Kashgar and replace it with modern apartments."
"The demolition should be stopped."
"Urban planners should identify a development plan that preserves the old city of Kashgar."
"The whole Silk Road in China should be submitted for protection under UNESCO's world heritage programme, which China joined in 1985."
"I call on the Commission and the Council to raise these matters with the Chinese authorities."
"Mr President, cultural heritage is crucial to preserving identity."
"This is clear in Europe, in China, and wherever, and the Chinese authorities know this."
"However, we have seen, for instance, how they have purposefully destroyed this heritage, which means this identity, in several places like Tibet, and now they are doing the same in the Uyghur places like Kashgar."
"This is why it is so important that we once again explain our position, and we urge the Chinese Government to stop the cultural destruction threatening Kashgar's architectural survival immediately and to carry out a comprehensive expert inquiry into culture-sensitive methods of renovation."
"This is not for nothing: the credibility of a government is also based on how it treats minorities."
"If China wants to be credible in the international sphere, it is important that minorities, such as the Uyghurs, are treated properly, adequately respectfully and in line with human standards."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner Hahn, culture and identity must clearly be placed centre stage at global level."
"Just this week, Karl Habsburg explained to us how important it is in the search for identity for this cultural heritage not only to be available to the Uyghurs, but also for it to be a global asset."
"China should make a concessionary gesture in this regard."
"For example, we have recently entered into an agreement with the town of Wenzhou enabling direct investments to be made in dollars in future."
"I see an opportunity here for the focus also to be placed on this region and for people in the different cities and regions of China to have equal rights."
"International relations can indeed provide a great deal of help here."
"(FI) Mr President, there is no respect for the fundamental rights of the ethnic minorities in China, be they Tibetans or Uyghurs."
"It is typical that the Chinese Communist Party refuses to support the city of Kashgar in its bid to compete for UNESCO world heritage status."
"In recent years, China has provided support for an international project to add cultural sites on the Silk Road to the world heritage list, but Kashgar itself has not been on that list because it is the home of one of China's largest minorities, the Uyghurs."
"On the contrary, China intends to demolish large areas of the city, claiming that it fears for the safety of the residents, but cultural, civil and human rights organisations regard this plan as a cruel attempt to crush Uyghur culture."
"The Chinese Communist Party must come to acknowledge the fact that the citizens of China are culturally diverse, and they must also have a right to cultural autonomy."
"(RO) Mr President, the old centre of the city of Kashgar is in danger and, along with it, the historic symbol of the Uyghur minority in China."
"The policy being pursued of so-called urban reconstruction is resulting in the gradual disappearance of this group's identity, which developed its culture around the fortress situated on the Silk Road."
"I believe that moving the Uyghur population from their traditional dwellings and demolishing Kashgar are measures which violate minorities' rights."
"In addition, the city is regarded as the best preserved example of Islamic architecture in Central Asia."
"Kashgar's streets and buildings can be restored to improve the inhabitants' living conditions."
"The question is why the authorities are not investing in activities of this kind."
"I recommend the inclusion of the old centre in the UNESCO world heritage list as part of the Silk Road."
"I also appeal to the Chinese Government to stop demolishing the city and to look for alternative solutions."
"(FI) Mr President, owing to its remote location, Kashgar, on China's western border, and the Uyghurs who live there, have succeeded in preserving their ancient traditions for centuries."
"The city therefore attracts hundreds and thousands of tourists a year."
"On account of its strategic location, the Chinese administration is now trying to control the region more effectively to guarantee better access to the energy markets in Central Asia."
"China does, of course, have the right to develop economically, but the rights of minority groups, fragile as they are, must be protected."
"It is possible to develop Kashgar in such a way that the way of life of the Uyghurs can continue to be guaranteed."
"The earthquake safety of buildings and the infrastructure can be improved without putting into effect plans to destroy 85% of the ancient city, with the Uyghurs being forced to move out to new residential areas and seeing their society fragment."
"This reckless destruction of the ancient city should therefore be stopped, and the Uyghurs should be consulted on the development of the place where they have traditionally lived."
"Otherwise, their exotic, fascinating culture is in danger of being completely destroyed."
"(PL) Mr President, I would like to say it is to be welcomed that the European Parliament is once again talking about the Uyghurs, a Muslim minority which is suffering discrimination in China."
"I would like to remind everyone that there has already been a European Parliament resolution about this, and that we should also express our views in relation to other religious minorities which are being persecuted in the People's Republic of China, such as the Christian minority."
"Catholics are facing very severe discrimination there."
"The Communist authorities in Beijing have appointed special ecclesiastical structures which are not recognised by the official Catholic Church."
"I think this very necessary and important discussion can, today, be a voice in defence of all religious minorities in China."
"I think that voice is greatly needed."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the preservation of cultural heritage is obviously of central importance in ensuring the protection and continuation of a minority's traditions and way of life."
"Moreover, the destruction of important cultural property has the potential to deal a serious blow, not only to the heritage and archaeological patrimony of the minority concerned, but to cultural heritage in general."
"In this light, the European Union is following with concern the redevelopment of the ancient city of Kashgar in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region of China."
"The significance of Kashgar as a centre of culture for the Uyghur minority in China cannot be overstated."
"Kashgar is conceived as being as important as Jerusalem is to Jews, Muslims and Christians."
"The Chinese Government's 2009 White Paper on Xinjiang stated that restoration of Kashgar is necessary to protect the city from earthquakes or fire."
"This is a laudable aim."
"Civil society, both in China and internationally, has expressed considerable disquiet about the methods employed."
"There is serious concern that as much as 85% of the old city may be demolished."
"Indeed, many notable buildings, including the unique Xanliq madrasah, appear to have been destroyed already."
"It is also worrying that some 200 000 people may be displaced from their traditional homes and that there appears to have been little or no consultation with the residents affected."
"It is feared that the demolition of structures which have formed the basis of Uyghur culture for many hundreds of years may have a grave impact on the preservation of their culture in the years ahead."
"It is also regrettable that China has chosen not to propose Kashgar as a world heritage site despite its unique status, as this would allow UNESCO to become involved in the process of redevelopment."
"We understand that UNESCO has, in any event, made representations to the Chinese authorities concerning the impact of the development on Kashgar's traditional heritage and culture."
"The European Union fully shares these concerns and will call on the Chinese authorities to work with UNESCO to ensure that any redevelopment of Kashgar meets international best practice in this field."
"The European Union will also call on the Chinese authorities to ensure that the inhabitants of Kashgar are fully consulted about the future of the city and that their views are taken into account."
"I have received six motions for resolutions tabled in accordance with Rule 110(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of the debates."
"Debate on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law (debate)"

"(Applause)"
"Statements by the President"
"A second piece of information is that there is disturbing news coming from countries in our distant neighbourhood: Bahrain, Syria and Yemen."
"In all of these countries, force has been used to suppress demonstrations being made by people who are demanding democratic change."
"Governments which use guns against their own citizens lose all democratic legitimacy."
"The violence must be halted, and those responsible put on trial."
"The next piece of information: I would like to inform you that we have received notice, today, of the resignation from Parliament of one of our fellow Members - Mr Thaler."
"A second Member, Mr Strasser, has notified his intention to resign from Parliament in the next few days."
"A third Member - Mr Severin - has left the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and has become a non-attached Member."
"These resignations are a consequence of the serious accusations which have appeared in the press about the improper behaviour of some Members of this House."
"This morning I called an emergency meeting of the Bureau to discuss the situation."
"We are meeting again this evening to continue our discussion."
"Speaking on behalf of the Bureau of the European Parliament and, I think, on behalf of the majority of fellow Members in this Chamber, we are determined to pursue a zero tolerance policy towards the actions which have led to the resignations of our fellow Members."
"(Applause)"
"As President elected by you, ladies and gentlemen, I am determined to uphold the integrity of this House and all its Members."
"I would like to remind you of the great public responsibility resting on us as representatives elected by the people."
"The citizens have entrusted us with the right to exercise authority on their behalf."
"We must not disappoint that trust."
"The Bureau has decided that we must learn the lessons of this unfortunate incident."
"Parliament is trying to establish all the facts."
"We will cooperate fully with all competent authorities to explain everything that has happened and to verify all the information."
"At the request of the Bureau, I will be in contact with the national ministries for foreign affairs of the countries of the Members concerned to establish what action the judicial authorities in these countries intend to take."
"In Parliament, we must attend to strengthening our internal code of conduct for matters of this kind in the future, and this includes more severe sanctions."
"We think the recent events show the need for the existence of a legally-binding code of conduct for lobbies operating in the institutions of the European Union."
"(Applause)"
"I will keep you informed of developments as they happen."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wanted to speak before you highlighted Parliament's determination to call for the resignation of the other MEP, the last MEP, who has not yet resigned."
"I thank you and thank Parliament for making a firm and determined decision to implement a zero-tolerance policy because this is all about the credibility of everyone in this House, and above all we must remember that we represent 500 million citizens and not the lobbies, thank you."
"(FR) Mr President, I fully approve of your severity."
"I hope that it will also apply to journalists who cannot stir up trouble in order to provoke an offence and who are also in serious breach of ethics."
"As for the rest, this House is too attached to the presumption of innocence for me to comment on these matters further."
"(DE) Mr President, first of all I would like to defend the journalist."
"I think what has happened deserves to be praised."
"Are you aware, Mr Buzek, that there are going to be a dozen more cases?"
"Would you join us in recommending - as the Hans-Peter Martin's List would like to propose - that these fellow Members resign before they are exposed in the media in order to avoid causing further damage to the great European peace project?"
"I am therefore asking you to take this request into consideration in the Bureau and also to communicate it to the groups."
"(PL) Mr President, in your statement you said that you are expressing the opinion of the Bureau and the majority of Parliament."
"It is the opinion of the entire European Parliament."
"We are opposed to the actions of our former fellow Members. Thank you."
"(DE) Mr President, I would not have asked to take the floor had it not been for the speech before last."
"I believe that zero tolerance applies to all Members of this House."
"I would therefore like to ask the following question and I ask that a clear answer be given. Can you, Mr President, or can the Secretary General of this Parliament confirm that Mr Martin is required to repay EUR 168 000 to the European Parliament following a ruling by the European Court of Justice in respect of irregular accounting?"
"(Applause)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I propose we move to the next items on our order of business."
"Composition of committees and delegations : see Minutes"
"Mr President, given that the Japanese earthquake and the suffering in Japan have taken second place recently, would it not be appropriate for this Parliament to mark them and to join with the people of Japan, and their democracy, expressing our condolences by observing a minute's silence?"
"Last week we held a meeting of all Members of the European Parliament with the President of the European Commission and the President of the Council of the European Union, Mr Van Rompuy."
"At the beginning of that meeting I sent expressions of sympathy to the entire Japanese nation."
"I spoke, too, of the terrible suffering."
"We feel deeply for the Japanese people."
"We also stood to observe a minute's silence in the Chamber to honour the memory of those who died in this catastrophe."
"There was also a brief discussion on the subject."
"I think the House has done everything necessary to express our solidarity with the Japanese people."
"Thank you very much."
"(Applause)"
"Composition of political groups: see Minutes"
"Interpretation of the Rules of Procedure : see Minutes"
"Composition of Parliament"
"The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament has informed me that with effect from today Mr Severin is no longer a member of the group."
"This time it is an official notification."
"In accordance with Rule 211(3), the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has proposed the following interpretation of Rule 128 entitled 'Proceedings before the Court of Justice of the European Union'."
"The whole interpretation has been made available for your inspection."
"The above interpretation will be considered adopted if no objections are lodged by the opening of the sitting on Thursday, 24 March 2011."
"So you have until tomorrow at 9.00 to lodge objections to this interpretation."
"It is a long one, so I am not going to read it out."
"Nevertheless, all of you do have access to this interpretation."
"I would also like to inform you officially that Mr Thaler has resigned from Parliament with effect from 21 March 2011."
"In accordance with Rule 4(1) and (3), Parliament has noted the resignation and established the vacancy from the date I have just given. Mrs Soullie has resigned from Parliament with effect from 24 March 2011."
"In accordance with Rule 4(1) and (3), Parliament has noted the resignation and established the vacancy from the date I have just given."
"In addition, the competent authorities of France have informed me that Mrs Soullie will be replaced by Mr Hortefeux with effect from 24 March 2011."
"I understand Mr Hortefeux is with us today."
"Are you in the Chamber, Mr Hortefeux? We do not see him - he is not here."
"Under Rule 3(2), until such time as his credentials have been validated or a ruling has been given on any dispute, Mr Hortefeux will take his seat in Parliament and on its bodies and will enjoy all the rights attaching thereto, provided he has previously made a written declaration stating that he does not hold any office incompatible with that of Member of the European Parliament."
"Now Mr Cohn-Bendit would like to say something."
"(FR) Mr President, you know as well as I that the possibility of Mr Hortefeux becoming a Member of this House is being legally challenged. Even so, I find it somewhat disappointing that the French Government is not waiting for this status to be verified."
"Since Mr Hortefeux has not indicated his acceptance and not taken part in the inaugural session in Strasbourg, he cannot replace the Member he wants to replace."
"That is why I call for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), which claims to be so legalistic, to wait for a legal ruling on whether Mr Hortefeux may sit in this Chamber or not."
"Otherwise, it is a legal outrage."
"It is as if we are engineering one."
"(FR) Mr President, this is not the first time that our fellow Member Mr Cohn-Bendit, who called a president - a prime minister - a dictator in the mould of Hugo Chavez, has failed to respect democracy."
"Brice Hortefeux was elected as a Member of the European Parliament in June 2009."
"That is indisputable."
"At that time, he was appointed Minister of the Interior."
"French law stipulates that an elected representative of the European Parliament who joins government may regain his or her seat upon leaving government."
"That is exactly ..."
"(Interruption from Mr Cohn-Bendit: 'He did not have a seat - that is the problem, Mr Audy')"
"Brice Hortefeux was elected as a Member of the European Parliament."
"Do you accept that?"
"I shall conclude, Mr President."
"By virtue of the Treaties and of the law, it is indisputably up to Member States to name their MEPs."
"Having been elected, Brice Hortefeux was legitimately put forward by the French authorities to sit in this Chamber."
"The statement you made is unacceptable."
"(FR) Mr President, I would simply like to tell Mr Cohn-Bendit that, in order to challenge a seat, an official proposal must firstly be made."
"If no proposal is made, the Committee on Legal Affairs cannot analyse the situation."
"Before intervening in this way, I suggest that you think before you act."
"That is all."
"(Interruption from Mr Cohn-Bendit: 'Yes, but he might not have a seat')"
"You are the one asking me to observe the law."
"I have always observed the law."
"Now let us leave it to the Committee on Legal Affairs to give its verdict."
"It cannot give its verdict without a proposal."
"If that proposal is not lawful, the Committee on Legal Affairs will tell us."
"Let me say again: let us think before we act."
"(FR) Mr President, I fully agree with the idea that we should wait for the results of the legal analysis."
"I would simply like to say one thing: in our country, we are seeing a rise in extremism, and this is doubtless because one part of the political class considers mandates and posts to be at its disposal."
"We expect a little more from France, especially with regard to Parliament, which has its seat in Strasbourg."
"I would like to come back to the words I read out just now."
"Until such time as his credentials have been validated or a ruling has been given on any dispute, Mr Hortefeux is a Member of the European Parliament and is acting in accordance with the rules for Members of the European Parliament."
"The matter is subject to verification."

"1."
"Amendment of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union with regard to a stability mechanism for Member States whose currency is the euro ("
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this European stability mechanism is necessary in order to provide enduring legal assurance and in order to guarantee solidarity with countries that are having problems, but also in order to secure the euro, guarantee the necessary budgetary discipline and enable a joint response to growth challenges."
"In view of the time that an ordinary procedure would have taken, and also in order to avoid a referendum in some Member States, this can only be regulated by a simplified Treaty revision procedure."
"However, Parliament is saying that this should not become the usual procedure and that we should actually proceed here in accordance with the ordinary Treaty revision procedure."
"The original proposals stated that this should be a purely intergovernmental method in which the Commission had hardly any role and the European Parliament no role whatsoever."
"Today we are able to report that, further to the negotiations that we have held with the Commission, the European Central Bank, the President of the European Council and the President of the Euro Group, in almost all matters concerning models, tests and decision bases, all aspects concerned with defining a framework and proposing a regulation for this in a Community procedure, it has so far been accepted by the European Council, by the Council of Finance Ministers, that the European Parliament can also play a part in this process and will play a role in such matters."
"We were thus not too pleased initially, but I believe that if Community institutions are used and we can start using intergovernmental procedures as in the past, then when the time is right it will be easy to arrive at a clear Community policy."
"Since the institutional conditions are now in place, we can propose to you that we approve this Treaty revision procedure from the European Council and set it in motion."
"We therefore tabled such amendments with the unanimous approval of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs."
"We need to realise that our interpretations have also been accepted and confirmed by letters from the President of the Euro Group and the Commissioner for Monetary Affairs, as well as by a letter from the President of the European Council."
"I believe that this provides a reliable basis for our adopting this now in order to secure the euro, which has been a great success for Europe, and to move forward together."
"rapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the report that we are about to vote for, we still have reservations over the decision to adopt a revision of the Treaty on the intergovernmental character of the mechanism, but at the same time we are in favour, because - as Mr Brok explained - the negotiations that we conducted allowed us to achieve important objectives that relate mainly to the fact that the conditionalities associated with the assistance will be determined by a regulation, hence by a codecision procedure."
"It is therefore fair to vote in favour and I would like to thank the many fellow MEPs who have contributed to this result and mention the privilege of working with Mr Brok, Mr Pirillo's extremely useful advice and also the work of the two rapporteurs from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON): Mr Scicluna and Mr Gauzès, Mr Schade, Mrs Häfner and the group coordinators and of course the chairmen of the groups that have given us such significant political support, thank you."
"I would like to welcome the President of the European Commission and the Vice-President of the Commission who are here with us, and also the President-in-Office of the Council."
"We have some very important voting, we know that very well, so thank you for your presence at such an important moment."
"Ladies and gentlemen, you will be able to comment on the vote tomorrow."
"Now is not the time for explanations of vote, so please do not make such comments."
"Tomorrow after the vote there will be a time for comments on all the issues - those from today and from tomorrow together."
"Voting time"
"The next item is voting time."
"(For results and other details of the vote: see Minutes)"
"Explanations of vote"
"I am voting for this report, as the European Council's proposal to create a permanent stability mechanism would create an intergovernmental procedure beyond the EU's scope, which would be a dangerous precedent."
"The European institutions, specifically the European Commission and Parliament, must be an integral part of this board with the Commission as a member, not an observer."
"Parliament is an important organisation for democratic monitoring, and the Council should consider the proposal made by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament regarding a possible compromise on Parliament's involvement in the mechanism's operational components."
"As such, I would stress the report's idea that 'the mechanism must not give rise to a new model of European governance which falls short of the level of democratic standards achieved in the Union'."
"Moreover, the stability mechanism must be viewed as only a part of the framework of solutions for European economic governance, for example, the Commission should investigate the potential of a future system of Eurobonds."
"The European Council, which brings together European Heads of State or Government, is currently debating the implementation of a stability mechanism for Member States belonging to the euro area."
"The aim is to collectively ensure the financial stability of the Union, which is today being undermined."
"In this resolution, which I feel is balanced, Parliament welcomes this initiative, but issues a request to go beyond the temporary measures intended to stabilise the euro area."
"I share this point of view and feel that the EU must continue to strengthen its economic governance, in order, of course, to stabilise, but also to encourage sustainable growth."
"in writing. - (LT) Today we voted in favour of the amendment of Article 136 of the Lisbon Treaty, which will enable the EU to establish a stability mechanism which is only intended for members of the euro area."
"The European stability mechanism will be aimed at reinforcing budgetary discipline and coordination of economic and financial policies of the euro area Member States, including the promotion of a joint European response to such challenges as growth, overcoming economic and social imbalances and improving competitiveness."
"I believe that this mechanism will ensure greater financial stability for the euro area and will speed up the economic recovery of euro area Member States."
"However, countries not in the euro club, which were worst affected by the crisis, remain in the sidelines, and the road to more rapid and sustainable economic recovery will be blocked."
"I feel that the EU must show greater solidarity and provide the Member States with full assistance to enable them to join the club of euro area countries and become fully-fledged EU Member States."
"in writing. - (BG) As a representative of Bulgaria in the European Parliament, I voted against the draft decision because I think that it imposes double standards, which is something I strongly oppose."
"We have already seen such double standards in the case of Greece, which, rather than being punished, was rewarded with EUR 120 billion, while Bulgaria worries about its future in the euro area being on hold."
"in writing. - (CS) The introduction of the stability mechanism for states paying in euro marks the first use of the simplified revision option in the Lisbon Treaty."
"This is a revision which should also be supported by countries not paying in euro, since the stability of the euro is undoubtedly in their vital interest."
"However, this mechanism should not be overused, in my opinion, and I am pleased we have upheld the idea that it should be activated only in cases where it really is absolutely essential."
"This is an important signal as regards the responsibility of states and of creditors, since it does not establish a 'transfer Union' in which financially irresponsible states would run their affairs at the expense of the financial standing of countries having consolidated public finances."
"In contrast to that, I am not concerned that the proposed revision would create the conditions for introducing a stability mechanism entirely outside the scope of the Union."
"The interpretation and application of the relevant provision of the Lisbon Treaty will, in any event, be under the control of the European Court of Justice."
"The willingness or otherwise of states to involve other Union bodies in this mechanism must be respected, and any intergovernmental nature of the mechanism surely does not have to be a priori at the expense of quality or democratic legitimacy."
"As long as the financial side of the stability mechanism is linked to national budgets, it is quite understandable and logical that the mechanism should have an intergovernmental nature."
"in writing. - (CS) The report includes a proposal for a European stability mechanism, representing an integral part of an overall package of measures proposed with the aim of creating a new framework, while at the same time improving budgetary discipline and coordination of the economic and financial policy of Member States, which should also include support for a common European response to problems in the area of growth, leading at the same time to the elimination of economic and social inequalities, and to greater competitiveness."
"In my opinion, the Commission's call to consider other mechanisms as well for securing financial stability and economic growth in the eurozone is quite correct."
"I also believe the Commission is entirely right to call for the submission of legislative proposals that would include a stability mechanism and measures for reducing risks in the interests of financial, economic and social stability in the European Union, including the effective regulation of financial markets."
"It is entirely appropriate to review the stability and growth pact."
"The report also supports the introduction of instruments for reducing macroeconomic imbalances in the eurozone, and measures aimed at environmental renewal."
"For the reasons mentioned above, and for other reasons too, I have decided to support the report."
"I voted for Parliament's resolution because I agree that the European stability mechanism constitutes an important part of a global package of measures designed to define a new framework, reinforcing budgetary discipline and the coordination of Member States' economic and financial policies."
"This should include the promotion of a joint response by the European Union to growth challenges, concomitantly overcoming economic and social imbalances and improving competitiveness."
"I voted against the report on amendment of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union with regard to a stability mechanism for Member States whose currency is the euro."
"The Heads of State or Government of the European Union have responded to the economic crisis with austerity measures and public spending cuts."
"These measures and policies have brought the workers to their knees in most countries in Europe, in that they take the form of wage cuts, pension cuts, cutbacks to social rights and soaring unemployment."
"Basically, they are being forced to pay for the consequences of the economic crisis by those who caused it."
"This amendment to the Treaty paves the way for stepping up austerity measures and 'tops off' a package of 'supervisory' measures which includes the economic governance package and the European semester."
"The 'pact for the euro' basically overrides national economic policy and almost forcibly turns the institution of the euro area into a tool for Germany to exercise its economic policy."
"I also disagree with this particular use of the simplified procedure for revising the Treaty."
"I believe that the most appropriate method for amending the Treaties is by referendum in all the Member States."
"I voted for the report by Mr Brok and Mr Gualtieri, who recognise the need, within the Union's constitutional framework, to make viable the creation of a stability mechanism for Member States whose currency is the euro."
"Practice demonstrates that greater economic governance is needed within the EU, which will impact on economic and financial policy, and enable greater budgetary discipline."
"The report rightly stresses that temporary measures are insufficient and that any attempt to create a system outside the EU's institutional framework is a threat to the Union project; for this reason, it also rightly calls for a more significant role for the European Commission."
"I also agree with the call for the Commission to table any legislative measures that might prove necessary to strengthen financial stability and sustainable economic growth."
"I voted for the report on the stability mechanism for the Member States in the euro area, given that this mechanism marks a step towards better coordination of economic policies at European level."
"At the same time, a global package of measures is required which will aim to achieve economic stability and boost competitiveness in the EU."
"in writing. - I rejected the proposal as a whole as I do not believe it solves the problems."
"I agree with ETUC that the proposed changes will be 'paving the way to interfere with social dialogue and intervene in collective bargaining systems all over Europe'."
"Furthermore, I disagree with the choice of the simplified Treaty revision procedure."
"I believe that the ordinary Treaty revision procedure should be used in order to allow for a proper and in-depth discussion about the proposed stability mechanism and other possible changes to the treaties, for example a social progress clause."
"Finally, I urge the Member States to enable referenda in all Member States on proposals for Treaty change."
"in writing. - I welcome today's vote in the European Parliament on the proposed Treaty change."
"However, it is a matter of the utmost importance for the Heads of State Summit this weekend to honour its agreement with the European Parliament."
"As far as most MEPs are concerned, the process used by the Council in arriving at their proposed text is very unsatisfactory."
"If it were not for the fact that it is extremely important for the eurozone and that a permanent European stability mechanism (ESM) is urgently required, particularly for small Member States such as Ireland, I for one would be voting against the original proposal."
"The text we have agreed on in the European Parliament today is the minimum necessary to ensure legitimacy for the setting up of the Mechanism and its operation."
"However it does not signal any agreement by the Socialists and Democrats Group to the draconian austerity programmes expected of some Member States without reference to their economic sustainability."
"Parliament supports the limited amendment of the Treaty on European Union to allow for the implementation of a permanent stability mechanism for the euro area, which should be formally established during the European Council meetings of 24 and 25 March, by the amendment of Article 136 of the Treaty."
"This decision will help to make the financial stability mechanism, which has proved it effectiveness since being created last May, more permanent."
"We will thus have a healthy EUR 700 billion mechanism for providing loans, at the best rate and under strict conditions, to euro area countries in difficulty."
"It was, however, inconceivable that the amendment of the Treaties would consolidate a mechanism based solely on intergovernmental commitments."
"The Community method, which we favour, is the guarantee that all Member States of the euro area will receive equal treatment in accessing, subject to strict conditionality, this rescue fund."
"As for the International Monetary Fund, we will remain extremely vigilant with regard to the conditions of its participation."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of the report to amend the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union with regard to a stability mechanism for Member States whose currency is the euro, as it is essential to stabilising the euro area in the long term, to limiting speculation against European countries and to protecting the public."
"Despite the mechanism's intergovernmental nature, I believe that it is positive to strengthen the Union method, along with the role of the European institutions in the EU's economic governance, specifically that of the Commission and the European Parliament."
"in writing. - (SV) We Swedish Social Democrats support this report as a whole."
"At the same time, however, we believe that the wording of the text relating to a consolidated Eurobonds market goes too far."
"We consider the creation of a Eurobonds system to be an interesting and promising idea, but we believe that the matter must be investigated properly before it can be considered appropriate to go on to actually implement it."
"We currently know far too little for it to be possible to take any definitive decisions at this stage."
"At exceptional times in the history of states and organisations, such as these which we are now experiencing, we have a joint obligation to find appropriate and ambitious responses to the challenges we face."
"The debt crisis that Europe is fighting demands exceptional measures and the necessary maturity to find, within our institutional structure, the path towards mechanisms which will provide the euro with the necessary stability and resilience."
"Measures which are firmly anchored in budgetary discipline, in the coordination of macroeconomic policies and in the existence of sustainable growth policies."
"While I advocate legislative stability, it is because we are living through exceptional times that I support the currently proposed amendment of Article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to such an extent as to enable the creation of a permanent mechanism to safeguard the stability of the euro area, as proposed in report, adopted by this Chamber on 20 October 2010."
"The European Union must strengthen its economic governance, which will only be achieved using the Union method, with the Commission's leadership, rather than the intergovernmental method."
"I hope that the strengthening of the Stability and Growth Pact, the European Semester, the Europe 2020 Strategy and the amendment of Article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union with regard to a stability mechanism will result in sustainable economic growth."
"The workings of this mechanism must respect the fundamental principles of democratic decision-making, such as transparency, parliamentary monitoring and democratic responsibility."
"This mechanism constitutes an important part of a global package of measures aimed at defining a new framework in order to reinforce budgetary discipline and the coordination of Member States' economic and financial policies, which should include the promotion of a joint European response to growth challenges, concomitantly overcoming economic and social imbalances and improving competitiveness."
"I voted in favour of creating this mechanism in the hope that it will be a valuable contribution to conferring greater stability on the financial markets and providing sustainable economic growth."
"The intended simplified way of amending the Treaty is highly revealing of the vacuity of the claims of belief in the importance that the Treaty of Lisbon would ascribe to national parliaments - as well as the European Parliament - and of the falseness of all the rhetoric concerning deepening democracy."
"Little more than a year down the line, the Treaty, which was supposed to last at least a generation, is then being amended, in a quick and simplified way because of the desire and pressure from the directorate of powers led by Germany, which wishes to preserve at all costs the economic and political dominance guaranteed to it by the instruments of this EU, including the single currency."
"Discussion, participation and democracy fall by the wayside."
"If, in order to adopt the Treaty of Lisbon, they shied away from national referenda - and disrespected the few that were carried out - they now do not hesitate to escape even the scrutiny of the national parliaments."
"It is understandable if we consider the fact that, with the mechanism that they now wish to include in the Treaty and with so-called 'economic governance', there is a risk of these becoming meaningless words."
"There is no longer any doubt that they are intending to create a veritable straightjacket for the Member States, so that they may implement the strategy of deepening..."
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 170 of the Rules of Procedure)"
"We are against the entire process involving the announced amendment of the Treaty of Lisbon, as regards not just to its substance, but also to its form."
"The strict conditionality for the concession of financial assistance under the European stability mechanism is unacceptable for a number of reasons, the most significant of which is the possibility of removing powers from and interfering in the governing of the European Union Member States whose currency is the euro; interference in the budgetary, social and labour areas is particularly serious."
"It is an amendment which uses a mechanism of the Treaty itself to sideline everyone, enabling not just an amendment without any democratic participation - and, furthermore, continuing what they did by rejecting national referenda to adopt the Treaty - it creates a mechanism enabling permanent monitoring of Member States' economies."
"This report is along the same lines, tabling certain proposed amendments to the Commission's draft of the amendment to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union with regard to a stability mechanism for Member States whose currency is the euro."
"However, it always aims to consolidate the desired boost provided as part of the aforementioned economic governance, with the creation of the 'European Semester', the deepening of penalties..."
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 170 of the Rules of Procedure)"
"According to legal opinion, a limited amendment to the Treaty is needed to ensure that the European stability mechanism is within the European Union institutional framework."
"In the absence of other alternative solutions proposed by the Council, it was necessary to vote in favour of making the European stability mechanism permanent, in order to provide assistance to our Greek, Portuguese and Irish colleagues."
"However, the debate is far from over."
"This concession made by the French socialists is not an indicator of the outcome of other forthcoming debates on the economic governance issue."
"Faced with the introduction of this intergovernmental mechanism, it is important to move forward and implement instruments which will encourage recovery in growth and business."
"It is, among other things, to ensure that we are able to finance such instruments that I am campaigning alongside my socialist colleagues for an increase in the European Union's own resources."
"We could also use the Structural Funds in conjunction with the European stability mechanism to make deficit countries converge upwards."
"It is with ambitious budgets and the promotion of a European social model that we will be able to emerge from the crisis."
"I voted in favour of a stability mechanism (ESM) for the Member States of the euro area in order to help those of our neighbours that are in difficulty."
"This mechanism is an embryo of what the Eurobonds could be in future in terms of their ability to finance the Union's budget and to release the financial markets' stranglehold on the sovereign debt of Member States."
"I regret, however, the ESM approval method chosen - a simple consultation of the European Parliament - because the intergovernmental approach has prevailed over the Community approach."
"This poses a risk to the quality of democratic debate, which is nevertheless necessary in order to implement an effective economic policy."
"This mechanism remains a partial response which is not sufficient to encourage growth and reduce unemployment."
"I saw it as my duty, as a Member of Parliament, to achieve the maximum possible level of democratic control and integration of the European stability mechanism in the negotiations."
"The result is thus a great improvement on the original proposal."
"I am therefore voting in favour."
"However, I would like to set out my basic objections to the route upon which we have embarked."
"The ordinary Treaty revision procedure should have been required for the ESM."
"This would have enabled it to be set up within the Community framework with democratic participation and control."
"Reverting to the intergovernmental method is fatal."
"We are privatising (speculative) profits and socialising the losses."
"That is the wrong way to go."
"We let taxpayers suffer, but protect the banks, asset managers and speculators."
"The public sector is lending money to the banks here."
"It is the public sector that is bearing the costs - not the private sector."
"Without a fundamentally new concept of money and clear legal rules for the banking and financial sector we will continue to be only ever treating the symptoms, without remedying the underlying causes."
"in writing. - I abstained throughout the voting on this report."
"Scotland is not within the eurozone and I therefore consider it appropriate to withhold my vote on this issue."
"Having said that, I note that paragraph 6 refers to Europe's smaller nations 'whose economy may be seen as not ""indispensable” for the purposes of safeguarding the euro area as a whole'."
"I feel that this paragraph displays a dangerous arrogance; the EU is the sum of all its parts and the importance of all European economies is equal, regardless of size."
"History shows that unions based upon the dominance of larger members are doomed to fail."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this report, because the amendment of the Lisbon Treaty adopted will facilitate the establishment of the permanent euro stability mechanism."
"The situation today shows that we are in a difficult economic and financial situation and that we must take very specific actions regarding economic coordination and surveillance."
"However, this mechanism and the Guarantee Fund is only intended for euro area members, while countries not in the euro area will be sidelined, causing greater fragmentation of the EU."
"In my opinion, the EU must show greater solidarity, by providing assistance to non-euro area countries as well as countries in the euro area, so that they become full and equal EU Member States as quickly as possible, and we would thus eliminate a temporary discrepancy in the EU accession agreement and contribute to the creation of a more cohesive EU."
"in writing. - (IT) The resolution on the proposal to amend the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, approved in Parliament, concerning the provision of a European stability mechanism for the euro area, is an important goal for strengthening the cohesion and competitiveness of the economy and stabilising the financial system."
"I voted for the amendment, given the significance of the euro to the European political and economic plan for sustainable growth."
"The stabilisation of the euro area is of strategic importance, and I believe that Europe must include measures to strengthen it, increasing its economic governance in light of the objectives to be pursued by the EU 2020 Strategy."
"Lastly, I believe in the need for a permanent stability mechanism to provide for the involvement of Community institutions, both to avoid the setting-up of double structures and because establishing a mechanism outside the institutional framework of the EU would constitute a threat to the integrity of the system based on the Treaties."
"in writing. - I rejected the proposal as a whole as I do not believe it solves the problems."
"I agree with ETUC when they say that the proposed changes will be '... paving the way to interfere with social dialogue and intervene in collective bargaining systems all over Europe'."
"Furthermore I disagree with the choice of the simplified Treaty revision procedure."
"I believe that the ordinary Treaty revision procedure should be used in order to allow for a proper and in-depth discussion about the proposed stability mechanism and other possible changes to the Treaties, for example a social progress clause."
"Finally, I urge the Member States to enable referenda in all Member States on proposals for Treaty change."
"in writing. - (RO) I regard the stability mechanism as being particularly important and vital to the Member States which use the euro as their currency in terms of strengthening the single currency and supporting the European political and economic project."
"Strengthening and ensuring the stability of the single currency provide the market with security and make adopting the euro more attractive to new Member States."
"This matter is crucial to Europe's growth and development, values which I support in every respect."
"Consequently, I voted in favour of this report."
"in writing. - I am pleased with the results which Parliament has secured through negotiations with the Council, and as a result I supported this Treaty change."
"Giving a legal basis to a stability mechanism is vital to the immediate and long-term stability of the euro zone."
"The Council has given assurances that in future there will be a strong role for the Parliament and the Commission, which I believe is very important."
"While I approve this Treaty change I have very serious concerns regarding the current economic governance proposals, and voting in favour of this report is not an endorsement of the current economic governance package."
"in writing. - (IT) The new European stability mechanism requires an amendment to the Treaty of Lisbon, to ensure its legally valid inclusion within the institutional framework of the European Union."
"We believe that this should be accompanied by a strengthening of the preventive and corrective arm of the Stability and Growth Pact and measures relating to medium- and long-term competitiveness."
"Measures, in other words, capable of promoting a common European response, in order to better address the macro-economic imbalances between Member States and to ensure their sustainable growth."
"The European stability mechanism is therefore an important element of a comprehensive package of new measures (together with the European Semesters and the EU 2020 Strategy), aimed at establishing a new framework for strengthening and coordinating economic and financial policies and budgetary discipline."
"To ensure respect for the core principles of democratic decision-making such as transparency, parliamentary scrutiny and democratic accountability, Parliament must be adequately informed and involved."
"In addition, we support the need for each national parliament to be fully involved, in accordance with their budgetary and control rights, in order to increase the transparency, ownership and accountability of decisions taken, including at European level."
"This report endorses the institutionalisation of the control of the European Commission, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) over the budgets and the political reforms of the Member States of the euro area."
"It does not say a word about the social injustices that citizens will suffer in order to take advantage of the financial assistance that the European stability mechanism will provide."
"Neither does it mention the causes of the crisis, which is driving the Member States to agree to bleed their populations dry in order to reassure the financial markets."
"What is worse, it supports an abuse of authority which consists in using the simplified revision procedure of the Treaty of Lisbon in order to try and avoid a possible referendum."
"My group is the only one to set itself apart in demanding that referendums be held in all the Member States."
"Your European oligarchy fears democracy."
"It is right to do so, as the people of Europe, following the example of the North Africans, want to tell it to clear off!"
"We must not hesitate in combating the sovereign debt crisis that has been affecting some countries in the euro area."
"In another, less serious situation, I would not agree with the proposed amendment of the Treaty of Lisbon, which came into force so recently."
"At this time, it is essential to go beyond temporary measures to stabilise the euro area and there is no doubt that the EU must reinforce its means of combating the sovereign debt crisis."
"As such, the amendment of Article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union is essential to create a permanent European stability mechanism that will be effective in assisting Member States in difficulties."
"I voted against this report because in no way is this the solution to the economic crisis we are experiencing."
"The proposed changes pave the way for social dialogue to be torpedoed."
"Moreover, I do not agree with the choice of the simplified Treaty revision procedure."
"I am of the opinion that the simplified Treaty revision procedure should be used to create an atmosphere favourable to an in-depth discussion of the proposed stability mechanism and of other possible mechanisms, such as the social progress clause."
"Finally, we call on the Member States to lay the ground for referenda on potential modifications of the Treaty."
"in writing. - (HU) I represent a country from the euro area which at the time did not support the loan for Greece."
"This was a decision that naturally no one was pleased about."
"I sincerely hope that similar decisions will not have to be made often."
"The crisis spared neither the euro area nor the European Union, but our common currency has already proven itself on several occasions."
"It provides its users with a form of unity and protection which we can be rightly proud of as an EU achievement."
"For precisely this reason we must protect our currency against future economic swings with an appropriate legislative framework."
"Thanks to the current Treaty amendment, a European stability mechanism will replace the temporary stability tool."
"The mechanism reform offers a chance to those in trouble, thus I would prefer it to be used rarely."
"This is one of the last moments when we can coordinate our economic and financial systems."
"I supported this highly realistic and constructive solution with my vote."
"As Parliament has said before, the structural causes of the crisis need to be tackled."
"A repeat of a situation similar to the experiences of the recent past must be prevented."
"The debt crisis in the euro area has proven the need to establish an economic union and economic governance as quickly as possible."
"The European stability mechanism is an important aspect of the measure aiming to strengthen the budgetary discipline and coordination of the Member States' economic and financial policies."
"It is the first step in a series of changes required to establish a credible economic government."
"The permanent stability mechanism is the subject of an intergovernmental agreement, which unfortunately means that the unanimity rule will be applied."
"This is a dangerous approach as it could play into the hands of Eurosceptics."
"Ideally this mechanism should have been incorporated into the Community system."
"Indeed, the Commission should be able, in agreement with the Member States, to manage the objectives of the permanent stability mechanism rather than being limited to technical monitoring."
"Lastly, while it may have been necessary to use the simplified revision procedure in this case, I believe that it must remain an exception."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this resolution because it is important for the whole of the European Union as it recovers from the tough economic crisis."
"Consequently it is very important to establish such a mechanism that would stabilise the euro area and ensure its effective and efficient functioning and development."
"The European stability mechanism is a permanent aid fund assisting euro area Member States affected by the crisis."
"However, for this mechanism to function effectively it must be brought fully into the institutional framework of the Union."
"Above all, it is necessary to ensure that it is open from the outset to all Member States, even those whose currency is not the euro."
"I believe that it is advisable to provide for financial measures which would give the opportunity to purchase bonds from those countries that are facing enormous debt problems."
"This would pave the way for them to access financial markets while encouraging a speedier economic recovery."
"I agree with the proposal that other EU institutions should also be involved in the mechanism's management process, and that the Commission should be given more powers, in order to effectively implement the Union's expanded functions in this area."
"in writing. - (IT) I voted for the amendment of the Treaty with regard to a stability mechanism for Member States whose currency is the euro."
"I hope that Member States will come to a quick decision over its details and specificity."
"However, I do not think that the debate stops here."
"Indeed, I believe that in the coming months and years the issue to be faced will be whether to and how to use these contributions."
"I refer, for example, to the matter of Eurobonds."
"In a situation like the present, in which Member States are asked, on the one hand, to implement severe budget policies to reduce deficits and debts and, on the other, to pay contributions to participate in the stabilisation fund, there is a real risk of collapse and a risk of States no longer being able to finance themselves."
"The European economy cannot be revitalised unless, at the same time, we use the strength of the euro on international markets and the resulting improved credit rating for its recovery."
"The collection of money at European level allows Member States to cut spending to avoid overlap and to achieve a better return on their investment."
"Strengthening the EU's economic governance has become a priority, especially in the current international economic situation."
"In fact, when the Treaty of Lisbon came into force on 1 December 2009, there were no expectations that it would have to endure amendments in the near future."
"However, the well known, exceptional circumstances in financial, economic and also, now, social terms are the deciding factor for this amendment, which has a majority political support."
"Nevertheless, I cannot fail to stress that this simplified revision process must not set precedents for future constitutional revisions when there are no truly exceptional circumstances, such as these we are currently experiencing."
"I agree that there is a need for a concerted and coherent economic and financial policy between the Member States of the euro area, which could guarantee the cohesion and stability of the euro area, so I voted in favour of this report aimed at amending Article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, as well as institutionalising a permanent European financial stability mechanism with the aim of guaranteeing stability and financial assistance, according to certain conditions, specifically a rigorous analysis and the application of an economic and financial recovery programme."
"in writing. - (IT) Today we voted, during the mini part-session at the European Parliament in Brussels, on the report 'amending the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union with regard to a stability mechanism for Member States whose currency is the euro'."
"On 16 December 2010, the European Council decided to consult the European Parliament under the simplified revision procedure laid down in Article 48(6) of the Consolidated Version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union concerning a proposal to revise Article 136 of the Consolidated Version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union with regard to a stability mechanism for Member States whose currency is the euro."
"The objective of the proposal drafted by our colleague, Mr Brok, and fellow Member, Mr Gualtieri, is to add a paragraph to ensure that Member States whose currency is the euro are able to establish a mechanism to be activated in case of need to safeguard the stability of the euro area as a whole, stating that the granting of any necessary financial assistance under the mechanism will be subject to strict conditions."
"in writing. - According to the report voted today, the EP:"
"1. Emphasises that the monetary policy for the Member States whose currency is the euro is a Union-exclusive competence and has been a Community policy since the Maastricht Treaty; and"
"2. Stresses the importance of the euro for the European political and economic project, and underlines the importance of the commitment made by all Member States in favour of the stability of the euro area and the sense of responsibility and solidarity they have shown."
"At the same time, it considers that it is essential to go beyond the temporary measures aiming at stabilising the euro area, and that the Union should build up its economic governance, including by means of policies and instruments designed to promote sustainable growth in Member States, and takes the view that the reinforcement of the SGP, the European Semester, the EU 2020 Strategy and the amendment of Article136 TFEU concerning the stability mechanism are only a first step in that direction."
"in writing. - (IT) I support the wording of this resolution because I believe that the monetary policy of the euro should remain an exclusive competence of the European institutions, since this would avoid the setting-up of double structures which would prove detrimental to European integration."
"All Member States currently coordinate their economic policies in accordance with measures dictated by the European institutions for the stability of the entire euro area."
"The current draft Council decision could create a decision-making mechanism on the stability of the euro that is outside the sphere of Parliament and the Commission."
"For this reason, the stability mechanism is a joint response to economic and social growth challenges and to encourage the introduction of the euro in the remaining Member States."
"I hope that the setting up and functioning of a permanent stability mechanism will involve the contribution of the entire European institutional framework, and when necessary, through the use of the enhanced cooperation procedure in order to ensure the transparency of all decisions."
"in writing. - I rejected the proposal as a whole as I do not believe it solves the problems."
"I agree with ETUC when they say that the proposed changes will be '... paving the way to interfere with social dialogue and intervene in collective bargaining systems all over Europe'."
"Furthermore I disagree with the choice of the simplified Treaty revision procedure."
"I believe that the ordinary Treaty revision procedure should be used in order to allow for a proper and in-depth discussion about the proposed stability mechanism and other possible changes to the treaties, for example a social progress clause."
"Finally, I urge the Member States to enable referenda in all Member States on proposals for Treaty change."
"in writing. - We rejected the proposal as a whole as we do not believe it solves the problems."
"We agree with ETUC when they say that the proposed changes will be '...paving the way to interfere with social dialogue and intervene in collective bargaining systems all over Europe'."
"Furthermore we disagree with the choice of the simplified Treaty revision procedure."
"We believe that the ordinary Treaty revision procedure should be used in order to allow for a proper and in-depth discussion about the proposed stability mechanism and other possible changes to the treaties, for example a social progress clause."
"Finally, we urge the Member States to enable referenda in all Member States on proposals for Treaty change."
"The sovereign crisis affecting the Member States is obliging the European Union to rethink its economic strategy."
"The Union's economic governance is gradually becoming a reality."
"There is a need for a concerted and coherent economic and financial policy between the Member States of the euro area: a true 'pact for the euro'."
"Therefore, and to guarantee the stability of the euro area, this report aims to amend Article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, as well as to institutionalise a permanent European financial stability mechanism with the aim of guaranteeing stability and financial assistance, according to certain conditions, specifically a rigorous analysis, and the application of an economic and financial recovery programme."
"I am voting for this amendment because I believe it to be essential to institutionalise the European mechanism and simultaneously make it more flexible."
"Nevertheless, I cannot fail to underline that it must take into account the competences of the European institutions, so an institutional framework separate from these must not be created."
"Current events require the uptake of serious and real positions at Member State level, particularly those states in the euro area."
"However, I cannot fail to stress that this simplified revision process must not set precedents for future constitutional revisions."
"in writing. - (DE) I voted in favour of this addendum to the Treaty on the Functioning of the Union because it has logical consequences for economic governance and promotes further coherence in the euro area with a view to common financial policy."
"Moreover, it is right that no country is given discounts and that no distinction is made between good and bad debt."
"The pact between generations means that the burden of debt is always passed on to subsequent generations, restricting their freedom to act and their future opportunities."
"The draining of European public finances as a result of the Member States' crucial commitment to controlling the fall in growth following the financial crisis has created significant public deficits which are subject to frenzied speculation."
"It required the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) to be made permanent."
"I welcome the institutionalisation of this instrument, which clearly expresses solidarity within the euro area, and which, in return, calls on its members to be more responsible."
"Firstly, activating this mechanism provides assistance to Member States in serious financial difficulty and, secondly, the mechanism requires those States, in return, to reduce their deficit."
"By implementing a shared approach to the management of part of the Member States' public debt and by making their economies converge, this mechanism is in fact part of a more comprehensive strategy which my political family broadly supports, namely economic governance of the euro area."
"We are not talking here about a theoretical gadget or a European gimmick; we are talking about a clear need and about real progress for Europe."
"The strength of our currency, our capacity to import at low cost and our ability to attract investment to Europe are dependent on this strategy."
"in writing. - (DE) The Brok/Gualtieri report explicitly states that the Council - and thus the Member States - have failed to implement the Stability and Growth Pact fully and that ways of stabilising the Pact that exist in the treaties have not been exploited."
"Moreover, with this report Parliament gives its backing to the European Commission and unreservedly supports its 'intention to ensure consistency between the future mechanism and the Union's economic governance' in order to prevent any future crisis like the one we have at present."
"As early as paragraph 3 of the report it is established that the European Parliament sees the stability mechanism as 'part of a global package of measures which are designed to define a new framework, reinforcing budgetary discipline and coordination of economic and financial policies of the Member States'."
"I share this view of many of my fellow Members."
"in writing. - (SK) The single currency has brought greater freedom to Europe."
"However, freedom must always go hand in hand with responsibility."
"This is where the problem lies."
"Some Member States apparently did not take their own share of responsibility for the common currency very seriously."
"They now need to borrow more money for the gradual repayment of these debts, but the banks no longer trust them."
"The countries that acted responsibly had a choice: allow the debtors to go bankrupt, or show solidarity."
"As a staunch European, I am glad that the principle of solidarity prevailed."
"At the same time, however, I expect the new mechanism to be applied cautiously, in order to avoid what we see happening today, with both Greece and Ireland requesting more aid on top of the original amount."
"I also expect that our solidarity will not be abused by those who need it, or by those who are seeking a convenient pretext for tax harmonisation and other ways to curtail Member State sovereignty."
"Corrections to votes and voting intentions: see Minutes"
"Preparation for the European Council meeting (24-25 March 2011) (debate)"
"The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on preparation for the European Council meeting to be held on 24 and 25 March 2011."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, President Barroso, Commissioner, honourable Members, I very much welcome the opportunity to appear before you in advance of the next meeting of the European Council."
"As you know, it will be a very intensive meeting due to the unforeseen events of the last couple of weeks."
"Let me first run you through the main issues on the agenda of the European Council."
"There will be three major items: first a comprehensive economic package which, hopefully, will be adopted by the Heads of State and Government; then Libya and the southern neighbourhood; and thirdly Japan."
"Let me start with the economic policy issues."
"The European Council will, I hope, adopt this package in order to respond to the economic and financial crisis."
"The package has six major elements, the first being the conclusion of the first phase of the European Semester, with endorsement of the priorities for fiscal consolidation and structural reforms."
"As you know, the European Semester cycle started early in the year with the presentation of the Commission's annual growth survey."
"It brings together various policy recommendations required to strengthen recovery, to help Europe maintain its international competitiveness and to achieve the EU 2020 objectives."
"The first phase of the European Semester will now be concluded with the endorsement by the European Council of the priorities for fiscal consolidation and structural reform, in line with the conclusions prepared by the ECOFIN and EPSCO Councils."
"The theme of this report - which was prepared by the Presidency - was welcomed by the General Affairs Council last Monday."
"Member States will take these broad policy orientations into account when preparing their stability and convergence programmes and the national reform programmes to be submitted in April."
"On the basis of the Commission's assessment, the Council will subsequently provide its assessment and guidance to the Member States in June: that is, at a time when important budgetary decisions are still in a preparatory phase in most Member States."
"The Hungarian Presidency's aim is to close the first European Semester by the time of the European Council in June 2011."
"The second element is the strengthening of economic governance, and here the European Parliament has a decisive role."
"The Council has already taken a major step forward: the Ministers for Economic and Financial Affairs have agreed the Council's general approach in relation to the six legislative proposals on reinforcing economic governance."
"This achievement enables the Presidency to start negotiations with this Parliament."
"As you know, the Council has to observe a deadline set by the European Council - June 2011 - for reaching political agreement on the package."
"Four out of the six proposals are subject to codecision."
"We know that the deadline imposed by the European Council does not, by any means, bind the European Parliament, yet I take this solemn opportunity to ask for Parliament's cooperation so that we can reach political agreement by June."
"It would send reassuring messages to the markets and, most importantly, to our citizens who expect us to safeguard the euro and the European economy with it."
"So we have a common responsibility with the European Parliament in this matter."
"Our Prime Minster is about to meet the rapporteurs and the coordinators who are responsible for this package and I hope that we will have extremely fruitful cooperation with Parliament."
"The third element is the restoration of the health of the banking sector through the ambitious new stress test."
"The fourth is the pact for the euro, its extension to Member States outside the euro area who wish to join it, and possible announcement of the first national action plans to implement it."
"The fifth element is finalisation of the work on the future of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) and on strengthening the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), building on the agreement in the Eurogroup Plus ministerial meeting on 21 March, and you all know that the terms of reference of the European Stability Mechanism mention the fact that information will be provided to Parliament."
"I was especially pleased about that."
"The sixth element is the Treaty amendment, on which you have just voted, and the formal adoption of the decisions amending the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union with regard to the setting up of the future ESM."
"I would like to thank Parliament here for this positive vote: I think it was an extremely important contribution on your part."
"As you see, real progress has been made in combating the crisis."
"The European Council will finalise this work at its next meeting and adopt a comprehensive package of measures to respond to the crisis, preserve financial stability and lay the ground for sustainable, job-creating growth."
"Let me turn now to Libya and the southern neighbourhood."
"On the basis of the European Parliament resolution of 10 March 2011, the European Council's conclusions of 11 March 2011 and UN Security Council Resolution 1973, the Council has expressed its concerns at the present situation in Libya and has condemned the gross and systematic violation of human rights, the violence and brutal repression perpetrated by the regime against the Libyan people."
"The EU's main aims are protection of the civilian population and support for the Libyan people being able to realise their aspirations for a democratic society."
"Colonel Gaddafi must relinquish power immediately."
"His regime has lost legitimacy and is no longer an interlocutor for the EU."
"So what kind of action has the Council taken?"
"First let me mention the sanctions."
"On 28 February 2011, in record time, the Council adopted decisions concerning restrictive measures against the regime."
"On 10 March further sanctions were added, including an asset freeze, a further travel ban, an arms embargo and an embargo on equipment which might be used for internal repression - thus going beyond the measures imposed by the previously adopted UN Security Council resolution."
"Let me announce a third element: a third round of sanctions."
"Acting upon the mandate given by the Foreign Affairs Council on 21 March, the Council has today adopted, by written procedure, the Hungarian Presidency's proposal to extend restrictive measures to further Libyan individuals and entities, and these sanctions already extend to the national oil company of Libya."
"What else did the Council do besides sanctions?"
"The Hungarian Presidency put the question of emergency supply security on the agenda."
"Ministers discussed the impact of the political crisis on the energy market, energy security and supply."
"They agreed that the EU has sufficient oil and gas stocks. Nevertheless the discussion highlighted, once again, the vulnerability of Europe and the need for an even stronger common energy policy, including measures such as diversification of supply routes."
"The Council expressed its satisfaction after the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 1973 and underlined its determination to contribute to its implementation."
"The Council also welcomed the Paris Summit as a decisive contribution to its implementation."
"By contributing in a differentiated way, the EU and the Member States are determined to act collectively and resolutely with all the international partners, particularly the Arab League and other regional stakeholders, to give full effect to these decisions."
"The Council and the Member States will support actions under the UN Security Council resolution to protect civilians and civilian population areas under threat of attack."
"The EU will continue to provide humanitarian assistance to all those affected, and of course - at a later stage - we will have to help Libya in building a democratic state and developing the rule of law."
"The EU is preparing to provide CFSP support and humanitarian assistance in response to a request from the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and under the coordinating role of the UN."
"Such actions will fully respect the UN guidelines on the use of military and civil defence assets."
"The High Representative has been asked to develop further planning in accordance with the UN resolution and the European Council declaration of 11 March on support for humanitarian assistance and civil protection operations, including the use of maritime resources for this purpose."
"Everything should be done in the closest possible cooperation with the UN, NATO and others."
"The High Representative will maintain contacts with the UN Secretary-General and countries in the region, including Egypt and Tunisia, and has stated that this process should be undertaken as a matter of urgency in order to allow further consideration by the European Council by the end of this week."
"Furthermore, the Member States have underlined once again their solidarity with those of their number most directly affected by migratory movements, and have reiterated their readiness to provide necessary support as the situation evolves."
"The Hungarian Presidency put this issue to the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 24 and 25 February 2011, and the joint operation Hermes has been launched under the Frontex framework, with several Member States contributing resources."
"Let me mention what has happened on evacuation."
"As early as 23 February, the Presidency activated the EU's civil protection mechanism to support the evacuation of EU citizens from Libya - a decision also supported by the High Representative."
"Inspired by the principle of responsibility to protect, set out in the EP resolution, the Hungarian Presidency is doing its utmost to coordinate the ongoing work, in particular with regard to refugees and migration issues."
"The Hungarian Minister for Foreign Affairs, János Martonyi, and Commissioner Malmström are currently visiting Egypt and its common border with Libya."
"Minister Martonyi has been to the border and talked to the local authorities and, in a statement made there earlier, he said that without the air strikes an unbearable situation would have evolved."
"Now the situation is under control, thanks to the Egyptian authorities."
"For three days, there has been no outflow of people; some Libyans have decided to return but of course the situation is still shaky and we do not know whether there will be further outflows or not."
"On 3 March I was at the Tunisian-Libyan border, in the company of Commissioner Georgieva, to see the state of affairs there."
"The situation was still very serious: 1000 people per hour were entering Tunisia across that border."
"Evacuation was the most important issue on 3 March, and it is still very important that Member States help with the repatriation of non-EU citizens, mostly migrant workers."
"In the absence of a resident European Union delegation, the Hungarian Ambassador in Tripoli has been representing the EU."
"He is there and will not leave; he coordinates the consular and diplomatic efforts on behalf of the Member States."
"On the southern neighbourhood: at its extraordinary meeting on 11 March, the European Council declared that democratic uprisings are bringing dramatic changes to the southern neighbourhood, creating new hope and an opportunity to build a future based on democracy, pluralism, the rule of law, human rights and social justice."
"It has to be stated that aggression is taking place not only in Libya: we should be aware that in Bahrain and in Yemen people are also experiencing aggression, and we have to be very clear that aggression is not acceptable anywhere."
"It is for the countries in the region to decide their future in a peaceful and democratic way."
"The EU will support all steps towards democratic transformation to political systems that allow for peaceful changes, growth and prosperity and more proportionate distribution of the benefits of economic performance."
"The EU will consult with the countries of the region that are concerned on financial and technical support for improving the control and management of borders, as well as measures to facilitate the return of migrants to their countries of origin."
"The Council, in cooperation with the Commission, was invited to submit - before the June European Council - a plan for the development of capacities to manage migration and refugee flows."
"The European Council broadly welcomed the joint communication from the Commission and the High Representative proposing a partnership for democracy and shared prosperity in the southern Mediterranean, following a differentiated and incentive-based approach and bringing together all EU instruments."
"The Council was invited rapidly to examine the proposals contained in the communication and, in particular, to consider how the Union's support for its partners could be enhanced."
"I will conclude with a rapid presentation of the ideas on which very swift action is needed."
"We have to increase the ceiling for European Investment Bank operations for Mediterranean countries undertaking political reform -Parliament will have a role on this issue and I count on your cooperation."
"We have to adopt the Commission proposal to allow the EIB to reinvest within the FEMIP funds flowing from past operations."
"We have to examine, with other stakeholders, conditions under which the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development could operate in the southern neighbourhood, and we have to adopt without delay the proposal on pan-Euro-Mediterranean rules of origin, which is essential for further development of the region."
"Lastly, adoption by June 2011 of the regulation enhancing the capabilities of Frontex is, I think, a must."
"I will stop there."
"I will not speak on Japan because we now have a new item on the agenda."
"I am sorry if my speech was a bit too long."
"The reason is that a lot of things have happened and I wanted Parliament to have a comprehensive picture of all the issues."
"President of the Commission. - Mr President, as I said last week to this Parliament, what Europe will put in place at this European Council on 24-25 March will be a real game-changer in terms of economic governance."
"In other words, it will be a cornerstone in our comprehensive response to the crisis, and will mark the beginning of its full implementation with the setting up of a new economic governance framework - and, hopefully, a European Monetary Union (EMU) walking on its two legs (the Monetary Union and the Economic Union) instead of limping along."
"The economic policy of each Member State is now recognised as a matter that should concern all Member States and all European institutions."
"For the first time - with the European Semester - we have the tools we need for early and strong coordination of our economic policies and structural reforms, before each Member State sets its own policies and budget for the next year."
"Not only do we have ex ante coordination, but we can do it in parallel with the economic policy and budgetary policy."
"The first European Semester kicked off earlier in January with the Commission's Annual Growth Survey, which presents 10 priorities for this year, all firmly anchored in the Europe 2020 Strategy for growth and jobs."
"They are intended to promote fiscal consolidation, correct macroeconomic imbalances, and ensure financial stability - all prerequisites for sound growth."
"In itself those policies will not deliver growth, but it is quite clear that without those prerequisites we will not have the kind of growth we need: sustainable inclusive growth."
"The Pact for the euro, agreed by Heads of State and Government of the euro area and open to all Member States wishing to join, reflects the priority actions of our Annual Growth Survey, but now the Pact for the euro, as it was agreed, is also fully compatible with the Treaty and will be fully integrated in the European system of economic governance."
"Once again I want to thank this Parliament because I believe the strong positions taken by this Parliament were very important to assure that the Community approach could also be recognised in the Pact for the euro."
"The Pact for the euro also recognises the Commission's work on taxation and financial regulation."
"In fact as you know, the Commission is working on a proposal to tax the financial sector."
"Every Member State, when implementing the Stability and Growth Pact, must follow the recommendations of the Commission."
"As decided last week, and I quote: 'In deciding on the steps in the Stability and Growth Pact the Council is expected to, as a rule, follow the recommendations of the Commission or explain its position in writing'."
"This is the principle of 11 March 2011."
"I think it is a very important political principle that can be added to the important legislative decisions that have been taken, and also some that you are now preparing."
"Fiscal consolidation is not an end in itself."
"Without fiscal consolidation there is no confidence."
"Without confidence there are no investments."
"Without investments there is no growth."
"But our target, as I said in this Parliament several times before, is growth: sustainable inclusive growth."
"For that we also need to improve the business environment."
"We need to complete the internal market."
"One of the goals we have in the internal market is precisely the different bases in terms of taxation."
"That is why the Commission has proposed, and has now tabled, a legislative proposal for a Common Corporate Consolidated Tax Base."
"We need indeed to tap the full potential of the Single Market, and the Commission will soon put forward the Single Market Act with a set of a dozen priority proposals to put our biggest asset to work, to deliver growth and jobs and reinforce Europe's competitiveness."
"We also have to do more to foster employment."
"We need more labour mobility, not less mobility."
"We need more promotion of tax incentives to work and we want growth that is employment-enhancing and employment-friendly."
"In close cooperation with the Commission, Member States are now finalising their National Reform Programmes as well as their Stability or Convergence Programmes."
"Let me stress that having clear, concrete, ambitious, nationally-owned programmes is essential to the successful implementation of the European Semester."
"So it is now up to each Member State to have this serious work completed by the end of April."
"Last week the Council agreed on its general approach to the Commission's legislative package on reinforced economic governance."
"I would again like to thank the Hungarian Presidency for all its efforts which led to a successful compromise."
"Now negotiations will start with Parliament."
"I know that the Commission can count on strong support from this House, and I hope we will have a final agreement by June."
"Then our new economic framework would be fully in place and all its tools could be used to assess national budgets, Stability and Convergence Programmes, as well as National Reform Programmes by 2012."
"Finally, with the current European Financial Stability Fund, and by 2013 the permanent European Stability Mechanism (ESM), we will have a backstop tool to guarantee the stability of the Euro area as a whole, if needed."
"Last Monday the Finance Ministers agreed to set up the European Stability Mechanism from June 2013 with effective lending capacity of EUR 500 billion."
"This is a major step forward for the European Union which the Commission, as you know, has been strongly promoting."
"Following our proposals, the agreement for the future ESM clearly states the central role of the Commission in the process, as well as the implication of the European Parliament."
"It will be for the Commission to assess, in liaison with the European Central Bank (ECB), the existence of a risk to the financial stability of the euro area as a whole and to undertake analysis of the sustainability of the public debt of the Member State concerned."
"Further, it will be for the European Commission to take the lead in assessing the actual financing needs of the beneficiary Member State, as well as the nature of the required private sector involvement."
"It will be also for the European Commission to propose to the Council a decision endorsing the macroeconomic adjustment programme."
"The European Commission, together with the IMF and in liaison with the ECB, will be responsible for monitoring compliance with the policy conditionality required by a macroeconomic adjustment programme."
"The policy conditionality established under an enhanced surveillance or a macroeconomic adjustment programme will be consistent with the European Union surveillance framework and must guarantee the respect of European Union procedures, and thereby also the role of the European Parliament."
"To this end, the Commission intends to propose a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council based on Article 136 of the Treaty clarifying the necessary procedural steps in order to enshrine the policy conditionality in Council decisions and ensure consistency with the European Union multilateral surveillance framework."
"The Council and the Commission will inform the European Parliament on a regular basis about the establishment and the operations of the ESM."
"Honourable Members, I just want to confirm what was said in a letter by Commissioner Rehn and the President of the Eurogroup, Jean-Claude Juncker, to you, President Buzek."
"I think at the end we have an agreement that is fully compatible with a Community approach and I want once again to thank Parliament for its interest and commitment to that approach."
"On the financial stabilisation front, Member States have eventually acknowledged the degree of interdependence of their economies."
"The European Union has already done a lot towards repairing the banking system, but here also we need to do more."
"A healthy banking system is a prerequisite for a sustainable economic recovery."
"The next round of EU-wide bank stress tests will be conducted in the next months by the newly established European Bank Authority (EBA)."
"Transparency is essential so that policy-makers and investors can make informed judgements; so is the willingness to follow through with tough indispensable decisions."
"I think after the very comprehensive and good report by Mrs Győri, representing the Hungarian Presidency, I will not now elaborate on the issues regarding Libya and the southern Mediterranean."
"However, let me tell you, as regards the European Commission's competence, that we have been playing a substantial role in coordinating the European response to the escalating humanitarian crisis on the Libyan borders."
"We have mobilised EUR 30 million to provide assistance to refugees and migrants and, as you know, we have several teams on the ground and we maintain close contact with countries of origin and donors."
"The Commission's Civil Protection Mechanism (MIC) is also continuing to support Member States' consular operations; and working closely with the Hungarian Presidency, Commissioner Malmström and Commissioner Georgieva have also been very active on this matter."
"The no-fly zone military actions, implemented pursuant to UN Security Council Resolution 1973, brought about new circumstances that need to be factored in when delivering humanitarian assistance in a secure and efficient way to those in need, either at the borders or inside Libya."
"It brought new hope as well as addressing the need to spare civilian innocent lives."
"While dealing with the short-term challenges of this fast-changing and extremely complex situation, we are not losing sight of our long-term goal of a democratic stable prosperous Southern Mediterranean region based on the Commission proposal on Partnership for Democracy and Shared Prosperity."
"The Commission's Civil Protection Mechanism is also coordinating the European Union's response to Japan's request for assistance."
"Since last Friday we have reinforced our presence on the ground with a civil protection team composed of logistics and nuclear experts."
"Specifically on nuclear issues, it is important to draw lessons from the events in Japan."
"That is why the European Commission proposed to review the safety of nuclear sites and the comprehensive risk and safety assessment ('stress test') on all European nuclear sites."
"These stress tests should also be carried out in all our neighbouring countries and beyond, under the responsibility of the IAEA."
"I hope of course that the European Council will confirm and endorse this orientation."
"Honourable Members, as you see, we have a very full agenda for the next European Council and the Commission has been working hard to develop this comprehensive European response to the crisis outside our borders, but also regarding the economic situation."
"We will, together with the European Parliament, play a central role in the implementation of the comprehensive response to the economic crisis."
"We will do this always in the spirit of the Lisbon Treaty, that is, in close coordination with your Parliament."
"And you can be sure that we will always live up to this responsibility as well."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Council is preparing to meet for the second week running amid a climate of international uncertainty and tensions."
"There is the uncertainty in Japan, where the level of human loss is still difficult to determine, and uncertainty in the Mediterranean, as further populations rise up against their regimes, in Bahrain and as you mentioned President-in-Office of the Council, in Yemen."
"Inevitably, all these situations are having repercussions for us here in Europe."
"Our fellow citizens have witnessed Japan's drama unfolding live."
"On top of the empathy we feel for the thousands of families shattered by grief, as we speak there are fears associated with the problems at the Fukushima nuclear power plant and the dread of the dangers that we too could face in a similar or comparable situation."
"These events should certainly be taken on board by all countries that have nuclear power plants and it is good that this Parliament is organising a debate on nuclear safety, though we should not lose sight of the fact that in Europe we need to be increasing and not reducing our energy independence."
"This is a subject we will be returning to during our next part-session."
"This weekend, the 27 Heads of State or Government will also be discussing the UN decision to intervene in Libya to save the insurgents from imminent attack by the regime."
"I would like to highlight the fact that European States have taken the initiative in these operations and were the first to intervene within the framework of the UN mandate, which itself was the initiative of several European States."
"No doubt they heard what us MEPs said during our last part-session here in Brussels."
"My group would like to see the Council take this opportunity to further develop the EU's Mediterranean strategy, whilst maintaining the goal to help and support but never to impose."
"This is our duty as neighbours."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following last week's euro area summit, at which the groundwork was done, the Council's flagship measures this week will relate to strengthening the euro and making progress on economic governance."
"The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) is in favour of increasing the funds available to support the euro and of making the ad hoc instrument we adopted last year to help Greece and Ireland more permanent."
"This political will reflects the responsible attitude that Member States have taken in managing this unprecedented crisis in our single currency's history."
"However, we wish to stress very strongly that these exceptional circumstances that the loss of control of national public finances has brought about must not be seen by the Council as an opportunity to adopt a different method for managing European affairs."
"The Community method must remain the rule and the intergovernmental method the exception."
"A very strong majority within Parliament supports this principle and the Barroso Commission also supports us in this approach, quite simply because it is vital for the future of the European Union."
"I am sure that President Van Rompuy will succeed in persuading the Heads of State or Government of this."
"The Pact for the euro should also be adopted on Friday."
"We welcome it insofar as it introduces provisions for which we have been calling for months now, namely convergence between Member States' budgetary, social and fiscal policies."
"I cannot stress this enough: European solidarity will only be accepted by our citizens if they feel it is fair and deserved."
"This will only be the case if the working conditions are met and if our businesses can invest and recruit under comparable fiscal conditions."
"Lastly, our group calls upon the Council to make swift progress on the economic governance package and to take proper account of the European Parliament's position as co-legislator on four out of the six proposals under discussion."
"Europe must get back on the path of growth and employment, and the measures that are taking shape are a step in this direction."
"Provided they are planned within a Community framework, they will give Europe a healthy basis for a fresh start and a promising future."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - (DE) Mr President, firstly I would like to give the President of the Commission good wishes on his birthday today."
"You deserve to be congratulated on that."
"(Applause)"
"I cannot share your cheerfulness ahead of this summit."
"I believe it is a summit that is taking place in the worst phase of the European Union, when it is in its worst state."
"It starts with Libya."
"Seldom has a campaign been prepared so hastily and in such an unstructured way as this campaign, which is actually a good thing and is intended to help people but which is now ending up a diplomatic and - possibly, although I hope not - a military disaster: hasty, uncoordinated, disorganised."
"Europe is running away from it in every direction and Turkey, our accession candidate, blocks everything."
"Many congratulations!"
"At this juncture we need to take stock."
"This crisis has been ongoing for a year, and for the past year the same process has been taking place over and over again."
"At first what is required is contested, only to be acknowledged four or five months later."
"A year ago people said 'The Greeks should deal with it themselves."
"We do not need to help them'."
"Four months later: a bail-out."
"'We do not need a rescue package."
"The amount we have made available is enough.'"
"Four months later: 'We need more money'."
"'We do not want Eurobonds. Eurobonds are nonsense.'"
"Now everyone is discussing Eurobonds."
"Eurobonds will come - of that I am quite sure."
"Perhaps in four months' time."
"'We do not need economic governance."
"Europe does not need economic governance.'"
"The same people who were adamantly maintaining this are celebrating at a European Council meeting the fact that now at last we have economic governance."
"They are not even embarrassed about saying and doing the opposite of what they previously announced."
"I also do not know whether we have yet rescued the Community method."
"I hope so and we support you in it, Mr Barroso."
"Not just as a birthday present, but because Europe must defend the Community method, because we can see that if we change to this other method which Chancellor Merkel calls the 'new European method' we will have exactly what I have just described."
"Everyone does something and the next day does the opposite of what was announced the day before yesterday."
"That is the reality."
"We are not dealing with a crisis of the euro; we are dealing with a crisis of the governments in the euro zone countries."
"There is a crucial difference."
"With respect to Portugal, everyone is talking and hoping that the government will be able to implement what are actually improbably harsh measures."
"Moreover, it is a government - like the situation in Greece - that is acting in part against the will of its own electorate, and then we have some tactical play from the opposition party which is putting the screws on the government."
"In Germany, the finance minister - a pro-European - comes up with a package that we all need just a few days before this summit, and then the foreign minister and the Chancellor say: 'Well, we will have to talk it over again first'."
"Last Friday I had opportunity to talk to many leading people from the European financial world on the issue of 'Does the euro enjoy confidence?'."
"The answer from those in Frankfurt that I spoke to - including the President of the European Central Bank and the President of the Euro Group, but also many other leading bankers - was: 'Yes, the euro is a stable currency."
"However, we have no confidence in the governments of the countries that have this euro."
"How can you have confidence in a government that cannot keep its word for even three days?'"
"That is the problem that we are grappling with in Europe."
"We have embarked upon the wrong course."
"The euro is a strong currency."
"It is also the expression of the economic might of the euro area in competition with other continents."
"On its introduction the euro was worth USD 1.17."
"Look at what it is worth today."
"The euro is a stable currency in the intercontinental competition between economic zones, but it is being destabilised from inside because there is no stable form of government."
"That is why the Community method is not just a subject of debate in the European Parliament, but also provides the basis for stabilisation of the currency and the expression of the huge economic might of the euro area."
"This economic might cannot develop, however, because it is being administered by people to whom the latest opinion poll for the next regional election is more important than the future of the European currency."
"That is the reality with which we are confronted."
"I hope that everything will go well at the weekend."
"I hope that what you have announced will be implemented."
"I hope that we will come back from a successful summit."
"However, I have my doubts and I fear that we will continue to experience what has been going on for the past year."
"I am sorry, but I have to say that the leadership of the European Union is blundering its way along."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, I would first like to offer my good wishes to President Barroso."
"He is an Aries like me and like Marielle de Sarnez and Joseph Daul."
"I have a band of Aries around me here; however, we all have something to say about the pact for Europe, President Barroso."
"Quite seriously, whilst it is good that everyone now agrees that we need an economic union and real economic governance, we have to ask the crucial question: will the pact for Europe really create economic union?"
"Will this pact really create economic governance?"
"I really do not think it will, for the simple reason that the Commission is not leading the process: it is still the Member States."
"These are not my words."
"I have here the text of 11 March, which will be approved tomorrow and the day after."
"What does it say?"
"It says that the objectives will be decided on by the Heads of State or Government, the undertakings will be made by the Heads of State or Government and the monitoring will be carried out by the Heads of State or Government."
"In fact the Commission will only be involved in technical monitoring, nothing else."
"The Council holds all the power."
"This is what defeated the Lisbon Strategy and it will defeat this strategy also."
"President Barroso, let me ask you once more: this weekend, what is going to be approved will be approved, but please get together with Mr Rehn as quickly as possible to prepare a real economic governance plan based on a Community act that gives all the power to the Commission and is based on a code for convergence, and put it on the Council's table."
"I know they will say no."
"They always say no."
"But carry on the fight with us and do not accept this procedure or the proposal that is on the table for the time being, as it will not do the job and will not stabilise the euro in the coming months or years."
"This is the first thing I wanted to say."
"The second thing I wanted to say, Madam President, concerns the Arab revolts and the follow-up of the discussion that we had here a week ago."
"Right now, we can make an initial assessment of the EU's action, and I have to say that this initial assessment is somewhat lukewarm."
"In the first place, you will recall that in the beginning we were not very keen on talking about these Arab revolts, out of fear of Islam fundamentalism."
"This was our first reaction in the EU bodies."
"Now, in the Libyan affair we have demonstrated the European Union's lack of unity."
"I find it appalling that all the EU Member States did not adopt the same position in the UN Security Council: three voted in favour and one abstained."
"This goes against the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Article 34 of the Treaty states that on bodies discussing foreign policy, European Union Member States have the duty to coordinate among themselves and reach a joint standpoint."
"Did they do this?"
"I do not think so and I believe they even violated Article 34 of the Treaty."
"Thirdly, look at what we are witnessing now."
"Yesterday, Baroness Ashton appeared before the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and I think she ought to be here today also, when we are discussing such an important issue."
"Personally, I see a lack of strategy on the EU's part in relation to the Arab revolutions."
"Some outrageous decisions have been made within the EU institutions."
"For example, on Monday before the Committee on Foreign Affairs, one of Baroness Ashton's colleagues Mr Cooper even said at one point that we ought to understand the situation in Bahrain and that the authorities were right to restore peace and order, when four people have been killed and two hundred injured."
"Is that the EU's position?"
"To give you another example, the Union's foreign ministers met in the Council on Monday and what did they say?"
"They also called on demonstrators - in Bahrain that is - to refrain from any acts of deliberate intimidation."
"Therefore instead of supporting these revolutions within the European Union and supporting those who have taken to the streets and have fought and been killed, they have done exactly the opposite."
"They are telling them to stay calm and be careful."
"I ask Baroness Ashton to come to the next part-session and explain what attitudes and strategies we intend to pursue in Bahrain, in Syria and in Yemen and what sanctions we intend to introduce and with whom."
"This is the stand we should be taking, rather than the pathetic stand that many European leaders have taken so far in this business."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Madam President, I regret to say that it seems that this European Council could bring on some dangerous changes, and we should be concerned about this."
"Under the banner of so-called economic coordination, economic governance, stability for the euro area, we see a favouring of EU-wide tax harmonisation and EU-wide fiscal unification."
"Parliament, unfortunately, has been playing a very active role in that."
"Let me speak clearly."
"The Commission's proposal of a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base is a risky step that will undermine healthy tax competition amongst Member States, prove harmful to the economy and drive business away from those who impose the policy."
"This has all gone too far and must be stopped."
"What we have also seen in the last few days is an attempt by some Member States to interfere in the fiscal and tax sovereignty of others."
"You know what I am referring to: the very disgraceful bullying of Ireland."
"We must not let this happen again."
"Turning to Libya, developments in Libya have reminded us once again that we should not expect too much from the so-called EU Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"National leaders, not EU leaders, have shown international leadership."
"Prime Minister Cameron and President Sarkozy have made and pushed through decisions - not the EU representatives."
"I think that it shows clearly that there are limits to integration in this field - but not only in this field."
"No Member State should feel obliged to do more than it feels is right."
"This is as valid for foreign policy as it is for economic policy."
"Europe must stay flexible wherever possible and not be driven by rigid integrationist dogma any more, and it is time for a change in the EU integration paradigm."
"That is clear."
"That is understandable, and I hope that the European Council will deal with that."
"Madam President, Mr Barroso has left already but as he said, confidence is the basis of everything."
"I can tell you that our citizens' confidence is evaporating as fast as the water in the tanks at the Fukushima power plant."
"Yes, our citizens know that certain things need to change and that we cannot continue as before."
"Yes, we need to halt the race towards insecurity and greater inequality."
"Yes, we need to break our addiction to fossil-based energy and hazardous energy."
"Yes, we need to return to a situation where finance is there to serve the economy and the economy is there to serve citizens; and no, we can no longer build our economies on debt, be it public or private, on deficit and on speculation."
"Our fellow citizens know all this."
"They also know that this will require profound and radical change on the part of governments, businesses and themselves."
"They know this and they sense it."
"They know that these radical changes are also complex."
"As Marianne Thyssen said to me yesterday, they are complex and we cannot do everything at once."
"We need to start somewhere."
"However, the trouble is that from our fellow citizens' point of view we always start in the same place: we always start by cutting public expenditure, which as we all know most benefits the more vulnerable."
"We always start by making the labour markets more flexible."
"Indeed, when people talk about rebalancing flexibility and security, we know full well that this means more flexibility and less security."
"Our citizens are fed up with the double standards behind this policy."
"At the end of the day, it leaves those who have profited most from the casino economy of the last 20 years in peace."
"What we want from the Council, therefore - in addition to everything that is on the table today of course - is a bold initiative designed to provide Member States and the European Union with stable, fair tax revenue."
"This means the financial transaction tax of course, plus energy taxes and business tax - and please do not try to sell us the common tax base as the be-all and end-all or the ultimate fiscal policy - and lastly, it means combating fraud and tax havens."
"Without such an initiative, I promise you that everything to do with economic governance that is on the table will collapse and take the euro with it."
"There is no historical example, ladies and gentlemen, of a monetary union that has succeeded without robust fiscal union to support it."
"No more impact assessments, no more prevarication, no more national egoism: for goodness' sake act!"
"Lastly, as regards the finance industry, new stress tests will not create greater security, any more than they will in the nuclear industry, if I may be so bold."
"We have seen how useless the previous stress tests were."
"Everything was fine supposedly, even in Ireland."
"What we need are new binding rules, but not rules that we are told will be implemented on 1 January 2019."
"It is high time that the demon of the finance industry with its predatory activities was put back in its bottle, and our citizens will not put up with us waiting any longer."
"This is the price to be paid for our fellow citizens' confidence, and it is vital that as Europeans we have that confidence so that we can return to the 21st century with optimism and with our heads held high."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, economic and monetary union without effective coordination of economic policy will not work."
"The Stability and Growth Pact has failed - on this many experts across party-political boundaries are agreed."
"The problem is that politics does not seem to have made much progress."
"In fact, no new political concepts are in sight."
"Let me remind you that the stability pact's 3% limit has been breached 73 times since 1999, 46 times in a way that is barely tolerable under the Treaty - yet in not one single case has a penalty been imposed."
"This non-functioning pact does not need to be revised; it simply needs to be implemented more - or rather, it needs to be implemented in the first place."
"Naturally, every householder and every entrepreneur knows how important it is to have sustainable budgets."
"However, I fear that in the forthcoming decisions on economic governance and on the European Stability Mechanism it will be all about cuts."
"That is not the same as a sustainable budget."
"No state that is in so much debt as to be on the brink of insolvency can get out of the debt trap if it has to continue to finance this debt by borrowing at high interest rates."
"However much it saves, its debt will continue to rise - all the more so if wages, unemployment benefit and pensions have to be reduced, working hours extended, and public investment in infrastructure, education, health and so on cut back."
"If there is no consumption, then production will also collapse."
"Neither tightening up the Stability and Growth Pact nor the so-called strict conditionality of the future stability mechanism will therefore lead us to our goal."
"What should be emphasised more clearly in the overall package of measures is the additional need for investment in crisis-hit countries in particular, and this must go beyond small extensions of credit and slight reductions in interest rates."
"The mention of the necessity of reducing macro-economic imbalances will be problematic for so long as it is only demanded of economically weak states, while those that are economically strong are allowed to continue as before."
"Not only does the key word 'solidarity' not appear anywhere, but it has also been forgotten that expenditure and trade deficits on one side are income and trade surpluses on the other."
"Madam President, what Commissioner Barroso has said basically amounts to a proposal to strengthen economic governance and the stability of the euro."
"This means speeding up the policy of economic governance in Europe."
"Of course, the work being done by Mr Barroso, assisted by Commissioner Rehn, is going very well and we see it in a positive light."
"We hope that this pact will be able to respond to the economic and fiscal challenges facing Europe and send the right message to the markets."
"Unfortunately, the markets are our current problem."
"This new economic governance comes after a crisis, a rude crisis in the form of the Member States' public debt."
"In my opinion, with the United States printing money to an estimated tune of over three trillion dollars, I see no reason why Europe should not resolve its problems by printing money in the order of a trillion euro, not in order to pump it into the market, but in order to set up a fund, what we call the 'support mechanism'."
"Be that as it may, it would appear that the time has not yet come for such an idea, not while Mrs Merkel's ideas hold sway over Europe."
"However, we must again highlight the fact that the European Union is being forced to create new systems and values under unfavourable circumstances."
"Introducing monetary union, without an overall strategy of economic governance and coordination between the Member States, was a risk which was tested in practice and operated along general lines."
"I believe that the time has come for the Union to take bolder decisions and to make the structural changes needed."
"As I said, of course we basically endorse the Council's decisions on the pact for the euro and we consider that the euro is still a good currency."
"However, we must ensure not only that we achieve the objective of stability in the euro area, but also that we achieve a high level of growth and competitiveness in Europe and that we increase and maintain jobs for European citizens, especially young people."
"We must focus on young people."
"(DE) Madam President, as an ardent pro-European - as are the great majority of my 500 000 direct voters - I find it very difficult to accept this predicament that you have placed yourself in."
"On the one hand, we need stability and have to do something to counter speculation; on the other, the way in which you are doing this once again provides a fairly dramatic illustration of the democracy deficit in the European Union."
"This procedure is more reminiscent of emergency legislation than of what we would like to see in a progressive Europe."
"Naturally, I therefore emphatically supported Amendment 34, which was put forward by the left and which calls for the ordinary Treaty revision procedure to be applied."
"Whenever there is an emergency you always manage to do something that in reality increases the gap between citizens further still."
"I would also like to take this opportunity to reject in no uncertain terms the way that Mr Schulz conducts himself in this House with respect to me."
"(ES) Madam President, the crisis in North Africa is putting the mechanisms established in the Treaty of Lisbon to the test."
"Yesterday, in the High Representative's appearance before the Committee on Foreign Affairs, we stressed the positive aspects of European Union action: Baroness Ashton's communication that distinguishes between the short, medium and long terms; rapid application of Resolution 1970 of the United Nations Security Council; the ability to negotiate with the Arab League; and the European Council meeting."
"However, it is only fair to say here today that there are still certain questions being asked by European public opinion and, therefore, by our citizens."
"Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Verhofstadt is absolutely right."
"How is it possible that, in this day and age, the four Member States that form part of the United Nations Security Council do not vote in the same way but rather do so differently?"
"How is it possible, in this day and age, that we should be discussing whether the United Nations resolution is applied by the European Union, by NATO or by the international coalition, when we are talking about the same resources coming from the same taxpayers; about the same ships and their use in the same theatre of operations?"
"It is clear that we still have much to improve as regards our capacity for coordination, and much to improve too in the decision-making process."
"There is a famous line from a film, which says that 'we will always have Paris'."
"Someone said during this debate that the European Union's response has been hasty."
"If it had not been for France's courage, determination and consistency - and that is how it must be put - in recognising the rebels, in sending the Minister of Foreign and European Affairs to the Security Council, in calling the Elysée summit and in applying the resolution, Lady Ashton, Colonel Gaddafi's troops would already have entered Benghazi."
"(BG) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to focus slightly more on one of the hot topics which will be debated tomorrow, namely, the situation in Libya."
"My fellow Members are right in saying that a sense has developed in recent days of total chaos or at least of a lack of predictability in the decisions and behaviour of the European Union, especially of its Member States."
"In particular, with some countries joining the coalition then stopping their involvement, it is impossible to reach consensus within NATO."
"Not only does this situation create great uncertainty among our partners as to whether we are clear about what we basically want to achieve and how to achieve it, it also creates major problems for European public opinion, which cannot have any confidence that the European Union and its actual leaders are up to meeting the responsibilities they have towards our partners in the southern Mediterranean."
"I would very much like the European Council, over the coming days, to come up with clear, sound decisions on Libya, and not only on Libya but also on the other countries where we basically have similar situations, such as Bahrain, Yemen and, to some extent, Syria."
"We are somehow forgetting that what we do in Libya will also be assessed in the light of our conduct towards the other countries in the region."
"I would like the European Council to make clear decisions about what the European Union wants to achieve in Libya, which will also elucidate, to a large extent, how we will achieve it."
"I believe that we need to understand clearly that the situation in Libya will have many serious consequences for the neighbouring countries too, if the current situation continues for a long time."
"We therefore need to be ready to provide help to both Egypt and Tunisia, not only in coping with the humanitarian situation, but also to be prepared to provide economic and financial support literally in the coming days, weeks and months because the situation there will have an impact on the economic situation in both these countries."
"(DE) Madam President, it has been said here that it is not the euro that is in crisis, but the Member States that have got into debt."
"That is the nub of the crisis - irresponsible indebtedness that has been carried on for many years."
"That is what we must now stop."
"That is why it is right that the European Stability Mechanism must be strict."
"That is also why it is right that this has been the case in the bail-outs that have taken place."
"That is also why it is right that Ireland is not given an interest rate reduction."
"This indebtedness must end."
"Once again I am hearing the social democrats talk of a distinction between good and bad debt."
"Of course investment is different to consumption, but at some point too much good debt becomes bad debt too."
"We need to be fair to future generations, we need sustainable public finances - and then the euro will become stable again."
"The pact for the euro involves too little Community method."
"That has been said here, and quite rightly so. I share this view."
"I would like to say a final word about Libya."
"The Council has supported resolution 1973."
"We must now look to the future."
"I agree with Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra when he says that France has played a very good role."
"However, had Turkey been invited to the Elysée summit then we would not be having these problems in NATO and the situation would be considerably easier for us all."
"Moreover, I hope that the newly appointed head of the transitional government in Libya will soon be visiting us here in Europe."
"(PL) Madam President, all the objectives which the Euro Group has set itself, and which are sometimes completely reasonable, can be achieved successfully with the help of the economic, social and taxation policies of the Member States."
"The question arises, therefore, as to why we are amending the Treaty today at express speed to transfer these competencies - at least in part - to Union level."
"I think there are two answers: as usual we want to share responsibility for unpopular decisions with the European Union, or we want to use the opportunity, perhaps under the pretext of reforms, simply to transfer more power to Brussels."
"I doubt this will bring the expected effects, taking into consideration the fact that most Euro Group Member States have more public debt and a less competitive taxation system than the other Member States."
"Hanging over this discussion, of course, is the threat of a two-speed Europe."
"I would like to warn those who want to hurry."
"In addition to the same speed, what is also needed is the right direction."
"Moving at very high speed but in the wrong direction threatens to end in only one way - a huge increase in the scale of the catastrophe."
"At least, that is what I see happens on Europe's roads."
"(PT) Madam President, the Portuguese Parliament will today vote against the fourth stability programme tabled by the government in 12 months."
"The majority of Members of the Portuguese Parliament will vote against this document because of the package's content, but also because it was presented in Brussels before it was known about, negotiated or approved in Portugal."
"That is the reason for my first question to the Hungarian Presidency: in the light of this experience, does it intend to defend, along with its partners, the obligatory nature of prior parliamentary approval for these documents, or not?"
"My second question is as follows."
"Tomorrow the Council is deciding on a post-2013 financing mechanism, but it does not tell us anything about the current financing mechanism, which is what interests us."
"With Portugal entering a period of early elections, inevitably there will be an explosion in public debt and interest rates."
"What does the Council intend to do to prevent speculation on Portuguese public debt?"
"Do not, moreover, say that it is a matter for the Portuguese, because if austerity is ours, it is ours because the decisions are yours too."
"(NL) Madam President, the High Representative indicated yesterday afternoon, in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, that he wanted to offer concrete support to what we have begun to refer to as 'the new Egypt' in addressing the large-scale housing shortage."
"Anyone who is remotely aware of the enormous socio-economic misery in which the vast majority of the Egyptian people find themselves can no longer remain euphoric."
"This is about showing genuine European empathy."
"For that reason, I warmly welcome all European efforts to improve living conditions in Egypt."
"Certainly now that the country is going through an uncertain transition after the departure of President Mubarak and now that Cairo seems to be heading straight towards a financial and food crisis."
"In my opinion, European aid to Egypt should be accompanied by redoubled efforts on the part of the Council."
"In the new Egypt, all citizens, irrespective of their religion, must be equal before the law, with equal rights for all."
"Moreover, Cairo needs to observe the peace treaty with Israel and even develop it further."
"If we set those two conditions, both the internal and external stability of the new Egypt would be strengthened."
"(NL) Madam President, I thought that you had overlooked me."
"Thank you for giving me the floor."
"We are creating a stability mechanism, a permanent aid fund, which will have to be paid for by the ordinary people, by the people who will not be getting any free gifts."
"The beneficiaries, however, are the people who will be getting a free gift."
"From now on, we will be rewarding cheats, those who break their promises and those who fiddle the figures."
"Ten years ago, a Stability and Growth Pact was signed with a solemn pledge that it would keep public finances in order."
"That pact has been breached by Germany, France, Greece and others."
"Major deficits have not been tackled."
"Now, though, solemn promises are again being made that the new pact will actually work."
"It will now be Brussels which decides what the Dutch are allowed to earn, when the Dutch are allowed to retire and how much they will get from their pensions."
"Again, the bill is being footed by the taxpayer, by the people who are not getting any free gifts."
"Madam President, that permanent fund is an expensive toy which allows the political elite to conceal the fact that some countries cannot be trusted in a Monetary Union."
"There are countries that want to enjoy the joys of the euro, but do not want to share the burden, countries which are failing to keep their finances in order."
"Those countries, Madam President, should leave the eurozone."
"That is the only adjustment we need to make to the Stability and Growth Pact."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the upheavals that are multiplying in the south of the Mediterranean should not divert our attention from the medium-term economic and other goals that have long been set."
"The international turbulence should instead step up the pace for the growth of our economy: I welcome the fact that the decisions to implement the EU 2020 Strategy should be taken quickly; as early as this week's meeting."
"We do not know what will happen after the conflict in Libya, but we can be sure that nothing will ever be the same."
"Europe therefore really needs a package of measures to permit the economies of Member States to catch their breath as they enter a new period of uncertainty."
"The biggest question certainly relates, however, to the situation in the Mediterranean."
"The Mediterranean at war is the worst catastrophe that the world could imagine at present."
"Those countries that considered it vital to do something in these circumstances acted wisely, but we are nevertheless left with the great contradiction of a European Union that seems to feel awkward, if not actually divided, over what to do."
"I therefore appeal to the Hungarian Presidency: Parliament and I also believe the Commission is close to this Presidency, which has the opportunity to turn the crisis into something that does not end up simply undermining the European Union."
"We have this enormous responsibility: to transform the present crisis into an opportunity to produce, to allow a foreign policy worthy of the world to live and breathe."
"With our responsibilities, our doubts and our mistakes, we are on the brink of momentous events and I think we should shoulder this responsibility to the full, making sure that that the decisions taken by the Council tomorrow and the day after tomorrow are reasonable, but above all bold. Thank you."
"(PT) Madam President, it has already been said that, regrettably, at this moment in the Portuguese Parliament, the government could be collapsing."
"If the government falls, it will happen as a result of the political instability caused by the opposition parties, which have not supported another austerity package."
"It is true: this is the fourth package in a few months."
"This is not because the previous ones were not observed: they were."
"Rather, it is because the conditions imposed have become worse at the mercy of the so-called desires of the markets."
"Portugal's budgetary implementation in the months of January and February recorded a surplus, with a 3% spending cut and income up 11%."
"The political forces that created this political crisis by rejecting this austerity programme, tabled by the government and supported by the European Commission, the Council and the European Central Bank, can be very satisfied with this."
"However, it is only imprudence that allows them to be satisfied with this situation, as it is terrible for a euro area country with debt problems."
"It is terrible for the country, it is unfair for the Portuguese people, and it is another blow to the sustainability of the great project that is the single currency."
"We are not in a crisis in the euro area: we are in the midst of the euro area's Great Crisis."
"I would like to ask my fellow Portuguese Members, what is the alternative?"
"All the Member States have to submit their austerity plans up to April."
"Does Portugal, or does it not, need further austerity measures to reduce its deficit and public debt; to reduce the deficit, in 2012 and 2013, by 3% and 2%, respectively?"
"You refused to negotiate, but you presented no alternatives."
"Rejection is not the solution, it is the problem, forcing further sacrifices on the Portuguese people."
"(FR) Mr President, the next Council is probably the last chance for Europe's leaders to remember that we founded Europe in order to uphold values and to act together when fundamental issues are at stake."
"When a population finds itself at the mercy of a murderous leader, this is a fundamental issue."
"A resolution has been adopted thanks to the efforts by France and the United Kingdom."
"We have managed to stop Colonel Gaddafi from reaching Benghazi."
"However, Europe's lack of unity is worrying."
"Tomorrow's Council must send a strong signal; it must support the intervention that is under way, recognise the Libyan rebels in order to give them support and isolate Colonel Gaddafi even more so that this regime will fall."
"Fundamental issues are also at stake when we look at what is happening in Bahrain, Yemen and Syria."
"When we see the cycle of violence flaring up again in the Middle East, this too is fundamental."
"We the European Parliament expect Europe's leaders to act before it is too late."
"History is on the move in much of the world."
"Political courage means taking up this challenge: this is precisely what we expect of Europe and of those in charge of it."
"(NL) Mr President, the Dutch guarantee of many billions of euros prompted the former Minister of Finance, Mr Ruding, to say 'The road to budgetary hell is paved with guarantees'."
"Indeed, the guarantees that have been granted have been too large and too risky."
"They will not help avert the crisis, because they are shooting wide of the mark."
"The current European crisis was caused by those who irresponsibly allowed debt to mount up and those who failed to comply with the agreements made."
"If we do not tackle these core issues, we can give as many guarantees as we like, but they will still not be of any help."
"We have a Stability and Growth Pact."
"As early as 2004, it was laughed out of the room by Germany and France."
"We had an opportunity to strengthen the pact, with automatic penalties, in particular, but what happens?"
"The penalties remain subject to political decision-making."
"That is unbelievable."
"The German writer Hans Enzensberger correctly foresaw what would happen."
"He predicted that the current situation will cause the citizens to regard the European political elite with cynicism and contempt."
"(PT) Mr President, the path that the European Union's leaders are treading is unacceptable, with increased exploitation of workers, and with new antisocial measures that exacerbate inequalities, increase unemployment and job insecurity, and increase poverty and social exclusion; all of which is in the service of the European Union's economic and financial interest groups, whose profits never stop rising."
"Under the pretext of the crisis, they want to force another noose around the necks of the more economically fragile countries, using the established conditions for the application of a European Stability Mechanism to, in fact, transform sovereign states into mere protectorates."
"Therefore the workers and the peoples are opposing such measures, as happened on Saturday in Portugal at a demonstration involving more than 300 000 people, and is happening today in the Portuguese Parliament, where the majority of its Members will surely do the same to the fourth austerity package."
"However, Mr President, we also want to say 'no' here to the bombing being carried out by the international force in Libya, just as we said 'no' to the repression of the struggling peoples in every country in the region, including Libya, Bahrain and Yemen."
"- (SK) Mr President, the responsible management of financial resources is a basic precondition for the good and stable functioning of households, manufacturing or trading firms, regions, nation states and also federations of states."
"It is therefore natural that, if a group of European Union states decided to create a single common currency, it must find a mechanism for preventing populist politicians from burdening the common currency with unsustainable liabilities - debts that are used to purchase the support of voters in the short term."
"The Competitiveness Pact defines certain parameters which eurozone countries in particular should adhere to."
"The problem, however, is with the implementation of these well-intentioned rules."
"I therefore firmly believe that the time has now come to apply automatic penalty mechanisms over failures to follow the agreed common rules of management, so that these penalties do not become the subject of political horse-trading in the European Council, where government leaders make up for their many and varied political errors by remitting each others' penalties."
"Mr President, I want to consider two issues."
"First, to welcome the birth of the Euro Plus Pact, which is a welcome event."
"A new architecture is being born, almost a kind of economic Schengen."
"What is important is that it should be inclusive and open for those who are able and willing to participate and that it should not create a two-speed Europe."
"Unfortunately the pact will be half open because the amendment to Article 136, as debated and voted in our Committee on Constitutional Affairs has fallen."
"It reads: 'Calls for the stability mechanism to be open from the outset to Member States whose currency is not the euro, but who wish to participate'."
"It will be half open because it will be open to take obligations upon its shoulders."
"It will not be open for those outside the euro who want to participate in the rights."
"What unites us is the single market, much more so than the euro."
"It is not a euro crisis; it is a crisis in some euro Member States."
"Any non-euro Member State could have the same public finance problem."
"So there is a lack of logic and a lack of consistency."
"A few words on Libya and the southern Mediterranean."
"Firstly, I want to congratulate us - in fact not the Union but some Member States who are at the forefront of the defence of human rights and democracy in Libya."
"We should be grateful to France and its leader, Nicolas Sarkozy, in leading the way."
"I think it is the beginning of moving in our foreign policy from interest-based foreign policy to value-based foreign policy."
"We need to follow two steps."
"We need to redesign the neighbourhood policy and direct it towards our societies and governments and achieve something which we call in Central and Eastern Europe transition or transformation."
"It is also an alarm call to redesign and reform and strengthen the common security and defence policy so as to equip the Union with common command capacities and military capacities."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow, 24 March, will be a symbolic day."
"In the first instance, it will be marked by the amendment to the Treaty of Lisbon that we have just voted for, which will allow a permanent European Stability Mechanism to be established."
"This mechanism allows the European Union to devise the first Eurobonds, which are designed to finance sovereign debt at low interest rates in the event of speculative attacks."
"In this respect, it is a shame that the process stopped halfway."
"To deal with the markets' irrational exuberance, the revision of the Treaty ought to have been an opportunity to authorise the European Central Bank to do what the United States does and buy back public debt in the event of exchange rate tensions."
"The process is even more incomplete since the pay-off required is to implement the Competitiveness Pact, re-christened the Pact for the euro."
"This is the second symbol of tomorrow."
"This pact is backed unanimously by the Council, the Commission and the European Central Bank."
"Ladies and gentlemen, you all know the Washington Consensus: you loved it."
"Well, 24 March sees the birth of the 'Brussels consensus'."
"The 'Brussels consensus' is the blind, roughshod application of neoliberal dogma: squeezing public services and the welfare state; wage austerity and minimal regulation of the financial markets."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Council, the Commission and the ECB have short memories."
"They are proposing to transpose the Pact for the euro into the governance package so as to enshrine in our system the very policies that led to the economic crisis."
"In Spain, the UK, Ireland and elsewhere, the rise of household debt, which is fed by the finance industry, has been caused by none other than the crisis in buying power resulting from the pay restraint that has held sway for 20 years."
"The Pact for the euro unfortunately proposes to make wage austerity a permanent fixture."
"As for public debt, as well as being a consequence of the economic crisis, it is also a result of pointless tax reductions everywhere, advocated by liberals and conservatives."
"There was no explosion of public expenditure in Europe: quite the contrary."
"Budget and wage austerity, combined with the interest rate rises already planned by the European Central Bank, will end up killing off internal demand in Europe and killing off the recovery without reducing deficits."
"Tomorrow, we will be side by side with employees demonstrating against this 'Brussels consensus': this is the third symbol of 24 March."
"If we do not want to see a return of the likes of the brown shirts, whom Europe was created to stand against, the people's elected representatives must stand with the people to denounce policies that are as unjust as they are ineffective."
"(FI) Mr President, creating a permanent crisis management mechanism for Europe is justified in case there are crises in the future."
"None of us wants further crises, but they could happen."
"It is nevertheless unfortunate that the plan is to establish the permanent crisis management mechanism outside the EU institutions."
"The mechanism should be brought as close as possible to EU institutions, so that they might monitor how it is used."
"Furthermore, any penalties should apply automatically, and not as the result of discussions and negotiations."
"I would like to say a few words about our socalled foreign policy and Libya."
"The situation in Libya and within the international community is confused."
"It was right to take the decision regarding the nofly zone in order to protect civilians."
"The EU has also been involved in this."
"Now that ground forces have been attacked, I think that there is good reason to question whether this nofly zone was created for that."
"In this respect, things are close to exceeding the threshold of war."
"Mr President, Mr Schulz said that military operations were set up too hastily."
"On the contrary, they came too late."
"The West waited too long."
"It could have isolated Gaddafi in Tripoli and forced him either to go or to be wiped out."
"As it was, we were just in time to prevent a mass murder in Benghazi."
"And what did we see?"
"France and Britain - two nation states - took the lead."
"My congratulations!"
"Germany, apparently, is a country of hard currency and soft power."
"Being Minister of Defence in Germany is the most risky job in the country."
"Meanwhile, Turkey opposes NATO, and the US is the power in retreat and acts like a spectator."
"I am afraid that now - as in the Balkans - we cannot break the deadlock without committed American leadership: leadership that the European Union, unfortunately, is incapable of providing."
"The only politician who knew how to deal with Gaddafi was Ronald Reagan."
"Reagan was right all along."
"(EL) Mr President, exactly a year ago, the leaders of the European Union and the Greek Prime Minister decided that Greece should play the part of economic and social guinea pig."
"Extreme, antisocial measures were then taken, on the pretext of reducing the public deficit and debt and improving competitiveness."
"At the end of this experiment, public debt is just under 150%, unemployment stands at 15%, with unemployment among young people at 30%, inflation is close to 4.4% and the economy has shrunk by 6.6%."
"Commissioner Rehn, the Greek experiment has been a failure and you have exterminated the guinea pig economically, socially and politically."
"The leaders of the European Union have the same fate in store for other Member States that take recourse to the pact for the euro, which is the European version of the Greek memorandum."
"We are against this pact, because we do not want to exterminate workers, pensioners and the unemployed."
"Commissioner Rehn, when the Greek memorandum was signed, you wished the Greeks 'bon courage'."
"If you are consistent in your wishes, you will also need to wish European workers 'bon courage' on Friday or Saturday."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the American political scientist Samuel Huntington once predicted a clash of civilizations."
"Had we relied on this, we would ourselves have played a part in bringing about this clash of civilizations as part of a self-fulfilling prophecy."
"We, the European Parliament, have always worked for cooperation with the Arab states and the people there."
"Now we are seeing how the peoples of the Arab world are striving for values that we also represent: democracy, freedom and the rule of law."
"Who would have expected just a few weeks ago that the Arab League would be asking us, the western and the international community, to stop the tyrant in Libya?"
"There is a sea change under way in the Arab world."
"We must not make any mistakes here."
"We must not just pay lip service to the peoples of the Arab countries, but rather must support them in what we do."
"This evening I am travelling to Tunisia on behalf of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, of which I am president, just as I was in Cairo two and a half weeks ago."
"I would like to reiterate the words of Konrad Adenauer, the first Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, who said: 'We are on the side of freedom'."
"We now need to say to the Arab peoples: 'If it is what you yourselves want, then we want to help you by providing solidarity and advice on democracy so that you can prepare for elections'."
"We hear with some dismay that a terrorist attack was carried out today in Jerusalem and that many people were injured."
"We condemn this in the strongest possible terms, whoever is responsible."
"However, we also say that there must now be peace between Israel and Palestine."
"If the wind of freedom is blowing through the Arab states then the opportunity must be seized to bring about peace between Israel and Palestine too, so that Israel can live within safe borders but also so that the Palestinian people, who deserve the same dignity as the Israelis, can also live within safe borders."
"This is our task as this great change takes place in the Arab world: to make our contribution as the European Union and to so in a united and resolute manner."
"(Applause)"
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, beyond the measures that have been announced, I wonder if European policy is doing enough."
"It naturally takes time for the European Union to establish leadership, especially in foreign policy, but as we know, certain situations arise and unfortunately do not allow us all the time we would like and actually call for fast action and far-sightedness."
"Now it is clear that we are still falling short of requirements as far as affairs in the Mediterranean region and particularly Libya are concerned: we need to reflect a little more to recognise that perhaps we will need stronger action to understand what has been happing and also to deploy concerted action towards the Mediterranean."
"It is in fact clear to everyone that if we look at Libya, there is a substantial difference between the whole of Europe taking joint action and action only being taken by willing countries, as is the case at present."
"No, my message to the representatives of the Council and Commission is that we are not there yet."
"The Council has not answered certain questions, and now must do so quickly."
"I wonder if beyond the humanitarian effort, we really know what to do if the application of Resolution 1973 is not enough and if some countries go beyond their mandate."
"Secondly, I would like to know the Council's view on the issue of operational command: NATO told us that it is performing a technical role, but not providing political guidance."
"Do we think we can get along like that, without seeking a stronger and more united European Union voice instead of fobbing the job off onto the few who are willing?"
"Finally, within the framework of ongoing operations and the relationship with the Arab League and the African Union, it is essential to prevent our intervention from ultimately being seen negatively, with the risk of creating uncertainty and dangerous shifts."
"Are we aware?"
"Perhaps not altogether: these are questions that do not deserve bureaucratic answers but need appropriate policy responses, starting with tomorrow's Council meeting."
"(SV) Mr President, critics of the euro in my country say that the situation with Greece and Ireland demonstrates that the euro does not work."
"They say that it is better to be outside the euro area."
"They are wrong."
"During its ten-year history, the euro area has created stability, low inflation and, in actual fact, millions of new jobs."
"The permanent crisis mechanism will act as an absolutely last resort if a country gets into major economic difficulties."
"The euro is not the reason for the crisis, as the Commissioner usually quite rightly points out."
"On the contrary, the common currency is an important part of the solution, and that is the point as far as a country like Sweden is concerned, too."
"I therefore deeply regret the fact that in the Swedish Parliament the majority is not in favour of Sweden joining the Euro Pact."
"This reduces my country's influence."
"If Sweden wants to belong to the EU's inner circle, as the Swedish Government says it does, it is no good sitting outside the meeting rooms."
"Denmark and the Danish Government and Parliament are in favour of the euro."
"It should be possible for Sweden to be so, too."
"(EL) Mr President, the Greek Communist Party condemns the new illegal imperialist war unleashed in Libya by the United States of America, France, Britain and NATO."
"The interest in providing humanitarian aid is disgraceful hypocrisy."
"The imperialists' real objective is the oil, the natural gas and the wealth-producing resources of Libya, North Africa and the region in general."
"The imperialist aggression on the part of the USA, NATO and the European Union is exacerbating the risks to which the people in the region in general are exposed."
"The new pact and euro-unifying economic governance will bring mass unemployment and poverty in their wake."
"The European support mechanism is a mechanism for controlled bankruptcy and safe insolvency for nations, in order to protect the profits of the plutocracy."
"This is the free world of the USA."
"This is the European Union of democracy and freedom."
"The real dilemma is this: will it be the people or the plutocracy that defaults?"
"The people should not pay for the consequences of imperialist barbarity and the capitalist crisis."
"They should not be condemned to permanent unemployment and poverty and we therefore call on them to rise up against and oppose this imperialist intervention and to fight for their modern rights and for an alternative path to growth that serves grassroots needs, not the profits of the monopolies."
"(PT) Mr President, first of all, I would like to draw attention to the value that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), and especially the Portuguese of the PPE Group, ascribe to the upcoming Council, to the solution that was found - which is frankly better than was expected at the time - and, in particular, to the work of my colleagues, Mr Brok and Mr Gualtieri, who prepared the report on behalf of Parliament, in line with the Commission's positions, bringing the fund closer to something that clearly follows the Union method and moving it away from what would be the intergovernmental solution."
"Next, I should like to say to all my fellow Members, at a time when Portugal is experiencing a political crisis, that the Portuguese Social Democratic Party (PSD), which is part of the PPE Group, is ready to govern following elections."
"Moreover, we will govern in line with criteria, which are criteria for the euro area, meeting all the targets set and, beyond that, doing what the Portuguese Socialist Party (PS) was unable to do in 13 years;"
"I repeat, 13 years."
"The PS government was a spectacular failure."
"Everything happening in Portugal was foreseen by the PSD during the 2009 elections."
"I took part in that campaign and we warned that this would happen."
"Therefore, we are now here to say that we give every guarantee to the European Union and, in particular, to our partners in the euro area, that we will fulfill every criteria, which will be demanding and will force the Portuguese people to make sacrifices."
"However, there will be, for once, someone credible in government, in contrast with the current Portuguese Government, which had to table four stability and growth programmes, and which is constantly seeking new solutions without being able to give the markets a credible response; to give a response that serves the interests of Portugal and of Europe."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question (Rule 149(8) of the Rules of Procedure))"
"(PT) Mr President, I should just like to ask Mr Rangel whether, given that he is saying here that the next Portuguese Government will present the same austerity measures and will commit to the same targets that have been negotiated with Brussels, does he not think it infantile and imprudent to provoke a political crisis; whether he thinks that Portugal will pay too high a price and that it will require too many sacrifices from the Portuguese people?"
"It is to this that I should like an answer."
"Is it not lust for power leading them to take this attitude?"
"(PT) Mr President, I will be very happy to answer, although I did not want to turn a European Parliament debate into a debate on Portuguese politics."
"In fact, if Mrs Estrela wants to debate Portuguese politics, she has a simple solution: we must have elections, stand as a candidate for the Portuguese Parliament and she will have the opportunity, in opposition, to debate the policies intended for Portugal with the Portuguese Social Democratic Party."
"I would just say the following: we cannot take another government that has failed four times in two years."
"It is impossible, it is unsustainable and the markets do not find it credible: there are no more solutions with the Portuguese Socialist Party in government."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question (Rule 149(8) of the Rules of Procedure))"
"(FI) Mr President, I will not have the opportunity to ask this in the Portuguese Parliament, so I will ask you straight: why is Portugal's Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) not supporting this very important proposal?"
"The whole euro area and the European Union may suffer a crisis if decisions are delayed."
"Why do you not support the solutions proposed, right here and now?"
"(PT) Mr President, the Portuguese Social Democratic Party (PSD) responsibly supported all the austerity packages, unlike many parties in other countries of the Union."
"When the government has spectacularly failed - and it no longer has any excuse, it is incapable of showing a single result after two whole years - and the market situation remains as it is, the PSD has no other option but to be on the side of the solution."
"The solution is new elections, new government, new credibility for Portugal, and also for Europe and the euro area."
"(MT) Mr President, two weeks ago, this Parliament adopted a brave political resolution, appealing - amongst other things - for the creation of a no-fly zone over Libya."
"Just one week ago, when the United Nations Security Council had not yet approved this resolution, we held another sitting where we were feeling rather desperate due to the imminent fall of Benghazi and ultimately the collapse of the revolution which is in favour of democracy in Libya."
"Last Thursday, one day later, the resolution was approved and it has been four days since its implementation."
"Mr President, I think it is important that we continue to implement this resolution and carry on supporting the Libyan people, while at the same time protecting them from further massacres and helping them in their transition towards democracy."
"We also need to tackle two other issues."
"First of all, we need to keep on providing extensive humanitarian aid to the Libyan people and to refugees fleeing Libya, particularly to Tunisia and Egypt."
"Secondly, we need to prepare for a possible mass exodus of refugees toward European Union countries."
"After all, this is not just the responsibility of Mediterranean EU countries but of us all."
"Mr President, today the PPE Group meeting room was officially named after one of the founding fathers of the European Union: Alcide de Gasperi."
"In his time, the key to solving the crisis was a supranational approach, taking care of European common interests first."
"He was among those statesmen who, although born in the 19th century, were able to develop a vision of the Europe of the 21st century."
"Reversing the economic crisis today needs statesmanship which is not geared to the next elections and does not concentrate first and foremost on national salvation but which has a care for the next generations and Europe as a whole."
"As for the European Council, I welcome the new text of the stability mechanism, as well as the euro area reform package."
"Second, I hope that the Competitiveness Pact will prove credible and will also attract non-euro area members."
"It is important that every government makes significant national pledges to improve our competitive position."
"Third, as with the single market, I am a bit worried that its ambitious targets have been substantially curtailed and its operational efficiency could become almost non-relevant."
"Therefore, while deciding on new steps, let us prove our political will and credibility by completing the four freedoms on which European cooperation is based, including the internal market, and implementing in full the Services Directive."
"(NL) Mr President, first of all, I would just like to express my sympathy and condolences to the people of Japan."
"I know we will have a debate on Japan in a few moments, but I hope that, in the days to come, as well, the Council will accommodate any requests from Japan for specialist assistance."
"We often talk about developing countries, but here we have a disaster area in a highly developed country, where additional help may still be needed."
"My second point is Libya."
"I do not think that any of the warm words expressed here today, even those expressed by the Commission, can change the facts that the European Union has no presence in Libya and that, at the moment, it is not even able to put a stop to the crisis in the cities or the actions of Mr Gaddafi's ground troops."
"I would like to congratulate the French President on having ensured, at the very last minute, that the European Union was actually able to do something in consultation with NATO, but the suffering of the people is not over yet and it would be wise of us to be modest about our role."
"Europe is better at providing help after a crisis than during a crisis, as I have already said on previous occasions."
"Finally, I would like to turn to the Euro Pact."
"I think that we have, indeed, taken important steps forward."
"Mr Barroso has dubbed it a cornerstone, but I do not think that the cornerstone is yet firmly in place, and in the coming months we will have to move forward."
"This will not really be resolved tomorrow."
"Mr President, like Mr Barroso I would also like to concentrate on the economic situation, particularly as my country is the recipient of an EU and IMF bailout at this particular time."
"However, we have a new government and new hope in Ireland."
"In his very first speech, our Taoiseach said he wanted to build bridges in Europe, pay our way and pull our weight - and that is what we are determined to do."
"However, there are two things we need in particular to do that."
"Firstly, the interest rate charged is draconian and is not sustainable."
"We would like to see that reduced by at least 1% to 2%."
"Secondly, we also need a continued guarantee of funding for our banks until such time as they are functional again."
"We do not need to be pressurised regarding our corporation tax and we particularly do not need lectures from people like Mr Sarkozy, who seems very cosy with an effective rate of 8.2% in France, while our effective rate is actually 11.9%."
"Perhaps he should look at the plank in his own eye before he casts his gaze across the Irish Sea."
"What is the quid pro quo?"
"One, we will have the austerity package in place, much to the chagrin and pain of our citizens."
"Two, we will consider, if required, a debt pact, like the one they have had in Germany since 2009."
"Three, we will also consider a European independent fiscal agency."
"That also is very important because I do not believe there is such a thing as an independent national agency."
"I would ask Mr Barroso, on this his birthday, and his colleagues, to help Ireland help itself on this one occasion and we will not come calling again for help by way of a bailout."
"(PL) Mr President, it is to be welcomed that the European Union's leaders have devoted so much time in recent weeks and days to what is happening in Libya and other countries in North Africa."
"I am sure this action will enable us to prevent a civilian massacre and I am sure, too, that the Libyans will overthrow the tyrant themselves."
"However, it cannot be denied that we also have to talk about internal challenges - challenges concerning the way the European Union and its institutions operate; challenges for internal function, common foreign policy and common security and defence policy."
"The difference of opinion which has appeared between some of the European Union's Member States shows how far we are from that objective for it to be a truly common policy, one which is in keeping with the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"It is also a challenge for the entire international community."
"It is good that we are working with the United States and other members of NATO, it is good that we are in dialogue with the Arab League and the African Union, and it is good that we are in dialogue with Israel."
"I think Mr Pöttering stressed something which is very important, that what is happening today in North Africa, what is happening in Libya and Egypt, may have very serious consequences, and that these consequences may also affect the future of the peace process."
"We should remember this advice and be careful to heed it."
"We should also think about the future of these countries and the promotion of democracy and human rights, and not just work as a firefighter putting out fires, and we should also think of other countries around Europe where such processes - sinister processes - can occur."
"(DE) Mr President, in his invitation to the European Council Mr Van Rompuy states that we will begin our working dinner by taking stock of events in Libya and in our southern neighbouring countries."
"I hope that nobody chokes on this, but that instead we send out clear messages - and also united messages - concerning our aims to Colonel Gaddafi and to the people of Libya, but also to our own public, which is irritated by the lack of unity in the face of a dictator's hold on power."
"It is right to expand our blacklist to include certain people and to freeze the accounts of the national Libyan oil company."
"However, I would also like to have seen the EU rather than NATO remembering its own decisions as regards capacity and capability, and being able to implement the arms embargo using its Member States' naval forces."
"After all, they are our neighbours."
"Had we done so we would have avoided the recent stress involving Turkey at NATO and relieved the burden on our US allies."
"I now hope that the planning of the EU's humanitarian missions will concentrate not just on the reception of war refugees on the Egyptian and Tunisian sides of the Libyan border, but that we will actively provide humanitarian aid in parts of Libya that have already been liberated from Colonel Gaddafi's power."
"I believe this is necessary in order to make our intentions clear to those in Tripoli."
"To the communist Member from Greece I would like to say that I have just heard from Moscow that Stalin is dead."
"New directives are on their way from the politburo, but evidently you have not yet received them."
"(RO) Mr President, I think that we all agree on the ultimate objective of the intervention going on in Libya: to put a complete stop to the intolerable acts of violence and abuse being committed by the Gaddafi regime against civilians."
"I believe that Paragraph 8 of UN Security Council Resolution 1973 provides an irrefutable legal basis for ensuring, by every means possible, respect for the no-fly zone established with the precise aim of protecting civilians."
"I actually want to mention that, prior to the adoption of resolution 1973, the European Parliament was one of the first international institutions to call for establishing such a zone, during the last plenary session in Strasbourg."
"With the prospect of the European Council meeting which opens tomorrow, I feel that there are two important factors for ensuring that intervention in Libya is successful."
"I believe that the key words should be 'coordination' and 'clarity'."
"I am talking, first and foremost, about coordination at EU level in the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon with regard to the humanitarian aspects."
"There is also coordination with NATO: I believe that our actions must complement those of NATO."
"Lastly, coordination with the Arab League is very important, because ongoing regional support will be an essential aspect of our actions in Libya."
"Finally, we need to be clear in our resolve to end the violence against civilians."
"The successful resolution of this situation depends, to a large extent, on the clarity of our message."
"(HU) Mr President, Minister, Commissioners, the latest economic figures show that Europe is heading out of the crisis."
"The next EU summit can further strengthen this process."
"The weekend Council meeting may bring a breakthrough in European politics, elevating European solidarity to a new level."
"An important element of the package of measures proposed for adoption is the macroeconomic coordination cycle, namely the European Semester, the first phase of which is concluded by the synthesis report prepared by the Hungarian Presidency."
"This report is also important because it gives us an opportunity of sketching an economic picture of a post-crisis, competitive European Union."
"In addition to this, the Hungarian Presidency-in-Office also played a major role last week in the adoption of the overall guideline of the package of six legislative proposals and, thanks to this, a start can be made by Parliament and ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(HU) Mr President, I congratulate the Hungarian Presidency on its activity over recent weeks."
"This is a real success story."
"At the same time, however, this is a success for Europe as well."
"Everything is set for a final agreement on the European Union's new economic policy framework to be reached at the forthcoming European Council meeting in the second half of the week."
"This may enable the whole of European integration to enter a new phase."
"In the renewed framework for economic governance our responsibility, and the responsibility of the European Parliament, is very great, because it would be good to adopt these six legislative proposals at first reading."
"The whole of Europe may lose if there is a delay."
"I congratulate Mr Brok and Mr Gualtieri on today's report."
"I am grateful that the Council was flexible, and the European Parliament not only now ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(GA) Mr President, I support what is being done by the Irish Government to obtain an interest rate reduction under the EU-IMF Programme for Ireland."
"The European Commission has made clear that it will be prepared to support an interest rate reduction, and I would expect that the 27 Member States will reach a consensus regarding the reconsideration of this question."
"It is in the interest of both Ireland and the European Union to ensure that our debt is sustainable."
"It is essential that the pricing of the EU financial assistance mechanism is affordable and that it is fair."
"It is widely reported that some countries are seeking concessions from Ireland in return for an interest rate reduction."
"It would appear that pressure is on Ireland to increase its corporation tax, for example - I do not have time to go into the issue of effective tax as against corporate tax -"
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, so the European Council will adopt the decision to amend the Treaty with regard to the European Stability Mechanism, but will allegedly help countries stay inside the eurozone."
"Of course it will fail: not for want of money being thrown at the problem, but because the problem is endemic."
"This is a mechanism that will try to make water flow uphill!"
"The external value of a country's currency should reflect the demand for, and supply of, its currency which of course should then reflect the demand for its exports, visible and invisible, and the demand for its imports, visible and invisible, as well as capital movements."
"The same currency value cannot possibly reflect the economic conditions in 17 different countries."
"Far from needing a mechanism to keep failing countries inside the eurozone, we need a mechanism to rescue them from it."
"Even those countries that have seen successes in the eurozone will be better off outside with revalued currencies."
"(RO) Mr President, I think that it is vital, as part of the European Council discussions on 24 and 25 March, to finalise a credible legislative package for strengthening economic governance in the European Union."
"In this respect, the cohesion policy, along with the common agricultural policy, is a priority area in view of the negotiations on the new post-2013 European Union budget."
"It is vital to maintain a large proportion of the post-2013 EU budget for the cohesion policy to ensure that the European Union meets its ambitious targets and provides appropriate support for the implementation of the Europe 2020 Strategy."
"However, the cohesion policy must make investments effective, especially through strategic fund programming, thematic concentration of targets and simplification of implementation rules."
"(LT) Mr President, today we approved the amendment of the Treaty of Lisbon which will facilitate the establishment of the permanent euro stability mechanism."
"We showed solidarity by agreeing with the amendment of the treaty and by understanding that we are in a difficult economic and financial situation and that we must take very specific actions regarding economic coordination and surveillance."
"This mechanism and the Guarantee Fund are only intended for euro area members, while countries not in the euro area will be sidelined, risking fragmentation of the European Union and rejection of the Community method."
"The European Union must therefore show greater solidarity, by also providing assistance to non-euro area members, so that they become members of the club and recover all decision-making rights in the European Union and we would thus eliminate a temporary discrepancy in the EU accession agreement."
"- (SK) Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to draw attention to two issues in connection with the forthcoming meeting of the Council."
"The first is that many of the measures are undemocratic by nature."
"The role of the national parliaments and the European Parliament, as the only elected bodies, will be weakened and the powers of central executive bodies will be strengthened."
"The strict penalties and their automatic nature limit the power of national parliaments to influence economic policy."
"I have a similarly negative view of the fact that the Commission is drafting legislation on macro-economic indicators without involving the European Parliament."
"Secondly, many of the proposed measures are counter-productive."
"How does the Commission intend to restore economic growth and employment?"
"You are proposing policies which suppress domestic demand and rely on exports."
"It is almost certain that such a combination of policies will not lead the EU out of crisis."
"Instead of undemocratic and restrictive policies, Commissioner, I would like to express the ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(FI) Mr President, the bad news today was that the Portuguese conservatives are rejecting this package in the hope of new elections being held."
"In this way the whole euro zone may be brought into crisis, because a delay would be poison at present."
"The markets are also watching to see if the European Union can take decisions."
"It is very important that we find solutions."
"This will be a historic decision, because now we are moving from a system of ageold coordination, in which only the few want to be coordinated, to governance, which is a brand new type of European economic architecture, and is a good thing."
"Regrettably, the reputation of this whole project was tarnished by Sarkozy's and Merkel's neoliberal..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, let me first of all thank the honourable Members for a very responsible debate on next week's European Council."
"On behalf of the Commission, I would like to comment on several speeches concerning Libya and Japan before commenting on economic issues."
"As you know, the Commission has no competence on the security and defence front but we have been coordinating the European response to the escalating humanitarian crisis on the Libyan borders."
"The no-fly-zone military action implemented according to UN Security Council Resolution 1973 brought new circumstances which need to be taken into account when delivering humanitarian assistance in a secure and efficient way to those in need, either at the borders or inside Libya."
"It brought new hope as well that innocent civilian lives would be spared."
"Although the events in Japan have no immediate health consequences for citizens in the European Union, it is important to take stock of EU nuclear safety policies, as well as contingency plans and safety measures in place."
"The Commission uses all instruments available to monitor the impact, including on future safety."
"To my mind, Japan teaches us that risks can become reality; what was thought to be impossible must now be included in our planning."
"A European approach for a comprehensive safety and risk assessment of nuclear facilities would maximise the effects at the European level."
"Before drawing final conclusions, a full analysis of the accident in Japan is essential; the assessment should cover the most important issues, such as safety requirements for earthquakes, as well as emergency power supply assistance for reactor cooling."
"On economic policy too, your debate reflected the magnitude of what is at stake at tomorrow's European Council and I trust that the messages sent from here will be heard and listened to in all capitals of Europe."
"It is fair to say that the European Union will have profoundly evolved after this March."
"The financial crisis which turned into an economic recession and then into a sovereign debt and banking crisis has forced Europe to seek new ways forward, to consider all possible options and to take decisions with long-lasting consequences."
"As President Barroso said in his opening remarks, we will respond to the challenge with a comprehensive strategy which builds on the strengths, values and institutions of the European Union."
"It is exactly the kind of challenges which are facing us today that the European Union was created for: to be able to withstand storms together and to be able by joint efforts to come out of a crisis stronger than before."
"As a result of very long talks for several months, the elements of a comprehensive response in economic policy are now finally there for the leaders of the Union to agree and commit to in the European Council tomorrow."
"The Member States, and especially the euro area Member States, are all pursuing intensified fiscal consolidation and growth-enhancing structural reforms with very strong determination."
"This is now the first and foremost cornerstone of making progress on this strategy."
"Secondly, both the Council and the Parliament are delivering on your commitment to conclude the Commission's legislative package on economic governance by this summer."
"Reinforced economic governance is indeed the cornerstone of our comprehensive response."
"Thirdly, the permanent European Stability Mechanism will be made functional as of June 2013, with the effective lending capacity of EUR 500 billion."
"By this decision we will have in place a financial backstop with a sufficient containment effect to clear away even the slightest doubt about our capacity to act even in the most stressed scenarios."
"The role of the Commission in the running of the operations of the ESM will be central, and the link of the ESM to the EU institutions, of course including the European Parliament, will be very clearly and firmly established."
"We shall in due course propose a regulation based on Article 136 of the Treaty clarifying the steps to define policy conditionality and to ensure consistency with the EU framework for country surveillance."
"Last but not least, the banking sector repair must be completed, to safeguard the provision of credit to the real economy, to enterprises and to households."
"The next round of bank stress tests will be conducted in the coming months; the results will guide the necessary restructuring and possible recapitalisation of the EU banking sector."
"Before the publication of results, all the Member States will need to decide and present their strategies, if needed, for the possible restructuring and recapitalisation of their vulnerable institutions."
"It is indeed essential that we see that these two problems have to be resolved in parallel; financial repair must be accelerated, banks restructured and, if need be, recapitalised as soon as possible."
"This is a precondition for restoring and reinforcing confidence in the European economy, improving banks' robustness, and ensuring that we safeguard economic growth through credit supply."
"To conclude, once the European Council confirms its full commitment to all of these elements of our comprehensive economic strategy to overcome the crisis, the European Union will be well on track for turning the economic tide this year, 2011."
"This does not mean all is fine, even less that we can sit back."
"But, yes, it does mean that we are prepared to face the current and emerging challenges and to prevent crises in the future."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (HU) Madam President, Commissioner, honourable Members, first, I thank you for this debate."
"I am grateful that most of you in the Chamber and the speakers in the debate recognised the need for the six elements which will be the European Union's joint response to the economic crisis and on which the Heads of State or Government, I hope, can decide on Thursday and Friday."
"With this we can bring the crisis to an end; with this we can lay the foundation for severely restricting the occurrence of similar crises."
"I agree very strongly with the speakers who said that it was not the European Union itself that was in crisis but that a part, a good part, of the Member States had become entangled in a debt crisis, a debt spiral."
"This is what we must put an end to."
"This is the top priority task for all of us, for every Member State."
"However, we live in a single Union, and we have a common monetary policy and a common currency."
"This is why the debt crisis of any individual Member State is a joint problem for us all."
"This is why we need joint solutions."
"An interesting debate has started, which, I believe, we will have to deal with when we start negotiations now in an official form as well on the six legislative proposals on economic governance."
"This is distinguishing between good and bad debt."
"Is there such a thing as good debt?"
"This is a very exciting debate."
"The Commissioner supports what I am saying, as we considered this in the European Council and the Council was very sceptical whether there was such a thing as good debt."
"Here, too, one MEP said that in very many cases a debt that started as a good debt could turn into a very bad debt."
"We should continue this debate, but I believe that if we wish to extract ourselves from the debt crisis once and for all, we must seek different ways of stimulating the economy and starting growth, other than increasing debt."
"We should not wish to make good investments at the expense of future generations."
"Therefore, I think it is also important to say that, as President Barroso also mentioned, we have tools in our hands: further developing the single market, removing still existing obstacles, and the Europe 2020 Strategy."
"I would like to say a few words on the Portuguese and Irish situations."
"We are all aware that this will be discussed at the European Council meeting."
"As regards Portugal, I merely wish to point out that Portugal's announced package of measures was welcomed by the Heads of State and Government at the EU Summit on 11 March, and it was also welcomed by the President of the European Central Bank."
"Thus this in itself was a positive message for the markets."
"At the same time, it is also very important to say that every action plan is only worth as much as is implemented of it."
"Furthermore, it is very important that there should be political commitment and unambiguous support behind every undertaking."
"Regarding Ireland, I would simply like to mention that the representative of the new Irish Government was very cooperative in the General Affairs Council on Monday, and that I am very confident that a solution to the Irish problem will be found at the European Council meeting as well."
"Many people have raised the Community method versus the intergovernmental method, suggesting that intergovernmentalism was the reason for the failure of the Lisbon Strategy as well."
"I believe that we have made considerable progress since 4 February."
"On 4 February, a good number of Member States and many Members of the European Parliament with whom I spoke at the time were worried about where we were heading and what would become of the European Union if we outsourced important matters."
"In my opinion, the situation has improved a lot and we have returned to the Community approach."
"From the very start the task for us, as the Presidency, has been to try to promote the creation of a viable solution between the outsourcers and those who wished to remain solely within the Community framework."
"The Hungarian Prime Minister suggested and requested as early as 4 February that a reference be made in the conclusions of the European Council with regard to also implementing what was then called the Competitiveness Pact in accordance with the Treaties."
"I am very pleased to be able to say that we have certainly returned to the Community approach."
"The European Commission, one of our most Community-oriented bodies, has an important duty in every element of our comprehensive economic answer of the six laws, and therefore the European Parliament has also been given guarantees that it will have access to the information."
"So, we have come a long way and in a positive direction."
"The Pact for the eis also open and Member States, such as my own country, will be able to join if they want to."
"It is not an exclusive club."
"Finally, as a last request, I repeat my wish that we pursue the debate on the package of six legislative proposals on economic governance in the most constructive spirit possible."
"We are prepared for this, and I would like to mention that we strove to take into account the reports of the MEPs which were already complete in January when the Council formulated its position."
"Turning to Libya and the Mediterranean, war and instability are the greatest tragedy possible for the people living in the region and the European Union."
"I believe I am quoting Mr Mauro's words, which I thoroughly agree with. We have ahead of us the opportunity and task of creating out of this crisis the chance to ensure that a tragedy of this nature never again occurs in the Mediterranean region."
"I think that it is fair to say, and I believe in plain speaking, that Parliament was quicker in deciding this than the Council."
"In the end, the Coalition was able to put together an operation at the last minute which managed to save the lives of very many people in Benghazi."
"As to the question of how united we are and how effective the European Union's common foreign and security policy is, here again I will speak plainly."
"We are not one hundred per cent united."
"However, we have been able to agree a great many things which were essential in the recent period."
"On 11 March, at the summit held then, the Heads of State or Government clearly stated that Gaddafi must go; that relations must be established with the Transitional National Council in Benghazi, and that the Libyan authorities must be called on to allow humanitarian aid into the country."
"Already at that time we decided that we must examine our relations with the southern neighbourhood."
"A condition for this was the start of democratic changes."
"Then we already agreed that financial support had to be increased by incorporating suitable conditions, that trade relations had to be deepened, and that we needed to facilitate social changes in the region."
"The area where we need to progress is the three Ms, Market access, Mobility and Money."
"Then, on 21 March, the Foreign Ministers, the trustees of the areas of the common foreign and security policy, and common security and defence policy, reiterated their commitment."
"By then, UN Security Council Resolution 1973 was available."
"We welcomed this and we could also welcome the decisions of the Paris Summit, the implementation of which must be started."
"We were very quick to decide on sanctions and we emphasised our commitment to helping civilians."
"The common foreign and security policy may not work perfectly but I believe that some very important decisions have been made, albeit at the last minute. Thank you very much, Madam President."
"The debate is closed."
"Written Statements (Rule 149)"
"in writing. - (NL) This spring summit is of crucial importance to all Europeans."
"Here, we will be laying the foundation for a stable euro and a thorough strengthening of economic cooperation in Europe."
"The Pact for the euro which is now before us is, fortunately, much more balanced than the original options."
"Respect for the social consultation model is central to this pact."
"That is how it should be, because it is the basis of our European Rhineland model."
"It is now time that we took the important next step, because the European project cannot be limited to a pure, bald financial-monetary project."
"That would eventually be detrimental and lead to popular support for Europe melting away."
"More than ever, therefore, Europe needs an appealing, new, future-oriented project which will inspire people with enthusiasm once again."
"We need not look far, because the proposals are already on the table."
"In particular, we need to focus on cross-border investment in renewable energy."
"That will only be possible if we also open up the way for Eurobonds."
"It will be a shot in the arm for our economy, for employment and the environment, of course, and entirely feasible, on the basis of the Commission's Roadmap 2050 calculations."
"Let us just get on with it."
"in writing. - The upcoming Council meeting is indeed a very important one."
"President Herman Van Rompuy, in his public invitation letter, notes that 'as an important step in the new framework of the European semester, we should give guidance for national economic policies with a view to implementing our Europe 2020 Strategy'."
"We should not bypass this point on the agenda as secondary behind the economic package."
"Everybody knows that the key to European economic growth is employment."
"The Europe 2020 Strategy aims at an employment rate of 75% among men and women aged between 20-64."
"Everybody knows, in theory, that this 75% threshold will not be attained without the massive participation and appearance of women on the labour market."
"Therefore, I ask two things of the Council ahead of its upcoming meeting."
"The first one is to be ambitious and explicit when it comes to employment guidelines, and especially when it comes to female employment."
"Secondly, I ask you to reaffirm your commitment to European targets and guidelines that allow for the massive participation of women on the labour market, especially the Barcelona targets for daytime childcare, which we know, are far from being met in the EU."
"in writing. - (RO) I think that it is absolutely imperative for the investments in education, research and innovation to be made immediately with the support of all Member States so as to achieve the Europe 2020 strategy's targets, thereby making the economic recovery a reality."
"As a representative of Europe's citizens, I declare my support for Mrs Balzani's report."
"I agree that the European Union needs to improve its financial resources so that it can compete on the global political and economic stage at a time when current challenges require greater competitiveness from global actors."
"Last but not least, in order to have a strong economy, promoting employment should be set as a basic objective."
"The European Union needs a skilled workforce in every area, people with the appropriate expertise and higher productivity in all its sectors."
"Over the next few days, the Pact for the euro will be finalised by the European Council."
"The basic objective of the pact is to promote competitiveness that will lead to an increase in employment in the countries in the euro area."
"In the aim of achieving the above objectives at European level, I propose that the definition and control of the land and sea borders and the economic borders of the Member States of the European Union be integrated into the pact."
"This will protect European manufacturing from counterfeit products imported from labour-intensive countries in the East."
"Importing these cheaply-produced goods is not only illegal; it also stops the market from functioning properly, thereby reducing the profits of European companies."
"This is slowing down growth and reducing the competitiveness of European companies and of Europe as a whole."
"In conclusion, we need new incentives for the Member States of the European Union to develop exclusive economic zones."
"We need a European guarantee for the entire European exclusive economic zone which cannot be contested by third countries."
"in writing. - (DE) There is no such thing as good or bad debt; the continual rise in national debt must be stemmed."
"Unfortunately, the Council has failed to implement the Stability and Growth Pact fully."
"However, our citizens cannot be burdened with a further structural crisis."
"The existing national debt problem can only be dealt with by demanding strict budgetary discipline."
"The procedure adopted by the Member States of applying the 'fast-track procedure' is to be rejected, but as Mr Gualtieri has already said, if we are to come up with a counter-proposal then we must concentrate on the substance."
"I would welcome an initiative in which the 143 nuclear power plants in Europe were immediately taken out of the grid and sustainable energy sources were used instead."
"To comment briefly on the imminent stress tests at the nuclear energy facilities: since - as is repeatedly emphasised - the detailed safety arrangements at nuclear power plants fall within the competence of the individual Member States, I cannot unreservedly support these stress tests at this early stage in the negotiations."
"In view of the events triggered in 1986 by a crisis simulation at the Chernobyl nuclear reactor, I would view such tests with great concern unless they were performed by the EU or a comparable institution and only following detailed analysis of the condition and load capacity of the individual reactors."
"The rapporteur sought to insert a paragraph concerning the European Union's decentralised agencies into a chapter entitled 'Sustainability and responsibility at the heart of the 2012 EU budget'."
"I share the main idea raised, which is that agencies bring added value to EU policies in areas as varied as professional training, the environment, internal security and rail transport."
"However, I also share the idea that, in terms of budgetary sustainability and responsibility, the agencies system could be improved."
"Indeed, the agencies' tasks and powers overlap at times, and some of them have high operating costs due to the constraints imposed by our financial and budgetary rules."
"That is why the decentralised agencies' expenditure could be rationalised through a system of shared services including, for example, assistance with the budgetary process, assistance with tender procedures and legal advice."
"To conclude, during the last discharge procedure, Parliament also sought to draw attention to the Commission's and Parliament's control over the decentralised agencies; this must be strengthened, as experience has shown."
"Europe must learn from the nuclear incidents in Japan and undertake to guarantee nuclear safety across the continent."
"The energy mix still comes under the remit of the Member States."
"However, nuclear safety is defined by European legislation, which must be reviewed, taking into account the nuclear plant safety tests proposed recently by the Commission."
"We must not forget that the EU is hugely dependent on energy imports and that Member States need to find solutions to make provision for their own energy sources."
"The EU needs a common energy policy which must be based on striking the ideal balance between renewable energy, new technologies for conventional energy resources and the need to produce nuclear energy in safe conditions."
"On the subject of Libya, the Council needs to come up with a new European partnership with the Southern Neighbourhood countries."
"This partnership involves close political cooperation which will ensure the transition of these countries to democracy."
"Furthermore, the European Commission must submit as soon as possible a plan for managing the migrant flows, which will take into account the solidarity between Member States and strengthen Frontex's technical and operational capabilities."
"However, this plan must not detract from the EU's focus on the Eastern Partnership."
"We have just endorsed amendments to the Treaty which will enable the introduction of a permanent stability mechanism for the euro area."
"We have achieved great success in managing to give a clear expression of support for use of the community approach as the main form of cooperation within the mechanism."
"The central role of the European Commission in the process of evaluating the financial situation of Member States augurs well for the future of cooperation, because this protects it from the instability which would threaten it if the intergovernmental approach were chosen."
"Let us hope that after adoption of the amendment to the Treaty by the European Council, it will be successfully ratified in the Member States, enabling the permanent mechanism to be set up according to plan."
"Incorporation of the stability mechanism into the Treaty is just one step which has been taken to improve the competitiveness of the euro area recently."
"At tomorrow's meeting, the Council is also going to accept the Pact for the euro, which was adopted at the meeting of euro area Member States on 17 March."
"I am certain that the Heads of State or Government will manage to reach an agreement and this scheme will come into force, making it possible to step up economic cooperation in areas including employment and public finance."
"It is to be welcomed that despite the initial fears of non-euro area Member States, the pact has been made open to all Member States wishing to join."
"This guarantees, at least to a certain degree, that the mechanism will not give rise to a two-speed Europe."
"This European Council is taking place in a specific context for Portugal."
"The country's economic and social crisis is plunging to unprecedented depths because of the path trodden by the European Union's members, and of the national level application of measures dictated by them: intensifying regressive policies, increasing the exploitation of workers, new antisocial measures that worsen inequalities, increasing unemployment and job insecurity, and increasing poverty and social exclusion."
"It is in this context that the government, with pressure and applause from the EU, is tabling another package of aforementioned austerity measures - the fourth."
"The intention of the directorate of EU powers is clear: to force another neo-colonial noose around the necks of the more economically fragile countries, attacking their sovereignty, with the anticipated conditions for the application of a European Stability Mechanism."
"All this, on the pretext of maintaining the privileges enjoyed by the great economic and financial interest groups - particularly those of the directorate countries - which a number of EU instruments contribute to, such as the Stability and Growth Pact, the Economic and Monetary Union, and the euro."
"Faced with this, the struggling Portuguese workers gave the necessary response to this in Portugal on Saturday in a great national demonstration."
"Situation in Japan, including the nuclear power plant alerts (debate)"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the situation in Japan, including the nuclear power plant alerts."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - Madam President, on behalf of the Council I want to begin by conveying our condolences to the people of Japan, those who have lost loved ones and the many others who have been touched in one way or another by the tragic events over 10 days ago."
"I also pay tribute to the courage and fortitude of those who are now struggling to tackle the consequences of the terrible earthquake and tsunami, as well as those endeavouring to deal with the consequences of the nuclear incident."
"The European Union stands alongside the Japanese people at this extraordinarily difficult and challenging time."
"We have already provided Japan with assistance in a very concrete way."
"On the very day that the earthquake struck, the European Council asked the High Representative and the Commission to mobilise all appropriate assistance."
"The European Civil Protection Mechanism was activated in order to help coordinate assistance offered by the Member States."
"Within a very short time the European Union was responding to requests for assistance from the Japanese Government."
"The European Union stands ready to continue to answer calls for humanitarian assistance, technical support of any kind or more specialised assistance that the Japanese authorities may consider appropriate."
"On behalf of the Council, I would like in particular to thank Commissioner Georgieva and the High Representative for a swift, comprehensive and very coordinated response to the disaster."
"The EU civil protection team deployed in Japan has our full support."
"Individual Member States have also been prepared to make very generous offers of assistance."
"It is also important to mention that the Council will need to follow up on the macroeconomic impact of the Japanese crisis."
"Ministers already had a preliminary debate on the matter at the Ecofin breakfast on 15 March."
"Obviously one of the main concerns for us all is the situation at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant."
"I would like to stress the fact that the Hungarian Presidency acted without delay, taking into account the gravity of the events and the possible effects in Europe, especially regarding the nuclear risk."
"We promptly convened the Working Party on Atomic Questions and an Extraordinary Energy Council in order to assess the situation in Japan, as well as its possible repercussions on the EU, and reflect on the EU response."
"I would like to underline that the first message to come from the Council was one of solidarity, compassion and readiness to provide humanitarian as well as technical assistance."
"This message is also one of respect for the tenacity and the resilience of the Japanese people, especially those who are still struggling to cope with the situation in Fukushima."
"It is thanks to their tenacity in extremely difficult conditions that one can now see some hope regarding the situation of the nuclear plant, although it remains serious."
"The major problem now is the high level of contamination that has been measured in the vicinity of the plant."
"Our support to Japan needs to continue."
"Several Member States are making a contribution, either bilaterally or through various coordination mechanisms operated by the Commission or the International Atomic Energy Agency."
"As the Hungarian Minister for Rural Development, Sándor Fazekas, was told at the meeting of the Environment Ministers, for the moment the events at Fukushima nuclear plant have no consequences for the population in the EU."
"Radiation levels in all Member States are normal and appropriate controls are in place regarding foodstuffs imported from Japan."
"However, the accident at the Fukushima nuclear plant calls for an effective EU response."
"There are certain lessons to be learned from this accident."
"Implementing and continually improving the high standards for nuclear safety is a top priority for EU regulators and operators; but the very concept of continuous improvement implies that we need to draw the lessons first, despite the fact that the accident was caused by external factors and not by malfunctions at the plant."
"Several Member States and industry operators have already decided to review the safety of the nuclear plants, which should be welcomed."
"Following the Extraordinary Council of Energy Ministers on 21 March, the Hungarian National Development Minister, Tamás Fellegi, has written to brief President Van Rompuy on the proposal for stress tests for nuclear power plants and for other countries, particularly our neighbours, to be associated with this exercise."
"The scope and modalities for the test should be developed in light of recent events and making full use of the available expertise."
"As to the scope, noting that each nuclear plant has its own specificities, the following core areas could possibly be addressed by the assessment: flood risk, seismic risk, backup systems and emergency procedures."
"The European Nuclear Safety Regulatory Group, with the full involvement of the Member States, will define the modalities of this assessment in consultation with the relevant stakeholders."
"Whilst it is difficult to set a firm date for this, it is clear that it needs to get under way as soon as possible."
"The issue of the safety of nuclear plants obviously does not stop at the EU's borders."
"This is why it is important to involve neighbouring third countries."
"An assessment needs to cover both existing and planned plants, and we must make full use of international organisations and bodies, like the International Atomic Energy Agency, and other international associations like the G20 to involve other countries."
"It is obviously important that the message to the public regarding the situation in Japan is clear."
"I have two comments on this."
"First, the credibility of the exercise depends on our being transparent about the modalities and outcome of the assessment."
"Second, however serious the situation in Japan is, we should not give the impression that the issue of nuclear safety is being addressed piecemeal and only now."
"It is important to recall that there has been a legally binding framework in place in Europe for over 25 years."
"As far as the specific nuclear issue is concerned the Council will obviously be following closely the developments and will in any case return to the matter in June."
"The European Council later this week will take stock of the situation in Japan in the aftermath of this tragedy."
"I have no doubt that our Heads of State and Government will want to express their continued solidarity with the people of Japan as I do now."
"The European Union will continue to stand ready to provide whatever assistance we can to help them through this difficult time."
"Once again, I salute their courage and determination."
"Member of the Commission. - (DE) Madam President, honourable Members, the Commission has expressed the solidarity of the European Union with the people and government of Japan."
"We have expressed our deep sympathy."
"We believe that the courage and the calm attitude of the Japanese people is worthy of our utmost respect and admiration."
"We have coordinated aid efforts under the Monitoring and Information Centre so as to make a common offer of aid from the EU."
"Blankets, mattresses, water containers, tents and hygiene equipment have been provided by 13 Member States as part of an initial joint EU aid package."
"We are awaiting further offers and will be taking delivery of and distributing aid consignments in Japan in the coming days: on Thursday - in other words, tomorrow - and on Friday."
"Commissioner Georgieva will be present in person."
"We have also offered to assist at the nuclear power plant complex, but our assistance has not yet been requested."
"Where nuclear energy is concerned, we are in close contact with the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna and are monitoring, assessing and analysing the safety situation in Japan closely."
"Further information is required before we can estimate the impact of the incident at the nuclear power plant."
"At the moment we are assuming that the Japanese engineers and technicians and the Japanese Government will regain control over this nuclear power plant complex and that further damage from the disaster can be avoided."
"We are assessing what lessons we should learn from this for Europe."
"To this end, on Tuesday last week we held a high level conference - with all the Member States, with all the energy enterprises that operate nuclear power plants, with all the enterprises that manufacture nuclear power plants and with the atomic energy authorities of the Member States."
"On Monday an Extraordinary Energy Council was held, having been convened by Mr Fellegi."
"It must be realised that there is great disparity between the situations and positions of the European Member States as regards nuclear power plants."
"Fourteen countries operate nuclear power plants; for 13 of these it is part of their long-term energy policy, while one - Germany - has a strategy to phase out nuclear power."
"Thirteen countries have no nuclear power, of which two - Poland and Italy - are currently considering moving into or resuming nuclear energy production."
"With the exception of renewable energy - with its 20% target - the energy mix lies within the competence of national legislation and policy."
"We respect that."
"The situation in different parts of Europe varies greatly - overall, Europe generates 30% of its power from nuclear energy, but in Austria the share is approaching 0% and in France it is 80% - but there are two common denominators."
"The first, which we will come back to in the course of the year, is the infrastructure."
"Whatever direction energy policy is to take, expansion of the infrastructure for electricity, gas and storage capacity - in terms of both quality and capacity - needs to be accelerated."
"Secondly, safety."
"The safety of industrial plants in general, of infrastructure in general and of nuclear power plants in particular is a common concern for the benefit of workers in the power plants, the citizens of Europe and European nature."
"We are therefore proposing that we look at whether it is meaningful and appropriate, in view of the already recognisable causes and the emerging information on the causes of the incident in Japan, to carry out a safety check - a stress test; in other words, an extraordinary test based on common standards and criteria with the aim of further reducing risk in the 143 nuclear power plants that are operated in the European Union, as well as for the building of any new plants in the European Union."
"Safety benefits all citizens, regardless of whether the Member State in which they live has nuclear power, is planning nuclear power, is phasing out nuclear power or has no nuclear power."
"This would look at particular criteria such as flooding and risks to operation and safety, earthquakes and knowledge gained in Japan, cooling systems and their functioning and the subject of power supply and backup power in a staggered configuration, so that more cooling can be maintained by means of power and backup power units even where there is a risk of earthquakes and flooding."
"This would involve general criteria for all nuclear power plants as well as special criteria for each particular design, age, location, seismic risk, flood risk and other factors."
"This special review should also include topics such as aircraft crashes, cyber attacks and terrorist attacks."
"The Commission's offer to the Member States is that it will prepare and coordinate this jointly with the atomic energy authorities."
"This is only an offer; acceptance is voluntary."
"The Member States are themselves responsible for deciding whether they want to perform a general and special common stress test in Europe."
"The previous speaker mentioned neighbouring states which are just as important for our safety; a central one of these is Switzerland, along with Ukraine, Armenia, Turkey and the Russian Federation."
"I have had a long telephone conversation with the Ukrainian Energy Minister."
"He stated that he would be happy to participate if there were a general stress test for the European Union - in other words, an offer on his part."
"It is clear that our authority in respect of a stress test outside of the European Union and its Member States will depend greatly on whether we can organise this jointly in Europe."
"If some Member States do not want to participate then we will have less authority when making an offer to Turkey, Ukraine, Russia and Switzerland than if all the Member States take a common view that this is an important safety task."
"We will therefore prepare these safety criteria in the coming weeks and we are happy to cooperate not just with Parliament, but also with all those involved in the European Union - with NGOs, energy enterprises, workers, technicians, engineers in the power stations - with the aim of achieving the greatest possible further reduction in risk and increase in safety."
"We are grateful that President Sarkozy wishes to address this whole topic at the G20 and therefore lessons will be learnt not just for nuclear power plants in Europe, but also for those throughout the rest of the world."
"This is the situation for our part."
"We will be happy to provide Parliament with information on how to proceed further at any time via its specialist committees - as we have already done in recent days in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy - and we look forward to corresponding support from the European Council here in Brussels tomorrow and the day after."
"Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have been reminded once again of the force of nature and we are seeing the limits of human capability and how we are at the mercy of these powerful forces of nature."
"At such moments we can only show solidarity with the Japanese - a solidarity that is expressed in our thoughts and prayers, but also in practical assistance."
"When the Commissioner mentions that we are providing aid, trying to provide relief and support people, that is an important measure that not only provides direct assistance, but also provides some comfort."
"I also know that it is not just the state organisations that are doing this, but that many of the citizens of Europe are prepared to donate, to give their own private money."
"In my home town alone - where I am a patron - EUR 50 000 was collected within three days, and the money is still coming in."
"This is happening all over Europe."
"It shows that there is a high level of support."
"At the same time, we should pause for thought and not immediately start pressing our buttons for internal political purposes."
"Undoubtedly, however, we will look at the experience that has been had and the lessons to be learned from the nuclear incident and will have to carry out the stress test, and I hope, Commissioner, we will do this at European level - because borders are meaningless when such incidents occur."
"We must ensure that we create the necessary infrastructures for alternatives and that research is carried out into possible new energy projects, which should equally address issues such as climate change, jobs and competitiveness."
"We also need to realise that the words 'ancillary risk' will play a different role."
"People no longer have faith that companies will observe all the regulations and that there is nothing that cannot be calculated. Japan will change our thinking on these issues and consequently we need to rethink the issue of ancillary risk; new conclusions will be drawn and must give rise to new considerations and new policies."
"We should discuss this with the calmness that it demands."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - (SV) Madam President, one of the world's most developed countries from an economic and technical perspective has been thrown into a state of humanitarian crisis."
"It is, first and foremost, a tragedy for all those people who have been affected."
"The images from Japan are heart-rending."
"We need to give them all the support and every possible form of assistance we can."
"However, the disaster also demonstrates the vulnerability of all modern societies."
"What has happened in Japan could happen in other parts of the world - even here."
"Even in countries with extremely high safety requirements, this safety may prove deceptive."
"Now, of course, we cannot simply imagine nuclear power away."
"There are certainly some countries in Europe that do not have nuclear power, but the majority are extremely, or completely, dependent on it."
"Some are building new nuclear power plants and some are decommissioning them."
"That is the situation we find ourselves in - in other words, the situation is different in different Member States as regards vulnerability, but we are nevertheless in this together and we need to take a long term- approach to our energy supply."
"We quite simply have to switch our energy systems so that we reduce the risks and the one-sided nature of these systems."
"We must make a serious effort to prioritise research and development and investments in, and the expansion of, long-term sustainable and renewable energy sources."
"Europe has huge untapped potential here that should be set against the fact that the construction of new nuclear power plants will make us dependent on them for many more decades to come - in other words new investments in nuclear energy are a means of postponing and preventing the expansion of renewable energy, a way of mortgaging the future."
"Instead, what we should be doing now is having a serious debate with regard to raising the EU's renewable energy targets and ambitions and as soon as possible deciding on binding energy efficiency targets and a long-term plan for our energy supply - a switch to renewable energy."
"The collective stress test for nuclear power plants in all countries is therefore necessary, but then what is needed is a long-term approach."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, the images of the massive earthquake and tsunami in north-eastern Japan are terrifying; our thoughts and heartfelt sympathies go to those who have lost homes and loved ones."
"Of course we welcome the EU help package."
"In Fukushima, personnel are still working at the site of the nuclear power plant to prevent further radiation contamination, and this of course has to be assessed thoroughly all over the European Union - including in Brussels."
"I welcome the stress test proposed by the Commission, but I think it has to be added that we cannot just have a stress test based on technology and geography."
"We need two other steps."
"One is on the security culture, where it obviously has been impossible to envisage multiple risks."
"The second is on the institutional framework, including an oversight of the relationships between the national regulatory bodies and the nuclear companies."
"Furthermore, authorities should not be allowed to audit themselves."
"Finally, as we evaluate the consequences of the disaster, we should base our discussion on information and knowledge."
"Radical measures might be necessary - I would think are necessary."
"But one thing should be obvious: we have to reform our energy production and to rely instead on renewable energy and we have to do it now."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Madam President, let me express my admiration for the stoic Japanese resilience in the face of these mighty forces of nature."
"We must remember the extraordinary strength of the earthquake and of the tsunami."
"I welcome the precautionary stress tests on European nuclear power plants, while remembering that the nuclear industry is already the most regulated and safety conscious in the world, and I note the statement earlier this year from WENRA, the Western European Nuclear Regulators Association, about making new reactors even safer than our existing ones."
"It is salutary to compare the safety records of the coal, oil and hydroelectric industries with that of the nuclear industry, in terms of accidents involving loss of life."
"Madam President, I see a silver lining in this awful cloud for Japan - namely that the rebuilding and restoration work in that country, courtesy of the deep pockets of the insurance industry, should give a huge boost to their economy and that will be good for the rest of the world."
"I thank the Minister and the Commissioner for their thoughtful remarks and I would say to Member States, and everyone else: do not go wobbly on nuclear power now, we need it too much."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, of course this situation requires that we should assist Japan as best we can and with all the resources at our disposal."
"A country hit by the kind of disaster that has hit Japan needs all the help it can get."
"However, I find remarkable the levity with which we heap praise on Japan's heroes."
"I believe that we are failing to recognise that the people referred to as 'heroes' know better than anyone else that they are risking life and limb and that many of those who are fighting the nuclear meltdown in Fukushima are already dead men walking."
"The Japanese know better than any other nation in the world what devastation a nuclear disaster can unleash."
"Their history is dominated by Hiroshima and Nagasaki."
"Every child in Japan is aware of the consequences of nuclear meltdown."
"We should be aware of this when we come to discuss Japan."
"The Japanese know better than anyone else all the horror entailed not just in this situation, but also in what is yet to come."
"Perhaps the Ukrainians, who have witnessed the devastation of part of their country for the last 25 years, are the only others qualified to speak about this."
"For me, current European discussions, unlike those of 25 years ago, should consider the political implications when we discover that in our own countries we have a technology that can get out of control, not just annihilating the past in certain regions or destroying the present, but also reaching insidiously into the future of all those living in the vicinity of these plants, as well as in the wider environs."
"I do not believe that we are doing this when we talk about stress tests, Mr Oettinger."
"We must be much more honest and should admit that we in the European Union have frequently been confronted with situations verging on nuclear meltdown in the plants that we operate."
"Let me give you a short list: Tihange in Belgium, Civaux in France, Philippsburg in Germany, Kozloduy in Bulgaria, Paks in Hungary, Brunsbüttel in Germany, where there was a hydrogen explosion, Forsmark in Sweden, Barsebäck in Sweden, Blayais in France, Krümmel in Germany - this is a list of the most striking incidents that have occurred, with a range of different causes, since Chernobyl, where we have found ourselves on the threshold of nuclear meltdown."
"How are we to deal with the fact that a nuclear meltdown could occur in any of the plants that we operate?"
"Are we to do this through stress tests?"
"In my opinion, these tests are only relevant if they lead us to produce a plan indicating which plants and which defined risks are to be the first to go as we turn our backs on this high-risk technology."
"If these stress tests are intended to reassure the public and once again to suggest that we in Europe could never be faced with situations like those currently experienced in Japan, then I believe that these tests are wrong."
"By the way, we would very much welcome the opportunity to have a say in deciding who defines the stress tests - this matter cannot be left to the nuclear power plant operators themselves - as well as who implements the tests and evaluates them."
"The hitherto responsible authorities have turned a blind eye far too often to the difficulties encountered in European plants and have approved plants that never should have passed the conformity assessment procedure, as Euratom did in the cases of Belene and Mochovce, for example."
"Madam President, like other speakers I would like to express my condolences to the people affected by the tragedy in Japan, a tragedy that is still ongoing."
"We need to do everything we can to help the Japanese people."
"Regarding the lessons we need to learn in Europe, the question of nuclear safety is clearly at the top of the agenda now."
"Especially in relation to the 'stress tests' to be performed on nuclear plants in Europe."
"What happened in Japan has serious implications for EU energy policy in the future."
"The humanitarian disaster shows the importance of moving towards a non-nuclear Europe."
"We need a moratorium on nuclear energy, and what is needed is massive investment in sustainable and renewable energy."
"There must be a review of the nuclear safety regulatory system as well."
"on behalf of the EFD Group, - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I also wish to express my sympathy and admiration for the dignity, fortitude and cohesion demonstrated by the Japanese people in the face of the sort of catastrophe that the world has rarely seen in terms of size and severity."
"The behaviour of the Japanese people is truly an inspiration to all and they deserve our help."
"The lesson to be learned from this experience is the need to strengthen the European civil protection system through more closely coordinated action and the wider availability of people and resources so that we can act quickly in the event of disaster."
"With regard to the nuclear option, it would be a mistake to discuss this topic on the emotional tide of current events: the subject is too important and must be addressed with a scientific approach."
"It is absolutely right to strengthen security measures for present and next-generation power stations and to dismantle those that are older and more unsafe, but we must avoid political exploitation and be cautious and pragmatic, as Mr Brok said."
"We should remember that in the same Fukushima area, a dam collapsed during the earthquake with many casualties, but this does not lead us to think of dismantling dams or building new ones, hence I call for caution, attention and openness to the future."
"(FR) Madam President, the terrible disaster which struck the Tōhoku region in the north-east of Japan has naturally aroused compassion and sympathy on the part of all Europeans."
"Beyond that feeling, we must of course participate in the rescue effort because the situation is, I believe, far from being stabilised in Japan."
"Japan is a remarkable country, an extremely dignified, strong and brave country, which is aware of its duties, but where bureaucracy has, as elsewhere, effects that can paralyse initiatives."
"One of the lessons to be learned from this disaster is that the most effective emergency relief is, in the end, the one that arrives by sea."
"Of course, this requires there to be sufficient facilities nearby."
"The situation is not stabilised and many homeless people are still suffering from the cold and from hunger."
"We believe that the lessons from this tragedy are the following: the first is that the worst always happens, the worst always ends up happening."
"The Titanic was built to be an unsinkable ship."
"'Even God could not sink it' was what was said about it."
"Yet it sank on its maiden voyage, despite the watertight caissons, because the engineers did not think there could be a leak on that scale."
"Well, the worst always happens, the earthquake plus the tsunami, this was, of course, the worst scenario."
"However, there will be other earthquakes, there will be the big Kanto earthquake that we are expecting at any moment."
"There might be one in California, in Italy or in the Caribbean."
"Therefore, as has been said, we need to be prepared for this by enhancing civil protection."
"The second and final lesson is that we must nevertheless not give in to panic."
"We cannot, at the same time, be told that we must forsake nuclear energy on the grounds that radioactive fallout is dangerous, while also being told that we should stop using fossil fuels because CO2 is being discharged into the atmosphere."
"A choice will have to be made."
"(LV) Madam President, the misfortune that the Japanese people have experienced is immense."
"I should like to put on record my deepest sympathy for the families of those who have suffered and those who have died, and their near ones."
"The nobility and composure exhibited by the Japanese people in this time of trial is worthy of the greatest respect and is an example for the whole world."
"Japan is faced with an intensive task of restoring its devastated territories, which will require significant resources, including inward investment."
"That is why I call for the European Union-Japan summit scheduled for 25 May to take the decision to begin negotiations on a free trade agreement between the European Union and Japan."
"This agreement would have to be of benefit to both parties; it would have to guarantee equal market access conditions to both partners, both in the flow of goods and services and in relation to agricultural products."
"A free trade agreement could become one of the instruments for the third opening of Japan, as Japan's Prime Minister, Mr Kan, has picturesquely termed it."
"The accident caused by the tsunami at the Fukushima nuclear power station is a cause of serious alarm throughout the world."
"We must bow our heads in respect and gratitude to those heroes who are working, at the risk of their own lives, to stabilise the situation in the nuclear reactor."
"The experience currently being gained by the Japanese engineers and nuclear power experts in accident prevention is unique."
"It is important for the world to learn from this experience."
"The experience of Fukushima must be of service to humanity, by becoming the basis for testing nuclear power stations and the development of improved safety criteria."
"In conclusion, I should again wish to confirm that the European Union must do everything possible to help Japan, one of our closest partners. Thank you."
"Madam President, two themes have emerged in the aftermath of the tragic events which struck Japan 12 days ago."
"The first has been the Japanese response which, in terms of structural preparation in the cities, the rapid response of the emergency units and the inspirational resilience shown by the Japanese people, has been exemplary and should serve as a template for other earthquake-prone countries."
"However, the second theme, that of the nuclear fallout in Fukushima, is more difficult."
"While Japan will undoubtedly learn swiftly from these events, Europe too must take these lessons on board and our reaction might be broken up into two areas."
"The first is to secure beyond doubt the safety of nuclear power plants operating in the EU."
"I welcome plans for tests and would like to stress that they must conclude with common rules between Member States on the security of nuclear power plants and on the storing of highly toxic nuclear waste."
"This is particularly pertinent in my Ireland East constituency."
"The largest collection of such material is housed at Sellafield nuclear plant in England just 280 kilometres from County Louth."
"Our second response should concern the future of nuclear power as a whole."
"In this regard, a complete halt to the construction of new nuclear power plants must be agreed."
"In order to ensure the continued provision of sufficient energy for the EU, investments in renewable energy production and increased energy efficiency must also be approved."
"Madam President, I endorse the words of my colleagues in the Delegation for relations with Japan - Mr Gollnisch and Ms Kalniete - words of respect and of sympathy to the Japanese."
"We must, however, also learn, and that means that this potential nuclear disaster should have an international dimension."
"There must be absolute transparency."
"We must find out why the International Atomic Energy Agency's warning was not followed up; there was no discussion about this warning."
"We should find out what happened."
"I agree with all the others who say that we should combine our efforts in rebuilding."
"Therefore a free trade agreement is of special value and we should conclude this agreement as soon as possible."
"(PL) Madam President, as a member of the European Parliament Delegation for relations with Japan, I would like firstly to convey expressions of sympathy and solidarity with the Japanese nation in the face of this enormous catastrophe."
"It has claimed almost 10 000 human lives, over 16 000 people are considered missing, and these numbers are constantly changing."
"The earthquake and the tsunami have caused unimaginable destruction."
"Losses are already estimated at USD 300 billion."
"Although Japan has not asked the European Union for any help, we cannot remain passive in the face of the magnitude of this tragedy."
"The greatest anxiety is being aroused by the damage to the Fukushima nuclear power station."
"In the opinion of some experts, the situation is serious and may result in a repeat of what happened after Chernobyl."
"The declaration of the Hungarian Presidency and Mrs Ashton concerning humanitarian and expert aid should be given substance as quickly as possible in close cooperation with the Japanese Government."
"(DE) Madam President, just 14 days ago, the Japanese company Toshiba and others that built nuclear power stations wrote in their promotional brochures that they had the safest nuclear power stations in the world - so much for the claim that we in Europe definitely have the safest atomic energy plants."
"I believe that this extremely serious and tragic accident in Japan should make it clear how absurd it is to equate nuclear power stations with wind farms, energy efficiency or solar power plants when discussing the fight against climate change."
"What is more, this idea of low carbon technology is simply wrong."
"One needs to look at the overall risk from all technologies."
"My first specific question to you, Mr Oettinger, is as follows: is it not high time for you to include at least one scenario in the Energy Roadmap 2050 that simply shows what we can achieve by combining 100% renewable energy and energy efficiency?"
"That is the very least that the citizens of Europe can expect."
"Let me state, with regard to the stress tests, that we are in favour of such tests, but they must be mandatory and they must be European."
"The first bank stress test was manipulated excessively by the national authorities so that a couple of banks would be excluded."
"We needed a second round of stress tests to get things right."
"The second key element is 'independent expertise'."
"Mrs Lauvergeon from Areva and Mr Teyssen from E.ON, the Euratom officials from the Commission, the nuclear experts in Vienna, and indeed the national nuclear watchdogs are all biased."
"Even the national authorities will not admit that the safety tests outlined six months ago are no longer correct."
"In other words, we need independent experts."
"Otherwise you run the risk of hearing only biased opinions."
"I have one final word to add."
"I would recommend caution, Mr Oettinger, when you point to Mr Sarkozy as the great champion in the struggle for worldwide nuclear safety."
"I would be a little more circumspect if I were you."
"(DE) Madam President, Japan is still under threat of nuclear meltdown."
"Radiation from the nuclear power plant in Fukushima is rising dramatically."
"This is yet another horrific demonstration of how impossible it is to control nuclear power."
"That is why we are calling for an immediate abandonment of nuclear energy."
"Nuclear energy lines the pockets of the power companies, but when an accident occurs it is the people who pay the price."
"For this reason, the EU must immediately lay down a requirement for the operators of nuclear power plants to hold mandatory public liability insurance."
"Sufficient cover must be provided for all damage to health, property and other assets in all Member States."
"The European Union should finally halt the promotion of nuclear energy and terminate the Euratom Treaty."
"Billions in taxpayers' money is still being poured into a dangerous, high-risk technology, while safe alternatives like renewable energies remain under-funded."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I think it would be a serious mistake to turn this debate into a kind of trial against the risks of modernity."
"We must acknowledge that science and technology allow us to live longer, to live under better conditions, to live with a more confident outlook and taking into account that food security conditions have improved, that the conditions of our welfare systems have improved, that conditions in our forward-looking world have improved, precisely because it has been able to use and exploit science and technology."
"Of course this viewpoint is not without risks, but these risks can be overcome if we are able to join forces to deal with the problems faced by the international community day by day."
"Mr Brock, in particular, got it right when he said that there is a mystery in our relationship with things that makes us realise that we have not mastered everything, that however advanced we may be, we have not got the answer to all problems that nature poses to humans and the magnitude of this earthquake reminds us of exactly that."
"It is very likely that inferior technology and science led not long ago or a hundred years ago, for example in Messina, to an event that caused more than 100 000 deaths, despite a much lower intensity earthquake."
"This should give us a clear guideline for the future: science and technology are tools and it takes good policy to put them to the fullest use."
"It will therefore take good politics, what we make together as institutions, to determine whether we currently have solutions to go beyond today's atomic age into the future or whether we must carry on taking these tools into account in the long term to enable the further development we all need."
"Today, however, we are called on to do something quite different, essentially to take action to help with the pain and the need of a people."
"I do not hear much about this in this House, because we are all concerned about a political discussion that is attempting to drag in future concerns that do not really have anything to do with what is on the agenda."
"(RO) Madam President, the crisis which is unfolding at the moment in Japan raises concerns about the safety of nuclear power plants worldwide."
"It is our duty to ask ourselves how resilient and safe the nuclear power plants built on our territory are."
"I come from Romania and the citizens of my country are quite rightly concerned about the safety of the Cernavodă nuclear power plant, especially as many question marks have been raised about it recently in the press."
"I firmly believe that not only in Romania, but also in a number of Member States, the general public is wondering whether they would be adequately protected in the event of natural disasters which could affect the nuclear power plants."
"Last week Germany decided to carry out a detailed inspection of its systems for producing nuclear energy."
"In light of the events in Japan, it is absolutely imperative to carry out an urgent review of the nuclear safety situation across the entire European Union."
"All Member States should exercise strict and total control over these power plants."
"The European Commission must not only ensure that the Nuclear Safety Directive will be implemented properly, but also monitor closely, along with the competent authorities in the Member States, the state of these power plants."
"The tragic situation in Japan highlights to us once again that we need to do our utmost to create rapid response mechanisms for tackling disasters."
"(FR) Madam President, a few words on Japan."
"Firstly, everything must be done to relieve the suffering of the Japanese people, who deserve all our compassion and solidarity."
"Secondly, on top of the two natural disasters - earthquake and tsunami - there is a third disaster, this one being nuclear and therefore man-made."
"Everything that has been said on this matter can be summarised in one word: hiatus."
"Yes, we are faced with a paradigm shift which boils down to two questions: what should be changed, and, secondly, what can we start by changing in regard to energy production?"
"We can be sure that if we had run out of fossil fuels and nuclear energy, as it were, we would very quickly be able to get a more accurate picture regarding the potential for developing renewable energy sources."
"We are expecting the European Union to redefine its strategy on this issue."
"For this to happen, it needs a vision, strength of will and a detailed roadmap."
"(NL) Madam President, I would, first of all, like to congratulate Mr Oettinger on getting off to a good start."
"You did, indeed, get off to a flying start last week, but since then you seem to have gone downhill."
"However, you really need to tackle this now and clarify your position, because what you said last week was that we should have a debate on Europe and on a future for Europe without nuclear energy."
"You have not repeated that since then, although that should be the subject of our debate now."
"Time and again, many studies, scientific studies, have shown that you can achieve your environmental targets without using nuclear energy."
"It is possible to run Europe entirely on sustainable power."
"That should be the subject of our debate today."
"Being for or against nuclear energy is a matter of political choice."
"We should not have to justify why we are against nuclear energy."
"Those who are in favour of nuclear energy are the ones who should come up with a justification."
"Hence, the importance of the stress test."
"I have two questions for you, Mr Oettinger, two important questions."
"First of all: how are we going to establish the criteria?"
"How are we going to ensure they are independent?"
"Secondly, what will happen if a nuclear power fails to pass the stress test?"
"What will be the consequences then?"
"(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, the events in Japan have affected all of us very profoundly."
"We pay tribute to the people who - at the risk of their lives - are dealing with the effects of three events which occurred together - the earthquake, the tsunami and the incident at the nuclear power plant."
"This tragedy has evoked great sympathy, and in so doing has also started the discussion we are currently witnessing in Europe on the future of nuclear energy and Europe's energy strategy."
"We recently adopted an energy strategy for Europe up to 2020."
"At the moment it is, in a way, being undermined, although in the strategy we do accept nuclear energy."
"We say there that it should simply be accompanied by stringent safety conditions."
"However, it is an acceptable part of the energy mix of a number of countries."
"It seems to me that this discussion should also enhance European cooperation on energy - and this is something we have asked for in our report."
"Today we not only have to improve safety conditions, we also have to strengthen the European Atomic Energy Community and move towards a European Energy Community."
"The European Commission must press for better cooperation between Member States and for Europeanisation of nuclear policy."
"Stress tests should not be voluntary - some countries will use them if they want to, while others will not."
"This must be part of building what is, after all, to be a common policy on nuclear energy."
"We should also support new technologies."
"Europe's entire energy strategy is based on decentralisation and diversification."
"Since this is the case, we should think about promoting small and medium-sized nuclear reactors."
"They cost less, are built as modules and as a result can be tested more easily in terms of safety."
"Perhaps this form will be more acceptable to public opinion, because we will not be able to eliminate this type of energy completely."
"(LT) Mr President, Japan has experienced the unimaginable impact of a natural disaster and a nuclear accident."
"The people of Lithuania are actively raising funds and trying in every way possible to contribute to aid for the country's victims."
"We remember and will always remember the painful consequences of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, which the people of this region continue to feel, even after three decades."
"The disaster in Japan is forcing us to fundamentally reconsider the issue of nuclear safety."
"We cannot control natural cataclysms, so we should at least ensure that natural disasters do not cause additional and particularly painful nuclear disasters."
"I agree with the review of existing infrastructure and the creation of new capabilities, but we must thoroughly analyse events at the Japanese nuclear power plant, particularly in light of the Chernobyl precedent."
"We must reach conclusions and adopt measures that would allow us to significantly strengthen nuclear safety throughout Europe."
"Mr President, my concern about the nuclear industry has been overshadowed by my concern about climate change and I now believe that nuclear has a role to play in helping us fight global warming."
"That was true before the incidents in Japan and it remains true now."
"There are obviously lessons to be learned."
"There are the problems of design, inadequate regulation, not enough independence and obviously: do not build nuclear reactors in earthquake zones."
"But we live in a world of hazards; our cities have chemical factories across the board, all of them present huge potential risks, but we manage those risks, we live with them."
"Over the decades we have had horrific train accidents; we do not close the railways as a result."
"We learn lessons; we apply them, and we improve safety."
"That is what we must do with the nuclear industry."
"(SL) Mr President, if we are serious about our climate targets, then nuclear energy will remain part of our energy mix."
"That is why our discussions must not be ideological."
"What we need, first of all, are answers to numerous questions, such as what was the main reason for the accident and how could it have been prevented?"
"Did the responsibility, implementation and supervision systems collapse?"
"Was the safety culture in one of the nuclear plants weak?"
"What are the options for storing spent nuclear fuel more safely?"
"Was the regulatory authority too weak to take timely action?, and so forth."
"We need answers to these questions, and then we will be able to take responsible political action."
"What does taking responsible political action actually mean?"
"We need to reach a social agreement on acceptable technologies, in particular on the role of nuclear power plants."
"We need to ensure the 'safety first' principle is implemented."
"We need to formulate a legislative framework, which would provide adequate financial and human resources for the safe operation of complex technologies."
"We need to facilitate the development of an excellent and independent nuclear profession, its continued training and the transfer of knowledge from older to younger generations."
"We need to assess the competence and independence of regulatory bodies which play a key role in ensuring the culture of safety, and we need to ensure safe disposal of highly radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel."
"Finally, I would like to mention the common safety criteria."
"Today, we all agree that we really need them, but remember 2009, when we discussed the nuclear safety directive."
"Even back then the European Parliament affirmed the common European criteria which the Council unfortunately did not affirm."
"At the time, the European Parliament proved it was taking the right action."
"Therefore, I think that it is high time that the European Parliament was given more powers in the field of nuclear energy and we ought to reach an inter-institutional agreement so that we can have codecision powers."
"(HU) Mr President, first, I would like to express my deep sympathy, second, my respect for the Japanese people and the Japanese nation, and third, my greatest admiration for and appreciation of the Japanese heroes who are working at this moment in the power station."
"A tragedy has happened which will be remembered forever in the history of Japan and the world."
"The disaster-stricken country has asked for the European Union's help in the preliminary coordination of the aid offered by Member States."
"The Commission's swift reaction was gratifying, as was the fact that it was confirmed by the Commissioner that every assistance would be given to Japan and the almost half a million people staying in temporary shelters following the devastating earthquake and tsunami."
"I firmly believe that everything must be done on top of this to avert the consequences of the disaster and rebuild living conditions."
"At the same time, however, I would like to voice the opinion that it is not fortunate to contrast this type of tragedy and similar tragedies with the use of nuclear power."
"Nevertheless, naturally, nuclear power plants must be equipped with the largest safety system, and must then be inspected continuously in accordance with the strictest regulations."
"The Commission's proposal to organise broad European consultation is to be welcomed."
"I also support, as I believe it is necessary, the Commission drawing up guidelines which lay the foundations for a well-functioning safety system coordinated at a European level and guarantee the continued safe production of nuclear energy in the future."
"The Japanese people's behaviour is exemplary and sets a precedent for us."
"I strongly believe that they deserve every support. Thank you, Mr President."
"(HU) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we are all a little Japanese."
"Even in the midst of the natural disaster we must admit that nuclear safety has a human face."
"Planning, construction, operation, dismantling and, like now in the Fukushima power plant, handling accidents are a trial of strength of human knowledge and dedication."
"The European stress test is an important step for us to plan what has been unimaginable until now for the future."
"Commissioner, we can best pay tribute to the Fukushima workers if European experts are involved in making European professional and policy decisions."
"Those nuclear workers should be involved whose dedication and knowledge are indispensable."
"It is very important that nuclear knowledge be maintained and extended in the medium term because this is the real guarantee of safety."
"Moreover, I would like to draw attention again to what Mrs Ulvskog said."
"Nuclear research and development must provide answers, better than at present, as to how we can handle nuclear waste and its ever-present 60-year history. Thank you for listening."
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to thank Commissioner Oettinger for taking such a serious-minded and responsible approach to this issue."
"We should consider whether the Western European Nuclear Regulators Association (WENRA) should be upgraded to the position of European regulator for the 27 Member States."
"We should think about whether the standards of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) should be made legally binding and whether this new regulator should be given the power to order an immediate shutdown if standards are not met."
"We should also consider reforming the Euratom Treaties, focusing on the safety and security regulations, as well as the issue of the coverage of the costs for decommissioning and final storage, which needs to be sorted out now."
"I believe this to be a sensitive subject."
"We must take this opportunity here in Europe to implement a peer review and to institute the latest standards so that the health of the population is not put at further risk."
"Mr President, of course I welcome the speedy assistance that we have given to the Japanese in their time of need, and I welcome and share the sympathy expressed with the Japanese."
"However, I cannot help but think that the sincerity of our comments on solidarity will be a little bit tempered by the action of some of our Member States."
"Reading our newspapers, I see that the Spanish Government has urged that goods from Japan be checked carefully for radiation; that the Netherlands Government has cautioned dock workers to handle all containers from Japan with care; that the French Government has called for the checking of all imports; and that the German authorities are demanding random checks on all goods imported from Japan including cars."
"These are goods which left Japan two or three weeks - and in some cases two or three months - before the earthquake."
"There is little expression of solidarity and sympathy in such action, and I would ask the Council and the Commission to try and speak to the Member States to say that, if they really want to express solidarity, they should not put out such scaremongering stories."
"Mr President, I am surprised that the Commissioner seems so optimistic about getting the situation in Fukushima under control in a few days when nuclear experts have talked about weeks and months; meanwhile the plant is still emitting radiation which is continuing to seep into the food supply and into the water supply."
"I welcome the call for stress tests but they do not answer the bigger questions."
"The question is: do we want to accept the rising risks of nuclear power in a world where complex natural disasters and extreme weather events are very much on the increase?"
"The safety of nuclear reactors simply cannot be fully guaranteed in the event of a large-scale disaster of any description where there are multiple levels of disruption, where you get cuts to electricity, to water supply, to communications and to physical access."
"That is the question: do we actually want to take this risk when we have other alternatives?"
"(PT) Mr President, we should like to express here our complete solidarity with the Japanese people, and we too offer our condolences to the victims of the disaster that has struck the country."
"We know that this disaster has triggered serious accidents in the Fukushima nuclear plant, the consequences of which still cannot be fully assessed."
"The accidents in this plant's reactors resulted from the combination of highly improbable factors, it is true; however, they did combine and potentially it could happen again in other nuclear plants."
"We must therefore learn important lessons from what is happening in Fukushima."
"There is an immediate need to review and, if necessary, adapt the redundancies in terms of the plants' safety systems, particularly with regard to the cooling systems."
"It is necessary to reassess the locations of existing nuclear plants, particularly according to the risk of earthquakes and the risk that a tsunami will occur."
"However, there is also a need to undertake a broad discussion as a society about the energy issue, our present and future needs, and how these can be met, tackling in a lucid and informed way the risks, impacts, potential and limitations of the various sources of energy."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to express my solidarity with the Japanese people who have been so hard hit by the catastrophe."
"It was a surprise to find that Japanese technology had not kept pace with events that constantly recur in those areas."
"Having kept a technologically obsolete nuclear power plant in operation is certainly not a matter of minor importance and these things should make us reflect on the European nuclear energy programme."
"We cannot allow ourselves to fall prey to fear and make hasty choices today: we need a general agreement on making existing nuclear plants safe and screening those that are under construction."
"Europe can not refrain from helping the Japanese people, not only due to the emergency, but also due to the probable financial crisis linked to the terrible catastrophic event."
"In the short run, steps must be taken to deal with an economic slowdown in Tokyo and with the likely consequences for the countries most closely linked to Japan."
"We should not forget that the government was already weak before the disaster and without a majority in the Upper House, meaning a crisis of the executive could be in the offing."
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to begin by expressing my sympathies to all those affected by this devastating situation."
"The tragic accident in Japan has led to a nuclear disaster that is now familiar to us all. Europe has reacted in a relatively swift and united manner, although there is an awareness, which is hopefully shared by all those who support nuclear technology, that radioactivity knows no national borders and that nature does not recognise safety standards, however high they may be set."
"We have witnessed Chernobyl - a failed so-called stress test - and now we have Fukushima."
"The time has come for those who favour nuclear power to place the wellbeing and health of human beings and the natural environment above all financial interests."
"We should consider a Europe-wide phase-out and promote renewable energies."
"(HU) Mr President, the tsunami after the earthquake in Japan was the direct cause of the accident at the nuclear power plant, which became above all a question of safety for both the profession and the public."
"This is why the correct decision was made to subject our functioning nuclear power plants to rigorous testing."
"It has become clear that we need a comprehensive, thorough debate in order to reach a rational decision concerning the future of nuclear energy."
"We must also be aware that, after a terrible tragedy of this nature, people will become more afraid, and this is precisely why we must make sure that objective and genuine information is given and safety measures are tightened."
"However, I would like to emphasise that nuclear power plants in Europe are subject to entirely different environmental factors than those in Japan."
"Europe is not threatened by the danger of either tsunamis or such a powerful earthquake, hence direct conclusions should not be drawn from this unfortunate tragedy."
"Our facilities are prepared for the potential impacts on them, and nuclear energy can remain an integral part of our energy resources in the future as well."
"Finally, I would like to express my sympathy and esteem for our Japanese friends. Thank you."
"Member of the Commission. - (DE) Mr President, honourable Members, I have listened attentively to your contributions and would like to thank you for the objectivity you have displayed, both in relation to the disaster and its consequences."
"We have heard expressions of solidarity and sympathy, as well as offers of help."
"There is nothing further to add to that."
"This encourages us in the work to be done by the Council Presidency and the Commission."
"The general issue at stake here is disaster response."
"If we consider Haiti and Pakistan and the host of other recent natural disasters, then I believe that the Commission's communication on an improved European disaster response, which was approved by the Council in December of last year, points the way ahead."
"We need to improve cooperation within the framework of disaster response procedures at a European level and must dedicate appropriate financial and human resources to this, as well as coordinating efforts at European level."
"I have no doubt that Mrs Georgieva will bring some concrete proposals to Parliament and the Council during the course of the year."
"When it comes to energy policy in Europe and the lessons to be drawn from the new information arriving from Japan, I believe that we need to start by taking an honest look at the facts and realities."
"Let me take the example of the German Government and its coalition parties, reminding you that I am a member of one of these parties."
"Our government has announced a significant change of direction."
"Seven nuclear power stations have currently been taken offline in Germany."
"This action has been criticised for 'not showing much credibility' or for being a 'typical display of German angst'."
"I believe we need to remember that respect for different positions should be the starting point for deliberations."
"I wish to express my respect for Parliament, which a few years ago gave its clear backing to the permanent use of nuclear power in the European energy mix, but which has doubtless begun to reconsider this position ."
"Secondly, I wish to express my respect for the EU's regulatory powers."
"I have re-read the Euratom Treaty very carefully and have also looked closely at the Nuclear Safety Directive adopted by the Council and Parliament in June two years ago."
"The second document makes many formal recommendations about the authorities to be established, information and reporting obligations and other points, but offers hardly any specific, material recommendations for construction or operating techniques, or even the most general specifications."
"If Parliament proposes extending European legislation today, I am quite prepared not to wait for the reports from the Member States in 2014 before submitting a report to the Commission, but to insist that this Directive should become national law by July of this year at the latest - this would be incumbent upon the Member States - so that it will be possible, as further information is gathered from Japan and from the comprehensive stress tests, to discuss a proposal from the Commission for further specific, material requirements for nuclear safety here in Brussels over the next year rather than later."
"It has been said that I need to 'act decisively'."
"I would disagree, however."
"I will take a consistent approach to this issue in asking what competences European legislators have and have not given me."
"When, even in the current climate, I hear criticism from some national governments for an over-dramatic assessment of the situation and the lessons to be learned from it, while others say it is high time I took decisive action, then I prefer to take a middle course."
"I have always felt comfortable on the middle ground."
"When you are criticised by both sides, then perhaps you are actually getting things right."
"Many of Europe's 143 nuclear power stations will still be online in ten years' time and, unless present governments have a change of heart, many, though not all, will still be operating in the following decade too."
"Consequently, it is in all our interests to insist on the highest safety levels, new standards and a further reduction of risks for those nuclear power stations remaining in operation in the medium to long term."
"Secondly, I assume that new nuclear power plants will be built in Europe under the aegis of the Member States, their national parliaments and governments."
"If we consider the referendum to be held in Italy in June, then we can see what is coming down the line and I note that with the exception of Germany, none of the thirteen Member States who operate nuclear power plants have changed their policy on this issue."
"I have been closely monitoring the debates at national governmental and parliamentary level and in the media"
"We need to understand that, although this is a European issue, there is also a global dimension."
"It is in all our interests to ensure that the highest standards apply not only in our own territories, but also throughout the world, as, after all, nuclear power will be in use around the world for decades to come."
"It is for this reason that I welcome ..."
"(Heckling)"
"Mr Turmes, I really am trying hard to remain calm and objective here."
"I suggest you do the same."
"When you tell me not to trust Mr Sarkozy, I can only say that I have every confidence that he will table this point for discussion at the G-20 summit."
"This is a major success in itself: the issue will be discussed in a forum attended by the Americans, the Chinese, the Russians and others who already operate nuclear power plants, are planning to build new plants or have authorised major industrial concerns to build nuclear power plants in their countries."
"That is why I believe that the reassessment of risks and higher safety standards are essential, irrespective of whether one is for or against nuclear energy, because nuclear power is going to remain part of our global future."
"(Heckling)"
"This is not the time to go back over the ground covered in the debates of two years ago."
"I am not the right person to deal with on that score."
"You are welcome to make your views known when others come to speak."
"I do not believe that you are addressing this issue to the right office holder."
"Let me turn to the question of the Energy Roadmap 2050 and the criticism we have heard that this does not sufficiently promote and fund renewable energy sources."
"In this case you are underestimating the power of your own resolutions, although we seek to monitor and guarantee compliance with such decisions."
"20% renewable energy sources in just nine years actually corresponds to 35% in the crucial area of electricity generation, which is where these sustainable sources are primarily deployed."
"We are well on the way to generating 35% of electricity from renewable energy sources - and the Member States are playing their part - while renewable energy sources are set to overtake nuclear power and coal in electricity generation in four to five years."
"This means that we are on the way to making renewable energy sources the most important sources for electricity in Europe."
"We will present our concepts and scenarios for the Energy Roadmap 2050 in late spring."
"However, there are other significant dates besides 2050, which might seem far off - there are also interim targets for 2025 and 2030, in other words for the period that requires investment in infrastructure and production capacities right now."
"I do not want to make concrete commitments here at this point, but by 2030 we will certainly have gone beyond 35% renewable energy sources, reaching a figure of over 40%, or even 60%, or somewhere in between."
"If this does prove to be the case, then nobody will be able to argue that renewable energy sources did not receive sufficient backing; renewable energy sources will play a decisive part in the energy mix within our lifetime."
"(Interruption by Mrs Harms)"
"Mrs Harms, I am talking about the Energy Roadmap, while you are referring to the CO2 Roadmap."
"These are two different issues."
"We have not lowered the targets for 2020."
"They are unchanged - a 20% standalone target and 30% if other countries follow suit."
"This has always been the position of Parliament, the Council and the Commission and this is the global offer on the table."
"There have been no changes."
"What we are talking about here is 'renewable energy sources' and that is where we shall achieve over 40%."
"We have therefore created a basis for ensuring that the energy mix is no longer just a matter for the Member States, but that the Member States share 50% of the responsibility, or a little more."
"Secondly, we have also set down requirements for establishing subsidy principles and for how the financial and technical resources are to be set up in the Member States with our cooperation."
"You can rest assured, Mr Turmes, that the scenarios will seriously examine something that has been proposed by various bodies, namely a move to up to 100% renewable energy sources."
"However, then you need to take a look at the legislation, specifically Article 194, which states that the energy mix is a matter for the Member States."
"I do not regard the Treaty of Lisbon as set in stone."
"It does, however, provide the parameters for my activities, setting down the rights of the Member States."
"These rights are jealously guarded, whether in Berlin, Luxembourg, Paris or London."
"I have one final point to make."
"I listened very carefully to what Mr Davies and Mr Hall had to say."
"They both belong to the same party."
"They both come from the same Member State."
"Yet, as we have heard, they have diametrically opposed positions."
"I respect that."
"When a small party in a large country can accommodate such divergent opinion as expressed by these two honourable Members and when the same party was opposed to nuclear energy in its country before the election but can accept it now that the election has taken place, then I respect this nonetheless."
"However, this goes to show the ecological, economic and political dimension of this issue, which is why we shall always have disagreement."
"Part of the process is always global in nature."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (HU) Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, I promise that I will be brief."
"Sympathy and a cool head are, I believe, the two things which should guide our actions now."
"Through sympathy we can help the Japanese with all they need; we can listen to them and take action where they, too, see a need, and a cool head is required in order to make the right decisions in good time about our own future."
"We should not decide on an issue of such importance under the influence of events."
"One thing that is certain, and no one in this Chamber has disputed this today, is that we must strive to achieve maximum safety with all our strength."
"It is our duty, moreover, to fully inform citizens in order that they understand what is under discussion, and when, about what and how we decide."
"It is very important that we draw conclusions and learn lessons."
"We should examine the events without being either tardy or jumping the gun and making statements which in a couple of weeks' or months' time may not stand their ground."
"As regards stress tests, I would simply point out that now, based on the current regulation, there is a voluntary option for these."
"Several of you have mentioned amending the legal bases, the frameworks which are in force today, which I firmly believe that the European Council would not exclude."
"This needs to be elaborated and an appropriate proposal tabled."
"There is no need to hurry but naturally the work must start."
"Commissioner Oettinger also pointed out that the energy mix is a national competence."
"Every Member State makes a sovereign decision about which forms of energy it uses to cover its energy needs."
"Half the Member States, half in terms of scale, use nuclear energy."
"When we have the appropriate legal basis, we will be able to impose a safety obligation on anyone, but the option and responsibility to choose lies with the Member States."
"In any event I welcome with pleasure that the Commission, as Commissioner Oettinger mentioned, will be able to prepare the report by July 2011."
"As a final thought, we talk a lot about research and development, which is also a cornerstone of the Europe 2020 Strategy."
"It is our task to create the best possible conditions for research and development in the European Union."
"Indeed, we still have much to do in this area."
"With the aid of research and development we should find the safest possible and most environmentally friendly forms of energy production."
"Let us make science serve people and the maximum safety of people. Thank you very much, Mr President."
"I have received one motion for resolution1 tabled in accordance with Rule 110(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow (Thursday, 24 March 2011)."
"Written Statements (Rule 149)"
"in writing. - (HU) First of all, permit me to express my profound condolences to the Japanese people and the relatives of the victims in connection with the exceptional natural and industrial disaster which happened barely 12 days ago."
"The Japanese tragedy reminds us that natural and industrial disasters can occur anywhere at any time, even in Europe, too."
"The question is merely when and where they will happen."
"This is precisely why I believe it is important for the European Union, in the event of a potential industrial disaster in Europe, to have at its disposal an adequate financial facility to intervene immediately and effectively, and to alleviate damages."
"Naturally, the EU efforts aimed at prevention are very important, but at present the European Union does not have a financial facility that can satisfy the aforementioned need."
"We only have to imagine what would happen if a disaster struck a Member State in a difficult financial situation."
"Apart from the shocking social and environmental consequences, this would gravely affect the budget of such a country and the European economy as well."
"In my view for this reason Europe needs a new disaster insurance scheme which, based on the principle of mandatory liability insurance, would provide additional funds in the region of EUR 4 to 5 billion per annum from payments by potential polluters in order to extend swift financial aid in the event of industrial disasters."
"Furthermore, the payers may also be the beneficiaries of the scheme as a result of the support they could claim through tendering for safety and environmental protection investments from the unused funds."
"in writing. - (IT) The growing demand for energy requires diversification in the supply of alternative energy sources to oil, such as renewable solar, wind and nuclear energy sources."
"In my view, the production of energy from nuclear sources is not an argument that should be discussed with feelings running as high as they are at present."
"I am afraid, in fact, that the usual opponents of nuclear power, often financed by oil companies, will try to exploit events in Japan to promote Italy's energy dependence on oil and its by-products."
"More than 8 000 people in Italy and more than 350 000 in Europe die each year because of pollution caused by burning oil by-products."
"Moreover, as regards the identification of possible sites in the area, I stress that this choice is aided by technical and scientific guidelines produced by experts that will put administrators in a position to make the most appropriate choices to ensure public safety and environmental sustainability."
"I hope that discussions about alternative energy sources to oil can be addressed with objectivity, ensuring European citizens adequate and accurate information in order to prevent easy manipulation, making us even more dependent on unstable oil-producing countries."
"in writing. - (RO) I share the sentiments of my fellow Members who have expressed their condolences to Japan and the Japanese people in the wake of the tragedy they are going through."
"The EU must support Japan with all the capacity it can muster in launching and running the reconstruction programmes."
"I have closely followed the debate, but I must say that I cannot agree with turning such a tragedy into a crusade against nuclear energy."
"This is a cheap, green source of energy and technological progress will make it increasingly safe."
"A plane crash, for example, is similarly tragic, but I do not believe that this provides sufficient reason for us to have doubts about the benefit and safety of planes."
"The correct solution is: yes to stress tests, yes to supervision and no to demonising nuclear energy."
"in writing. - Madam President, I would like to convey my sincerest condolences to the people of Japan, who have suffered from a terrible natural disaster during past weeks."
"Japan is being provided with assistance from the European Union, as well as from the Member States."
"The European Union will continue with any kind of assistance that the Japanese government regards appropriate to help them get through this terrible crisis."
"However, the nuclear power plant alerts in Fukushima have provoked an emotional debate over the use of nuclear energy in the European Union in general."
"I would advise everyone to consider their positions dispassionately and keep in mind that the use of automobiles was not forbidden when an Irish scientist, Mary Ward, was thrown out of, and run over by, her cousin's steam car on 31 August 1869."
"Instead we should learn our lesson and increase investments both into nuclear safety and innovative research."
"Fossil fuel resources are exhaustible and renewable energy is still very much experimental."
"Nuclear energy, on the other hand, could hold the key to our future."
"If the first cavemen had been afraid of fire, we would still be living in the Stone Age."
"in writing. - (CS) First and foremost, I would like to join all those who have expressed sympathy for the people of Japan, stricken by the destructive earthquake and the tsunami."
"This natural disaster has taken the lives of thousands of people, which is an appalling loss."
"It has deprived further tens of thousands of their homes, personal items and belongings, dramatically changing their lives for years to come."
"We must not forget this, even though the media are concentrating instead on the nuclear energy issues."
"The problems of the damaged Fukushima plant almost overshadow everything else."
"However, I would like to say - in connection with the alarmist scenarios - that the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki still constitute the greatest ever nuclear catastrophe."
"The greatest threat to humanity is the military nuclear arsenal."
"It is expanding, despite the many good intentions, and it lacks the permanent and thorough public control that we see with nuclear power plants."
"Moreover, after the events in Japan, safety requirements and standards will surely be further enhanced."
"We must therefore stick to a sensible position, avoiding any hasty or even hysterical reactions to the events in Japan."
"There is currently no alternative to nuclear energy, which provides us with much-needed, accessible and emission-free power."
"I am pleased that the Czech Republic, Finland, France and others are taking a realistic approach to the issue."
"This is in contrast to countries where nuclear energy has become a pawn in pre-election battles to an extent that is almost unethical, bearing in mind the situation in Japan."
"I would like to comment on the situation in Japan."
"Humanitarian aid for Japan is an obvious and necessary reaction of the European Union in response to the tragic catastrophe which has hit the country."
"I think Japan and the affected regions should be given all necessary aid (technical, administrative and organisational) as well as financial support."
"Besides emergency aid, we should also consider developing a model of systematic cooperation with all countries which are at risk from various types of disaster, including countries which are not part of the European Union."
"I would like to ask the services of the Commission and the Council which are responsible for this area to review the relevant legislation and make proposals for enhancing exchange of effective practices in the field of crisis management."
"Increasing numbers of countries, including those of the European Union, are suffering more and more often as a result of natural disasters."
"Therefore it is essential to have permanent and highly developed international cooperation."
"It is also important to conduct a review of existing legal and regulatory frameworks for the safety and protection of nuclear installations."
"In this connection I would like to draw attention in particular to two things: monitoring of full transposition of the directive on the safety of nuclear installations and adoption of a directive on radioactive waste."
"in writing. - (IT) Following the earthquake on 11 March, the consequences of the crisis in Japan for nuclear safety and the global economy have shaken the European Union, which is already grappling with instability in North Africa."
"I welcome the decisions taken at the special meeting of energy ministers, held in order to examine the implications of the accident at the plant in Fukushima, and trust in the determination of Member States to carry out stress testing of nuclear power plants in the European Union to be extended to non-European countries, and especially neighbouring countries."
"In this context, and giving due importance to the nuclear moratorium decision taken by some Member States, and the fact that public consultations on energy development are imminent, it is important that the Commission should report on the safety situation in European nuclear power plants that could affect neighbouring regions of Member States if an incident occurred."
"in writing. - (EL) I too wish to express my condolences and support for the people of Japan suffering from the disaster wreaked by the massive earthquake and tsunami, which claimed thousands of lives and left considerable damage in its wake."
"Of course, science and technology have done the most to help make the usual important structures safe and, of course, we have very strict rules to reduce their vulnerability; however, the recent massive earthquake and catastrophic tsunami which followed, claiming thousands of lives and causing destruction on a biblical scale, and the very serious damage to the nuclear reactors in Fukushima are such that we need to review and change the prevailing opinion of the safety of nuclear plants."
"They must be located and designed on the basis of criteria every bit as extreme as the natural phenomena to which they may be exposed."
"Scientists estimate, with a high degree of probability, that strong earthquakes may well occur in the medium and long term."
"Politicians should not therefore, under any circumstances, plan nuclear plants in active earthquake zones."
"There are modern, viable, smart and efficient ways for countries in earthquake zones to satisfy their energy balance."
"Otherwise, it would appear that human life is being used to counterbalance the energy problem."
"First, I should like to offer my condolences to the Japanese people on behalf of Jobbik, the Movement for a Better Hungary, and the whole Hungarian people."
"Hungarians have always regarded the Japanese with cousinly affection, which makes the disaster particularly shocking."
"It is the European Union's duty to help the people of Japan, and all the assistance Japan requires must be given."
"At the same time, the consequences of this disaster must be drawn, which clearly show for mankind that the globalised world estranged from nature is extremely fragile."
"There is a Hungarian proverb which says that a wise man learns from other people's misfortunes."
"The nations of Europe must learn from this disaster, and, returning as far as possible to nature, to natural foodstuffs and to natural energy resources, protect our environment for future generations."
"in writing. - (LT) Firstly, I would like to offer the Japanese people my sympathy following the earthquake and tsunami that have struck the country and claimed many lives."
"Given the tragic disaster at Fukushima nuclear power plant that followed the earthquake and tsunami, I would call on Europe to consider the future of nuclear energy and look for other alternative means of producing energy."
"Furthermore, our assessments of the impact of the disaster must be based on information and expertise provided by specialists and experts, and we must view new means of producing electricity from a scientific perspective."
"The events in Japan should be a worry for all Member States, regardless of whether or not their countries have nuclear power plants, because if similar disasters occurred, radiation would threaten the whole of Europe."
"At present Russian and Belarusian intentions to build nuclear power plants are a major cause for concern for the countries of Eastern Europe, in particular the Baltic States."
"The impact of radiation from these planned nuclear power plants is an even greater worry and there is concern about neighbouring countries complying with international safety requirements."
"I would like to stress that immediately after the disaster in Japan, Germany shut down its own reactors built before 1980."
"The Member of the European Commission responsible for Energy also maintains that Europe should strive for a future without nuclear power plants."
"Therefore, once we have assessed the potential radiation threat to Europe, here in the European Parliament we should discuss the risk of nuclear power plants near the European Union's external borders."
"The devastating earthquake and tsunami which struck Japan and the Pacific region on 11 March 2011, taking a toll of thousands of innocent lives, was a tragedy which has moved us all."
"It is our duty to convey expressions of profound solidarity with the Japanese people and government and to offer our condolences, and it is also our duty to extend humanitarian, technical and financial aid."
"I am pleased that the European Union provided this essential support almost immediately, using its best rescue teams and its experience in the field of disaster mitigation."
"This aid must be given continuously until the situation in Japan stabilises."
"In view of the disturbing fact that the disaster caused an extremely serious nuclear accident, which is affecting the Fukushima nuclear power station and constitutes a fresh threat to life and health, we should review and test the safety of nuclear power plants within the EU."
"Despite the fact that the accident at the Fukushima power station is a warning to us, I do not think it should cause us to panic or be prejudiced against nuclear energy."
"Japan has very often helped European nations in mitigating the effects of disasters, using its extensive and valuable experience in this area."
"The time has come when we have to take up this important role."
"I am certain that such cooperation will not only bring benefits in the form of emergency aid for the victims, but will also strengthen our relations with such an important friend as Japan."
"in writing. - We should not only focus on nuclear safety within the EU, but also look at its immediate neighbourhood."
"Two new projects for nuclear power plants with experimental reactors are being developed on the edges of the EU: one in Kaliningrad and another located in Belarus, 23 km from the EU's external border and 50 km from Lithuania's capital city."
"Both sites were selected on unknown criteria."
"The lack of transparency in the process, flawed consultations and failure to share information with the affected countries make both projects a cause for serious concern."
"Work has already started, although the international environmental impact assessments of both plants are far from complete."
"Moreover, immediately after the tragedy in Japan, Russia and Belarus signed an agreement giving a green light to build the plant in Belarus."
"Data from the Chernobyl and Fukushima tragedies show that the area of immediate radioactive impact is 50-55 km."
"In the event of an accident, the capital of an EU Member State would be immediately affected."
"The EU should demand that these third countries take their responsibilities seriously and carefully observe international obligations and standards for nuclear energy."
"I hope the upcoming European Council will agree to take the appropriate decisions."
"Establishment of a joint EU resettlement programme (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on"
"the oral question to the Council on establishment of a joint EU resettlement programme by Rui Tavares, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group - B7-0205/2011),"
"the oral question to the Council on establishment of a joint EU resettlement programme for refugees by Nadja Hirsch, Sophia in 't Veld, Sonia Alfano, Nathalie Griesbeck, on behalf of the ALDE Group - B7-0206/2011),"
"the oral question to the Council on establishment of a joint EU resettlement programme by Manfred Weber, Simon Busuttil, Georgios Papanikolaou, on behalf of the PPE Group - B7-0208/2011)."
"Mr President, refugees are probably the most vulnerable populations in the world and, of them, the most vulnerable of the vulnerable are those who can neither return home nor stay in the countries of transit."
"The United Nations High Commission for Refugees puts a figure on that population: 200 000 refugees per year."
"We know that half this number are resettled by the United States and other players, and we know that Europe does too little: 4 500 per year."
"We all agree, therefore, that the tragedy of the refugees is urgent and important."
"How important is it?"
"The Council itself has already answered this question."
"The Swedish Presidency talked about resettling 100 000 per year and the Belgian Presidency, at the end of its own term said - we had Prime Minister Yves Leterme here -that refugees were the image of the European Union's very raison d'être."
"Excuse me for saying so, but refugees are important for the Hungarian Presidency for historical reasons because it was for Hungary, in 1956, that the first concerted effort was made by the international community to resettle thousands of refugees."
"In the end, however, how urgent is the tragedy of the refugees?"
"Unfortunately, it is this question that we are forced to ask the Council."
"How much of a priority are refugees for the Council?"
"Are they urgent enough to finally put a signature, to finally add a signature to a piece of paper?"
"A year ago, Parliament voted in favour of two reports, one of which was a co-decision on the European Refugee Fund."
"The vast majority of us united behind what was important: from the Greek Communists to the British Conservatives."
"We did our homework."
"A year later we are still waiting for the Council."
"The co-decision process has transformed into a co-indecision process."
"This co-indecision process would be ridiculous if it were not so tragic for the people on the ground."
"The report that we adopted included emergency measures to be applied in addition to the Commission's annual priorities."
"We did this because we know that a humanitarian crisis can erupt at any time."
"One has just erupted in North Africa, on our doorstep, and we do not have these emergency measures ready to be implemented."
"We do not have them because the Council has unfortunately not finished this co-decision."
"Moreover, from the first day that it was completed, we would have, in addition to these emergency procedures, extra money for countries wishing to start carrying out resettlement, and clear categories for priorities to be used by the Member States."
"We would also have everything that we put into the own-initiative report: quality, speed and the creation of a resettlement unit in the European Asylum Support Office."
"Members of the Council, you - I am finishing here, Mr President - are co-legislators."
"It is not for us to tell the Council how to legislate, but this desk-drawer veto helps no one, especially the institutions' credibility."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, the resettlement programme is something that we worked extremely intensively on, investing a lot of energy, across all group divides and allegiances."
"We were unanimous in wanting to send out a clear signal on this matter."
"We also made it our top priority simply because it is such an important issue: people's lives are at stake."
"Nonetheless, the situation and ongoing developments in North Africa mean that we are called on once again to produce results in double-quick time."
"We have already lost one year."
"We have made the best use of the time available to provoke a civil and social debate because, in the final analysis, we also need the support of the Member States, regional authorities and the local population if such a programme is to become established in the new Member States, too."
"This discussion and the social consensus that has gradually resulted cannot be abandoned just because the Council and other key players are unable to agree and have reached an impasse."
"The issue is too important."
"We have instigated this debate and, true to our liberal credentials, our aim is to make this matter a genuine priority."
"I believe that we have agreement across all the groups in Parliament."
"We have signalled our position and now await a clear course to be set by the Council so that the issue will be placed on the agenda and that the other Member States that have so far not played an active role will now be encouraged to get involved."
"The feedback that we have received during our discussions indicates that these Member States are willing to come on board."
"For this reason, the main concern on the part of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe - although I believe I can speak for all the groups involved because the level of cooperation was really excellent - is that this matter should be given priority and the debate that we have engendered on a broad social level should be encouraged, rather than jeopardised by continuously the matter being continuously put on the long finger."
"Mr President, following on from what my fellow members said, I too should like to add that, first of all, Minister, almost a year after the resolutions passed by this Parliament, in which a great deal of effort was invested, a mission was sent to Syria for that very reason and we tried to galvanise as many Member States as possible into becoming involved in the refugee resettlement programme; yet, despite all that, we have still done nothing."
"Even if there are formal problems on the part of the Council and Parliament also needs to be involved, we are here to find solutions."
"That is our purpose."
"We refer to the humanitarian dimension of this programme, but we also refer to the instrument provided to Europe, so that it can exercise its foreign policy even more effectively."
"Would this instrument not be a very important tool today in Baroness Ashton's hands, if she were in North Africa and could refer to the programme we had decided on?"
"Obviously we refer to global needs."
"However, we do need, of course, to understand that the problem now lies at our door."
"Europe is being called upon to play a leading role in the Mediterranean."
"We need to start up this programme, Minister, and push ahead with it and we need to understand, when debating budgetary resources post-2013, that there are resources for this programme up to 2013 and, if we waste any more time, we shall no longer be able to utilise those resources and facilities."
"To close, may I remind you, Minister, of the proposal we made back then and to which we in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) keep reverting, namely the refugee reallocation programme."
"We cannot afford to wait for yet another Lampedusa, Minister, before we understand how necessary this initiative is and that we need to push full steam ahead with it."

"President-in-Office of the Council. - (HU) Mr President, honourable Members, the European Parliament addressed three questions related to the resettlement of refugees to the European Council."
"I would like to thank the three questioners very much for presenting in detail the considerations which led them to formulating the questions."
"All three questions were related to the Commission's proposal which intends to amend the decision establishing the European Refugee Fund for the period 2008 to 2013 with regard to the establishment of a joint European Union resettlement programme."
"I believe that this debate also demonstrates the deep concern of the European Parliament for the fate of people who are most in need."
"Therefore, first, I would like to thank the honourable Members for paying such very close attention to resolving the situation of the refugees."
"As Mr Tavares remarked as well, coming from Hungary, with its inheritance of the 1956 revolution and as a commitment to that, the Hungarian Presidency has a moral obligation to achieve progress in the area of the joint European Union resettlement programme."
"The North African crisis, which several of you have referred to, has shown the need to establish a well-functioning, unified European asylum system."
"I agree with the European Parliament's position that the European Union must accept responsibility in resolving the situation of refugees if it wishes to preserve its leading role in the provision of humanitarian aid."
"Allow to me to give you the very latest information on how the refugee situation on the borders of Libya is developing at this moment."
"I visited the Tunisian-Libyan border at the beginning of March."
"At that time one thousand refugees were arriving every hour, most of them migrant workers for whom finding a way home, a means of repatriation, was the most burning issue."
"Of them all, the people in the most difficult situation were those who arrived without any papers or documents at all."
"The international aid organisations on the spot were looking after them."
"Their number was growing; their repatriation, as such, is irresolvable, and therefore in this instance the resettlement system certainly comes into consideration."
"Today, or rather yesterday and today, the Hungarian Foreign Minister János Martonyi has been on the other side, on the Libyan-Egyptian border."
"The primary purpose of his visit was to learn about the refugee situation."
"He went to the border and met Egyptian officials there."
"The situation there, on this section, has changed now."
"For three days there has been no outflow from Libya on that section of the border."
"At present, there are about 200 people who should be able to take part in the resettlement programme."
"The others who have arrived until now are being evacuated, that is to say assisted in returning home, by the Egyptian authorities, incidentally with the help of EU Member States."
"By the way, Mr Martonyi has also held talks with the Foreign Minister of the Benghazi Transitional National Council, as well as the Egyptian Interior Minister precisely to gain an overview of the refugee situation."
"As regards a common European asylum policy, I would like to emphasise that we will do our utmost in order to create a common policy and system which is based on the full application of the 1951 Geneva Refugee Convention relating to the status of refugees and other relevant international conventions, and is in accordance with the commitments undertaken in the Stockholm Programme by the European Council."
"The Hungarian Presidency is committed to advancing the proposals in the refugee package."
"This is also shown by the fact that, based on last week's authorisation granted by the Member States, we are ready to start informal trialogues on the Asylum Qualification Directive as soon as possible in order to achieve the target date of 2012."
"I thank you once again for the January debate which I presided over on this subject."
"Then, too, I replied to MEPs' questions."
"I would also like to stress that the Council, as it acknowledges the importance of resettlement as a lasting solution for refugees, welcomed the proposal for a decision on establishing a joint EU resettlement programme and the related Commission announcement, which the Commission submitted back in September 2009."
"These initiatives stemmed from the agreement which the European Council reached in connection with the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum in September 2008, namely, that the resettlement of persons under the protection of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to the territory of the European Union could proceed for the time being on a voluntary basis."
"As a concrete example, I would highlight the conclusions of the Council in July and November 2008 in which the EU Member States made a commitment to resettle Iraqi refugees in their territory or rather this is what we encouraged them to do in these conclusions."
"In September 2009, the Council started the detailed examination of the proposal to amend the decision on establishing the European Refugee Fund."
"In the first half of 2010, informal meetings were held with the European Parliament on several occasions."
