"(RO) I sincerely thank the Commissioner for the answer he gave."
"In a global index indicating vulnerability to food price rises, out of the 40 countries occupying the top places in the index four are Member States of the European Union."
"I do not doubt the Commissioner's best intentions regarding the budget, but to what extent will the future budget be able to meet both the food demands and the new environmental ambitions?"
"Mr President, the fight against climate change is a major challenge for Europe, and more efforts in research and innovation will be needed in order to develop a society whose carbon emissions are low and which is resilient to climate change."
"At the moment, there is no single specialist body operating in these areas, nor is there a specific incentive such as the annual climate innovation award that has been mentioned."
"Nevertheless, many efforts have been made to achieve a coordinated approach among the Union's various policies and programmes."
"The Europe 2020 Strategy and its flagship initiative, the 'Innovation Union', have been adopted in order to bring the European economy out of the crisis and to confront the social challenges that exist."
"Investment in research and innovation - including new technologies such as eco-innovation, for example - is at the heart of this strategy, and new financial instruments are being planned with the aim of obtaining a substantial increase in private investment and establishing sustainable and long-term growth."
"As part of the Innovation Union, a pilot European Innovation Partnership has been proposed with the aim of covering the whole of the innovation chain, from research and development onwards, in order to guarantee that adequate conditions are in place to bring the results of research and development successfully to the market."
"Other European Innovation Partnerships could be proposed later."
"Secondly, the Commission's Green Paper entitled 'From Challenges to Opportunities: Towards a Common Strategic Framework for EU Research and Innovation Funding' proposes important improvements to the research and innovation programme which will form part of the next EU multiannual financial framework."
"Firstly, the idea is to link research and innovation by bringing together all the relevant European Union instruments into a common strategic framework allowing for the introduction of genuinely cross-cutting strategies that cover the entire range of innovation systems, from research to technological development, demonstration and the market."
"There is, in addition, a proposal to link European Union financing with the major challenges that society faces, such as climate change."
"The aim would be to use European Union financing as a lever to obtain more private investment, for example in the field of innovation in green technologies."
"Finally, the Green Paper poses the question of how European Union financing would be used to support small and medium-sized enterprises as well."
"The Commission has asked the parties involved to submit contributions on the topic of the Green Paper before 20 May 2011."
"Subsequently the Commission will present its legislative proposals for the future financing of this European Union of research and innovation towards the end of this year."
"(EL) Thank you, Commissioner, for your reply."
"I should like to ask you, in connection with your sector, with agriculture, how you imagine innovation might help, when applied to the agro-foodstuff production chain, not only in combating climate change, but also in addressing and preventing the adverse impact that we all know we shall have on rural life."
"Member of the Commission. - The question addressed to the Commission actually implies the diagnosis of the real state of the economy in Europe, as well as the prescription."
"I can share to some extent both the diagnosis and the prescription."
"Yes, we are in a Europe of austerity, meaning socially painful savings, politically costly and economically necessary, but challenging to some extent for the very fragile recovery of the European economy."
"The European Commission is a strong supporter of fiscal consolidation as a precondition for sustainable growth, but we are more than ever conscious of the sensitivity of the economic debate now being discussed as the 'relaunch versus austerity' problem, and this was discussed even today in the College."
"When you take the long run and when you read the 2020 Strategy, this is clear, as it is with the relaunch of the Single Market strategy, but this is about the unlocking of the potential of the European economy."
"The European budget should be the answer right now as we need growth and jobs right now."
"This is because of the specific nature of the European budget, with its focus on investment."
"The national budgets are mainly about social transfers; the European budget is mainly about investment and therefore could have a multiplying effect on jobs and growth and when we see the proposal for 2012, what is growing, with competitiveness, is cohesion, that is structural funding, and research and development; the other category of growing expenses is on migration."
"So this type of expenditure is conducive to growth and jobs."
"In the long run the same should be valid for the proposal we are to reveal at the end of June for the next financial perspective, adding a lot on top of what I have mentioned relating to the energy and trans-European infrastructure generally that is also conducive to growth and jobs."
"Therefore I can say that the European budget, due to its nature, could be the delivery mechanism in a time of austerity to replace the investment cut normally at the national level."
"Therefore we should exploit this potential of the European budget to its limits."
"(EL) Thank you, Commissioner, for your reply."
"I do not know if the Commission is currently discussing recent press reports about the Greek debt, with talk about secret meetings, debt restructuring, new loans and the possibility of Greece's leaving the euro."
"At the same time, we are living with the drastic effects of the Memorandum."
"Without sustainable growth, the debt will not be paid off and the economy will not improve."
"My question is this: what measures are you proposing, right now, in connection with the budget, in order to help countries which have been hit by the crisis, such as Greece?"
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I will try to do my best to keep my answers short."
"The Lisbon Treaty provides for the setting up of a European voluntary humanitarian aid corps with the objective of establishing a framework for joint contributions from young Europeans to the humanitarian aid operations of the Union."
"Last year, 2010, we reviewed the existing situation of volunteering, through bilateral meetings, surveys and a dedicated conference in September 2010."
"As a result, on 23 September we adopted the communication setting up a phased approach for the corps."
"The first stocktaking phase allowed us to identify current gaps, needs and conditions for the voluntary corps to make a positive contribution to EU humanitarian assistance."
"This year, 2011, the main activity is to further develop the approach, including a public stakeholder consultation with results to be made available by the end of this month, May 2011."
"Secondly, a preparatory action which allows the Commission to finance pilot projects aimed at selecting, training and deploying a limited number of volunteers in view of the adoption of a legislative proposal."
"Third, we will carry out a full impact assessment which will inform us about the potential economic and social impacts of the voluntary corps."
"The results of these activities will feed into a proposal for a regulation which will be tabled in 2012."
"The results of the public stakeholder consultation, as well as the selected pilot projects, will be presented at the dedicated conference organised in June 2011, this year in Budapest under the auspices of the Hungarian Presidency."
"Member of the Commission. - Since the beginning of the Libyan crisis, the European Union has shouldered its responsibilities to alleviate the suffering of the civilian population by providing timely and significant humanitarian assistance."
"To date, the Commission has allocated EUR 50 million - EUR 40 million from our humanitarian aid budget and EUR 10 million from the civil protection budget line - while the 27 Member States have collectively contributed EUR 52 million, bringing the total amount of EU humanitarian assistance to EUR 102 million."
"We are by far the leaders in addressing the needs of people in Libya."
"Our humanitarian funding supports activities implemented by partners, UN agencies, the Red Cross and Red Crescent, and NGOs."
"Our activities address both pressing needs inside Libya and the needs of people who have been fleeing Libya."
"As of today, 740 000 Muslim migrant workers have left the country in search of safety."
"Inside Libya, our activities include the evacuation by sea of about 2000 civilians from Misrata, the provision of food, water, sanitation and medical supplies in Misrata and other areas of Libya, and provisional materials for food, as we expect the food situation to worsen in the next four to six weeks."
"In border areas outside Libya, the Commission is supporting the pre-positioning of emergency stocks."
"We are also supporting operations in Tunisia, Egypt and Algeria for people who have left Libya."
"The EU civil protection mechanism has been activated twice: firstly to support Member States' consular operations to evacuate our citizens - 5800 Europeans have been evacuated -, and secondly to facilitate the return home of migrant workers stuck in Tunisia and Egypt."
"We have provided 157 flights from Member States with support from the Commission, and we have also funded the repatriation of third country nationals through the International Organisation for Migration."
"In total, over 56 000 people safely made it home."
"This, of course, also helps to reduce the risk of a wave of migrants into Europe."
"Despite the ongoing fighting and its spread to various parts of Libya, humanitarian organisations are doing a remarkable job in preventing a major humanitarian disaster."
"At this point, our main concern remains that, in large parts of Libya controlled by Gaddafi, access for these humanitarian workers is limited."
"I want to assure you that the Commission will continue its efforts to help people affected by this conflict."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, thank you very much for your dedication in this matter."
"I would like to emphasise this in the strongest terms."
"I would just like to ask the following question: either yesterday or today the United Nations requested a ceasefire so that humanitarian needs could be tended to."
"Is humanitarian aid actually reaching the majority of Libya's population and what percentage of the country or population do you estimate is inaccessible to the aid agencies?"
"Commissioner, in the light of Parliament resolutions and the Council conclusions of last December, could you give us your assessment of the progress that has been made since the 2006 Barnier report in setting up a really coherent rapid reaction or disaster response mechanism: one that draws together humanitarian, civil protection and military assets and that has a pre-identified pool of resources from Member States rather than an ad hoc approach?"
"Are we getting our act together?"
"Can you reassure us?"
"Member of the Commission. - The European Union is one of the major donors of food assistance."
"The Commission has been committed to providing leadership in ensuring that the most vulnerable people in crisis have access to safe, adequate and nutritious food."
"The Commission does not implement aid operations itself."
"It provides funding to partner organisations - the UN agencies, international NGOs, the Red Cross family - or partners who have vast experience in carrying out aid operations among the most vulnerable people."
"Our implementing partners have the authority to decide what the most appropriate food assistance needs are in any specific circumstance."
"We encourage them to purchase food locally as much as possible."
"Why?"
"Because, by doing so, they provide useful assistance to local farmers and we do not end up feeding the people yet, at the same time, killing the livelihoods of the local farmers by providing our own food."
"The Commission is always validating these choices and making sure that factors, such as the availability and nutritious quality of commodities, dietary habits of the local populations, availability of cooking facilities and cost considerations, including transportation costs, are taken into account."
"On that basis the exact composition of our food assistance will be determined."
"Obviously canned food has its advantages, including canned fish, because it can hold for a prolonged period of time and is therefore suitable for managing stocks."
"It also has some disadvantages, which are sometimes related to costs or dietary habits in local populations."
"So we always have to be sure that what we are doing is helping people in the most effective way."
"Thank you for your reply, Commissioner, which I believe."
"In your speeches you have mentioned nutrition on a number of occasions and in fact canned fish tick all of the boxes: they are low in value, high in protein, with no necessity for refrigerated transport or for cold storage facilities when they arrive, and, of course, they have a long shelf life."
"And when it comes to cooking, the fish are already cooked."
"I am thinking in particular of mackerel and herring."
"What I am saying to you is, could you use your offices to at least suggest the use of canned fish?"
"We are the people who are funding this and I would like to have an opportunity to meet with somebody from your DG to discuss this, because I come from an area where there is an abundance of fish but there is no other type of job."
"We should try to help our own people and by the same token help others."
"Member of the Commission. - The point you are making is very valid."
"We need to look at high nutritional value and also simplicity of use."
"At the same time, what I would like to caution against is expanding the intervention of the Commission in deciding up front what exactly should be the composition of food assistance in any given circumstance."
"We have taken a very important leadership role in the European Union with regard to food assistance by untying our food assistance or, in other words, not making it a requirement that European food assistance includes food produced in Europe."
"Sometimes agricultural surpluses from Europe are used in food assistance."
"We do require that food provided to people in any circumstance is the most appropriate for the particular circumstances."
"And why do we do that?"
"When we untie our food aid, this allows our partner organisations to purchase food locally and provides an incentive for local farmers."
"We do not end up bringing food from Europe, killing the livelihoods of local farmers and then giving them development assistance and actually bringing even more food because we have been unwise in our approach to food assistance."
"I can assure you that, globally, what Europe has done in this respect is seen as the right thing to do and we are applauded by people in developing countries and by our development partners for taking this approach to food assistance."
"Having said that, we also support prepositioning of food, in which case canned fish is very appropriate."
"I can assure you that we strive to do the right thing."
"When it is the right thing we of course encourage it to be done."
"You are very welcome to visit our services - we are always very happy to interact with the European Parliament."
"Baroness Ludford, you have had your answer."
"Do you want to press me for a supplementary?"
"Is that what it is?"
"You have had the answer to your question."
"Yes, indeed!"
"The Council conclusions of last December talked about various Commission proposals during 2011."
"I cannot claim to be a specialist in this area but they have not hit the headlines and I wondered whether any have been made."
"This is going back to proposals that have been made in the past, including by colleagues in my political group, for an EU fast-track organisation."
"The Parliament called for a European civil protection force, with the idea of having some kind of permanent body so that we would not have to keep relying on this hand-to-mouth exercise; we would set up the mechanisms so that we could go into action very quickly."
"I know you said we have made progress, but are we getting to the really ideal situation?"
"Member of the Commission. - Both agriculture and forestry can, of course, play an important role in achieving the EU's climate objectives, and non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture are actually included in the EU's Effort Sharing Mechanism, but emissions and removals of CO2 related to land use, land-use change and forestry (what we call LULUCF) are not part of the current reduction commitment as adopted back in the 2008 in the climate and energy package."
"However, as part of the package, the Commission was requested by the European Council and Parliament to assess modalities for their inclusion in the EU reduction commitment by mid-2011, and to make a legislative proposal as appropriate."
"So the Commission plans to publish the relevant communication this summer, i.e. in a very short time from now."
"Inclusion could strengthen the environmental integrity of our climate commitments, ensuring that all emissions and removals are covered, while enhancing the visibility of efforts by farmers and foresters to increase sinks through sustainable land-use management."
"The current CAP includes instruments that address climate change, mainly through the multiple co-benefits between agri-environmental policies and climate action."
"Pillar one provides income support to farmers who have to respect cross-compliance - a concept that includes baseline obligations, some of which are relevant to climate action."
"Rural development policy in pillar two makes more targeted climate-change measures available to Member States."
"The 2008 Health Check reconfirmed climate change as one of the major challenges to be addressed, and already measures in relation to forestry - for example, afforestation - can be supported under the rural development policy."
"A reformed CAP with a greener first pillar, introducing non-contractual and annual environmental actions that go beyond cross-compliance, and a second pillar more focused on climate action, supported by a professional farm advisory service, could be tailored towards helping farmers to manage their land-use systems so as to contribute to climate action (mitigation), and also become less vulnerable to climate change (adaptation)."
"That is definitely what we intend to achieve through the next CAP."
"(GA) I want to thank the Commissioner."
"It is clear that her policy is going in the right direction."
"In terms of the state of agriculture in the economy of my own country, it is clearly very important indeed."
"For example, in 2010 the net transfer from the EU to Ireland's agricultural budget was estimated at EUR 978.3 million."
"It is clear that farmers are willing to work with you, in terms of climate change and other things like that, but they must receive compensation and money if we want to achieve that kind of cooperation."
"It is clear that they are willing to cooperate but, at the same time, they can not do so without compensation, without economics, without money."
"Member of the Commission. - The European Union has for a long time been a promoter of gender equality."
"In support of this, the Commission has a well-established practice for widespread consultation both within and outside the Commission."
"In particular, the consultation of all Commission departments allows for consideration of gender equality aspects of all legislative proposals and other initiatives, including in relation to climate change."
"The Commission recognises the serious social impact upon women of climate change, as well as the important role of women in combating climate change."
"The Commission, back in October 2009, called for there to be a platform for women to make their voices heard, in particular as agents in the fight against climate change."
"In addition to this, the Commission is working closely with Member States and the EU Presidencies for the development of indicators for the follow-up at EU level of the 12 areas of concern of the so-called Beijing Platform for Action."
"In this respect, in the strategy for equality between women and men 2010-2015, the Commission has designated the development of indicators in the area of women and the environment among the priorities of the future work of the European Gender Equality Institute."
"We also understand that in the first half of next year, the Danish Presidency wishes to develop indicators in this field with a particular focus on climate change."
"A report is to be prepared by the European Gender Equality Institute and specific conclusions could be adopted by the Council on this issue towards the end of the Danish Presidency semester."
"So climate change and women is very much on the agenda."
"Thank you for your comprehensive answer."
"A couple of years ago the Commission announced that the main security threat now is climate change and that mankind has approximately 10 years in which to make the changes reversible."
"I personally am of the opinion that the economic crisis, revolutions in North Africa and now Fukushima have distracted attention from the fight against climate change."
"Do you have this impression as well?"
"Member of the Commission. - The Commission has actually already responded to similar written questions from the honourable Member Mr Ziobro on the cost of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union by 2020 and on the question of carbon leakage, back in March and April 2010."
"The EU has managed to decouple its economic growth from its emissions."
"EU GDP has increased by 45% since 1990 while emissions have been reduced by 13%, and that includes 2010 figures, meaning that was after we exited the crisis."
"Over the same period, the European Union manufacturing industry grew by more than 30%."
"These figures show that continued growth can go hand in hand with reducing emissions."
"For instance, it is actually estimated that, between 2005 and 2009, 550 000 new jobs were provided by the renewable energy industry alone."
"Firstly, with regard to carbon leakage, the Commission would like to stress that in the latest amendment of the ETS Directive the European Parliament and the Council have decided to tackle this issue by allocating a higher share of free allowances for sectors and subsectors deemed to be at a significant risk of carbon leakage."
"The Commission's analysis published back in May last year confirmed that free allocation is an effective means to address the potential risk of carbon leakage."
"Moreover, the risks for carbon leakage have been reduced further, since now more than 80 countries, amongst which all emerging economies, are implementing the pledges they committed to in Copenhagen and are implementing their domestic targets."
"I must say that the Commission has no evidence that companies are moving their production outside the EU due to climate policy."
"Secondly, the European Commission has assessed in detail the costs and benefits of CO2 emission reductions on the European economy in the framework of the Climate and Energy package agreed back in 2008."
"More recent analysis conducted in 2010 shows that the costs of meeting the 20% greenhouse gas reduction target have fallen by at least one third compared to the analysis made in 2008."
"Now they are estimated at EUR 48 billion, which represents 0.32% of the projected 2020 GDP."
"Having said that, it should also be mentioned that some of these investments will come back in, for instance, saved oil expenditure."
"In developing the climate and energy package, the Commission has taken due account of the different circumstances in the Member States in terms of economic development, wealth and energy mix."
"In addition, the climate and energy package contains three specific mechanisms to balance overall costs across Member States, so that efforts are shared in a fair and equitable manner."
"(PL) Mr President, thank you very much for having been so kind as to include my question."
"In view of the fact that we are running very late, however, I will limit myself to one consideration, if I may."
"I will happily pass on information to the Commissioner regarding companies which are deciding to transfer production outside EU Member States due to the constraints associated with reduced CO2 emissions."
"In my opinion, if I present you with these concrete facts then the Commission will also be persuaded to analyse the negative consequences this process has for the European Union economies."
"In view of the fact that CO2 emissions know no borders, and that after production is transferred emissions will continue, which will unavoidably have a negative impact on the environment, the European Union economy will lose out, since it is exporting jobs."
"Member of the Commission. - We all agree with that, of course."
"That is also the reason why, through the benchmark system, we have ensured that the sectors most exposed to carbon leakage will get almost all of their allowances for free."
"But let me correct just one misunderstanding: I think we should be very careful in the European Union and not believe that others are doing nothing."
"Last week, I came back from Korea."
"They are also introducing carbon trading now; they are finding out exactly how to do it."
"They will start it on 1 January 2015."
"China is carrying out huge pilot projects on carbon trading."
"They want to make it a national system in the very near future."
"They are also introducing environmental taxes, and so on and so forth."
"I could cite a lot of economies that we are competing with who have now realised that they also have to conduct ambitious environment policies, energy policies and climate policies."
"They have also realised that, if they do this intelligently, it will benefit their economies in the end."
"Questions which have not been answered for lack of time will receive written answers (see Annex)."
"That concludes Question Time."
"(The sitting was suspended at 20.20 and resumed at 21.00)"
"Textile names and related labelling of textile products (debate)"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading by Mr Manders on behalf of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection on the Council position at first reading with a view to the adoption of a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on textile fibre names and related labelling and marking of fibre composition of textile products and repealing Council Directive 73/44/EEC, Directive 96/73/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and Directive 2008/121/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (13807/4/2010 - C7-0017/2011 -."
"rapporteur. - (NL) Mr President, I want to thank everyone and, in particular, all the shadow rapporteurs for the excellent cooperation we have experienced."
"I want to thank the Commission for the way in which we have worked together."
"I also want to thank the Council, because I believe that, thanks to the Hungarian Presidency, we have broken the impasse on this particular issue."
"What I am particularly happy about is the fact that this is a regulation and not a directive."
"I take the view that regulations are the right tool for completing the Internal Market, which is, incidentally, what Professor Monti also clearly demonstrated in his research."
"We are producing too much legislation that is implemented at various levels, and because of that the Internal Market is failing to function as it should."
"I am happy that this issue is being discussed in this case and I note that we have, indeed, improved a number of things on that score."
"The proposal was dealt with by the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection."
"In the original proposal, there was, in fact, hardly any mention of the consumer; we, as politicians, understood that we also have to protect the interests of the consumer in this report, as, indeed, we have done."
"There are several important considerations and here I am thinking, in particular, of research into allergic reactions."
"The Commission has indicated that it is prepared to carry out a study of these important issues."
"It will present the study by 30 September 2013 at the latest and incorporate the positive results from the study into additional legislation."
"The Council has stated that it would be willing to help think things through, if the result is positive and attainable."
"Let us consider allergic reactions and chemical substances - we are witnessing increasing numbers of consumers developing allergic reactions when wearing certain clothes or eating, smelling or inhaling certain products."
"We believe it is necessary to examine the possibility of warning consumers of such potential allergic reactions."
"Very often, deceptive trade practices are also going on."
"In fact, they have been prohibited in the European Union since 2005, but we can see that there is too little clarity about the country of manufacture when it comes to made-in labels."
"There is too little legislation available, which means that it is quite often abused."
"We have also asked the Commission to examine the possibility of laying down clear laws and conditions, in order to ensure that manufacturers who claim a particular product was manufactured in, say, the Netherlands, Italy or Germany can guarantee that that really is the case."
"We do not want situations where 99% of a product is made in China and only the finishing jobs are carried out in one of the Member States of the European Union, but the lovely 'Made in Europe' label is still attached to it."
"This would also cover counterfeiting, for example."
"What I am particularly pleased about is the fact that we are opening the door to modern technologies, that we are not sticking with simple old-fashioned textile labels in textile products and that we are actually going to look into the possibility of using modern technologies in order to provide the consumer with the best possible information."
"The Council has already directly agreed to labels indicating whether garments contain animal products, because it is becoming more and more difficult to work out whether a piece of fur is real or fake, and there are a great number of consumers for whom that kind of information is important."
"The upcoming study by the European Commission is particularly intended to eliminate barriers to the proper functioning of the Internal Market and to anticipate developments in the area of electronic commerce."
"Because, if we want there to be more e-commerce, then we have to ensure there are European standards for labelling."
"I hope this study will lead to clarity on this."
"It also seems to me that, in the modern world, we no longer need to put 23 languages on a label, because modern technologies can provide improved solutions to this problem."
"I hope that the Council's statement tomorrow will be a positive one and that it will assure us of a positive result, and I wish to thank everyone who has contributed to that positive result."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (HU) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Manders, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great achievement that a second-reading agreement has been reached on the proposal concerning a regulation on the naming of textile fibres and the related labelling of textile products."
"This would not have been possible without the close cooperation of the three institutions."
"Allow me to convey the appreciation of the Council to the European Parliament for the excellent cooperation."
"I would like to thank especially the rapporteur, Mr Toine Manders and his colleagues for the highly valuable work they have contributed to this process."
"I also appreciate the work of the Swedish, Spanish and Belgian Presidencies, because the current result is due to their work of superior quality."
"The Commission has been a very constructive and cooperative partner throughout the whole period, and thanks are due to them as well."
"If all proceeds as planned, the Council will be able to adopt the text of the regulation in early autumn, and therefore the legislation will be applicable from 2012."
"This regulation will significantly contribute to the operation of the Internal Market, and will strengthen competition in this important sector."
"The simplification and development of the present regulatory framework for the development and application of new textile fibres will motivate innovation in the textile and clothing industries."
"Users of the fibres as well as consumers will be able to enjoy the benefits of the new and innovative products sooner."
"The Hungarian Presidency believes that the regulation will provide greater legal certainty for economic operators, and will improve consumer protection on the Internal Market."
"As a result of the provision on revision the co-legislators can make informed decisions because the Commission will conduct an in-depth survey on further compulsory labelling requirements."
"These may include handling instructions, standardisation of sizes, indication of country of origin and allergens, electronic labelling and other new technologies."
"In their draft joint declaration, the European Parliament and the Council emphasise that they attribute particular importance to the traceability of textile products and the use of new technologies."
"We hope that the Commission will pay special attention to these issues in its report."
"Until then, this piece of legislation will allow rapid authorisation of new textile fibres."
"The regulation states that the label must include the accurate fibre make-up, but it also introduces a new labelling requirement concerning non-textile parts of animal origin. As Mr Manders has indicated, as a result consumers can make much more informed decisions."
"Furthermore, the fact the legal instrument was created in the form of a regulation will improve legal certainty in this field."
"Congratulations, once again, and thank you for your attention."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank the rapporteur, Mr Manders, together with all the other shadow rapporteurs and the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO) for their work towards reaching an agreement after difficult negotiations."
"I believe it is crucial to reach an agreement at second reading because it will allow citizens and businesses to benefit more quickly from new fibres and innovative products resulting from it, and national governments will be able to reduce costs."
"Once again I thank the House for contributing to the interinstitutional debate through the amendments presented, some of which have given particular emphasis to the political dimension and consumer interest in this issue."
"In fact, at the first reading of this report when it was adopted by Parliament with a large majority, it was stressed that we need to launch a broad debate on the labelling of textile products, including the issue of origin marking and we proposed to extend the scope of the regulation to certain sectors."
"As you all know, the negotiations with the Council in the following months called for flexibility from all sides to identify workable solutions for the institutions."
"I believe that the agreed text is a balanced compromise that incorporates many of the amendments presented by Parliament and leaves room for further developments in the near future, which - as Mrs Győri pointed out during her speech - is very important."
"In the short term, or as soon as the new regulation comes into force, consumers will have more information about the presence of non-textile parts of animal origin and will also have access to information on the full composition of textile products."
"Another immediate result of the new regulation is simplification, since the Commission will turn a detailed technical attachment of more than 50 pages into harmonised European standards."
"However, even more importantly, the immediate results of this regulation are not the last stage of the process."
"On the contrary, they are a starting point for further analysis and for improving the legislation."
"In fact, in the short term the new regulation provides a comprehensive review clause which invites the Commission to set out, where necessary, further labelling requirements in this area."
"The Commission will then make suitable legislative proposals in the areas which require greater harmonisation."
"It is my intention - and I hereby take on the commitment before Parliament - to deal with this review both immediately and thoroughly."
"We are already preparing for the task of consulting consumers on some fundamental questions, namely: what kind of information is important and how should it be made available; in what way should technological developments, such as electronic commerce, affect the purchase of textile products; to what extent does the growing need for traceability, sustainability and corporate social responsibility influence the textile fibre market; how can we make better use of available technology in the digital age; how can we, as institutions of the European Union, adapt our laws to the growing needs of citizens regarding ethical, social and environmental issues."
"Mr President, these are just a few of the topics on which work has already started."
"As you can imagine, origin marking will undoubtedly be one of the priorities and core elements of our work."
"The review will therefore provide an opportunity to reaffirm my support for origin marking and clarify this issue once and for all, as it is an essential instrument for the competitiveness of European companies and the health of EU citizens."
"We will examine this matter in depth in order to provide clear rules, prevent misleading information and facilitate responsible choices by consumers when purchasing textile products."
"As stated by the rapporteur, Mr Manders, the Commission will also evaluate the link between allergies and chemicals used in textile products."
"Specific analysis in this field will be able to indicate the best way to use existing legislation, such as REACH."
"Let me explain briefly: through the use of origin marking, buyers will be sure they are buying a textile product that is not harmful to their health nor that of their children because the labelling will comply with all the rules of this important regulation which, at the cost of significant sacrifices, European institutions have imposed on all industries in this sector."
"The review clause - and again I thank the Council for having stressed its importance and declared their willingness to work with the Commission immediately to transpose the regulation - requires the Commission to submit a report, possibly followed by a legislative proposal, by 30 September 2013."
"I am determined to cut down the time required and have already instructed my staff to start work."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have finally reached an agreement on this important dossier, thanks to a great effort from everyone to find common ground between the divergent positions of Parliament and the Council."
"My goal was, is and will be to ensure that binding rules are adopted on textile product origins, since consumers and businesses must absolutely be protected."
"I believe that the compromise reached today is a very good result."
"I urged my fellow Members to fight the Council, and I use the word 'fight' with good reason, because negotiations have not been at all easy."
"We fought not only to achieve origin markings but also for traceability."
"The latter represents a key piece of information for the consumer before a product is purchased."
"Today, European consumers find textile products labelled 'Made in Italy', 'Made in Germany' or 'Made in France', when in fact they have been almost entirely produced elsewhere."
"We also ask for new labelling technologies, such as microchips and Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID), to be used in order to combat product counterfeiting."
"It is true that we have expanded the scope of the proposal for a regulation because we believe that the textile sector urgently needs greater protection."
"The joint declaration to be adopted by Parliament and the Council shows the importance of traceability and origin marking."
"I do not hide the fact that the Council's volte-face makes me confident for the future."
"We await with great interest the study requested from the Commission, whom we thank once again for their cooperation, and I thank the Mr Tajani sincerely for having just committed himself to reducing the timescales involved, because the textile industry is in urgent need."
"We cannot leave unheeded our citizens' need for truthful product information."
"After all, we are all consumers and reaching this objective is in everyone's interest."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to say a very big thank you for the excellent compromise that we have reached."
"The rapporteur, Mr Manders, in particular has done some sterling work and he ensured that we experienced truly excellent cooperation here in the European Parliament."
"We have come a long way since the Commission tabled its original proposal."
"It was a mainly technical proposal and it was one that only contained benefits for businesses."
"Fortunately, however, by working on the proposal here in the European Parliament, we succeeded in incorporating elements that make this legislation beneficial for consumers, too."
"I believe that this is absolutely crucial."
"As a result, we will have better labelling and a higher level of safety for consumers once we have finally implemented this legislation."
"The most important aspect for me and for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament was to ensure that the textiles that are sold on the Internal Market do not cause health problems."
"We are therefore very pleased that the requirement for there to be no residues of hazardous substances in our textiles that could give rise to allergies was successfully voted through - and, as the Commissioner has just said, that we are to have a study carried out to ensure that this is the case."
"This is absolutely vital and it is something that we in the S&D Group are very pleased about."
"We also agree that traceability and origin are extremely important, and this is also the type of information that consumers are very keen to have."
"Personally, I also hope that we can achieve a little bit more than this and that we might also be able to have harmonised clothes sizes and use new technologies in our labelling of textiles in the future."
"I do think that we have achieved a great deal, however."
"It should be a lesson for us that, when we lay down legislation here in the EU, it is important for it to benefit both businesses and consumers at the same time."
"That is the best way to ensure that we have a well-functioning Internal Market."
"I would like to finish by expressing my sincere thanks once again to all my fellow Members for their outstanding cooperation."
"I think we have achieved a very good result."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (RO) Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate our rapporteur Toine Manders for the fine job he has done and for the perseverance he has shown in the negotiations with the Council on this proposal for a regulation."
"I welcome the agreement which has been reached with the Council at second reading."
"I believe that this is an agreement which, although it can be improved, will boost the competitiveness of the textile industry, while at the same time providing consumers with better information."
"This agreement has a large number of positive points."
"Firstly, the procedure for including new fibres in Annex I has been simplified."
"This will help reduce the administrative costs for the textile industry and allow this money to be reallocated to innovation."
"This measure will also benefit consumers as innovation is encouraged."
"I also think that this regulation will offer benefits to consumers due to the labelling requirements."
"Providing consumers with sufficient information so that they can make an enlightened choice is a completely natural step."
"The discussions about the labelling have lasted longer than the Commission initially proposed."
"However, I think that this can only benefit European consumers."
"I agree that we need more time to evaluate the impact of some additional labelling requirements, especially regarding origin, the care treatment method and the introduction of a harmonised size labelling system."
"This is why the study carried out by the Commission marks a first step forward."
"Finally, I believe that the labelling requirement for non-textile parts of animal origin is a sign of real progress as it is consumers who do not want the textile products they buy to contain such materials."
"I think that, as a whole, this regulation will help deepen the single market for textiles, a move which I fully endorse."
"Mr President, simplifying the binding legal framework in respect of the labelling of textile products is intended to encourage the development of new textiles and their introduction onto the market."
"The proposal we will vote on tomorrow differs significantly from that put forward by the European Commission, which mainly consisted in technical changes simplifying legislation already in force."
"The original aim of the report was to speed up the procedure for registering the names of new textiles, in order to provide effective support for innovation in the European textile and clothing industry, while at the same time making it possible for consumers to benefit more rapidly from modern products."
"Despite the fact that work on the simplification of procedures has slowed down during the more than two years spent on this dossier, I would note that Parliament proposed extending the original scope of the regulation, in particular to include provisions concerning the country of origin of textile products, so I am glad that a balanced compromise has been reached."
"I would point out, however, that my group decided to approve the proposal in its initial version, which provides rapid benefits for business and consumers."
"We proposed right from the start that work on these issues should not take place in the context of the technical report."
"The Commission will therefore be asked to carry out a more in-depth analysis of the issue of mandatory 'made in' labels for textile products manufactured outside the EU, and by 2013 it will produce a report on the possible launch of a system for country-of-origin labelling for products."
"This report may be accompanied by a legislative proposal."
"The compromise between Parliament and the Council also guarantees that labels on clothing products will provide information regarding the use of materials of animal origin."
"If work is to be carried out in future on new opportunities for informing consumers about textile products, for example Europe-wide size harmonisation or RFID technology, let us remember to take a pragmatic approach, in line with consumers' expectations and what industry can achieve."
"Mr President, we say that consumer power is important, and if we are serious about this we clearly must also give consumers the opportunity to use their power."
"We must ensure that they have adequate product information etc. to be able to make wise and informed choices."
"I would therefore like to thank our rapporteur, Mr Manders, in particular for his persistence and commitment to ensure that the report includes the consumer perspective."
"I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, who have shown a great deal of commitment to increasing consumer power."
"As shadow rapporteur, I have tabled an amendment on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left concerning origin labelling, mandatory labelling of animal products and ethical and environmental labelling."
"It has not all been included, but I am very pleased with the compromise that we now have and I would like to express my support for it."
"There is a lack of information when it comes to chemicals and various products used in textile manufacture."
"The Commission has promised to carry out a study of this, and I would simply like to emphasise how very important it is that we have such a study done in order to be able to protect public health and combat allergies, among other things, in which we have seen a significant increase."
"We need to be able to see, and, where present, substantiate the connections that exist."
"I am also pleased that parts of textile products of animal origin are also to be labelled, and I wanted to use my speaking time to say thank you to everyone for their excellent work to increase consumer power. Thank you."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the measure in question is designed to replace three obsolete directives and relates to the labelling of textile products entering the European Union and the registration and naming of the substances they are made of."
"A text was adopted at first reading which called for labels to indicate the place of origin as well as a complete and mandatory list of the product's composition."
"Unfortunately, the Council's position appears to contradict the text approved by Parliament since, in particular, it is against any reference to origin marking and the introduction of traceability in textile product labelling."
"Just to get the measure approved at the second reading, the Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO) Committee has agreed to a text which does not satisfy us because it does not provide for origin marking."
"We will therefore vote against it, because the aim of providing consumers with correct and accurate information about the origin and composition of the product has not been met."
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, through this new regulation on textile product labelling, which we will vote on in plenary tomorrow, Europe will reach an objective it has been pursuing for years."
"However, it can only be considered a first step towards comprehensive legislation to protect all European consumers by indicating the country of origin and adopting a new and accurate traceability mechanism."
"I welcome the invitation to the European Commission to draft a legislative proposal for the adoption of new, more accurate and complete labelling systems."
"These will offer greater information about the characteristics and origins of textile products imported from third countries and sold in the European Union, thereby protecting consumers from false, improper and deceptive claims of origin."
"I hope it will encourage innovation in textiles and clothing, making it easier for consumers to benefit from innovative products."
"The proposal also supports the European manufacturing industry and guarantees its business in the global context."
"Finally, through these measures Parliament is sending the governments of the Member States a positive message in order that they will consent to the introduction of textile product traceability."
"This will provide consumers with more comprehensive and truthful information than under current legislation on origin marking and avoid them being misled."
"We now need the regulations on textile product labelling to be extended to all other market sectors, thereby coordinating the various legislative proposals and insisting that the fibres and textiles proposal, as well as the general origin marking regulation approved in Strasbourg last October, are adopted the Council in short order."
"As Mr Tajani has already emphasised, the deadline of 30 September 2013 is too distant."
"We are therefore relying on his stated commitment to bring it forward."
"(ES) Mr President, I should like to start my speech by congratulating all those who have made it possible to reach an agreement."
"It is a report that we should all welcome because it affects the day-to-day lives of all members of the public, but, in the constructive spirit characteristic of me, I should like to point out a few things."
"To begin with, I should like to draw attention to the importance of providing consumers with information that is precise and relevant, but above all comprehensible and uniform, regarding the components of textile products: exhaustive information is useless if the public is then unable to decipher it."
"We have achieved a step forward that is necessary but not enough: we must make further progress and protect the most vulnerable members of the public."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is essential to establish a European size labelling system based on body measurements, because the first thing we look for when we go to buy clothes is the size."
"We must therefore be much more ambitious and seek the harmonisation of sizes."
"(SV) Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Manders and offer particular praise for the fact that the request that parts made of animal fur be identified has now been included."
"Labelling is good for consumers, as we all know. We also know how important it is to have freedom of choice, and in order for consumers to be able to make considered choices it is necessary to have good information that is truthful and easy to understand."
"In this regard, I have a problem with origin labelling."
"Modern products are often made up of textiles and parts from different countries and it is almost impossible to correctly label an item of clothing with its origin."
"Mr Manders touched on this himself: where do we draw the line, what should we label and how much should come from a particular country?"
"In the modern global world, origin labelling could be a way of enabling consumers to be well-informed and to make the right choices."
"However, it could also be a sign of hidden protectionism, and sometimes when I hear these speeches I feel that I can both hear and see this."
"It is open borders and free trade that has made Europe rich and Europe's consumers know that. Thank you."
"(DA) Mr President, the textile industry is a global industry."
"The clothes that we wear have often been around the world before they end up with the EU's consumers as finished products."
"This report is comprehensive, thorough and very technical."
"Finding the right balance between competitiveness, consumers' right to information and the possibility of traceability at global level is difficult."
"Consumers have a right to know what chemical substances were used in the manufacture of a product, where the raw materials come from and other relevant information. However, how do we find the balance between an endless declaration in the collar of an item of clothing and a small label that simply says that the clothing should not be washed?"
"Labelling must be unambiguous and provide clear information to enable citizens to make their choice according to their own conceptions."
"This compromise is a step in the right direction."
"However, the study by the Commission will not be carried out until 2013."
"This study is to form the basis for how consumers, via the labelling, can obtain 'accurate information on the country of origin and additional information ensuring full traceability of textile products'."
"I hope that this basis will translate into a sensible and useable piece of legislation."
"2013 is still a long way off, so I am pleased that the Commissioner wishes to bring forward the date for legislation that will provide full information for consumers."
"Thank you Commissioner."
"The European Conservatives and Reformists will vote in favour of the proposal."
"(FR) Mr President, in 2005 the abolition of textile quotas left the doors of the Union wide open to all kinds of dumping."
"That was disastrous for employment and the environment, and, despite appearances, it is disastrous in the long term for consumer health."
"It is high time that we introduced measures aiming to protect and develop jobs and to promote know-how among textile employees, as well as consumer health."
"Even though we wanted to go further, we are approving the proposals that have been submitted to us concerning origin labelling, the study on hazardous substances and the mandatory marking of the fibre composition of textiles."
"We must still make sure that we have the resources to implement this protection and information in all the Member States and to take action against offenders."
"Yes, we must make sure that we have the resources to combat counterfeiting - at the borders of the Union, for example, but also in the very heart of the Single Market."
"This is a question of political will."
"It has to be said that, unfortunately, more resources are being put into tracking down Tunisians at the French-Italian border than into combating the sale of counterfeits."
"If we consider that fact, then, it is clearly better to be a commodity than a human being in Europe."
"We must change this."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, while thanking the President of the Commission and Mr Tajani for their efforts, we of Lega Nord must say that we are completely and utterly dissatisfied."
"This debate seems surreal to me."
"It is a con, a downright con."
"Some excited left-wing Members are suggesting that we agree on uniform sizing, while we do not know the origin of the goods worn by consumers. So much for free market!"
"I would like the surreal debate of this Tuesday evening - which was held in a half-empty Parliament - to be heard by a few thousand of the manufacturers that survived the crisis in the sector."
"I understand the logic of compromise, but the current text destroys the one which resulted from the first reading and was voted for by an overwhelming majority."
"It was a balanced text that took account of the needs of both producers and consumers."
"Since then it has been a complete fiasco: if I am not mistaken only two out of the 27 Member States have asked that the consumer be informed of the composition of garments, and the Hungarian Presidency of the Council has ignored this fact."
"Is this not yet another demonstration that Europe is light years away from the interests of citizens, be they producers or consumers?"
"(HU) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Győri, please let me divide the topic of labelling textile products into two important issues."
"The first important issue is that it is necessary to indicate where, which country a textile product originates from."
"The other important issue is of course that the materials the textile product is made of should also be indicated accurately."
"A single system of regulations is of course beneficial in both cases."
"If we take a look at the first issue, namely, the origin of products, it makes sense to begin with the cliché that there is an ongoing crisis in the European Union that is due mainly to the fact that production industries, for example the textile industry, were outsourced to different countries in the Far East for easy and quick profits, and therefore production in the European Union has declined."
"We have to find the breakout points that will help the European Union overcome the crisis."
"The textile industry is especially such a sector, along with, for example, agriculture, machine production or tourism."
"European manufacturers are at a marked disadvantage in the textile industry, because the dumping of cheap and poor quality products from the Far East makes it impossible for European manufacturers to make progress."
"Country of origin must be indicated, and I would definitely support even the indication of the EU Member State, trusting the wisdom of costumers who support their own economies, as everyone will see, say, a Bulgarian, a Czech, a Hungarian or a German person, that they are buying a product manufactured in their own country."
"We must protect our markets with new technologies, and the quality of materials must be indicated, backed by strict laboratory testing."
"- (CS) Mr President, it was one year ago last week that a very comprehensive bill on labelling textile products, as tabled by our Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, was passed by a large majority at first reading."
"I greatly applaud the work of the rapporteur, Toine Manders, and others who negotiated up to the last minute with the Council on a compromise at the second reading, which allows the more rapid introduction of new fibres in European manufacturing and improves product safety."
"I must express regret, however, over the fact that the Council has so stubbornly refused to introduce country of origin labelling and to harmonise size labelling."
"I am very disappointed with the approach of the Council, which deprives consumers of the right to find out before purchasing where a significant part of a product was made."
"After all, this not classified information."
"It will reinforce the promotion of high-quality European brands, and will rightly inspire pride in citizens for what Europeans still manage to produce, despite the competition from cheap labour."
"If consumers know where a product was made, they will also more easily avoid purchasing hazardous products, of which there are still very many, despite improved controls."
"This is absolutely not about protectionism."
"I am pleased that the Commission, at least, is prepared to present an impactsassessment by September 2013, which, apart from country of origin, will also focus on harmonised methods for treating products, size labelling, and the inclusion of information on hazardous substances, allergens, flammability and so on. It remains to be seen whether this will have any effect in two years' time on the Council, which protects the interests of businesses importing textiles from third countries more than it protects European producers and consumers."
"It is also up to us, however, to convince people about this, not only here in Brussels, but also our governments at home, if we want to achieve these goals."
"I would like to end by thanking Toine Manders once again, as well as the Commissioner and everyone else, for today's result."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this proposal for a regulation is worthy of support because it helps to simplify and harmonise the different laws in the Member States."
"The proposal sends out a signal that is in line with the Commission's proposals on small and medium-sized enterprises and the strategies to stimulate European competitiveness in the manufacturing sector."
"The regulation also implicitly rewards product innovation and contributes to greater transparency in the process."
"However, I would point out that the compromise reached with the insertion of the review clause and the joint statement by Parliament and the Council on origin marking - the political significance of which is not lost on me - could set a precedent and compromise the outcome of the difficult negotiations between the Commission, Parliament and the Council on the complex issue of origin marking for non-EU products, which Parliament approved at first reading last October and which concerns non-textile products also."
"It is high time that the Council acknowledged once and for all the democratic will expressed here by the majority of MEPs."
"However, despite these concerns, we will vote in favour of the proposal for a regulation."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, while on the one hand this report contains useful measures designed to simplify and harmonise this area, on the other hand I oppose it because we did not manage to include a reference to origin marking within the text."
"This measure would have been of fundamental importance for the textile sector, and would have provided a guarantee for European citizens and consumers."
"Our main competitors, such as the United States, Japan and even China, have already been applying a similar rule on imported products for some time."
"Who knows why, but Europe seems to consider this point to be completely irrelevant and extraneous."
"The issue, however, is anything but trivial: labels with origin marking can help prevent fraud, as well as protect quality."
"Just last week in Prato, my hometown, more than 73 000 counterfeit items were seized and the majority of them were textile products."
"Counterfeiting, imitations, extremely low-cost manufacturing in the Far East, and so on, have brought our textile and manufacturing sector to its knees, and Europe ignores our every request."
"Forgoing origin marking is, sadly, only the latest terrible idea."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(IT) Mr President, I am addressing the Members from the Lega Nord party to ask what their party has done during the negotiations and the trialogue, since I personally, together with the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), asked them to make an active contribution."
"It is right to criticise, but it would be better to work together to achieve tangible results and not just reel off slogans."
"(IT) Mr President, during the first reading in committee, a completely different text - one including the product origin certificate - was approved."
"It is not clear why the Council and the Commission gave up on this point: we do not intend to give up, and so we are voting against the report precisely because the origin certificate has been omitted."
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are all here to assess a text that certainly contains a few gaps, since I think that - as is often said in this House - we all wanted something more ambitious."
"However, we are also all aware that we are on the right track."
"Obviously, a clear and mandatory labelling system for all items of clothing allows for greater control and means that fraud and illegality can be combated more effectively."
"For example, there was practically unanimous praise for the fact that this text makes it obligatory to indicate where trimmings are of non-textile animal origin."
"We hope that this will make for a more effective fight against the heinous trade in dog and cat furs, which are used as trimmings on garments placed illegally on our market."
"We had hoped for a more ambitious plan including an indication of the place of origin, or at least immediate origin marking for products from those third countries that are notorious for not respecting any rules or regulations protecting consumers, workers, the environment or children - rules and regulations which are now established practice in Europe and represent a genuine guarantee for our consumers and citizens."
"I should like us all to remember, however, that this is a battle we must win together and by working as a unit because, as Mrs Comi pointed out, this fight began a long time ago and today we are marking important progress."
"The consumer consultations that the Commissioner has pledged to carry out will be a fundamental step, not only for the textile sector but also for all those sectors in which Parliament has often questioned the general public's desire for information concerning place of origin."
"I think that this information will be at the top of consumers' list of preferences, and I acknowledge the efforts made on this matter by all those Members who worked personally on this important text."
"(HU) Mr President, we must pay particular attention to the interests of consumers during the discussion of the report."
"Accurate indications and labelling must be sought, because these are the measures by which the added value of the European Union can be displayed for consumers."
"The current legislation in force allows for derogation."
"This means competitive disadvantages for the European Union, so the time has come to a legislative revision in line with the present market relations."
"The rapporteur may be right in that there is no sufficient evidence for the potential effects of hazardous materials applied."
"Conversely, maybe the rapporteur is not right, and it would be advisable to examine this issue more closely."
"It is also important to assess cause and effect relations, if any, between allergic reactions and synthetic fibres and colourants used in textile products."
"Therefore the issues concerning quality, origin and traceability must be given even higher priority."
"Mr President, EU citizens have a right to know the make-up of the clothes they wear and this regulation will allow them to avoid purchasing products containing non-textile parts of animal origin, whether for health, ethical or other considerations."
"When used in garments, for example as trimmings, such materials are currently not subject to mandatory labelling; most consumers are unaware of this and may not know the exact make-up of the textiles they buy."
"EU legislation providing for this already exists for footwear, and it makes sense to provide our consumers with the same level of information when they buy their clothes."
"Allergy sufferers in particular stand to gain from this proposal, as fur is potentially hazardous to their health, and the Commission must also study the possibility that potentially hazardous materials and chemicals used in textiles may lead to allergic reactions."
"Future applications of new textile fibre names must include available scientific data on possible allergic reactions and other adverse effects on human health."
"It should be stressed that these are balanced proposals which exempt clothes made by self-employed tailors from such labelling requirements."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, rather than a technical debate, I think this is more of a policy debate within the context of decisions made by the institutions of the European Union - in this case Parliament, the Commission and the Council - to boost the real economy."
"The European Commission and the Commissioner for Industry and Entrepreneurship intend to carry on supporting industrial policy and small and medium-sized enterprises, partly so as to provide answers to our citizens on the issue of the quality of the products made by our businesses."
"The competitiveness of the European economy is also measured in terms of product quality as a factor in the protection of the health of our fellow citizens."
"That is why this evening, at the end of this debate, the European Commission is renewing its desire to press ahead with origin labelling."
"As I already announced - and in order to reassure Mr Cancian and all the other honourable Members who have voiced concern about the overly long timescales - I can confirm that we will try to present our work ahead of schedule."
"In this regard, I confirm that I have authorised my staff to continue down our chosen path, because the Commission has always supported origin labelling both for products made in the European Union and for those that are imported."
"This evening's debate has certainly not been fruitless, because Mrs Győri clearly stated that the Council sets great store by the clause we are discussing - which is the key to today's policy debate - and that it is ready to reach a forward-looking rather than a backward-looking agreement with the Commission and Parliament in order to provide our citizens with real answers."
"I continue to believe that the traceability issue affects the competitiveness of SMEs and - just as my top priority since being appointed as a European Commissioner has been SME policy, so continuing the work of my predecessor - I intend to continue protecting the health of consumers through quality products which will be the only competitive ones on the international market, because the competitiveness of European Union products is measured in terms of quality."
"That is why I think it is important to continue working in this direction."
"I am satisfied with the agreement reached between the co-legislators."
"As you well know, Parliament and the Council have to assess it at second reading, but the European Commission intends to seize back the policy initiative and reinvigorate it."
"In other words, the Commissioner for Industry and Entrepreneurship intends to start work immediately on ensuring the protection of our products, for the sake of the competitiveness of our businesses and the health of our citizens."
"Before concluding, I should like to mention our commitment to supporting innovation in the textile and clothing sector."
"Adjusting legislation is one way of defending our competitiveness, but there are other industrial policy initiatives in the works as well."
"I will mention just two of them."
"We are developing measures to support the transfer of research outcomes and their transformation into tangible, marketable products and services."
"We are also preparing a communication on the fundamental aspects of competitiveness in the fashion industry."
"All of this goes towards underlining the need to protect European businesses and the fact that there can be no growth and development, and above all no jobs, in a social and market economy situation in which the market - which is also a fundamental instrument of our European Union - does not pursue a higher and more important goal, namely social policy."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (HU) Let me respond in a few words to the questions concerning the indication of the country of origin, because this was the most exciting part of the debate, and I must say that this issue generated a lively debate not only during the consultation with Parliament but also in the Council, and we discussed this issue at great length."
"Since consultations on the horizontal proposal concerning the country of origin in trade policy have not ended yet, it did not seem appropriate for us to create a precedent that would jeopardize the proposal and prejudice the outcome of that debate."
"We also considered the possibility of establishing a system operating on a voluntary basis for indicating the place of manufacture."
"In practice this option is already open to operators."
"But if we laid down this voluntary system in a regulation, without a proper implementation mechanism, it would lead to unjustified burdens and distortions, and that is something we wanted to avoid by all means."
"I am positive that the Commission report will assess the effects of a possible system for designating origin, so that the legislators can make a sound decision at a future point."
"(IT) (...)"
"I must also express my gratitude to Mr Tajani for his willingness to speed up the work in the Commission aimed at finding a solution on this highly important matter."
"(HU) So at the end of the day, it seemed to be a practicable solution to include a review clause in the text, and also settle the topic in a paragraph in the preamble, and it is a great pleasure for me that Mrs Lara Comi, who was the most important representative of the topic today and who is also a pioneer of the issue, has also said that this solution is an acceptable and good solution and can serve as a basis for joint work in the future."
"So I would like to thank everybody for this useful debate once again, it is good that now we have a schedule concerning the future as well, and it is very important for us that, as several Members have indicated, we can combat counterfeiting as efficiently as possible and that the European consumer can trust the traceability of textile products."
"So on behalf of the Presidency I would like to once again thank the rapporteur, the shadow rapporteur, the chairman of the IMCO committee and his colleagues for their joint efforts aimed at reaching an agreement on this piece of legislation in the second reading, through which the Internal Market of textile products can operate even more efficiently."
"rapporteur. - (NL) Mr President, the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection stands for free trade and against protectionism."
"Protectionism was never the intention behind this proposal, but what it is intended to do is to ensure that modern technologies are used to provide adequate information for the consumer and also to provide accurate information."
"I also find it nonsensical that some members should say, after the first reading, 'Well, that is over, so now we can carry on regardless', because we in this House know that if we want to carry on as we were and if we want something other than what the Council or the Commission wants, then we will be thwarted in that aim."
"It is easy to call your attention to this now, but I do think this is the right way forward."
"I have seen how strongly Mr Tajani has supported our compromise and I call on Minister Györi to be just as strong in his attempts to persuade the Council to accept the positive elements which the study produces and enshrine them in legislation."
"If that happens, I think that we will be able to show that we are making laws which are beneficial for our industry, for our consumers and also for us, because we do need to retain public support in Europe."
"I thank everyone for their support and once again, Mr Tajani, thank you for your support and I hope that we will have the results of the study as soon as possible."
"I also hope that the President-in-Office will succeed in persuading the Council that we can set to work in a positive spirit."
"I think that the future will show that the course we are now taking is a template, an example for a great number of sectors, a course that is worth the trouble we are taking."
"No legislation should ever be based on emotions, because that is not what anyone wants."
"On the other hand, legislation which is underpinned and supported by scientific arguments, with input from all parties, and which will eventually lead to legislation that is acceptable for all, whilst still being workable - now, that will lead to greater prosperity in Europe."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday, 11 May at 12:30."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"We know that on 30 January 2009, the Commission adopted the current proposal on a regulation on textile fibre names and related labelling of textile products."
"The aim of the proposal is to simplify and improve the existing regulatory framework for the labelling of textile products with a view to encouraging the development and uptake of new fibres."
"The proposal facilitates the process to adapt legislation to technical progress by transforming the three existing directives into a single regulation, which would avoid transposition of merely technical updates, and shortens the time between the submission of an application and the adoption of a new fibre name."
"The majority of Parliament supports the simplification of the existing regulatory framework, which encourages innovation in the textile and clothing sector, whilst allowing fibre users and consumers to benefit more readily from innovative products."
"In its position at first reading, adopted on 18 May 2010, Parliament approved 63 amendments with a very large majority, including rules on origin marking, indication of animal-derived materials, use of language-independent symbols and a review clause, but the Council did not accept everything."
"It is important that it accept several proposals, particularly those on origin marking."
"Therefore, we support the majority of the positions adopted here."
"Stress tests of the EU banking sector (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on"
"the question for oral answer to the Commission on the 2011 stress test of the EU banking sector by Mrs Wortmann-Kool, Mr Gauzès and Mr García-Margallo y Marfil on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) - B7-0216/2011),"
"the question for oral answer to the Commission on stress tests of the EU banking sector by Mrs Bowles, Mrs Goulard, Mr Sterckx, Mr Haglund and Mr Schmidt on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (B7-0219/2011) and"
"the question for oral answer to the Commission on stress tests of the EU banking sector in 2011 by Mr Bullmann on behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament (B7-0309/2011)."
"Mr President, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) has concerns about the European banking sector stress test which is to take place in June, because last year's stress test lacked credibility and the consequences of that were painfully obvious when the Irish banks that passed the test landed in serious trouble shortly thereafter."
"We need to ensure that the same thing does not happen this year."
"The question is whether our financial sector is equipped to cope with severe weather."
"This knowledge is important, if we are to restore confidence in the financial sector."
"Hence my question to the Commissioner: what are the most important changes that have been made to ensure that, this year, there is no repeat of the failure of last year's stress test?"
"Mr President, last year individual countries were able to decide which banks would undergo the stress test, but this year the newly-established European Banking Authority has been charged with ensuring equal criteria for every bank and for every Member State."
"This stress test will be a test, not only of the banks, but also of the credibility of the new supervision structure."
"Is the Commission happy with the fact that, while in some countries the stress test will cover 85% of the banking sectors, in others it will cover barely more than 50%?"
"Now, that is a rather remarkable statistic, and I am curious to hear your explanation of this point."
"Mr President, we need a robust European crisis resolution mechanism for cross-border banks and while, by obtaining the results of the stress test as early as June, we might be helping banks in difficulty, we will be missing an opportunity, in that we will still not have a European crisis resolution mechanism in place."
"The PPE Group encourages you to come up with ambitious proposals and you will be able to count on our support here in Parliament."
"author. - Mr President, I should like to say this to the Commissioner: the bank crisis resolution is being elaborated at an international level and there are also important competition issues to address, but this does not mean that everything has to wait, in particular when we have a combined sovereign debt and banking crisis."
"Last year's tests were weak."
"We said so then and have repeatedly said that bank stress tests must be credible, robust and transparent."
"Indeed we need a whole lot more banking transparency in general."
"So I suggest that we take a lesson from the US and the Dodd Frank Act which requires disclosure, with a two-year time lag, of the US Fed's liquidity provision."
"There are European names in the US disclosures, and it would be an altogether healthy thing for EU central banks to follow suit with similar disclosure about support during 2008 and 2009 as an accompaniment to the new stress tests."
"Now these new stress tests are improved under the EBA but there are still issues being avoided due to guarding and prevarication by Member States."
"It is about time that the message sank in that feeble political will is not the answer to this crisis and makes solutions more expensive."
"Why try and hide the full level of banks' exposure to sovereign debt, especially when we all know the likely reality?"
"There really is no excuse not to stress-test the banking book."
"Various assets got parked there, under the heading of Hold to Maturity, which would have been moved if they had not lost value."
"Of course, analysts in the market are well able to read across from stress tests and other information and make an estimate as to what is going on in the banking books."
"But a darker interpretation, reflecting on some Member States themselves, will be cast by the fact that Member States - and in many cases the supervisors are the culprits - were not bolder incoming clean."
"Meanwhile actions are being provoked by the stress tests; banks are seeking capital; some Member States are being proactive in pushing banks to raise capital."
"But there is no overall plan to address under-capitalisation."
"This simply does not stack up; surely one thing we have learned in the crisis is that we are very interconnected."
"If banks do not trust one another and inter-bank lending is frozen, we have a big problem."
"So please can we have proper disclosed coordination of the response?"
"But let us not dodge the elephant in the room: this is not just about banks, it is about sovereign debt and the stability of the euro: inextricably linked and overwhelmingly important."
"Mr President, Commissioner, it is time to carry out European stress tests that are transparent, flexible, reliable and effective: their quality and credibility are a necessary contribution to financial stability and the reestablishment of market confidence."
"Stress tests are an essential supervisory tool for evaluating the specific solvency of individual banks and the ability of the system as a whole to withstand stress."
"The intention of their design and implementation is to calculate how banks would withstand stress under certain adverse conditions, and to detect risks of contagion in order to prevent a domino effect that could lead to collapse."
"The European Union has prior experience with stress tests, carried out by the Committee of European Banking Supervisors (CEBS)."
"The experience dates from May 2009, when the Ecofin Council mandated the CEBS to organise stress tests on the financial system, in cooperation with the European Commission and the European Central Bank."
"The goal was to have a level of aggregated information on the ability of the European financial system as a whole to withstand stress, and they focused on the 22 largest banks."
"The results were not made public, because the market was very sensitive, it was said at the time."
"All that was released was a methodology providing for three outcomes - the best, average and worst - and the purpose of the tests was not market transparency."
"During their development, in July 2009, guidelines proposed by the Commission on state aid were adopted, establishing that banks needing financial aid to tackle the crisis should also be subjected to stress tests."
"On 1 October 2009, the aggregated results were sent to the Ecofin Council, which, on 2 December that year, asked the CEBS to provide it with information on the strength of the banking system, for which new stress tests would be carried out."
"The results of these stress tests carried out by the CEBS were published, in line with the European Council's June 2010 guidelines."
"They affected 91 banks in the European Union, but were criticised because they lacked a European focus, because each country decided which banks should be subjected to the tests, because the scenario was different for each country, and because the information provided was often incorrect; we all remember the case of Ireland and the lack of information on some aspects of the exposure to sovereign debt of some countries' banks."
"Despite improving the perception of some Member States, all this did not succeed in re-establishing confidence within the European Union."
"These are the circumstances in which the time has arrived to suggest a new round of stress tests, but in a totally different situation, with new European supervisory authorities."
"For the first time, there is a new European supervisory framework with experience of the two previous tests, enabling the promotion of transparency, the promotion of reliability and, clearly, the promotion of effectiveness, which is the key aspect of these third tests."
"Obviously, the first thing we want to know is what will be done to prevent the errors made in the two previous tests."
"Secondly, we want to know what will be done to cover and capture the potential for significant risk in all the Member States."
"Adequate diagnosis is necessary."
"The method also needs to be developed in line with the banks' various business models and structures, so the stress tests need to be able to provide the information needed to take appropriate action."
"This is a very important time, because the new financial supervisory authorities are starting to operate."
"On 18 March, the European Banking Authority published an executive summary containing the methodology, and we would like to know, when the European Council thought that the information should be published, what measures..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, I thank Mrs Wortmann-Kool, Mrs Bowles and, just now, Mr Sánchez Presedo for their three questions concerning an extremely important subject, namely the credibility of the stress tests for banks."
"Honourable Members, we are in a situation where the financial industry is slowly recovering from this crisis, an unprecedented struggle - even though, for some banks, the crisis already seems to be over."
"We have not yet learned all the lessons from this, and we are all engaged in an important legislative task."
"In order to get to grips with this crisis and the lessons that we must learn from it, we need a supervisory framework, and we have had one since 1 January, thanks to you in particular."
"We need tools for anticipating problems as well as better governance in each of these establishments."
"We also need better capitalisation, and we will come back to that."
"Then, we should be measuring, taking the temperature, constantly taking the pulse."
"That is why, as some of you said just now, we need reliable measuring instruments."
"The stress test is a key measure and a key tool in this context, and not only have we discussed it here, we have also discussed it on many occasions - and as recently as April, in fact - with the finance ministers in the Council."
"As you said, last year's stress test was clearly insufficient, and the Commission itself has said this on numerous occasions to the new supervisory authority, the European Banking Authority (EBA), which coordinates the test in cooperation with national supervisory bodies."
"You are therefore right to wonder about the quality and, I would say again, the credibility of the new 2011 tests, which began a few weeks ago in April, and I would like to respond to your questions and to give you our analysis on five points."
"Firstly, as you wanted, the stress tests for 2011 have undergone genuine improvements, particularly in six areas that I would like to inform you about briefly."
"1."
"The adverse macroeconomic scenario that is applied simulates conditions much more severe than those of the 2010 scenario."
"Among other things, it adds severe real estate shocks, as well as an explicit impact on the cost of financing."
"2."
"The coherence of the exercise has been very significantly improved thanks to a consolidated methodology upstream and a strict assessment subject to the adversarial principle downstream; in other words, peer review."
"3."
"Under the principle of increased transparency, the dissemination of the results in June will be improved and accompanied by a separate detailed publication of the bank balances."
"That will also include the dissemination of sovereign debt holdings as well as capital structure."
"4."
"The banks will also be tested on the basis of an upper capital threshold, core tier one."
"5."
"The dissemination of the methodology prior to the publication of the stress test results will improve the general credibility of the exercise."
"6."
"Finally, coordination among the national authorities responsible for applying what we call 'backstop' solutions, which are to be imposed on banks that fail this test, has been significantly enhanced and improved."
"That is the progress that has been made, the improvements on last year's tests that you quite rightly hoped for and which have been made this year."
"A second point that I would make, honourable Members, is that we must have much more clarity on exposures in relation to sovereign debt."
"Several of you - in particular, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe - asked me about the methodology applied in this context, as Mrs Wortmann-Kool did just now."
"The adverse scenario proposed by the banking authority, the EBA, envisages a significant shock in the form of price fluctuations of sovereign debt and the cost of its financing."
"As you noted, however, this scenario does not extend to cases in which repayment of sovereign debt is defaulted on."
"This is because the shock envisaged by the EBA would only have an impact on sovereign debts held in the banks' trading book."
"Nevertheless, there is an explanation behind this choice that was made this year."
"I would repeat that the stress tests simulate extreme scenarios, but ones which must nevertheless be considered plausible."
"Today, in the context of the recent introduction of the new European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism and the European Financial Stability Facility, which provide several governance tools for the euro area, we think, quite reasonably - and the European Banking Authority thinks so too - that it is much more useful now to ensure complete transparency of exposures relating to sovereign debt as they appear in the banking book and the trading book."
"The dissemination of these will therefore be much more detailed than last year."
"Thirdly, you have also drawn our attention to the need for more consistent implementation of stress test scenarios throughout the Union."
"This is indeed essential for the credibility of the exercise."
"The Banking Authority is making considerable efforts by carrying out a strict assessment of the results of this exercise."
"This will ensure consistency between the methodologies applied by the banks as well as a convergence - an appropriate one, I think - of the ways in which the macroeconomic scenarios are retranscribed into parameters of respective risks."
"This approach does not prevent the banks from reflecting certain specific aspects of their trading book or a particular management model."
"There is another element which is essential for the consistency of the exercise: the use of common definitions for the capital thresholds according to which the participating banks will be assessed."
"The reference for capital announced by the EBA is based largely on the current provisions of the Capital Requirements Directive, which already takes into account the different banking structures and the management models which exist in Europe."
"Fourthly, Mrs Bowles and other speakers asked us about the differences in coverage of the banking sector within the Union."
"The Banking Authority has tried hard to develop a sufficiently representative sample, both at national level and across the entire European Union, whilst ensuring that the exercise remains manageable."
"Honourable Members, the banks tested during the 2011 exercise account for 65% of the European banking sector in terms of total assets."
"In each Member State, the sample was determined in such a way as to cover at least 50% of the total assets of the national banking sector."
"With that, I come to my fifth comment, mentioned by Mr Sánchez Presedo in particular, concerning the question of the corrective measures - the backstops - that banks could expect if they turned out to be vulnerable or potentially undercapitalised."
"These banks will have to implement appropriate measures to remedy their weaknesses and above all to turn to the private sector by financing themselves directly from the markets or by selling assets."
"If, and only if, these measures turn out to be insufficient, public support could be envisaged, on condition, of course, that it conforms to the European State Aid Regulations."
"My colleague Mr Almunia and his entire team are working upstream with the Member States on this very question."
"If public support is needed, the banks benefiting from it should, pursuant to the December 2010 communication on the application of State Aid Regulations to support measures in favour of banks, provide the Commission with a restructuring plan which is appropriate for dealing with the problem, in order, in particular, to consolidate and restore their long-term viability."
"Finally, you quite rightly hoped for a strategy to recapitalise and restructure failing banks, as Mrs Ferreira proposed in her report on crisis management."
"As you know, we are working, honourable Members, on a legislative framework on the management of the crisis, the banking resolution, which we have had the opportunity to discuss several times."
"My aim is to give supervisory bodies and the future resolution committee for these cross-border institutions a toolbox in order to take preventative measures and to prevent risks that are diagnosed fairly early on from turning into crises, and to prevent the crises themselves from turning into catastrophes."
"Therefore, to ensure - and to finance, if necessary - early intervention, and to ensure that the banks pay for the banks: that is what we consider to be an orderly resolution, and I intend to present this proposal both to the Council of Ministers and to you yourselves before the end of the summer."
"Those are the technical responses that I wanted to provide, in as precise a manner as possible, to the three extremely relevant questions that were asked at the beginning of this debate."
"Mr President, Commissioner, as you acknowledged just now, last year's tests have not had the anticipated effects."
"We ought to avoid the same errors of conception and implementation."
"The fields of investigation must be consistent and similar."
"There will be no stabilisation if the diagnosis is not correct."
"Governments must be aware of that."
"This being so, the tests must quite clearly be realistic."
"The solutions that you have just given us, in a particularly detailed fashion, are of a kind that can provide an answer to our questions."
"It is now the job of the European Banking Authority, in supervising and examining the conclusions of these tests, to give a first test of its effectiveness."
"The tests must allow us to better define the potential recapitalisation needs of the banks and to take the measures that you have just mentioned."
"However, performing credible stress tests is the best way to calm the financial markets and to limit the influence of credit rating agencies and the negative effects of their decisions on the whole of our economy."
"The credibility of the results of these tests can end the dependency on these agencies, or at least can reduce it."
"The supervisory authorities have no choice but to ensure that the tests are successful; that is, that they provide convincing evidence."
"Let me use my allotted time, Commissioner, to draw your attention to the fact - in my opinion, a serious one - that the legislation relating to credit rating agencies, which has now entered into force, has not been applied, and that the authorities to which these agencies submitted their files did not take steps to inform them of the requirements of the agreement."
"We planned a transitional period pending the establishment of the European Securities and Markets Authority, yet today we are continuing to act as if nothing had happened."
"Mr President, Commissioner, if there is one thing we have learned in Europe from the recent financial crisis, it is that full capital adequacy of our credit institutions and effective supervision of the level of risk they undertake are key points in overall economic - not just financial - governance."
"Lasting and cohesive restoration of growth in the European economy necessarily depends on the restoration of confidence in the banking sector and the restoration of a financial system in general that functions smoothly and transparently and resumes its basic role as a source of finance for the real economy."
"As we have seen in practice, and as various speakers have pointed out, last year's stress tests did not achieve their objective of highlighting which banks enjoy the necessary confidence of their consumers, their creditors and the national regulatory authorities."
"This year, we are in a different situation."
"The stress tests will be carried out by the new supervisory authority, the European Banking Authority, and we must avoid last year's failure at all costs."
"This will basically depend upon imposing common stress criteria to banks, which are interpreted and applied uniformly and broadly, so as to cover the various risks to each national market."
"Commissioner, this is, without doubt, the top priority at the stress test stage; however, I would also point out that, in the second stage, full and fundamental preventive supervision will need to include appropriate mechanisms to address what, to date, has been a particularly shadowy banking sector."
"Mr President, Commissioner, a lot of things have been said about methodology."
"You have responded in detail."
"I would just like to make a brief comment about what is going to happen after the stress tests, by echoing slightly what Mr Gauzès said, which is that one cannot indulge oneself by adopting laws: they have to be adhered to."
"For my part, I see these tests as supplementing the economic governance package."
"We can do whatever we like with regard to sovereign debt, but if we do not clean up the banking sector, we will achieve nothing."
"I simply wanted to draw your attention to what is going to happen and to how these famous backstop measures will enable action to be taken at the end of the stress tests."
"I also wanted to draw your attention to what happened during the hearing with Mervyn King and Andrea Enria, whose very determined action we applaud."
"They came to see us in their capacity as Vice-Chairs of the European Systemic Risk Board, and we had the pleasure of hearing, from Mervyn King in particular - it was rather amusing, if you recall last year's negotiations, Commissioner - that the safeguard clauses, which the Member States delighted in adding to the package developed by the Commission, would not prevent them from following the recapitalisation guidelines given by the European Banking Authority (EBA)."
"I just wanted to bring that small point to your attention."
"From a systemic point of view, the Systemic Risk Board itself believes that this is important, and I believe that if the quality of the work done by the EBA, with your support and under the supervision of the Systemic Risk Board, means that we can happily shelve those absolutely ridiculous safeguard clauses that the Member States sought to include in the supervision package, then we will have taken a step forward."
"I therefore hope that the Commission and the Board will be very keen to ensure that concrete measures are taken by the Member States, large or small."
"Spain has set an example by doing a certain amount of work; we hope that the others will follow."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, last summer's stress tests were meant to restore confidence in banks."
"This was Europe's attempt to tell global markets to 'calm down, dear'."
"It failed."
"Nineteen weeks later, the Irish banks collapsed and taxpayers across Europe were forced into a bail-out, and just last week we learnt that EUR 12 billion of the proposed Portuguese bail-out is for their banks."
"The sovereign debt crisis will not be solved until the bank crisis is solved - and the bank crisis will not be solved until markets are confident in providing capital and liquidity to banks."
"Stress tests are meant to stress risks."
"To assuage market concerns they must stress the risks that the markets are concerned about, and right now the markets are concerned about sovereign debt levels."
"Refusing to test the sovereign debt held on the whole bank balance sheet will not restore confidence."
"The European Banking Authority is of course caught between a rock and a hard place: publicly admitting that the risk of a write-down exists may perpetuate the risk of it occurring, but denying that it exists at all would be downright irresponsible for a regulator."
"And then there are the trillion dollar questions."
"Behind closed doors the argument has focused on the numerator."
"What type of capital do banks hold?"
"The longer individual countries fight for their own opt-outs, the more everyone becomes aware that not all banks are equal and market concerns multiply."
"But we should also be concerned about the denominator."
"What is the risk of the assets on the balance sheets, and can you trust the risk weights applied to those assets?"
"If US banks have risk weights 50% higher than European counterparts, are Europe's banks being allowed to fundamentally misrepresent the risks on their balance sheets?"
"The financial crisis should have taught us all to value transparency."
"For depositors, investors, borrowers and taxpayers these stress tests do not offer transparency and that is a travesty."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Mr Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, the reason why the issue of the bank stress tests is of such decisive importance and is regarded so critically by our citizens is because the banks are at the centre of this crisis."
"It was the banks who invested huge amounts of money without considering the risks, creating property bubbles in a number of Member States, who are now stricken by this crisis."
"Something that we always believed to be impossible, namely that the markets might be less well informed than many external observers, has actually come to pass and the markets got things severely wrong."
"It is evident that the banks that caused the crisis were unable to make the right decisions during the crisis."
"It is now also apparent that national debt has also increased enormously during the downturn, firstly due to the cost of rescuing the banks and the associated guarantees and secondly, and more importantly, due to the cost of the downturn itself."
"Thus, the central question is: are any serious lessons being learned from the banking crisis?"
"It is not simply the case that the banks are responsible for what happened in the past, but also for present difficulties, because the markets are still not operating correctly."
"A total of EUR 427 billion in outstanding demands have now accumulated between the central banks in the accounts of the European Central Bank system and the TARGET2 payment transaction system; this is because the system has intervened between the central banks in place of the non-functioning markets."
"Because of the weakness in the banking system, we are hesitant about introducing the debt restructuring measures urgently needed in the weaker countries."
"To put it in a nutshell: people in Greece, Ireland and Portugal have the feeling that they are suffering because the structure of our bank system is weak."
"European stress tests have been carried out over the last two years."
"We believed that we would finally find out the truth."
"As has already been said many times, the 2010 stress tests were weak, particularly in relation to government risks, which were ignored almost entirely."
"These bank stress tests did not reflect reality."
"The picture is very similar in 2011."
"Although we are grateful for your contribution Mr Barnier, you have not explained why the risks associated with government bonds are recorded in the trading book, but not in the banking book."
"The explanation is always the same: we always have the rescue packages to fall back on."
"However this is just an audacious way of pre-empting a political decision."
"After all, the rescue packages cannot simply be taken for granted, but must first be approved by the national parliaments."
"If these rescue packages are quoted as the reason why risks are not priced correctly, then in practical terms this is like nationalising private risk as a fait accompli."
"What is more, we still do not have a proper stress test for the insurance market."
"I am calling on you, Mr Barnier, also to take a close look at this area."
"I am disappointed that the European Banking Authority, which we established and which is responsible for the stress tests, actually failed its own stress test."
"Mr Barnier, please stay on track and pursue this matter with greater urgency."
"This whole issue seems to illustrate the words of Bertolt Brecht when he said: founding a bank is a much worse crime than robbing one."
"However, he was wrong."
"We must now learn that carrying the burden of the banks' debt is much worse."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - Mr President, the most fundamental weakness of the proposed stress tests has now been referred to."
"It is the possibility of widespread sovereignty faults."
"Surely, this is a very likely development, given the incredible level of debts that have been loaded onto economies that are simply unable to pay."
"For example, the Irish State is on track to owe EUR 750 billion by 2014, and we have a government debt that is more than EUR 120 000 per worker."
"Irrespective of a potential cut in the interest rate and our so-called bail-out, this is unsustainable and the Irish State will default."
"I understand that German banks are exposed to Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain, the so-called 'PIGS', to the tune of EUR 400 billion."
"French banks are exposed to the tune of EUR 260 billion and British banks EUR 300 billion."
"This massive exposure explains the vicious austerity applied by the Commission and the European Central Bank to working people in the peripheral economies."
"It is my understanding that the stress tests will assume that the funding needs of the banks remain stable."
"Given the potential for a deepening of the crisis, this is unlikely to be the case."
"For example, EUR 34 billion left the six Irish domestic banks in the last three months of 2010, forcing them to rely on what is supposedly short-term funding from the ECB to the tune of EUR 160 billion."
"On the restructuring of the banking sector, surely the most fundamental lesson that has to be drawn from the experience of the last number of years and the major crisis is that the major financial institutions and banks cannot be left in private hands."
"The pursuit of profit by these private institutions has played a significant role in wrecking our economies, for which working people have paid a terrible price."
"The major financial institutions, the major banks, must be taken into democratic public ownership."
"The dictatorship of the financial markets must be ended, and their massive resources should be used to benefit ordinary people through the granting of loans to small businesses, affordable mortgages to help homebuyers, and so on."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - (SK) Mr President, on 18 March the new European banking authority published the scenarios and the stress tests through which it wishes to check European banks."
"If we want the experts to accept the results of these tests, we must avoid the superficiality and inconsistency which characterised the banking sector tests of July 2010."
"In view of the fact that the credibility of the entire European financial sector will probably be assessed according to the stringency of these tests, it would be good for the tests to be as comprehensive as possible, and for them to reflect in their stringency the actual risks the financial sector may face in the current period."
"In my opinion, these tests should not therefore avoid an adequate assessment of the exposure of the banks towards specific state debts, or the debts of other banks, in order to take account of the worst case scenarios in the tests, such as a country becoming bankrupt, for example."
"We must also ensure a balanced and fair approach towards assessing the various banking structures and business models in the individual Member States, and try to ensure that the new stress tests relate, as far as possible, to the entire banking sector in each Member State."
"Only thus will we regain the confidence of the financial experts."
"(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, in the analysis of the banks carried out in 2010, it was uniformly recognised that one of the problems of these tests has been the predominant national logic, whether with regard to methodology, to diagnostics or to the choice of criteria."
"Later, in the report that you kindly mentioned, for which I was rapporteur, this Parliament asked for the strengthening of a European dimension for managing bank crises."
"In the meantime, the Systemic Risk Board and the European Banking Authority (EBA) have been set up, indicating that finally, we were going to give the banking sector a European dimension."
"However, the stress tests that we are discussing were referred to as follows by the European Council on 24 and 25 March."
"I will read it in English, because that is the document I have."
"'Member States will prepare, ahead of the publication of the results, specific and ambitious strategies for the restructuring of vulnerable institutions, including private sector solutions ... but also a solid framework in line with State aid rules for the provision of government support in case of need.'"
"(PT) Therefore, as regards the stress tests, what we are doing at the moment - without any clear, comprehensible framework harmonising the various national practices - is again recommending that it is up to the Member States: we are again reinforcing the national dimension of approaching the solution and of correcting the stress tests on the banking sector."
"This leads me to a fundamental question."
"With this type of methodology, will we not lose a golden opportunity to finally create a European, rather than national framework to solve the problem of regulation?"
"(SV) Mr President, we are living in difficult times."
"The financial crisis has shown us how important it is for citizens to have confidence in the banks and the payment systems."
"Stress tests for the banks are therefore an important instrument for examining the resilience of the banks to unexpected shocks."
"Financial stability is about how well capitalised the banks are and how much resilience they have."
"Our experience shows that vigorous tests increase confidence in the banking system and the tests should be tough, credible, comprehensive and have clear requirements."
"The example of Ireland demonstrates the opposite, unfortunately."
"I would like to emphasise the importance of openness and transparency with regard to publication of the results of the stress tests."
"Publication of the individual tests is very important in order to help strengthen citizens' and the market's confidence in the banks."
"Just as Mr Barnier said, it is all about confidence."
"Future stress tests need to be continually developed in order to include real market conditions and risks."
"By reporting the level of exposure to sovereign debt, the market players can make their own risk assessments."
"This is important in order to strengthen the market's confidence in the design and credibility of the tests."
"The Commission, the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) and the European Banking Authority (EBA) should be clear about what the stress tests are intended to show and they should check and ensure that the assumptions of the stress tests reflect the risks."
"If the stress tests reveal that any particular banks do not meet the requirements, the Member States must take immediate action."
"The Swedish experience of expansive banks in the Baltic States demonstrates that the risks can quickly build up as a result of growing imbalances."
"History has taught us that caution is necessary, but delays or hesitation in the face of unsatisfactory results can be devastating. Thank you."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, stress tests are the latest thing."
"We have a deep economic and financial crisis, so we will make our banks take stress tests!"
"We have a nuclear crisis, so let us make our nuclear power stations take stress tests!"
"As if the very idea of stress tests was going to reassure our fellow citizens or the financial market."
"Because, clearly, everything depends on the possibilities they cater for, and as you said, Commissioner, we cannot say that last year's financial stress tests were very credible from that point of view."
"Furthermore, the nuclear stress tests, as your colleague Mr Oettinger acknowledged this afternoon, are also a big joke - they have been so far anyway - since the possibility of an aeroplane crashing into a power station has not been taken into account."
"I would therefore like to say that, in a case such as that, where an aeroplane crashes into a nuclear power station, there is clearly a default risk."
"Commissioner, you say that plausible possibilities should be taken into account, and so we are not taking into account the possibility of a sovereign State defaulting in Europe."
"I would therefore like to make the following point: either you regard this as a possibility to be rejected, and if so I would say to you that you are in denial, because the figures of the Greek debt and the Irish debt clearly show that, sooner or later, those States are going to have to restructure their debt, or you are playing for time, and if so I would say to you that that is equally irresponsible, because the longer it takes to tackle the issue, the more it will cost society as a whole."
"I therefore appeal to your sense of reality and responsibility in this matter, Commissioner."
"You are an ambitious European; you know that the people whose stress levels are tested every day are our fellow citizens, who know only too well that, until we take the bull by the horns, we will be unable to guarantee their security or the security of the financial market."
"Taking the bull by the horns today means radically restructuring the finance industry in Europe."
"I know that you have started, but this also implies the need for a European budgetary federation."
"We will discuss this point again tomorrow, however."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to express my thanks for the detailed answer to my parliamentary question of 8 February on the stress tests as they related to the Irish banks."
"We have made something clear today: credibility engenders trust."
"Also, a serious, upright and determined approach will help us overcome the crisis in credibility."
"It is for this reason that I am forced to say that I do not believe the last stress test was adequately evaluated."
"The consequences are unknown."
"Despite the logical conclusions that you have outlined today, I am still not clear about the consequences of the forthcoming test."
"For this reason I have three questions."
"My first is this: Commissioner, how can you guarantee this time that a long-term view will be taken, rather than the short-term focus applied last time with the Irish banks?"
"Secondly, is the European public debt crisis deteriorating before our very eyes, as Mr Giegold describes?"
"This deterioration will only be tested in the banks' trading books in the current stress tests."
"However the titles held by the banks until final maturity are listed in the banking book."
"Yet the banking book will not be included in the stress test."
"How can you justify this distinction?"
"Thirdly, will this not yet again give rise to a feeling that the long-term survival of the banks is guaranteed because our main problem, the state debt crisis, is not adequately being evaluated?"
"(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen I should like to thank you for your answer."
"The important thing is to make the proper diagnosis, but also to be able, after the diagnosis, to apply the proper treatment."
"We therefore need to make the stress tests more transparent and reliable - and we are headed in the right direction - but we also need to make the response more effective."
"We need solvent financial institutions, a stable financial system and, above all, the restoration of the flow of credit into the real economy."
"Banks that pass the stress tests are not exempt from making every effort to tackle adverse scenarios and to prepare for an increasingly demanding regulatory situation."
"Banks that do not pass the tests should immediately seek solutions to tackle the situation, and the Member States - those that have not done so already -should adopt initiatives to help them and contribute to their recapitalisation or to seeking means of resolution."
"The European Banking Authority can issue recommendations to correct risks detected, so as to identify any institutions presenting systemic risk - which will be subjected to a higher level of supervision - and so that rescue, recovery and resolution procedures can be followed."
"You will have our support for those procedures, Commissioner, so that an ambitious European framework can be created even in order to go further, because monetary union requires greater financial integration, but it also requires greater fiscal and political integration."
"(RO) Mr President, the stress tests are important for assessing the health of the banking system."
"However, two conditions are absolutely essential."
"Firstly, the quality of these tests and the accuracy of the actual assessment process."
"I would like to mention that the banks have had different business models in different countries."
"In Romania, as in other countries, the banks were not involved in transactions dealing with toxic assets."
"On the other hand, however, they carried out expansionist lending based on external resources assigned in the short term and providing funding in the long term."
"However, the results were the same: losses, particular vulnerability generated in the relevant countries and, obviously, a lack of responsibility for risk management."
"The second condition is the transparency of the test results which we will apply in the banking systems."
"This transparency is demanded by both financial markets and citizens."
"(SV) Mr President, during the turbulent period that we have been experiencing with regard to our public finances over the last few years we have lost our focus on the root of the problem."
"In our work to rescue the public finances of the weakest countries we have tended to forget that it is the banks that are our biggest problem."
"This is the case partly on account of the fact that the long line of disasters in the banking sector is the main reason why the public finances of so many countries are so fragile now and partly because many of the key weaknesses of the banking system still remain."
"We need to find viable solutions for the public finances of Athens, Dublin and Lisbon."
"However, these solutions will not be worth very much if we do not at the same time support those European banks that are still not able to stand on their own feet."
"If we do not make the effort that is needed at this stage to create a sustainable banking sector, it will sooner or later result in a burden on public finances that even the strongest countries will find it difficult to cope with."
"What is particularly disheartening in this context is the fact that several countries that currently have robust finances are doing so little to deal with the weaknesses in their own banking systems."
"They loudly demand that Greece, Ireland and Portugal improve, but fail to do their own homework, despite the fact that they have the resources."
"That is unacceptable."
"It is clear that the ongoing stress test must be carried out in a stringent and transparent way that inspires confidence."
"It is equally clear that the stress test must be followed up with appropriate initiatives to address the weaknesses that are identified."
"A common European strategy for this would be very valuable."
"I expect the Commission shortly to take such an initiative on the basis of the guidelines proposed by Parliament in Mrs Ferreira's report on crisis management in the banking sector."
"At the end of the day, however, the main responsibility remains at national level."
"All countries, and the strongest ones in particular, must ensure that they deal with the shortcomings that still remain in the banking system. Thank you."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr Barnier, the EU stress test for banks conducted last summer is in need of a radical overhaul."
"It is patently not enough simply to focus on the banks' capital base."
"The impact of the crisis on the banks' liquidity must also be examined."
"As a reminder: banks like Lehman Brothers collapsed because they were faced with significant liquidity problems."
"I fail to understand the debate as to whether or not the results of the liquidity check should be published."
"Anyone who insists that the data should be kept secret is undermining the purpose of the test."
"There is little doubt about what is intended: the aim is to stop the markets from losing confidence in the banks that fail the tests."
"However the effect of keeping the public in the dark about the results of the tests would simply be to engender even more uncertainty."
"Rumours and half-truths flourish in such an environment."
"Even though people will criticise the new methodology and various parameters, the common objective must be clear."
"Transparency is essential in order to determine the European banks' susceptibility to crisis."
"There is an urgent need for broad-based confidence and the banks must play a role in this in their own interests."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Barnier for the excellent work he is doing."
"We need to restore stability and confidence, and I think that an enormous effort is being made to that end."
"The legislative framework for the management of the crisis is providing Mr Barnier with the means to take a range of preventive measures as well as to manage the current situation."
"We need to watch out for and resist the bureaucratic temptation to create bodies, agencies or other instruments that could complicate life in future."
"A coordinated approach within a general European Union legal framework is essential to prevent problems and future financial crises and to allow the banks to operate in a more orderly fashion and under the same conditions throughout Europe."
"I am of the opinion that, in order to ensure transparency, regulators should be continually developing standard rules and procedures."
"I would stress, however, that care must be taken when publishing results."
"The financial year 2010 showed clearly how sensitive and important the publication of results is in terms of consistency."
"They can also produce counterproductive reactions in the markets and cause disruption."
"Attention must therefore be paid to this issue, and it must be taken seriously into consideration."
"Mr President, banks were once revered in Ireland."
"Now they are reviled, and there is no need to go into the reasons why."
"I am here to ask questions rather than give insights, and I have a number of questions."
"Firstly, do all banks have to be stress-tested?"
"Secondly, can we be assured that the stress tests from now on will reflect the true position of banks?"
"And thirdly, what authority does the European Banking Authority have to impose its authority on errant banks, banks that are over-exposed, banks behaving recklessly, and so on?"
"Finally, Mr Gauzès referred to the need to rid ourselves of dependency on the rating agencies."
"How can this idyllic situation be brought about as soon as possible?"
"(PL) Thank you very much for the opportunity to ask a question."
"I would like to make it quite clear that if it were not for the measures taken by the European Commission and by you yourself, Commissioner, there can be no doubt that we would be worse off today as regards the situation in the European banking system."
"The situation is very dynamic, however."
"We have fortunately resolved some of the problems relating to bank liquidity, but new problems and threats are emerging."
"In connection with this, I should like to ask, Commissioner, if you could give us your current thoughts regarding the threats which are emerging at present, and the threats which we will need to deal with in the near future."
"I wish to stress most emphatically that some of the problems are fortunately already behind us, but that other problems are constantly emerging."
"Mr President, lest we forget that there are people affected by these problems, I met a young Irishman on the flight to Frankfurt today, on his way to Australia with a one-way ticket, and he is just one of thousands who are doing this because of our economic and banking problems."
"Would the Commission accept that the damage done to Europe's credibility by the fudging of the first banking stress tests - and I say this with great regret - is almost irreparable?"
"European Union citizens are looking on in distress at what has happened in relation to banking."
"We have damaged confidence in the European Union and in the eurozone."
"As you know, the Irish banking sector has had its second round of stress tests and the new government has put in place a restructuring plan."
"The additional capital required was EUR 24 billion."
"The impact on the Irish economy now is that good enterprises are starved of capital as banks struggle to meet the various requirements."
"This is an impossible scenario, and I would ask the Commissioner to address it."
"(RO) Mr President, the fact that the previous stress tests were not credible makes carrying out the next tests complicated."
"The crisis in Ireland has altered the new data in the European banking system considerably."
"In this context, future tests must be much more precise in terms of providing information."
"The national authorities must apply the action plans already."
"This would therefore resolve the problems from stress tests in general."
"We should not expect to see banks failing the test."
"The new tests should highlight the weaknesses of the banking system, while identifying where the capital needs to be consolidated."
"I should emphasise the importance of the Commission adopting a fair approach in applying the stress tests in absolutely every Member State."
"Finally, I also find useful the information from the Commission on the major modifications it has proposed."
"(HU) Mr President, the importance of this topic is best highlighted by the fact that three MEPs have addressed similar questions to the Commission."
"This is not an accident, because if we conduct a stress test similar to last year's, which has not managed to restore confidence in the European banking sector, this might damage the credibility of the European Union."
"The work of ESRB and EBA preparing the test seems to be sound, both as regards its unified methodology and the method used to conduct it."
"However, some questions still remain open for me, even after the answer of the Commissioner."
"For example, does the selection process manage cross-border business and shareholder relations, as well as different business models?"
"Another question is whether it can be stated with absolute certainty that such a series of stress tests will not ignore any bank whose operation might present a risk to the European economy."
"Mr President, I am grateful to everyone who has taken the floor at this late hour for demonstrating the European Parliament's vigilance, and I would even say its intelligence, on this difficult issue."
"Firstly, to come back immediately to the issue raised just now by Mrs Gáll-Pelcz, who talked about the responsibility of the Commission - I am used to facing up to my responsibilities - I would point out that these stress tests that are being performed today have been designed by, and are the responsibility of, the new authority that we have created together, the European Banking Authority."
"Of course, we are working closely with that authority and we, like the European Central Bank, have helped prepare this new round of tests with the EBA, but it is the EBA that is mainly responsible for this."
"Mr Zemke asked a rather broad question about future threats and risks."
"Firstly, I believe there is no such thing as zero risk, either in this field, or in the environmental field."
"I think it is very difficult to predict the future, and we know after all, Mr Zemke, that the markets move much more quickly than the age of democracy, than our age, no matter how quickly we move or how quickly and effectively we want to move."
"How, though, can we be better prepared than we were four years ago when faced with the crisis that originated in the United States and nearly swept everything away?"
"By creating tools, frameworks for governance, supervision, responsibility, transparency, everything that was lacking, everything that had been part of the very powerful tide of ultraliberalism that first swept through the world in the 1990s, everything that was partially dismantled, too, with the foolish idea that the markets could regulate themselves."
"Within the framework of the G20, and perhaps going further in some areas than the G20 had requested, we are today patiently recreating the governance, regulatory, transparency, I was going to say quite simply 'moral' - if I can use that word - or ethical frameworks and tools that have been singularly lacking in the financial market set-up for around 15 years."
"That is why your understanding of this situation is important, and why your role in creating proper European supervisory authorities - Mrs Goulard mentioned the European Systemic Risk Board - is very important."
"That is why - and this is also addressed to Mr Gauzès, who mentioned rating agencies - we are including this action, the specific topic of tonight's sitting, everything that we are doing patiently, week after week, in the major European financial and economic governance project, and we have more work to do yet."
"I do not have a problem with using the word federation in the context of this major project; I think it was Mr Giegold who used that word earlier."
"We need to pool our energies and our policies more, and at times we need to go beyond mere coordination."
"I agree with Mr Gauzès on the importance of continuing the reforms in the area of rating agencies."
"We are working on a third reform, which will complement the previous two."
"As for the issue that you raised, Mr Gauzès, with regard to excessive dependence on ratings, we are going to get rid of a number of ratings very shortly, at the beginning of July."
"We are going to get rid of several references to ratings so as to prevent this excessive dependence on ratings by the banks, and not just by the banks in fact."
"We are going to work on this point, therefore."
"Mrs Goulard referred to the comments made by Mr King and Mr Enria, and I have noted them down."
"I thank her for having drawn my attention to their comments, which demonstrate, moreover, a proactive and changing approach, which I am very pleased about."
"I should also like to thank her for having mentioned the very important role - and we know how much we owe you, Mrs Goulard - of the Systemic Risk Board."
"We must work with all these stakeholders and the EBA, and naturally we must have regard for the role of the Systemic Risk Board, so that we apply the stress tests consistently and so that we learn from them."
"Ultimately it will be up to the Member States rather than the EBA to learn lessons by putting in place conditions and backstops, which we will be monitoring closely in the period immediately after the stress tests."
"When the three European supervisory authorities and the Systemic Risk Board were set up, I said that we were going to test the ground by walking on it."
"That is what we are doing."
"I believe that the EBA is doing a good job under the leadership of Mr Enria; the same applies to the other authorities, to the Systemic Risk Board and, Mr Giegold, to the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA)."
"Earlier you mentioned the tests in the insurance sector; the EIOPA is currently preparing a series of tests in that sector, as the EBA did for the banks."
"You raised a sensitive and very important issue, Mr Giegold, as did Mr Karas and Mr Schmidt earlier, namely sovereign debt shock."
"As I have already said, and I will not be saying anything else on the matter this evening, the EBA has been tasked with designing and developing the tests."
"It felt that a banking book shock was unrealistic, and so there was no point in carrying out tests on the banking book at this stage."
"All I can say is that we have this dialogue with the EBA, we are determined - Mr Giegold has drawn all the lessons from this new round of tests, just as we drew lessons from the previous round, which was unsatisfactory - and we have an ambition - Mr Sánchez Presedo asked me to show ambition - which is to be demanding and rigorous when holding this dialogue, while respecting the powers and the independence of the EBA, just as we in the Commission demand respect for our own independence."
"My ambition, Mr Giegold, is to reflect rationally on what we have learnt from this round of tests, which will end in June, and to learn as much as we can from our dialogue with the EBA, in order to improve the following round."
"Mr Mann, like you, Mr Giegold, mentioned the evaluation of liquidity risk."
"As you know, the evaluation of this liquidity risk is not part of the stress test itself, the results of which will be made public."
"At the beginning of the year, the European Banking Authority announced that it would be carrying out a separate thematic review of the liquidity risks in the EU banking sector as part of its regular risk assessment cycle in the first quarter of 2011."
"It will therefore address this issue in this parallel context, so to speak."
"Mr Karas called on his fellow Members and the Commission to integrate everything that we are doing into long-term strategies, and I would like to say to Mr Karas that this is a general principle to which I subscribe, and it is also the spirit in which I am working with my teams in order to propose all the new legislation that is part of this financial and economic governance that we need."
"This specifically applies to the issue of governance, to what we are going to do in terms of shareholder liability - we are working from a long-term perspective - and to what we want to do, as I was saying earlier to Mrs Ferreira, with regard to bank resolution."
"It also applies to another point that I have in mind; although you have not mentioned it, it is one of the reasons for, or one of the causes of, the crisis: the obscene pay and bonuses, which were even higher when more risks were taken, since those taking the risks knew that everyone else would pay for them."
"When we review the application of the current guidelines on pay and bonuses, and see where they fall short, I will clearly ensure that, as many of you have requested, they are transposed and applied in every Member State over the coming weeks."
"When I say that I am considering new guidelines on this issue, it is precisely in order to address one of the causes of the crisis - this crazy risk-taking - and to make those involved in the banking sector more prudent and responsible again."
"Mrs Ferreira and Mr Lamberts made the point that the stress tests were inconsistent.I have said what I think about the shortcomings of the previous tests."
"We need more consistency, we need more Europe in the application of these tests, and that is why the peer review with the EBA will also be very useful."
"Regarding the issue of a harmonised bank resolution framework, that is precisely what we are working on, Mrs Ferreira."
"I can confirm to you that we will be presenting our proposal before the end of the summer, and that we will be relying in a very real and sincere way on many of the proposals you have made."
"Several of you, including Mr Ludvigsson, Mrs Ford, Mr Cancian and Mrs Băsescu, just now, called for the tests to be - I shall repeat what I heard - rigorous, credible and transparent."
"Once again, in the overall context of this financial and economic governance that we are in the process of establishing together, the 2011 tests will be more rigorous, credible and transparent than the previous round, and we are going to build on the lessons and the review of this 2011 round in order to ensure that, as you have requested, the subsequent stages in the banking sector stress tests are even more effective, rigorous, credible and transparent."
"Thank you very much, Mr Barnier."
"Our discussions have gone on a little too long."
"It is very much to your credit that you have responded to each speaker."
"However, perhaps in future, for educational reasons, we should agree that the final statement by the Commissioner will only respond to those speakers still actually in the Chamber."
"This would save us a little time."
"The last debate has actually taken us right to the limit of the time we have available to us."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"in writing. - (LT) As we can see today, the stress test of banks operating in European Union Member States carried out last year failed to reveal the true situation in this sector."
"The Irish example has shown that this check was fundamentally unreliable."
"This year a slightly improved test was also carried out, and we are all awaiting its results."
"I feel that in order to restore EU citizens' faith in the banking and financial system in general and to ensure the credibility of the whole European financial institutional framework, the newly created European Banking Authority must be given much greater powers and a more important role."
"I believe that tests should be carried out systematically and cover as broad a range of risk elements as possible - these vary across the Member States."
"The European Banking Authority should also lay down clear procedures and have the opportunity to submit decisions that are obligatory for banks if the checks carried out reveal banks' financial instability or unreliability."
"It is interesting that after the failure of the stress test the press was flooded by false success reports even last year - obviously this was also due to the machinations of the European Commission."
"And now not just us, but everybody from the liberals to the PPE demand an explanation for the failure."
"They, however, are seeking a solution in false answers, for example in the form of additional governmental capital injections pumped into banks or in further Brussels centralisation."
"But the actual reason for the failure is precisely that the Brussels bureaucracy is simply not able to assist us efficiently in most of fields of our lives."
"So after the fiasco they should not want to withdraw further licences from Member States and waste billions of euros on establishing further mammoth authorities; instead, they should admit that Europe cannot exist as the United States of Europe, and the more power is given to Brussels, the more efficiency will decrease."
"Enforcement of regulations on the shipping of toxic waste to developing countries (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on"
"the question for oral answer to the Commission on the enforcement of regulations on the shipping of toxic waste to developing countries from Mrs Bearder, Mrs Ek, Mr Ouzký, Mr Seeber, Mrs Klaß and Mrs Harms on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, the European Conservatives and Reformists, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance - B7-0217/2011) and"
"the question for oral answer to the Commission on the enforcement of regulations on the shipping of toxic waste to developing countries from Mrs Wils, Mrs Liotard, Mrs de Brún, Mr Ferreira, Mrs Matias and Mr Chountis on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left - B7-0218/2011)."
"author. - Mr President, does the Commissioner not consider that, if any of us woke up one morning to find our rich neighbours had dumped their toxic rubbish in our front yard, we would be furious?"
"Yet that is what the EU is doing every day."
"Every year tonnes of toxic waste is shipped from the EU to developing countries against European environmental law, smuggled through ports with very weak controls."
"Almost three quarters of electric waste in the EU is unaccounted for and only one third of electronic waste is treated according to EU legislation."
"In the UK the average Briton throws away four pieces of electronic waste every year."
"That is 500 000 tonnes of broken TVs, computers and phones, but over half of this is not recorded as being recycled - it just disappears - and that is only in my own country."
"The export of controlled waste from the EU for disposal is prohibited under current legislations, yet annually illegal shipments from the EU are thought to average about 22 000 tonnes."
"The WEEE Directive states that exported electronic items must be in working order."
"However, this relies on effective EU-wide inspection policies which are clearly missing."
"This waste contains lead, cadmium, barium, mercury, brominated flame retardants and other chemicals and plastics that become hazardous when burned."
"Burning is often the cheapest method to recover these valuable metals as adults and children scramble over the dumps of rubbish in their quest to earn a few cents."
"We cannot ignore the environmental and health impacts of this scandal which affects the most vulnerable."
"Frankly, as a European, I am ashamed."
"I thank the Commissioner for the answers and the responses, but we need to know the specifics of how he is going to close this loophole in the Waste Shipment Regulation."
"Does the Commission have any plans to address the tonnes of EU waste already dumped in African countries?"
"Does the Waste Shipment Regulation need to be revised or is it just a matter of enforcement?"
"This is an urgent problem and action needs to be taken now."
"I await your response."
"deputising for the author. - (DA) Mr President, I am pleased that so many of my fellow Members are aware that our waste does not simply disappear of its own accord, but unfortunately often ends up out in the wider world where no one deals with it properly."
"There is actually nothing new about this, of course."
"A great many European countries started to send their discarded ferries filled with asbestos to India many years ago, where bare-foot workers separated old iron from the hazardous components on an open shore - as they still do today."
"An even worse situation is that of the African children who sit on the ground and separate out our electrical waste right down to the individual components."
"Is this acceptable?"
"No, of course it is not."
"However, the EU lacks reasonable and realistic means to enforce the sound regulations that were laid down as long ago as 12 July 2006."
"The directive is enforced via the individual Member States, as stated in Article 50 of the same regulation, but some States turn a blind eye when it comes to this enforcement."
"Something has to be done, however, because 70 million tonnes of hazardous waste per year - and rising - is no trifling matter."
"I therefore have another question in addition to the written questions that the Commission has already received, and that is: Has the Commission considered utilising special port areas for unloading hazardous waste in selected ports?"
"That would provide better means of control in general."
"Could the Commission envisage carrying out some publicity work to encourage EU citizens to take their hazardous waste to specific places in the Member States?"
"It is extremely important to make our citizens aware of the problem, because without their help in the struggle to manage hazardous waste we will get nowhere."
"author. - (DE) Mr President, Mr Barnier, it is not just in the banking sector that we have regulations that do not work, but also in the environmental area."
"Although we have a regulation covering the shipping of waste dating back to 2006, this does not work because there is an increasing trend towards shipping hazardous waste beyond the EU's borders, in particular to developing countries where the proper disposal of these hazardous substances cannot be guaranteed."
"This cavalier approach to disposal leads to environmental and health problems in these countries that can cause many fatalities in extreme cases."
"In addition, here in the European Union, we are discarding valuable resources."
"Part of the 2020 strategy includes a strategy on resources and waste is one of our resources."
"We should make every effort to improve our research activities in this area so that valuable materials can be segregated at the end of the product lifecycle."
"In a speech on 7 April of this year, your colleague, Commissioner Potočnik, announced that, despite the Commission having avoided this issue and done nothing for many years, he intended presenting a communication in the autumn of this year in which he would tackle the problem, in particular with regard to implementation of existing regulations and an improved inspection system, as well as a broadening of the scientific base."
"Commissioner, I would like to know whether this communication is already being prepared by the Commission services."
"In other speeches, Commissioner Potočnik also referred to a new agency."
"Although we already have a large number of official bodies, he is obviously thinking of a way to strengthen the control of the Member States' authorities in this area."
"I would like to know how things stand in this area, because at present it would seem that we are unable to resolve this problem."
"What steps does the Commission intend to pursue in this area?"
"deputising for the author. - (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the poor implementation of the Waste Shipments Regulation has been a serious problem for a long time now."
"This has been emphasised by the European Union Network for the Implementation and Enforcement of Environmental Law since 2003, and it has made clear proposals for improvements."
"The Commission, however, has done virtually nothing, unless you count the many studies it has conducted and its proposal for a new Renewables Directive."
"For more than 10 years now, Parliament has been calling for tighter controls, including legislation on European inspections: for minimum criteria for inspections in Mr Jackson's report in 1999, for legislative reform for shipments of waste in Mr Blokland's report in 2003, and for minimum criteria for inspections in the 2008 resolution."
"All these the Commission has mainly just ignored."
"In 2006, we were shocked by the massive Trafigura scandal, when huge quantities of toxic waste were dumped in Côte d'Ivoire."
"The then Commissioner for the Environment, Stavros Dimas, promised to look for ways to strengthen the Waste Shipments Regulation and its implementation in the Member States, but nothing concrete happened."
"Two years ago, a Commission study recommended that a special agency should be set up for the implementation of legislation on waste."
"It would execute numerous tasks, such as checking the investigation systems in place in Member States and coordinating controls and inspections, but no proposal was put forward."
"Last year, a Commission study came to the conclusion that the best option would be a legal instrument governing the criteria for inspections, but no proposal was put forward, although Commissioner Potočnik has said that the implementation of EU environmental legislation is his priority."
"Now I would ask the Commission when it actually intends to introduce proper measures, instead of just conducting more studies."
"When will we have a proper legislative proposal, and not just communications and studies?"
"As my colleague Mr Seeber said, this would also improve Europe's resource efficiency."
"author. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, illegal waste exports and the illegal disposal of waste pose an increasing threat to the health and environment of millions of people in developing countries."
"The volume of toxic waste is continuously increasing in the EU."
"Because of the high cost of recycling and disposing of waste, there is an enormous temptation to ship this waste to countries with less stringent environmental controls and lower disposal costs."
"I am pleased to find that this problem is accepted by all sides of the House and hope that Parliament will take a concerted approach to this issue."
"The legal loopholes that permit these hazardous exports must be closed."
"The existing regulations on the shipment of toxic waste to developing countries must be tightened up and enforced."
"We need a legislative proposal for environmental inspections, something that Parliament already called for in 2008, so that ships can be inspected effectively by the authorities in the local ports."
"This must also be linked with the possibility of impounding ships in ports throughout the EU if there are grounds to suspect breaches of the law."
"We propose that this should be reinforced in a joint resolution by all sides of the House."
"The entry of waste into the EU must also be better controlled."
"Off the coast of Calabria, just a few miles away from the port of Cetraro, there is a sunken vessel known for carrying highly toxic waste."
"It is assumed that many other toxic waste transporters have been sunk just off the coast in the Tyrrhenian Sea."
"This example illustrates the need for transparency in the shipment of waste and for reliable official inspections."
"Mr President, honourable Members, firstly, my colleague and friend Mr Potočnik sends his apologies, as he is in New York this evening for the signing of an important agreement - the Nagoya Agreement - on biodiversity."
"Nevertheless, I am pleased to have been given the opportunity to stand in for him, or to try to do so anyway, since the issue you are discussing is one that has always interested me, ladies and gentlemen."
"I was Environment Minister in my own country and I have not forgotten the efforts that we made, during my first mandate as Commissioner around 10 years ago, to begin to address this extremely serious issue with Parliament."
"The Waste Shipments Regulation prohibits exports of hazardous waste to developing countries, as well as exports outside the Union and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries of waste intended for disposal."
"However, we know - and you have pointed it out - that the efforts made to enforce this ban vary greatly between Member States."
"Operators often seek to benefit from inadequate inspections in order to get round the ban and smuggle the waste through other Member States where the inspections are less rigorous, as you said."
"Furthermore, false declarations are often used to export waste as second-hand goods, which complicates the work of the authorities responsible for monitoring and enforcing the rules."
"Then there is the obviously low treatment cost in third countries, which is the main economic factor encouraging or driving these illegal shipments."
"There is also the very serious situation of countries that receive, so to speak, this waste, these illegal shipments, which cause significant pollution of the air, water, soil and homes, and which threaten - as you said a moment ago, Mrs Wils, and as Mrs Bearder and Mrs Rosbach said with the same emotion before you - people's health, and particularly children's health, which is the most shocking of all, as well as the health of workers and of a large proportion of the population."
"The already toxic nature of the hazardous substances contained in waste often poses a further increased risk when inappropriate waste management techniques are used, which is often the case in these countries of destination."
"Furthermore, illegal shipments of waste to third countries obviously have an adverse effect on trade and competition since, economically speaking, businesses that comply with the legislation evidently face competition and are put at a disadvantage."
"The European recycling and waste management sector, which is bound to comply with the EU's rigorous environmental legislation, is a dynamic one."
"It has a healthy EUR 95 billion turnover."
"It provides, or supports, 1.2 to 1.5 million jobs and accounts for 1% of GDP, and this waste management and recycling sector, which operates by the rules, is also competing with, and put at a disadvantage by, these illegal shipments."
"Effective enforcement of the Waste Shipments Regulation at EU level would encourage this sector, I believe, to invest and to create even more jobs in the future."
"Illegal waste shipments and poor quality recycling also lead to a loss of resources, since secondary raw materials can go a long way towards meeting Europe's raw material requirements, and can also improve the effectiveness and use of resources."
"On the basis of this diagnosis, then, we need to improve the situation."
"That is why the Commission has sought to find out whether additional legislative measures need to be taken at EU level and, if so, which new, specific requirements and criteria they would include for waste shipment inspections."
"We are currently completing an impact assessment of the various possible approaches to resolving the problem that I just mentioned, including national inspection and mandatory national risk assessment plans and programmes, as well as more targeted training for national officials responsible for enforcing the provisions and, on the other side of the coin, for proving that those who declare waste to be second-hand goods are doing so fraudulently."
"I should like to conclude, Mr President, by raising the following points in response to some specific questions."
"Firstly, it is possible to circumvent the Waste Shipments Regulation by claiming that the articles being exported are second-hand goods rather than waste."
"The main problem is that the Member States are not implementing the inspection requirements properly."
"To remedy this, the Regulation needs to be supplemented by more detailed rules on national inspections."
"The legislative measures should be accompanied by adequate training for officials in charge of enforcing the rules, as I said."
"Secondly, non-legally binding guidelines at EU level could support and facilitate the implementation and enforcement of the Waste Shipments Regulation, particularly by customs officers, and thus help to combat illegal activities."
"However, guidelines alone will not be enough."
"We also need binding rules to combat this problem."
"Thirdly, waste production has increased or stabilised in recent years."
"Waste management is improving throughout the Union, and recycling has increased over the last five years."
"Yet what is remarkable today is the great disparities between the Member States with regard to the implementation of our waste requirements."
"The Commission, ladies and gentlemen, is conscious of the environmental, economic, social, human and public health consequences of illegal waste shipments, and the Probo Koala affair, in which several people died after being exposed to hazardous waste illegally dumped in Côte d'Ivoire, is one of the worst examples in living memory, and here too there are lessons to be learnt."
"The Commission has launched numerous studies on this issue, and the results of these investigations can be consulted on our website."
"Once illegal shipments of waste have been detected, there are measures laid down in the regulation to remedy the situation."
"The waste must be sent back to its country of origin, pursuant to EU legislation and international law."
"If the companies responsible cannot be located, the country of origin in the Union must pay a fee to have the waste repatriated and treated."
"In some cases, Member States have to bear costs in excess of EUR 1 million."
"In the Probo Koala affair, which I mentioned a moment ago, the company Trafigura had to pay the equivalent of EUR 152 million in clean-up costs and EUR 33 million in compensation to the residents of the affected towns."
"Lastly, I should like to say to Mr Seeber that, as far as I am aware, Mr Potočnik promised to present that communication on the implementation and enforcement of EU law and he is in the process of drafting it."
"Mr President, many of us are outraged at the fact that, despite a comprehensive public debate on this, Europe is still dumping hazardous waste in poorer countries."
"As many here have already said, we are right to be outraged."
"Not only do we use products that exhaust and damage the environment and then also fail to deal with them properly once we no longer want them, we also dump the hazardous waste, which damages the health of innocent people, often children, and makes the land and water in other countries toxic for generations to come."
"That is absolutely unacceptable."
"How can this be allowed to continue?"
"We have legislation and we have a ban in place, but it is not working."
"Therefore, the Commission must now propose amendments."
"Of course, the best solution, as always, would be for there not to be any hazardous waste."
"The extensive work that we have carried out to identify and phase out hazardous chemicals, within REACH for example, is therefore important in this case, too."
"Since the ban on the export of hazardous waste is not working, I think that we should be especially pleased that we have strengthened the legislation concerning waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) by setting high collection targets."
"However, knowing how poor the Member States' compliance with the export ban is, there are good reasons for the Commission also to closely monitor the Member States' actions with regard to WEEE and other legislation stipulating how this type of product should be dealt with."
"As many people have said, including the Commission, we need some form of clarification and simplification of what rules actually apply when it comes to the shipping of toxic waste to developing countries, so that it will be easier for the police and other border control officers to take measures to deal with the crimes against the environment that the export of hazardous waste actually entails."
"However, we just as surely need the Member States to give higher priority to this matter."
"I think the fact that the Member States are failing in their responsibility to check their compliance with EU legislation is a constantly recurring issue."
"It is very clear here that the Member States are not fulfilling their obligations."
"The Member States must take greater responsibility, and we expect the Commission to ensure that they do."
"What you have presented here today, Mr Barnier, seems to me to be a definite step in the right direction."
"Once we are able to see the whole communication we will be able to decide whether or not we think the number of steps taken are sufficient. Thank you."
"- (CS) Mr President, the exponential growth in the volume of waste from European manufacturing and consumption looks like a time bomb, both in the EU and in the developing countries to which hazardous waste is exported, much of it illegally."
"Commissioner, I welcomed your communication of the Commission's specific desire to remove the gaps in the legislation relatively soon."
"Along with the speakers who came before me, however, I believe there is little desire on the part of Member States, in particular, to invest in controls and to introduce sufficiently harsh penalties for breaches of the existing rules."
"As the Vice-Chair of the Delegation to the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, I believe we also need to establish a common strategy with the ACP countries for the fight against illegal imports of toxic waste to these countries, and in particular action plans for introducing a system for the safe management of waste in African countries, including support for recycling technology."
"(HU) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the seemingly strict EU regulation concerning hazardous waste has many loopholes in practice, which can be eminently used by organised groups of criminals and the hazardous waste mafia."
"Illegal disposal of toxic waste classed as hazardous has become one of the most lucrative businesses."
"One reason for this is the extremely high cost of legal disposal and recycling; another reason is the over-bureaucratisation of obtaining legal licences."
"The solution has to be bi-directional: the administrative burdens of enterprises that recycle and dispose of hazardous waste legally has to be relieved, and of course in parallel, producers of hazardous waste should be encouraged to choose the legal course and made interested in restraining the hazardous waste mafia."
"On the other hand, criminal law sanctions for environmental crimes must be radically tightened, and inspection must be uniformly increased at EU level."
"- (SK) Mr President, it is a quarter to midnight and we are debating a serious matter: the exporting of toxic waste to developing countries."
"It is scandalous that European countries in the modern age are engaging in the kind of activity we saw in the Oscar-winning film Erin Brockovich, which featured Julia Roberts, and where we saw that only in California could something like this happen, with factories exporting toxic waste and people then falling seriously ill and even dying."
"It is a very sad fact that EU Member States export their toxic waste to African countries that are almost powerless to prevent this, and it includes toxic elements such as lead, cadmium, mercury, asbestos and others."
"In my opinion it is good that the Commission wants to continue working on this."
"I would like to call on Commissioner Barnier, who promised us that the Commission would take a more energetic approach, to adopt measures to improve this situation."
"Mr President, there is a problem in the European Union because our citizens are dumping on their own doorsteps."
"To do that in Europe is one thing but to do it to the developing world and to the poor is, as the authors of this question said, reprehensible."
"I will listen carefully to the Commission's response about new legislation."
"I am always concerned that we layer legislation on top of existing laws without looking at the enforcement aspects, and I would ask the Commission to address the issue of enforcement."
"I think in many areas we do not have sufficient numbers in Member States to correctly keep control and account of the transportation issue, in this case of toxic waste."
"The consequences for the health and welfare of those who handle this waste in a very inappropriate way are extremely serious."
"This is a moral and ethical question."
"Perhaps if our citizens were aware of this - I think they are not - they might think twice about their purchasing and disposal methods."
"Mr President, Mrs McGuinness made an important point just now, namely that there is a moral and ethical dimension to this issue, given all the public health, biodiversity and economic concerns we have raised."
"That is why - and I say this to Mrs Westlund and Mrs Roithovà, as well as to other speakers - the Commission is determined to act."
"In order to support the impact assessment, which will demonstrate the justification for this initiative, the Commission will propose tightening up EU legislation, in particular so as to improve inspections and enforcement of the Waste Shipments Regulation."
"This should greatly reduce the considerable number of illegal shipments."
"All possible solutions are being examined."
"Give Mr Potočnik the few weeks he needs to draft this legislation."
"I can say on his behalf that it will be before the end of this year, 2011, that the Commission, taking into consideration the very important debate that you have held, despite the late hour, presents its legislative proposals to step up the fight against these illegal shipments and all their consequences."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
", in writing. - Earlier this year I made some enquiries to the European Commission in response to press reports about shipments of toxic waste from Italy to Romania."
"Although no evidence was found for the shipments, what was clear from the outcome of my enquiries was that we could benefit from more regular inspections of cargo, as this would act as a deterrent to those involved in the illegal shipment of waste."
"Such measures may have an additional impact in the case of third countries because they may lack the capacity to properly monitor incoming shipments and therefore prevent the entry of toxic material into their territory."
"We should give serious consideration to the benefits of thorough, regular inspections, coordinated at EU level, especially in the case of shipments to developing countries."
"Agenda of the next sitting : see Minutes"
"Closure of the sitting"
"Opening of the sitting"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to apologise for the delay."
"There was a very exciting and interesting discussion between President Barroso, Commissioner Lewandowski and the leaders of the political groups, so we are a few minutes late."
"There is now a very important discussion ahead of us and I would like to invite you to this discussion."

"the statement by the Vice-President of the Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on the situation in Syria and in Camp Ashraf and the situation of the Coptic Christian community of Egypt,"
"the report by Mr Albertini, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the annual report from the Council to the European Parliament on the main aspects and basic choices of the common foreign and security policy (CFSP) in 2009, presented to the European Parliament in application of Part II, Section G, paragraph 43 of the interinstitutional agreement of 17 May 2006,"

"the report by Mrs Muñiz De Urquiza, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the EU as a global actor: its role in multilateral organisations."
"Before we begin, I would like to say a few words."
"On Monday, we remembered Europe Day, a day in celebration of the European Union."
"Without doubt, what we most need in the European Union today is a common foreign and security policy."
"We face historical challenges, only one of which is the need to overcome the crisis which has been imported into Europe."
"We must prepare for this kind of situation in the future and solve the problems of the crisis which exist outside Europe, too, and not just those inside Europe."
"We also have the growing disorder in Syria, Bahrain and Yemen, as well as the renewed unrest in Tunisia and Egypt."
"We should not forget our eastern neighbours - indeed, a few days ago, we launched Euronest."
"We have our common European diplomacy, which needs to be an effective tool for action outside the European Union, because it is not possible to solve problems inside the European Union today if we do not begin seriously to solve problems outside the European Union."
"The European Union must have greater political strength and not just economic strength."
"Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. - Mr President, this will be the first of three contributions that I will make to honourable Members this morning, so I want to start by giving you my vision of the issues that face us and also to try and touch upon some of the detail of the issues that honourable Members have added to this debate, knowing the importance that you attach to them."
"Let me begin."
"There are storms blowing across the countries we call our neighbours - Arab spring, winds of change, whatever imagery we use."
"None of us in this House know where it will end and what that end will bring."
"Aspirations are high and expectations too that the revolutions will have been worth the blood that has been spilt, worth the turmoil and fear, worth the economic havoc in a world already grappling with the worst economic problems for decades."
"The uprisings across North Africa and the Arab world pose great challenges for Europe, but also opportunities we cannot afford to miss."
"Two principles have to underpin what we do."
"The first is that we in Europe know how long and painful the journey towards liberty can be."
"Our own path to 20th century liberal democracy was a very slow one."
"The European Union itself was born in the ashes of conflicts that remind us how terrible life can be when democracy breaks down."
"Add into that the mixed record of Europe's empires and some humility is in order, even as we assert that democracy is the necessary foundation of human progress."
"Second, democracy is, of course, about votes and elections - but it is also about far more than that."
"What we have learnt in Europe the hard way is that we need deep democracy: respect for the rule of law, freedom of speech, respect for human rights, an independent judiciary and impartial administration."
"It requires enforceable property rights and free trade unions, and is not just about changing governments but about building the right institutions and the right attitudes."
"In the long run, surface democracy - democracy that floats on the top with people casting their votes freely on election day and choosing their government - will not survive if deep democracy fails to take root."
"But there is no certainty - not in the outcome in any country - and no quick fix or short-term solution that will create the world so many people want to see."
"Meanwhile, the spectre of religious intolerance casts its shadow - witness the recent events in Egypt - finding its excuse in uncertain times to play on fear and to wreak destruction."
"Freedom of religion or belief is a universal human right that must be protected everywhere."
"We need to condemn all those who seek to use religious belief as a means of oppression, and support those who advocate tolerance, whether in Syria, in Pakistan, in Egypt or elsewhere."
"Europe has choices to make too."
"When we look at our neighbourhood, we have to be ready to rise to challenges that are being asked of us."
"I can make hundreds of statements - and I do."
"I deplore, I condemn, I urge, I demand, but we also need to act and that action has to come in different forms."
"Let me mention sanctions."
"We impose sanctions against regimes that treat the lives of their citizens as worthless, with people killed at the hands of police or security services that they command."
"Sanctions on Syria were imposed yesterday - an embargo on arms, an asset freeze and a travel ban for 13 key individuals in the regime, the freezing of our association agreement and of our cooperation with Syria."
"Let us be blunt and clear, as I was with the Foreign Minister of Syria yesterday."
"What is happening in Syria is a popular aspiration for democracy and the rule of law - it is not some foreign plot."
"By failing to see what it is, the regime loses its legitimacy and estranges itself from the people and from the international community."
"Violent oppression and threats inside and outside are tools of an era that is long gone."
"Our concern, in this House and in the European Union, is with the people of Deraa where the UN has been refused access, in Baniyas where the crack-down continues, in Hama where the tanks have moved in."
"The Syrian people will not bow to tanks."
"We say to the regime to change course, and to change course now."
"(Applause)"
"I said yesterday to Minister Moallem, the Foreign Minister of Syria: You must allow immediate and unhindered access to humanitarian support and to the media."
"Only then can your claims of support for peaceful protests be substantiated."
"In our eastern neighbourhood - in Belarus - President Lukashenko failed to use last December's presidential elections to show his readiness for change and a more open and democratic, European society."
"Not only did he not take this chance but, in using violence against peaceful demonstrators and multiplying the number of political prisoners, he has shown contempt for democracy and the rule of law."
"I met with the families of those who have been imprisoned and I know that he left us with no other option than to adopt strong sanctions in response, targeting those in the regime responsible for the crack-down, including President Lukashenko himself."
"I also know that we should step up our support for civil society and for people-to-people contacts."
"Then there is our direct engagement in Camp Ashraf."
"What happened on 8 April is deplorable and has, and had, my strongest condemnation."
"I have been adamant that we need a strong united EU response."
"I have written to the Foreign Minister of Iraq and I spoke to him again yesterday."
"While I do not question Iraq's sovereignty over all its territory, it has a duty to protect the human rights of Ashraf residents."
"I have condemned that violence and called for an inquiry - an inquiry that has to be as thorough as it is independent and that should tell us exactly what happened."
"But, as honourable Members know from the letters I have received individually and collectively in this House and beyond, there is no simple solution here."
"Several options for a long-term solution are being considered, with the United Nations in the lead, all of them with challenges."
"I am very grateful for the work of this House, for the work of those who have travelled there and for the contributions I have received."
"We need to take this also to the Foreign Affairs Council and we need to discuss this with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees."
"Our Ambassador to Iraq arrives today, and she knows the importance that I attach to this issue."
"We need to pursue and make sure that we find the correct course of action here, but the inquiry and the condemnation are absolute."
"In Yemen, too, the Gulf Cooperation Council has put forward its proposals and President Saleh has once again hesitated."
"I spoke to him not long ago."
"We talked about the discussions he had had with the opposition and the proposals on the table."
"I told him that he knew what he had to do - in the interests of his country - and that he should do it."
"In my meetings in the Gulf, I met with the King of Bahrain."
"We discussed the initiative there for the dialogue without preconditions that the Crown Prince has put forward, and I urged him to pursue that dialogue."
"The current course there is not the answer."
"We need to see fair and civil trials, if there are trials in Bahrain, and that the death penalty is avoided in all circumstances."
"In all of these cases, it is about the direct engagement that we have and the pressure that we apply and the directness of our approach."
"Be under no illusion: we are very clear, I am very clear, with all of the leaders I speak to about what I believe needs to happen, and I do so with the support of this House and with the support of the Foreign Affairs Council of the 27 Member States."
"Of course I want to talk about Libya."
"There are Members of this House who wish we had a stronger defence and security policy."
"I say to them this: in the last few weeks and months, we have seen how far we have come in some ways, but also how far we still have to go."
"We did engage together to plan the military support for humanitarian needs: ready at the request of the United Nations to support the people with resources from across Europe."
"Just as we did when the terrible earthquake struck in Haiti - military hospital ships, heavy lifting equipment, civilians and military working side by side in that case."
"Do not misunderstand: I know that humanitarian aid is apolitical and that humanitarian workers must not be put at risk but, in the primary objective of saving lives, sometimes it is only the military who have the equipment or people to achieve that - delivering aid at speed, putting in place the infrastructure - and that is why, should a UN request arrive, we will be ready to help."
"We need to get faster and smarter in how we do this."
"I am the first person to say and admit that there is much more we need to do, and I will talk more of that later on this morning."
"We are improving our collaboration with NATO, sharing details of our operations for the first time as part of continuing to develop our relations."
"Last Friday, I co-chaired with Secretary-General Rasmussen the meeting of the PSC Committee and the North Atlantic Council in our first ever discussion on Libya."
"There is also our collaboration with the African Union with President Jean Ping, and the Arab League with Amr Moussa and, of course, his successor, and with the Organisation of the Islamic Conference and Professor Insanoglu, under the leadership of the UN special envoy, Al-Khatib."
"It was in my discussions with Ban Ki-Moon that we agreed to bring together the regional organisations for a meeting in Cairo and to follow up after the contact group meeting in Rome."
"We are discussing together how to play our part in the future of Libya - to support the national dialogue, to help with the constitution and to prepare for elections."
"I have sent two missions to Libya to meet with and work with young people and with the women in Libya."
"As the leader of my team said to me, it is the first time that they have ever discussed a constitution - words and arguments they have never known before."
"They talked of how they longed for the end of the regime, so let us also be clear: Gaddafi must go from power and must end his regime."
"(Applause)"
"I intend to open an office in Benghazi so that we can move forward on the support we have discussed with the people ..."
"(Applause)"
"... to support civil society, to support the interim transitional national council and Mr Jibril (we have had many meetings with him); to support security sector reform; to build on what the people told us that they wanted."
"They want help with education, with healthcare, with security on the borders, with the kind of support that we are able to give and want to give them."
"And with all that we do, the silver thread of human rights runs through our work."
"Then, there is the new Neighbourhood Policy - a different level of ambition and vision."
"Mutual accountability is at its core: the EU and the neighbourhood are responsible to each other for delivering on the commitments that we make to the countries and to the people of our neighbourhood and to the people of Europe."
"Building on what we have already talked about are mobility, market access and money, or the 'three Ms', as a simple way of describing it."
"Some things are extremely important to support these countries into the future."
"One example is the mobility of young people."
"These are young societies where young people long for greater opportunities, and the European Parliament has a big role to play in supporting those opportunities for young people to gain benefits and knowledge from Europe."
"So too with Member States: the opportunities to travel, to study."
"For businessmen and women, it is important to have the chance to explore new markets, to sell their goods and services, and they are in the gift of our Member States, some of whom have long relationships with the countries concerned, but who now need to step up and provide those opportunities."
"On market access, we know that we have a genuine contribution to make to stimulate economic growth and the recovery."
"You know the effect of this turmoil on the economies of the countries we are describing."
"Some of these countries rely on us as their major export market and the source of their imports."
"Allowing those countries to develop their markets could make a real difference, supporting not just the opening of markets but how they gain access to them, ensuring that they can reach our standards, and ensuring that they have real opportunities."
"Nowhere is that more true than in small businesses, but we have to have the political will to do it."
"We have to have the political will to be committed to ensuring that we make our markets available."
"That is a challenge."
"It is a challenge in any circumstances; it is a challenge in economic times, but I would argue it is a challenge we have to rise to because, if we do not, then the failure of the economies in our neighbourhood will have a direct impact on us."
"Then there is money, or rather resources."
"Not just what we can do in direct support - although that is important - but what we can leverage."
"We have already hosted a meeting of senior officials from around the world and from the big financial institutions to discuss what we might be able to contribute if asked, and will, but in consultation with our neighbourhood, we have to do more to support resources coming together more effectively."
"Nowhere will this policy matter more perhaps than in Tunisia."
"Prime Minister Essebsi's speech on television may help as the country moves towards elections on 24 July, but he acknowledged the problems of a country where economic growth rates are down to between 0 and 1%."
"We have to ensure support to Tunisia, to its economy and its civil society, and that means thinking not just of the long term, not just of the importance of a new strategy, but of what we do now and how we support countries - Egypt, Tunisia and others - right now with the budgetary problems that they have."
"That is the reason we have started discussions with the financial institutions, with our Member States, with those who are engaged in wanting to support these countries, because helping them deal with deficits when tourism has collapsed, when the economy is not working properly, matters right now."
"Honourable Members must understand that there is an immediate urgency and there is a long-term strategy, and we need to have both in what we do."
"On Egypt: I have been there three times in recent weeks and I have spent a lot of time with some of the young leaders from Tahrir Square, and also meeting some of the women."
"The women in particular are looking for the stronger voice that they believe they have been promised in the future of Egypt."
"I met one woman who will be a presidential candidate and who is determined to show that women have that role to play in Egypt."
"I have talked with many government ministers, and let me give you the example of the Planning Minister, Fayza Aboulnaga."
"She wants to build houses for people; she has a big vision of what building a million houses over twenty years could mean for Egypt."
"We need to take these big visions from countries with whom we are working and translate them into what it is that we can provide and support."
"So, integrating training and education, infrastructure around housing programmes, opportunities for small businesses to grow, working with UN women - as I am - to consider how we build safer communities around the housing projects, how we work together to design a much bigger, grander vision that is built upon what the Egyptian people want."
"I am talking to the Foreign Minister of Egypt, Al-Araby, who is committed to working closely with us on the Middle East Peace Process, keen to develop the strength of the relationship that we already have, and keen to see us as partners in collaborating in the region."
"There will be many challenges for Egypt in the coming months and years."
"We have to be there to support them through each of those challenges and be willing to put our resources, our knowledge, our expertise and our contacts in favour of supporting them."
"I have always said in this House and beyond that the External Action Service is a force to prevent and resolve conflict, so let me just mention, too, that this is why our role in Serbia and Kosovo matters."
"It is why the vote that we won at the UN, the voice that we now have, can play its part."
"It is why we have to engage the leaders in Bosnia to get them to get their eyes off the floor, to get them from thinking only about their own communities to thinking about the needs of their country, and to see their future and to see the European Union."
"It is why too we play a role in the Middle East Peace Process."
"Honourable Members know well that stability in the Middle East requires peace."
"The quest for a negotiated agreement has dominated the region for decades."
"We have brought new vigour to the Quartet in recent months."
"I hosted a Quartet principals meeting in February and the follow-up of the Quartet envoys has been working with the Israeli and Palestinian negotiators for the very first time since the Quartet was established."
"I wanted another principals meeting in April, and we have prepared a substantial statement based on our position."
"I continue to believe a negotiated solution is the way forward, and we will stay engaged and have another envoys meeting later this month."
"We, too, have been a strong supporter of Palestinian state-building, so when the ad hoc Liaison Committee meeting was hosted by us on 13 April, I listened to the praise for the work of Salam Fayyad, for his remarkable achievements in governance, the rule of law and human rights, education, health and social protection - sufficient for a functioning government according to the World Bank."
"I have acknowledged the importance of Palestinian reconciliation behind President Abbas as an opportunity and something that the European Union has called for for years."
"What is happening now is the most serious effort so far to establish unity, which is, in itself, key to achieving the two-state solution."
"I have been in close contact with President Abbas and Prime Minister Fayyad, as well as with Egypt, the Arab League, the United States and with Israel."
"Non-violence, the continuation of state-building and abiding by existing commitments will be crucial, and we must judge this effort by its results."
"I do believe that Israel should hand over the tax revenues owed to the Palestinians, but I want to be clear that our position on Hamas has not changed and Israel's security remains a key concern for all of us."
"I also want to say that I do not consider a flotilla to be the right response to the humanitarian situation in Gaza."
"I have been there twice."
"I continue to highlight the plight of the people, especially asking for more access to enable the economy to start to develop."
"The situation there frankly, especially for the children, is awful."
"We have put forward proposals to Israel to support that greater access."
"I want to see the people of Gaza with a future, but I also want to see Gilad Shalit, captive for years in Gaza, given the chance to go home to his mother and father whom I have already met."
"Europe's experience tells us that true democracy is the necessary foundation of tolerance, of peace and of prosperity."
"In North Africa and the Arab world, that destination will not be reached quickly or without setbacks, but building deep democracy is the only way that destination will be reached at all."
"We have the experience to help every country that asks us now to help them make that journey to democracy."
"It is why I am proposing to support the endowment for democracy which will enable us, too, to use our resources to support opportunities, particularly for young people, to engage in political life, to support the development of political parties, to enable people to do what honourable Members in so many countries represented here had to do themselves - i.e. develop the political process by building those political parties, civil society, and deep roots that mean democracy flourishes and grows."
"I often say when I visit these countries that it is not about electing a government so much as the right to be able to throw a government out."
"Democracy is about being able to say bye-bye as well as hello, and that is important: knowing that you have the right to use your ballot box, once, twice, three times, four times to change your government, to demand of your government, is critical, and you can only do that when democracy is deep and flourishing."
"It is why what we have seen happening in Cote d'Ivoire is so important, seeing President Ouattara finally take his place, and the role we have played has been significant in supporting that process."
"It is why it is good to see the Nigerian elections going well and Goodluck Jonathan now being appointed properly."
"It is good to see democracy begin to take hold and flourish and deepen, and that is what we have to support."
"Change does not necessarily ensure progress, but progress absolutely requires change."
"That means we have to be more determined to act."
"Some of the things I describe require Member States to act, some require the Commission to act, many need the support of this House, and we have to decide that we will all play our part."
"If we only do it when the media's attention is on those countries or on us, then we will fail."
"We must be in this for the long haul and we have to be determined in saying to our neighbours not just that they should start the journey towards democracy, but that they should complete it."
"There have been three excellent reports which I shall speak on in my next intervention, but I do want to thank the rapporteurs."
"I am going to end with a very small quote from an anthropologist, a woman I admire very much, Margaret Mead."
"She said: 'Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world."
"Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has'."
"Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, foreign policy has been dominated by the revolutions - some more peaceful than others - taking place in a number of neighbouring Mediterranean countries and, more recently, by a symbolic event in the fight against international terrorism, namely, the end of the Bin Laden era."
"What is Europe's role in all of this?"
"Are we willingly and actively involved in the situation?"
"Yes, we certainly are."
"The action being taken in Libya under the auspices of the United Nations and on the initiative of certain European Heads of State or Government has demonstrated that, when it wants to, Europe - or some of Europe - can act decisively in difficult times."
"Does this make us a key international player with influence to match our economic strength?"
"The answer is a resounding 'No'."
"Europe is still effectively a bit player, at best a Tom Thumb in politics and geostrategy, despite the ever-increasing expectations of European public opinion."
"Europe backed stability and development aid in the Mediterranean."
"Yet the people are - quite legitimately - demanding political freedom and are fleeing their countries because there is no prospect of a life of dignity and opportunity for them and their children."
"The humanitarian assistance that we have provided over recent months has definitely been useful."
"Baroness Ashton, we need to do more."
"Have we begun to learn from these events?"
"I would like to think so."
"What is worse is that the waves of migrants coming to our shores in flimsy vessels, who are dying at sea - and let me point out that we have inadequate information on the number of deaths - are all too often met by division, quarrelling, closed borders, with some countries even calling into question the Schengen Area, an essential instrument for freedom of movement."
"(Applause)"
"Is all of this worthy of Europe, of European values, principles and ideals?"
"I do not think so, nor does my group, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) nor, I am sure, do the majority of Members in this House."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the reason why we are meeting with the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy this morning is that we sought to give Europe a voice and a face under the Treaty of Lisbon."
"We now need to move on and take action."
"That entails making choices and sticking to them."
"What, then, are Europe's priorities?"
"Relations with our eastern and southern neighbours?"
"Combating terrorism?"
"A solution to the conflict in the Middle East?"
"Trade policy?"
"Tackling all of the above at the same time is no easy task."
"Who are our preferential partners?"
"The United States, emerging countries, or others?"
"How can we achieve the best results?"
"By leaving individual Member States free to define their own policy, as we have for the last 60 years, or by speaking with one strong voice?"
"Ladies and gentlemen, an intergovernmental solution is no longer the right approach to foreign affairs, security and defence: instead, we need more Europe."
"We need to move away from national egos and towards greater effectiveness at European level."
"Baroness Ashton, we will only have a robust foreign and security policy if we put all our weight behind and all our energies into a few clearly defined objectives."
"Ladies and gentlemen, 2011 should be the year of the Mediterranean, of combating terrorism, even of achieving a breakthrough in the Middle East conflict."
"If Europe is capable of becoming a key player in this area, it will be able to put the errors of its youth behind it."
"Let me close with a quote from someone very familiar to you: John Paul II."
"'Do not be afraid,' Baroness Ashton."
"We have made savings of EUR 4 billion in the European budget."
"Please come up with some proposals for using that money, rather than returning it to the Member States."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, in a European Union where we are seeing moves towards renationalisation in all areas, the Treaty of Lisbon should be used as a tool for creating a new community policy: the common foreign, security and defence policy."
"This is the first important general debate which we have held with Baroness Ashton and, if we look back to the early days, it was already clear then that there were certain governments which did not want the title of 'Foreign Minister of the European Union' to be used and this has ultimately led to the name of 'High Representative' being chosen."
"This is understandable, because, alongside tax policy and domestic policy, an independent foreign policy is one of the key features, you might almost say an identifying feature, of national sovereignty."
"Particularly in the field of foreign, security and defence policy, transferring this sovereignty to a supranational institution is a brave and also a difficult move."
"However, we in the European Parliament, together with the High Representative, need to ask a quite different question."
"This question is: What is the role of the Union as an independent body in international policy?"
"Over the last few days, I have read articles about Baroness Ashton which have astonished me, because they criticise her absence and her lack of policies."
"This criticism comes from people who think only about making their own national foreign policy and their own national interests the very top priority and who, without consulting with any of their partners, take unilateral decisions which will ultimately divide Europe rather than unifying it."
"We only need to look at the mission in Libya."
"There has rarely been a more obvious split in the European Union's international policy and in its international involvement than over the question of how we behave towards Libya."
"There is a tendency in the major capitals of the European Union to regard the EU's foreign, security and defence policy as a continuation of each country's own national policy financed with European money."
"The larger the Auswärtige Amt, the Foreign Office or the Quai d'Orsay, the more pronounced this tendency is."
"Baroness Ashton, you will undoubtedly receive broad support from Parliament if you say to these people that, although you respect their unilateral interests, the common European foreign policy cannot take the same direction."
"This policy will be defined by you, the High Representative, in all the areas of consensus."
"I am in favour of opening an office of the kind you have described in Libya, because you as High Representative, the Union itself, and Parliament as an independent body, all have credibility in humanitarian and political terms."
"We are more credible than the states which have taken military action in Libya out of necessity, but whose arms exporters also had the largest trade stands at Libya's most important arms fair last autumn."
"Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Italy and Belgium are the main suppliers of arms to Colonel Gaddafi's army which is fighting the rebels in Libya."
"That is not the sort of credibility which Europe needs."
"(Applause)"
"The credibility which Europe needs is that of soft power, which helps to establish democracy, which opens an office to support developments in civil society and which does not define international cooperation with the European Union in terms of subjugating others to the unilateral diplomatic and economic interests of the Union, but instead encourages policies based on an equal partnership between different regions of the world."
"That is my vision of the foreign, security and defence policy of the European Union."
"You have mentioned the three Ms: money, mobility and market access."
"In the next phase, you should add the three Cs: coherence, concreteness and the community method."
"In my opinion, with the three Ms and the three Cs, you will find partners in the European Parliament."
"We in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament know that we are still in the early stages of the cooperation between you and Parliament and there are certainly some areas for improvement."
"This is why I am repeating my offer on behalf, I believe, of the majority of the Members of this House."
"You will undoubtedly find more support for your vision of a common foreign and security policy here than among the 27 foreign ministers, all of whom I respect, but who all have one problem, which is that they are foreign ministers of individual countries."
"(The President interrupted the speaker)"
"You, on the other hand, are the diplomatic representative of an entire continent."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, on Saturday, I had a long meeting in Cairo with the new Egyptian Prime Minister, Mr Sharaf."
"The conclusion of this meeting, and my conclusion also after this meeting on my second trip to Cairo in the last two months, is - as you have indicated - that we need to give massive help to these revolutions in North Africa and especially to developments in Egypt."
"We must stop making our little paternalistic adjustments that we have announced up to now."
"I shall give a short comparison."
"Do you know how much money was transferred under the US Marshall Plan?"
"For years in a row? 1% of GDP every year."
"USD 162 billion in actual money."
"And what are we talking about and promising Egypt?"
"One billion. Not 162 billion, but one billion."
"Not in 2011, not in 2012, but in 2013, when we have the possibility to do so."
"I think that is nothing at all."
"What I expect from you and from the Commission - because it is apparently Commission money we are talking about - is not big plans about changing the Neighbourhood Policy."
"We need to do that in the future, but what I expect is direct budget aid given to Egypt as fast as possible, because by the end of the year, they will have no money in their budget and that could be the beginning of a counter-revolution in Egypt."
"Direct budget aid or cancelling the country's debts - that is the way forward immediately."
"An announcement today in that direction would certainly be helpful for Egypt and for the Egyptians."
"My second message is about Syria."
"Let us be honest, Baroness Ashton."
"Syria is a huge disaster."
"What is happening there - and I have no other words to describe it - is nothing less than an Arab Tiananmen."
"An Arab Tiananmen."
"People massacred by tanks and by snipers every day."
"800 people killed to date."
"8 000 people arrested to date."
"People tortured in the most brutal way in order to release passwords on Facebook and the names of comrades working on Facebook."
"Soldiers who do not want to shoot at their own people are themselves shot by the secret services of the army and of Bashar al-Assad."
"From what is happening today in Syria, it is very clear that there is only one way to describe Bashar al-Assad, and that is as the most brutal dictator in the world at the moment."
"That is the clear analysis we can make today."
"(Applause)"
"So what can be done? I see 800 people killed to date, 8 000 people imprisoned, some of them tortured every day, and we are freezing the assets of 13 people, but not Assad."
"I say this is an unbalanced approach."
"It is, in fact, ridiculous, and it is not helping to press the Assad regime to change its direction."
"It is not enough to say 13 people and one of Assad's brothers is there, and one of his nieces or nephews is on the list."
"No, there are hundreds of people you have to put on the list immediately, as fast as possible, to apply real pressure."
"I can understand your approach a little bit."
"You are saying that if I leave Assad off the list, maybe it will help him change his attitude later on."
"OK then, make that very clear here today in the debate."
"I want you to declare that you give Assad a few days."
"If, in these few days, he does not stop what is happening at the moment, then freeze all assets, not only of the 13 people but of the whole Assad family."
"(Applause)"
"Impose a travel ban not on 13 people when 800 are killed, but on the whole Assad family and declare what is very important."
"They are waiting for that."
"Yesterday, we had a link directly with people in Syria who are saying that you have to strengthen the sanctions, otherwise he will not stop."
"Declare that the Assad family will never be considered by the European Union as the real representatives of the Syrian people, and that they will be accountable for their crimes."
"Do it right now."
"That is what we expect today from you."
"You can help to stop this Arab Tiananmen."
"It is not true that we play no role: we play an essential role and the people of Syria are waiting for this clear message today."
"Not tomorrow."
"Today."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, the major development in the common foreign and security policy (CFSP) this year has undoubtedly been the establishment of the European External Action Service (EEAS)."
"Baroness Ashton, as Vice-President/High Representative, you have recently come under pressure for its lacklustre performance."
"However, you can only ever be as effective as the Member States will allow you to be and, of course, you are reluctant to use your own powers of initiative - an approach which I fully support."
"On the one hand, the EU wants to carve out its global role as a diplomatic heavyweight but, on the other hand, the CFSP requires unanimity, which means compromising to preserve the interests of individual Member States, particularly the big ones."
"This hybrid sui generis approach to EU foreign policy vindicates those of us who opposed the creation of the EEAS in the first place, believing then that the EU's global ambitions would undermine national sovereignty."
"Paradoxically, it now seems that national sovereignty is undermining the EU's global ambitions, as we saw recently over what happened in Libya."
"The ECR, my group, nevertheless remains constructively engaged with the EEAS. We wish it well."
"We hope it will work."
"It needs to bed down, and we want to see budget neutrality and more political accountability."
"Although the Vice-President/High Representative has made excellent senior appointments - I have seen some of these before the Committee on Foreign Affairs - I must ask why she has been short-changed in a stitch-up by the Commission, which seems to have retained a disproportionate amount of resources for EU enlargement and the European Neighbourhood Policy."
"This split does not provide value for money to EU taxpayers, nor does it serve our foreign policy interests."
"Can I now make some specific requests, firstly on the imminent Gaza Flotilla Mark II?"
"Can you, Madam Vice-President/High Representative, put pressure on Turkey to stop this dangerous provocation at a time when Israel is under enormous tension and pressure, with missile attacks from Gaza and the renewed passage of Iranian warships through the Suez Canal?"
"And how will the EU engage with a new unitary Palestinian Authority that has Hamas, a terrorist organisation banned by the EU, as one of its components?"
"Secondly, Madam Vice-President/High Representative, will you broker a solution for the closure of Camp Ashraf in Iraq?"
"Next, will you condemn forthrightly and totally the passage of the Bahati bill in Uganda, which allows the execution of homosexuals?"
"Lastly, I entirely agree with Mr Verhofstadt: I commend you in all your efforts to stabilise the Middle East and North African countries and, in particular, your condemnation of the killing of Christians in Egypt, but why, as Mr Verhofstadt has pointed out, has President Assad of Syria been left off the EU sanctions list after the brutal killing of innocent civilian protesters by his forces in recent days?"
"Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to put some questions to you today, Baroness Ashton."
"Firstly, on the subject of Syria, like Mr Verhofstadt, I would like to know what is stopping Europe from placing President Assad on the EU sanctions list?"
"Which country or countries are currently preventing the European Union from taking the only possible decision?"
"Please tell us."
"If Mr Westerwelle is the obstacle, then tell us that it is Mr Westerwelle: at least that way, we will know what is shaping different Member States' policy."
"Unlike the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, we are not going to suggest that President Assad is the answer to President Assad's dictatorship."
"If that is what we are being asked to think, it really is unbelievable."
"The only solution for Syria is for President Assad to relinquish power in Syria: that should be Europe's position."
"It is therefore obvious that President Assad and his whole family need to be included on the list - not tomorrow, not the day after tomorrow, but today."
"If that is not feasible because a unanimous decision is required, then you need to say what is hindering progress."
"It needs to be stated publicly so that we can have a proper debate in Europe."
"Secondly, what is preventing Israel from paying the taxes due to the Palestinians and why?"
"Of course we need to maintain security in Israel, but the Palestinians should not have to suffer in order to maintain security in Israel."
"That cannot be the solution."
"(Applause)"
"My last question: 600 people died on the Libyan coast a few days ago."
"A vessel was in the area."
"We have been told that it was not a NATO vessel, that it was not the Charles de Gaulle."
"Apparently it was a Maltese vessel."
"I would therefore like to know: what boat was it and what information is available?"
"Who failed to rescue the 600 Libyan refugees?"
"In the 21st century, surely no one is going to tell me that it is not possible to identify the ship in question."
"The lack of action constitutes a crime: that of failing to provide assistance to persons in danger."
"Mr President, Baroness Ashton, during the course of this debate, you will hear not only praise, but also criticism."
"To be honest, it is clear that EU foreign policy has failed in some areas, including in the Arab world, in Afghanistan, in finding a resolution to the Palestinian problem and in the conflicts among our eastern neighbours."
"The question that I would like to ask is: What is the reason for this?"
"With 27 different nations making decisions, how can we reach a consensus within the EU and within the common foreign and security policy?"
"It is obvious that foreign policy is a policy of individual interests."
"However, the time when the West could assert its own interests without taking into consideration its partner nations and their people is long since past."
"The EU must show that it is open to adopting a policy of reconciling interests."
"The main factors which contributed to the failure are double standards and a tendency to think in military terms."
"The Members of this House almost cheered when the UN Security Council decided to take military intervention in Libya."
"Today, I think all of us are at a loss when it comes to events there."
"What are we doing for the people of Gaza or Darfur?"
"How can we give the 1.4 billion people living on one dollar a day the right to a life of dignity?"
"My group is particularly concerned with this question."
"The revolutions in the Arab countries have one important demand in common."
"They are all calling for justice and fairness, both in the distribution of wealth within society and in democratic participation in political decision making, including international relations."
"The EU must respond to this demand."
"In order to achieve this objective, we must work together to develop international law and not simply interpret and implement it unilaterally."
"Mr President, Baroness Ashton, I have a number of burning questions on developments in the Israeli/Palestinian conflict."
"What position will the European Union take, through its Member States the United Kingdom and France, in the United Nations Security Council in September in respect of the unilateral efforts of the Palestinian Authority to proclaim a Palestinian state, separately, it should be noted, from the peace process with Israel?"
"This question, High Representative, is all the more pressing after Fatah and Hamas last week re-established Palestinian unity whilst completely ignoring the conditions of the parties, in other words, including the European Union, for a unified Palestinian Government, namely, recognition of the State of Israel, the renunciation of violence and terrorism and compliance with earlier commitments."
"In the meantime, Hamas is making clear that it does belong on the European Union's list of terrorist organisations."
"Hence my pressing question: how, in this new situation, will the European Union apply its own Quartet principles?"
"Conducting business as usual with Ramallah implies at any event letting go of these fundamental principles of peace."
"All of this will cause serious damage to European-Israeli relations and it is of very little help to the peace process, on the contrary, in fact."
"Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, the subject of European foreign and security policy is especially crucial at this particular historic juncture, which is marked by an extraordinary wave of protest that has taken hold in the Mediterranean and is also spreading across the Middle East."
"In view of this serious crisis affecting the whole of the southern Mediterranean and now spreading into the Arabian Peninsula, the European Parliament must act as a sounding board for all these protests by ordinary people."
"They are risking their lives, clamouring to improve conditions and to start the transition to democracy by toppling the current regimes."
"This House wants to deal directly with the High Representative and Vice-President, Baroness Ashton, particularly because of our role in controlling the budgets of civilian and military missions under the common foreign and security policy (CFSP) and the common security and defence policy (CSDP)."
"The first part of the report particularly concerns the relationship between Parliament and the other institutions, primarily the Council and the Commission, driven by the post-Lisbon approach to European politics."
"Another very important subject is the EU's multilateralism, which benefits, above all, from the recent establishment of the European External Action Service, which has at last come into being."
"In this regard, I have to welcome the recent resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly granting the European Union observer status within the Security Council, thus acknowledging what the Treaty of Lisbon enshrines."
"We have tried to produce an appraisal that corresponds to the current situation as far as possible."
"The report rightly highlights the great wave of civil protest in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya, and also in Syria, Bahrain and Yemen, and points out events, contexts and expectations for each of these countries, as well as other subjects of particular interest, such as our strong transatlantic alliance and our hugely important relations with Russia."
"Enlargement, support for civil rights and the establishment of the rule of law, diplomatic relations with the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China), the Arab-Palestinian conflict and condemnation of the bloodiest regimes are some of the subjects of the report that I am submitting to your vote."
"Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, the common security and defence policy (CSDP) is going through an extremely difficult time."
"Just when developments in the international system require the European Union to become a credible actor in security and defence; just when the European approach to crisis management through supporting democracy rather than exporting it appears to be more suited to the challenges of our times; just when the economic crisis makes the option of developing a common defence inevitable; just when the Treaty of Lisbon provides new instruments to develop the CSDP within the framework of an integrated approach; in short, just when a quality leap in the CSDP has become necessary and possible, the European edifice seems to be creaking dangerously and there is a real risk that the ambitions and possibilities of the CSDP will have to be drastically downsized."
"The report I am presenting seeks to tackle this contradiction and suggests possible answers for the other institutions."
"With regard to the Libyan crisis, we do not confine ourselves to expressing our disappointment either at the European Union's inability to define its position and take joint action or at the restrictions placed on the EUFOR Libya mandate."
"We believe the time has come for a European political initiative, in conjunction with our other partners, to bring about a ceasefire and to hold negotiations that will put an end to the Gaddafi regime and begin a transition to an inclusive democracy."
"NATO's military intervention is clearly unlikely to solve anything and it will do well to adhere scrupulously to the mandate of the UN resolution, avoiding any disproportionate use of force."
"At the same time, we hope that CSDP assets will be used effectively to provide humanitarian assistance to the civilian population under attack and that future operations will be planned in such a way as to support the development of democracy in Libya."
"The Libyan situation also calls for reflection on a wider scale, and I believe it reinforces the report's suggestions."
"Responsibility for the future of Europe and for security and defence, of course, lies primarily with the European Council, its members and also its President, who represents the Union in matters of foreign and security policy at that level."
"We say to them clearly that bilateral cooperation and coalitions of the willing cannot replace the CSDP as the Union's policy."
"We do not find the idea of renationalising this policy convincing, not because we are Treaty purists, but because, if it were renationalised, this policy would not be equal to the challenges that lie ahead."
"We propose that Parliament should enter into a strategic dialogue with the European Council, which we call on to discuss Parliament's recommendations, to draw up a proper foreign policy strategy and to devote an extraordinary meeting to European security and defence."
"We call on you, Baroness Ashton, to intensify your efforts to build a consensus among the Member States and to make use of your multiple functions to improve consistency between the CSDP, the common foreign and security policy and the other facets of the Union's external action."
"The European External Action Service is an instrument with enormous potential for this work."
"The report puts forward several proposals for the role it should play, starting with that of being a crisis management board able to provide a genuinely integrated response to crises, and we are delighted to see that it is taking shape."
"The Libyan situation also confirms the inadequacy of Europe's military capability, which is well below the overall high level of national defence budgets."
"It is quite obvious that strength only lies in unity."
"This involves pooling, sharing, strengthening of the European Defence Agency, permanent structured cooperation, development of an efficient and competitive European defence market, strengthening of the industrial and technological base, and enhancement of joint command and control capabilities."
"The inadequacy of these capabilities has been a factor preventing Europe from responding promptly to the Libyan crisis, starting with setting up a permanent operations general headquarters."
"The report formulates a large number of concrete proposals on this and other issues, such as the integration of external and internal security policies in a way that respects the primacy of the Community method."
"It is noteworthy that in this respect, the main pro-European political groups are united, and I thank the shadow rapporteurs and coordinators for this fruitful collaboration."
"Parliament is ready to support the development of a CSDP that is fully integrated with the Union's external action and is rooted in the values and principles of Europe."
"Baroness Ashton, we hope you can respond convincingly to us both in words and, above all, in deeds."
"Mr President, Baroness Ashton, Henry Kissinger defined the world of his time as militarily bipolar, economically unipolar and politically confused."
"Today, international order is multipolar in all areas and, due to globalisation, is politically complex."
"Globalisation implies, among other things, the dispersion of centres of power and the collective management of common problems and interests."
"New international organisations and fora have emerged - an example is the summit diplomacy of the G20, G8, G7, etc. - and there are proposals to reform the traditional international organisations."
"In this context of change, and given the international legal personality of the European Union, it is vital that we urgently redefine the role that the European Union plays on this stage and that it takes its due place in the multilateral order so that it can fill the role of a relevant global player assigned to it by the Treaty and which this institution is requesting of it, along with European society at large, dare I say."
"This process has already begun with the approval of the resolution of the United Nations General Assembly on 3 May, which will allow the European Union to participate in the General Assembly's work."
"This is an historic event and a diplomatic triumph that we need to recognise without equivocation and for which I congratulate you, Baroness Ashton."
"However, given the complicated nature of the negotiations for the approval of Resolution 1973, we can anticipate the arduous work that awaits you to update and rationalise the representation of the European Union, which is fragmented and dispersed and has an ad hoc status in each of the 249 multilateral agreements involving the European Union."
"This does not only depend on you, clearly."
"It also depends on the non-EU states that are members of the various multilateral organisations."
"It depends also on organising the most effective form of representation within the European Union, and by organisation I mean an arrangement involving yourself - the European External Action Service - the President of the Commission, the President of the European Council and the now residual participation of the rotating presidencies of the Union."
"It also depends on the Member States transferring the pre-eminence of representation to the European Union, particularly in the case of international organisations committed to policies for which the European Union has exclusive competence."
"Baroness Ashton, we can all remember the Copenhagen climate change summit as an example of the useless cacophony that is brought about by over-representation of the European Union and its Member States."
"We can also remember how well representation of the Union worked in the World Trade Organisation or in the Food and Agriculture Organisation."
"Moreover, we can remember how disconcerting multiple representation of the various presidencies of the European Union can be in summit diplomacy, or the dysfunction that can arise through not implementing the provisions of Article 34 of the Treaty of Lisbon on the coordination of the European members of the United Nations Security Council when the common positions of the European Union are put forward."
"Mr Schulz has referred to these flagrant dysfunctions in his speech."
"I am referring, in this sense, more to the Member States than to yourself, in the call to construct the role of the European Union in a more structured multilateral world order and to draft a real EU foreign policy, setting aside any renationalising tendencies and temptations that are appearing in a number of our Member States."
"However, while we are essentially appealing to the Member States to construct this role of the Union, we are also appealing to your commitment to put your capacity for political initiative and your services to work in order to raise the level of the European Union's external representation and rationalise it."
"We are at an historic moment for the world and you have the opportunity to lead the EU's international role with, for example, initiatives such as the one you have announced of opening a Union office in Benghazi."
"You can count on the support of this Parliament, and not only its support, in fact, but also its mandate to establish a rational, structured and coherent representation of the European Union on the international stage as soon as possible."
"Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. - Mr President, I would like to thank Members for their contributions."
"One of the themes that came through very much in what all of the group leaders said - although Mr Tannock pointed out that his group had never been in favour of the EEAS - was the desire to see, if we have one, the unified approach."
"I agree."
"I do not lack any ambition for what Europe can be."
"What I have to deal with is the reality of what we actually are."
"We passed a Treaty, and I joked that when the Treaty was passed, I was handed it and given a pencil and those were the resources that I began with. It is pretty much true, but we are not where we will be."
"The challenge we have is how to make sure that, not just this House and the desire of honourable Members with the passion that I feel here, but also the Commission, the Council, the Foreign Affairs Council, the Development Council, the Defence Ministers - all things that I chair and am responsible for bringing together - move with that same ambition."
"It does not surprise me at all, and I do not think it surprised honourable Members either, that on the way to this, particularly at a time when so many things are happening, we find that it does not necessarily work as effectively as you would like, or indeed sometimes as I would like."
"What we need to do is continue that level of ambition for where we want to get to."
"That applies in everything we do, whether it is the sanctions we impose - where we need the 27 because we need unanimity - or whether it is in the approach that we take on support for the countries of Egypt and Tunisia."
"As Mr Verhofstadt said, we need the support of the Commission to really move and change and have a new strategy and a new ambition in the long and the short term."
"Well, we support people right now."
"All of these things require us to shift and make changes."
"We are on that journey."
"I am not complacent about it at all, but I am realistic about exactly where we are."
"You can challenge me - and you should as often as you like - to try and make this move faster, and I will do so."
"But do not accuse me of a lack of initiative, of not being ambitious for it, and of not saying this loud and clear in the Foreign Affairs Council, in the media and elsewhere, because that is not true."
"I am really ambitious for this."
"I am really determined that Europe can be so much more than it is, but it requires us to get on that journey and stay on it together."
"It is difficult for individual Member States with individual constituencies to necessarily always be able to look at this through the lens of what is best for Europe in the world, and not what is best for the domestic situation."
"I understand that too."
"I agree with what Mr Daul said about neighbourhood terrorism and the Middle East peace process as being some of the key objectives that we have in terms of the work we do this year."
"It is why we have been so engaged, for example in Libya, on bringing together the regional organisations - the African Union, the Arab League, the UN and the OIC."
"This is really significant work in terms of thinking through how we are going to move forward in a process that it is currently extremely difficult."
"How do we get to the point where Gaddafi has to go?"
"We have the dialogue where people can see the future, and that work goes on all the time."
"It is absolutely critical and it requires us to have a united front."
"Mr Schulz said that there is a long way to go."
"I agree."
"We have much more that we need to do, and we need to make sure that the building of democracy is a big part of that journey, but we are on that journey as well in terms of what we can do."
"I like the three 'C's."
"I think we can become much more coherent."
"I think we can be better in cooperation and, of course, communautaire is the objective I know this Parliament has."
"So please keep the pressure on me, but do so also in terms of Member States."
"Regarding the Marshall Plan, I think what General George Marshall did with the initial USD 13 billion that he got from Congress in 1948 is an extremely good model."
"It is a good model, too, because of the different things he did."
"He got loans, services, advisers and the breadth of things that could make a difference, so I think that it is a good model."
"It is not the plan we talk about for obvious reasons."
"People want something that is new and for them, but it is significant."
"I agree with you about the support and the issues of debt."
"That is why we are in discussion with countries with whom those countries have that relationship, and it is also why we are in discussion with the Commission."
"I agree about the terrible violence in Syria."
"I am not in any way lacking in ambition for what we should do with Syria."
"What we have got is again a journey on sanctions."
"We started with the 13 people who were directly involved in the repression of the regime."
"There was a lot of discussion, Mr Cohn-Bendit, about whether President Assad should be on and there were lots of different views."
"I cannot just give you a list of Member States who said yes or no."
"There were strong views about how we do this, bearing in mind some of the situations."
"The decision was taken that for the first list, no, but we will look at it again this week."
"I assure you that my determination is to put the maximum political pressure that we can on Syria and to try and make sure - as I did when I spoke to Foreign Minister Moallem yesterday - that they understand the significance of what they are doing and that they take this closing window to actually change course and make a difference."
"Mr Tannock, you talked about many things to do with the support of the 27, your desire to see us get the proper resources and being short-changed."
"I do not think we are short-changed."
"The institutions of Europe are all focused in the same direction."
"We have got to make sure that the ambitions that you have for what we can achieve can actually be realised."
"I have to find the resources for opening an office in Benghazi."
"Supporting better our delegations in Iraq, which some honourable Members discussed with me this morning, requires resources."
"We have to find them, both by being better and more efficient - I agree with that - but also by recognising what we have to do."
"I have already talked about the flotilla, some of the issues concerning the Palestinian authority and the discussions that are going on - Mr Belder, you raised them too - between Fatah and Hamas."
"I made it clear that our position on Hamas has not changed, but I made it clear that we support ways in which President Abbas can bring unity with Palestinians with his technocratic government and with elections, which is going to be so important."
"We have not changed our position, and we are very clear that we are cautious in looking at this situation."
"I also wanted to make some reference to what Mr Bisky said when he talked about the poorest in the world: 'support life with dignity' was his expression."
"I think what we do with the Millennium Development Goals and the work that we are doing in collaboration in bringing development together is going to be so important for that in the future."
"Just quickly - because I do not want to take up too much time - I want to talk to Mr Albertini about his report and to quote from it."
"He talks about coherence and says 'Coherence requires, first and foremost, the political will of the EU Member States to overcome their differing outlooks'."
"Absolutely."
"We know that, if we are going to be successful in implementing Lisbon fully - and this is what the report says - we need that sustainable funding in the next framework as well."
"I agree with the report in so many ways, but especially on the need to be proactive in promoting our values and in using all of the policy instruments that we have."
"I am also keen to improve the dialogue that we have."
"One of the greatest difficulties we have is time - how much time to spend - and I want to make sure that we are using the best possible time in discussions with you."
"Mr Gualtieri, you and I had a good discussion yesterday."
"I agree about the importance of moving forward, particularly on pooling and sharing which will be part of the discussion with the Defence Ministers next week."
"We have got to make sure that we use the resources of Europe more effectively."
"It is a very simple idea to pool and share, but it is very powerful."
"We have big military potential, largely untapped, so decisions to use military assets and to support each other in pooling and sharing are something that we need to take forward. We are also trying to improve the work of the European Defence Agency and to take up some of the challenges that we have clearly seen in the responses that we have had in recent weeks, especially in Libya."
"Finally, I would like to thank Ms Muñiz De Urquiza for this report and for her support on the UN."
"I think in the work that I did at the UN last week I have demonstrated my personal commitment to the power of multilateral action."
"We have got to look at the EU in the UN system and in all of the other international organisations."
"We have got to be clearer in our voice and more prominent and more creative in what we do."
"That just leaves me to thank the first round of speakers and to say that I look forward to some final remarks at the end."
"Mr President, Baroness Ashton, in the discussion on European foreign policy and Europe's position in the world, we are agreed that there is a need for improvement because of a variety of different circumstances."
"However, we could follow the example of a similar area of policy which already functions extremely well, in other words, external trade policy."
"The European Union has sole responsibility for external trade policy."
"It is the only player and the only representative of the Member States."
"It is not constantly being denounced on the basis of national vanity."
"We may disagree in other areas, but here we are strong and united."
"It is time for us to use our strength to ensure that the people living in our partner countries can benefit from the values that have helped us: human rights, social security, justice and freedom."
"This new dimension of European foreign policy is something that we should and, indeed, must follow up to make the world a freer, fairer and more social place in future."
"(PL) Mr President, Mrs Ashton, permit me first to thank the rapporteur, Mr Gualtieri, for his hard work, and also to thank the other shadow rapporteurs with whom I had the pleasure of working. I would like to say that, as a newcomer to this role, I had expected sharp altercations, particularly since the report has a certain military aspect to it, but as it turned out, the work progressed very peacefully."
"In Mrs Ashton's first speech, when she spoke about the conflicts which have broken out in North Africa, she said that we do not know where they will end and what that end will bring."
"Of course, we cannot say that the common security and defence policy will be a wonder drug for all the world's evils, but development of the CSDP would certainly mean we would know more about those conflicts and that we could perhaps prevent or resolve them."
"I am thinking, here, about the conflicts which have broken out in North Africa and the Middle East, and also about the frozen conflicts which are still smouldering in Nagorno-Karabakh, Transnistria and the occupied territories of Georgia."
"It is to be welcomed that Mr Gualtieri's report covers many issues - it is a fairly lengthy report."
"For reasons of time, I will not mention many of them, but I would like to touch on two things."
"Firstly, the question of the operation of European Union missions."
"In the Subcommittee on Security and Defence, we spoke many times about how we must learn from mistakes or from certain shortcomings so that these missions function better in future."
"The question of the planning and management of European Union operations remains an open one."
"The ministers of the Weimar initiative have raised this in a letter to you, Mrs Ashton."
"We are hoping for specific action in this area."
"Finally, I would like to mention EU-NATO relations."
"I welcome the fact that you maintain permanent contacts with the Secretary-General of NATO and the Secretary of State of the United States."
"We must continue these contacts, so as not to duplicate what we do - simply in order to save money."
"We know revolution is not possible, Mrs Ashton, but we do expect you to take action which will aid evolution."
"(FR) Madam President, Baroness Ashton, you have faced many criticisms over the last few days, Baroness Ashton."
"Some are no more than cheap political moves and my group has condemned them."
"Others, however, cannot be dismissed out of hand and I would like to share my concerns with you."
"It is true that we do not always have a clear grasp of the EU's external policy, particularly in terms of what it is aiming to achieve, in other words, its purpose."
"Your communiqués are adopted but are often low-key, from which we can deduce that there are probably differences of opinion within the Union, which is, in itself, a message, albeit a negative one."
"So, you set to work, you have your meetings, make your phone calls, you give it all you have got, there is no doubt about that, but the results of these efforts are, unfortunately, diluted in the media ruckus, and hence the Union's foreign policy appears extremely weak in the face of the thunderous speeches delivered by some European Heads of State."
"Yet here you have an extraordinary political space opening up in front of you with the Arab revolutions, and the role of European diplomacy in that space needs to be made very clear, because beyond the specific characteristics of each country, it is true that everything is connected."
"For instance, the Fatah-Hamas reconciliation would have been inconceivable without the Arab revolution in Egypt and also without the recent bloody repression in Syria."
"Indeed, it is because Bashar al-Assad has crossed the red line that Hamas suddenly no longer feels at ease in Damascus and is considering moves to Qatar and Cairo, and that it wanted to hold last-minute negotiations when it had been negotiating for ages."
"These opportunities need to be seized!"
"So what is our current policy on Syria and the Middle East? As I have said, it is unsatisfactory."
"Furthermore, I share the anger of some of my fellow Members regarding the Syrian exception and now the exception for Bashar al-Assad, who has avoided sanctions."
"This needs to be explained to us better, Baroness Ashton."
"One more thing."
"Unless an eleventh-hour candidacy is received from Kuwait or Nepal, at the instigation of the United States, we could well see Syria heading up the UN Human Rights Council on 20 May."
"Can you really see Syria chairing the UN Human Rights Council?"
"Baroness Ashton, sanctions are not enough."
"Have you campaigned against Syria chairing the UN Human Rights Council?"
"Have you pushed for an international inquiry into the massacres?"
"Even if you do not manage to persuade the Heads of State - and I agree with Mr Cohn-Bendit here - say so, do not leave us guessing!"
"It is this ambiguity that weighs us down."
"As for the Middle East, I am not exactly in agreement with you."
"You have cautiously welcomed the Fatah-Hamas reconciliation, but will you engage in dialogue with Hamas?"
"Are we to repeat the mistakes of 2007?"
"As we know, the situation is certainly very complicated."
"However, I think we need to grasp this opportunity."
"Hamas has supported the Arab peace initiative."
"Both parties have made incredible concessions to form this government."
"In the agreement governing the formation of this future government, which will take place in a month perhaps, there was acceptance of the concept of elections, of the Palestinian Authority, of the fact that Mahmoud Abbas could take part in negotiations, and of the concept of the 1967 borders, which are both an essential requirement and an implicit recognition of Israel."
"So do not tell me that you still stand where you stood two years ago."
"That would be unthinkable for us."
"Baroness Ashton, the matter is urgent."
"Caution in politics is no replacement for boldness: they must go hand in hand."
"Parliament will always be behind you if you have the courage to provide a strong vision."
"(DE) Madam President, Baroness Ashton, we are still a long way from a common foreign policy which is really worthy of the name."
"You are being criticised for this, but it sometimes seems to me that you have been made the scapegoat in a situation which is outside your control and which is caused by the fact that the Member States do not have the political will to agree on a common approach."
"Let us take the example of Libya."
"First of all, Italy blocked the imposition of sanctions, then France recognised the transitional council in Benghazi without any consultation and, finally, Germany abstained during the vote on the resolution in the UN Security Council."
"There is nothing you can do to change this, but it gives Europe a negative image."
"In Syria, we should have imposed stronger sanctions, but here, we also needed unanimity."
"There are some Member States - Greece, Italy and Spain have been mentioned in the press and Germany may also be one of them - which are opposed to this."
"In this case, you must stand up here and say: 'We have only been able to put 13 on the list'."
"The need for unanimity is paralysing us."
"It no longer works with 27 Member States."
"We must make the next quantum leap forward in our common foreign and security policy."
"I would like to make this quite clear to Mr Tannock and his Tory friends."
"What can you do?"
"Make public the fact that European cooperation has failed and identify who is responsible."
"Make use of the community instruments, in particular, to promote democracy."
"I was surprised to hear you speaking here so openly about the European Endowment for Democracy."
"We are in the process of drawing up a report on the subject with Mrs De Keyser as the rapporteur and we are evaluating what the requirements are."
"I must make it quite clear that we do not want a second European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR), which is bureaucratic, slow, over-complex and unpolitical."
"We need a solution that is unbureaucratic, fast, simple and political."
"If you can bring this about, you will have our full support."
"(PL) Madam President, Mrs Ashton, one of the most moving moments of my life was in December 2007, when I was present at the symbolic opening of the border between Poland and Lithuania by President Kaczyński and President Adamkus, a ceremony held to mark the fact that Poland and Lithuania were joining the Schengen area."
"I would like to say that for us - people who grew up behind the Iron Curtain - freedom of travel and a Europe without borders are tangible examples of the success of European integration."
"I would like to make an appeal: under no circumstances should a return to borders in Europe become a political tool or an attempt at a populist response to what may perhaps even be real problems."
"The Schengen area is a great achievement and we should protect it."
"Thank you, Mrs Ashton, for saying that our position on Hamas has not changed."
"The problem is, unfortunately, that the position of the Palestinians and of President Abbas on Hamas has changed."
"I would like to appeal to you, Mrs Ashton, to ensure that the huge amount of aid which is going to the Palestinian Authority is not used by Israel's enemies for attacks on what is, at present, the only democracy in the region."
"I would like to remind everyone that Israel is the only country in the Middle East in which the Arab population can and does make use of the right to elect its representatives to parliament."
"Madam President, I should like to make this point to the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative: Europe's foreign policy currently lacks leadership, boldness and Community method, and this at a time when the Union has more foreign policy instruments at its disposal than ever."
"You, as you often say yourself, are in listening mode: listening to national governments and waiting until they have pronounced themselves."
"Then you present the lowest common denominator, and often at times when events have already moved on"
"On Syria, for example, what are you convinced of?"
"Should Assad be included or not?"
"What is your opinion?"
"We would like to hear that."
"Do you want to threaten sanctions or not?"
"You ask us, you did that in your reply, to put pressure on governments, so tell us which ones."
"Open the debate."
"Sure, Member States often lack the political will to act in a unified and decisive way, and they do not want to see you strong, but believe me, Baroness Ashton, they will not support you and will not save your life as High Representative."
"They are not a guarantee for you to stay in your job, I promise you."
"And also this does not change the fact that the Lisbon Treaty envisaged a stronger role for you."
"You are the rotating Presidency."
"You are Vice-President of the Commission."
"You can take initiatives."
"You should set the agenda."
"You should set out in front your opinions, your decisions, and then let Member States react."
"If you do not take initiatives, at least do not kill those of others."
"For example, the review of the Göteborg Programme on Conflict Prevention: ten years ago, it was initiated by Anna Lindh."
"The Hungarian Presidency started a review and wanted you to take it over, but you stopped it."
"I do not understand why."
"I can only recommend you dare more, delegate more."
"Follow Margaret Mead, whom you cited."
"Be the agent of change that we need."
"I promise you: only this will save your position, and nothing else."
"(EL) Madam President, Baroness Ashton, I think that you are right to feel wronged by the criticism levelled against you."
"How can you be to blame when you are bound by the decisions taken by the large states in the European Union."
"However, I have one more question: will those levelling criticism here against their governments do any different from what they are denouncing when they are in power in their countries?"
"I also agree with what Mr Schulz said: that until recently, European states were selling arms to those whom we have now discovered to be dictators."
"However, policy means foresight, it means prompt diagnosis of problems; otherwise, we are simply conducting a post mortem."
"European states are bombing their recent partners; at the same time, however, they are bombing and destroying the arms they themselves sold."
"Obviously, you cannot sell new weapons without destroying the old ones."
"For us, if the European Union is to progress, it needs to develop a policy based on principles of peace, detached from military means and interventions, and to promote the demilitarisation of international relations."
"The Union needs to liberate itself from nuclear weapons and to help denuclearise the planet."
"That will be a moment of glory for the European Union."
"A word about a neighbouring country in the Middle East: Turkey."
"Dozens of journalists are in gaol in Turkey and it still has 40 000 troops occupying half of Cyprus and violating the rights of Turkish and Greek Cypriots."
"This is where I call on Baroness Ashton to see promptly in Cyprus what we saw too late in the Arabian Peninsula."
"(IT) Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, the attacks on Coptic churches in Egypt and the killing of Christians are signs that religious intolerance is worsening, betraying the spirit of unity shown in Tahrir Square, where Copts and Muslims demonstrated together against the regime."
"Coexistence and social stability are essential for an orderly transition to democracy, but they are made impossible by this lack of tolerance."
"The authorities in Cairo must therefore make a greater commitment to protect minorities and to oppose Salafi extremism, which is a negation of the principles of modern democracy to which the Egyptian people aspire."
"Economic development, with the resumption of foreign investment and, above all, tourism, is unthinkable without tolerance, order and stability."
"It is therefore in the interests of Egypt and the world that Europe should grant generous aid, but this aid must be conditional upon an effective policy to protect minorities, in line with the 'more for more' principle that you, Baroness Ashton, proposed together with Commissioner Füle."
"(DE) Madam President, Baroness Ashton, current events in Syria are once again making us aware of the dilemma that the European Union finds itself in with regard to the Middle East and what is happening in North Africa."
"For many years, we have given our support to despotic regimes and dictatorships in the Arab world."
"Now, when President Assad begins taking brutal measures against his own people, we are, of course, dutifully condemning his actions and imposing half-hearted sanctions."
"This is not what is meant by credibility, in my opinion."
"For the Arab world, democracy and human rights have obviously never been much more than empty words."
"It is clear that attempts are being made to conceal the fact that Brussels or, in other words, the European Union, has primarily been acting in the geopolitical interests of the Americans in this region."
"In particular, the helplessness of the European Union in the face of all the developments in the area of the southern Mediterranean gives cause for concern."
"We welcomed the coming of democracy when the revolts and uprisings began."
"What is happening now in Tunisia?"
"At best, the situation can be described as chaotic, with the transitional government about to be overthrown again."
"Egypt has what seems to be a permanent or temporary military dictatorship which is persecuting the Coptic Christians."
"In Libya, there is a civil war in which the divided Europeans are intervening half-heartedly with half of their resources."
"However, the Americans may find that Syria is a hard nut to crack."
"President Assad does not even need to worry that the army will turn against him under external pressure."
"There is also no protective power which could bring him down."
"Nevertheless, regime change in Damascus would definitely have far-reaching consequences for the entire region."
"The first Syrian refugees who are arriving in Turkey may be the vanguard of a major influx of people fleeing the conflict."
"As a result of the current situation in Syria and Libya, we in Europe and in Brussels urgently need to develop an autonomous policy which is not dependent on or influenced by Washington."
"Unlike the USA, Europe is directly affected by events in the region because of its geographical proximity."
"However, we must not allow ourselves to be dragged further into the Libyan civil war or we risk becoming a target for terrorism and extremism."
"Madam President, with regard to the report on the EU as a global actor, developments on the international scene show there is an urgent need for the EU to act more swiftly."
"This means being ready to face global challenges."
"The Lisbon Treaty has created the framework and necessary instruments for such action."
"We should start by addressing global governance gaps."
"Examples such as the Copenhagen climate change summit, the United Nations General Assembly resolution on enhancement of participation rights - congratulations to Baroness Ashton - or EU participation in the International Monetary Fund show the necessity not only of addressing these issues, but also of finding a common strategy."
"The report shows where the effort should be intensified."
"One of the most important fields is strengthening our role and coordination in the United Nations system."
"The same applies to the international financial institutions and multilateral security organisations."
"All this will not happen automatically."
"It will take time and consistent and coordinated actions on our side."
"What we urgently need is a long-term strategy clearly defining the steps and actions we need to take in order to consolidate our place on the global scene."
"I hope that such a strategy will be proposed soon by Baroness Ashton and that we will have an opportunity to discuss it here in Parliament."
"I have one further remark, which has more to do with the Albertini report."
"This Sunday, there were local elections in Albania."
"I was the head of the EP ad hoc delegation which participated in observing the elections, and I have a message to share with you."
"The citizens of Albania - I am not speaking about the politicians but about the ordinary people - look at us - the EU - with trust and hope."
"They hope we will help them to find a solution to the very difficult political situation into which politicians have led their country."
"Compared to our global ambitions, what is needed here is a small step."
"How good can we be in our home field?"
"However, it is a test that we have to pass successfully and with dignity."
"(DE) Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, as shadow rapporteur, I would first of all like to offer my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Albertini, for his very positive cooperation on this report."
"In this report and, of course, in this debate as well, we have rightly focused primarily on southern areas and on the Middle East."
"I do not want to repeat what Mr Schulz, Mrs De Keyser and others have said."
"I would just like to refer briefly to the situation in Palestine and Israel."
"I believe that the reconciliation between Hamas and Fatah and their readiness to found a state represent a major opportunity, because founding a state involves commitment and responsibility."
"We must definitely make that clear."
"We need the recognition of Israel, we need peace in the region and we need a renunciation of the use of violence."
"(Applause)"
"That is extremely important."
"However, Israel must also recognise an independent Palestinian state in just the same way as Hamas must recognise the state of Israel."
"Only when we have this two-state solution can we also bring about peace in the Middle East."
"I want to look not only southwards but also eastwards, because, on the one hand, I headed a parliamentary delegation to Turkmenistan and, on the other, yesterday I was appointed as Parliament's rapporteur for Russia."
"Despite the understandable focus on the problems in the south, we must not forget how important our eastern neighbours are."
"Turkey also plays a major role in this respect."
"We should not simply regard Turkey from the perspective of an accession candidate."
"Turkey must also be our partner, in particular, with regard to the situation in the Mediterranean."
"However, it is also important for us to strengthen our contacts with Turkey when it comes to the Black Sea region and to include Turkey in our common European foreign and security policy."
"This does not necessarily have anything to do with the question of accession."
"Secondly, partnership with Russia is a very important factor."
"We want to establish a partnership with Russia, but we need to negotiate from a position of strength and self-confidence."
"This is something which we are sometimes lacking in."
"While Russia has too much, we have too little."
"Only when we are on an equal footing will we be able to reach an agreement."
"Although I am very much in favour of this partnership, which must be a strategic partnership, I am very surprised by the pressure that Russia is now exerting, in particular, in Ukraine."
"Previously, we would have described the members of the governments of Russia and of Ukraine as friends, but the way in which Russia is now behaving towards Ukraine is far from fair."
"The same goes for its behaviour towards some energy suppliers and we have also seen this in Turkmenistan."
"Therefore, we must make it clear to Russia that we want a partnership based on equality and on common interests."
"Our objective must definitely be to establish a genuine and active partnership."
"On the subject of Central Asia, Baroness Ashton, we want to become involved, but we have no representations there."
"I know that there are financial problems, but we urgently need diplomatic representations in the area."
"We want to buy energy from these countries."
"We want them to move towards democracy and to respect human rights."
"However, we are not really becoming sufficiently involved."
"Mr Morel is an excellent man and he is doing a very good job, but it is not enough."
"We need to establish more representations in these countries in Central Asia which are our neighbours."
"Either these countries will look only to China or to Russia, or they will at least have a chance to look towards Europe."
"I believe that this is important."
"Finally, I would like to make it quite clear once again that we want to give you our full support."
"What you have said today is absolutely right."
"We in Parliament would perhaps like you to say it a little louder and more directly, even though that is not always your style, because then we would be able to give you even more support than we otherwise do."
"Madam President, I should like to say this to Cathy Ashton: you spoke lucidly of the problems of getting agreement amongst 27 Foreign Ministers."
"But the Treaty of Lisbon allows you not to do so: you can form coalitions of the willing and build up a systematic form of reinforced cooperation."
"I think that if unanimity can only agree upon a list of 13 Syrians to sanction, then it is the imperative of unanimity which ought to be scrapped."
"My advice is to find the avant-garde, to forge a core group of politically willing states and work with them to forge a common policy."
"Madam President, Baroness Ashton will not be surprised if I express disappointment, not in the performance of the European common security and defence policy (CSDP), but in the fact that she still insists on flogging this particular unnecessary and very expensive dead horse."
"She may claim that the European Union has been engaged in some 25 missions with a CSDP label."
"Well, it is all about the label: few of these missions stand up to scrutiny."
"They are either missions better performed by NATO, straightforward civilian missions, or they are passive missions involving military personnel."
"They have usually come about because the European Union has begged somebody to invite it to do something."
"Currently, there are military operations being conducted by NATO in Libya."
"Having failed to get a mandate to enforce the maritime embargo, the EU has been desperately trying to get the UN to invite it to carry out a humanitarian assistance programme."
"The fact is that neither NATO nor the UN wants the EU pretending to get involved militarily."
"Of course there is a great need for humanitarian assistance and the EU could play a useful role, but not in a way that merely seeks to promote a misplaced military ambition."
"The trouble is that the very existence of the CSDP and all its duplicative structures is divisive and encourages allies to think twice about robust commitment to NATO operations."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"Madam President, would my colleague agree with me that, with regard to the UN, if there was a single seat for the European Union on the UN Security Council - which is much mooted at the moment - that would constitute a significant transfer of sovereignty from the UK, and indeed France, to the European Union?"
"Surely the current UK Government, of which he is a supporter, would definitely not support such a transfer of sovereignty?"
"Madam President, I would like to thank the honourable Member for that question."
"Of course, this is another of the baleful consequences of the Lisbon Treaty."
"I find totally unacceptable the idea that the United Kingdom and France should indeed give over their United Nations Security Council seat in order to enable the EU to sit at the Security Council table."
"I do not see that either Member State would be willing to do that."
"Unfortunately the Lisbon Treaty encourages that, which is, as I say, one of the reasons why we so object to it."
"Madam President, I should like to say this to the Vice-President/High Representative: I appreciate very much what you said in your first speech on your policy and what you have been doing with North Africa - Egypt, Tunisia, Libya - and especially the focus you put on the young people and women there, and your approach to deep democracy that has to be rooted."
"I think that is essential, and all of us here in this House share that view with you, so I hope this will be successful."
"On the other hand, I agree with many of my colleagues that Assad should have been included in the sanctions."
"As my colleague, Danny Cohn-Bendit, asked you, who is the one - or who are the ones - who blocked it in the Council?"
"Is it Mr Westerwelle or who?"
"Tell us, and you will find support from us if you are transparent and open with us."
"I think that will get support for you."
"Explore your mandate."
"You will have more support here from us if you tell us more about what is going on in the Council."
"Go ahead and tell us."
"I think that is true for coherence as well, as you and so many others here have said."
"In the Albertini report that we will be voting on this week, we also call for the national policies to be supportive of the EU positions and of you, and I call on my colleagues here in the European Parliament, those of you who are from government parties in your own countries: tell your foreign ministers and your prime ministers to support the common European policy and not just look into your own domestic interests, including in foreign policy, otherwise we will never get a common European foreign policy for which we need you, Baroness Ashton, to lead, to be ambitious and to be bold in your commitments."
"61 years after the Schuman Declaration, which we celebrated two days ago, we need more Europe than ever."
"What we want is very concrete: conflict prevention and civilian crisis management, Lady Ashton."
"We demand that in the External Action Service, we have independent impact assessments as a standard procedure for the qualitative evaluation of the security, human rights, gender, social and economic effects of each CSDP mission and we need more civilian personnel in these missions as well."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"Madam President, for a start, I pay tribute to my colleague who has just spoken for her tireless work on human rights."
"She talks about a common EU policy on foreign affairs, etc. But does she share my dismay at the hypocrisy of the European Union?"
"As she and I both know, the EU is opposed to the death penalty, and yet the joint statement by President Barroso and President von Rompuy on the death of Bin Laden says that it 'shows that such crimes do not remain unpunished'."
"Does that imply acceptance that the death penalty is a punishment?"
"Madam President, with regard to my colleague's remark, the death of Osama Bin Laden was not a death penalty."
"What took place was a killing, and I personally would have preferred it if the United States had apprehended him and taken him to court."
"However, that is not meant to be a criticism of her."
"What she is saying that Mr Barroso stated was not hypocrisy."
"It was a statement that was made."
"I might be critical of it and, as I said, I would have been more in favour of having Osama Bin Laden tried in an international criminal court, for example, but that has not happened."
"However, I do not attach any hypocrisy to this because we need a common European position."
"On the death penalty, I think things are clear in this continent at least - although not in other parts of the world, unfortunately."
"(FR) Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the words that you used during your first speech about your desire for there to be a Palestinian State, after inter-Palestinian reconciliation, are very important."
"This Palestinian agreement is a key political event, and contrary to what has just been said here, Hamas has, for the first time, agreed to the PLO and the Palestinian Authority acting as its negotiating partners."
"It accepts the 1967 borders and the Quartet's conditions, including the rejection of violence."
"A transitional government in charge of preparing for elections is due to be put in place."
"Therefore, conditions are ripe for the United Nations to recognise the Palestinian State within the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as the capital, next September."
"Leaving aside what you said earlier, Baroness Ashton, what further steps will the European Union take to recognise the Palestinian State and champion this idea before the United Nations?"
"Also, can you tell us what initiatives you and the EU intend to take to ensure that the Israeli Government hands over the tax revenues owed to the Palestinian Authority?"
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(DE) Madam President, Mr Le Hyaric, I see things in exactly the same way as you do."
"The unity between Hamas and Fatah really is an historical step forward."
"It may now perhaps be possible to make progress in the process of reconciliation between the Palestinians and the Israelis."
"Baroness Ashton has made it very clear that the second flotilla will be a completely unnecessary provocation which could harm this process."
"Would you and your group now distance yourself from your support for this flotilla in the same way as happened yesterday here in Parliament with the substantial involvement of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left?"
"(FR) Madam President, no, that flotilla is European civil societies acting to lift a completely pointless blockade."
"If the public authorities, States and ourselves had upheld international law, we would not be here and the Palestinians would not be living in the prison that is Gaza as they have for far too long now."
"(EL) Madam President, my congratulations to Mr Albertini on his report and for referring to the principles and priorities of the CFSP, the defence and security policy."
"Of course, the world is changing; the European Union is being called upon to face huge challenges and it needs to take serious action in order to do so."
"Threats from ongoing poverty, the social exclusion of large swathes of the population, spiralling unemployment, geopolitical changes in the Arab world, take particular note of that, natural disasters and immigration are the basic problems at present and presage tensions for the future."
"In particular, the question of immigration, which has become a sore point recently between Italy and France, has called the Schengen Agreement into question."
"In my opinion, we cannot ignore the immigration problem, but we must handle it cautiously and decisively."
"Yes to solidarity, but yes also to the maintenance of social structures."
"Any debate on the Schengen Agreement must, in my opinion, be accompanied by amendments to Dublin II."
"Madam President, I have words of sympathy and support for Baroness Ashton: I was watching a BBC programme recently on which you were being interviewed by Jeremy Paxman, who asked you some very pertinent questions and you felt very uncomfortable."
"He asked you from whom you actually take your orders and which of the 27 nations you can actually speak about - and I think those questions have resonated in the Chamber today."
"There is not one common policy, is there?"
"We saw this with the UN resolution on the no-fly zone in Libya, when Germany voted against it."
"How can we have a common policy when one of the major EU countries actually votes in opposition to two other major EU countries?"
"You have an impossible task."
"My words of support - and I was relieved to read in the Sunday papers that you denied you would be quitting your post - are these: as someone who is very critical of a common EU policy and of the EU taking sovereignty from my country, I wish you to stay in post for as long as possible because, while you are there, I do not think we are going to have much problem with loss of sovereignty."
"After all, when you were the leader of the UK House of Lords, and you pushed through the Lisbon Treaty, which created your GBP 313 000-a-year job, you actually said, over and over again, that this was just a tidying-up exercise and not a significant transfer of sovereignty."
"You said that repeatedly to the House of Lords."
"So there is no point asking you questions, because can we get an honest answer?"
"(ES) Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, the central factor in this overly broad debate should be the situation in North Africa and the Near East."
"We must approach this debate without extolling virtues - Baroness Ashton has rightly highlighted some positive elements;"
"I would emphasise the good or, rather, the better provision of information between Parliament and the European External Action Service - yet also without concealing defects, and a voice as sensible as that of Giorgio Napolitano, our former fellow Member and President of the Italian Republic, has reminded us of this recently."
"Among the negative aspects, and despite the efforts of Baroness Ashton, is the different yardsticks against which the cases of Libya and Syria are measured in the United Nations Security Council and also in the Council of Ministers of the European Union."
"Also among the negative aspects, Baroness Ashton, is the situation of Camp Ashraf: you are aware of the positive, constructive and moderating role that my group is playing in the development of foreign policy, and believe me when I say that the importance and sensitivity of the Iranian dossier has not escaped me."
"However, in spite of the warnings about the humanitarian aspect made to your services, to your collaborators, to your cabinet and to your Director-General, and despite the fact that I submitted a draft statement to you myself, you did not speak out until there had been 32 deaths and more than 300 wounded."
"You can draw your own conclusions."
"You yourself said this morning that we have to act and we have to be coherent, particularly in relation to the defence of human rights; especially by taking risks, Baroness Ashton, when there are lives in danger."
"My question to you is this: with regard to the Cuban dissident, Juan Wilfredo Soto García, who was arrested, beaten and finally killed, are you willing to call for an investigation to shed light on these tragic events?"
"If this investigation shows that there is a cause-and-effect relationship between the beating received and his death, are you willing to condemn them?"
"Madam President, words are tools, words are instruments and words can be weapons in foreign policy."
"Therefore, they should be used sparingly and prudently, but there are occasions when they must be used decisively."
"I would like to say to the High Representative that I sorely missed her voice during the very first few days of the horrors perpetrated by the Syrian authorities."
"I believe that the courageous citizens who were - and still are - demonstrating in Syria at great personal risk have missed your voice even more."
"There are rare occasions when one needs to speak up immediately."
"This was one of them."
"Let me now turn to the Middle East."
"I believe that withholding of taxes collected in Palestine by the Israeli Government is an ill-inspired action, and what is more, it is inconsistent first to demand that the authorities of the West Bank and Gaza should find an arrangement - an agreement - and when the agreement comes, to take this decision then."
"Moreover, this decision is extremely cynical as it is very likely that the European Union will have to make up for the financial shortfall in any case."
"So I support all my colleagues who have called - and I call myself - for a new impetus to a peaceful solution of the Israel-Palestinian conflict, which, of course, must be based on the two-state solution."
"(PL) Madam President, despite the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, which governs the common foreign and security policy, little has changed."
"Existing diplomatic offices have been given new names, but the Union has not strengthened its position as an actor on the global stage."
"One might wonder if it is possible to operate a common policy for the 27 Member States of the Union at all."
"Conclusions like this flow directly from the Albertini report, which notes a lack of will on the part of Member States to conduct a common policy and the statements of some representatives of those Member States which have created the impression of disunity."
"Similar conclusions are found in the Gualtieri report, which draws attention to the widespread overlapping of defence programmes and the consequent wasting of limited economic resources."
"NATO, therefore, continues to be the only effective force, and the Left-wing voices in Parliament, expressed in writing in a minority opinion and demanding, among other things, the dissolution of NATO, are dangerous and frankly anarchistic."
"(DE) Madam President, Baroness Ashton, the excellent report by Mr Gualtieri concerning the common security and defence policy includes an important stocktake of the situation."
"I would like to highlight four priorities for the security and defence policy which we should follow up over the course of the next year."
"The first is that we must carry out a realistic assessment of the joint missions and, in particular, an external evaluation."
"We must also incorporate them into our regional policy concepts."
"This applies, in particular, to the Horn of Africa."
"Secondly, we need to make progress in pooling and sharing military capacity."
"We must ensure that the separate route which the French and British are following is brought back into a common European solution."
"The European Defence Agency has ideas on this subject."
"You should put these ideas on the table and ensure that there is a public debate, so that we can make progress."
"Thirdly, we need a public discussion about a new European security strategy."
"The paper produced by Mr Solana in 2003 was a positive contribution at the time."
"However, the world has moved on and we need a public debate."
"Fourthly, we urgently need to come to an agreement with the parliaments of the Member States about joint parliamentary supervision of the common security and defence policy."
"If we, by which I mean you, Baroness Ashton, and this Parliament, can succeed in making progress with the common security and defence policy in these four areas, in a year's time, we will be very happy with what we have achieved."
"(FI) Madam President, I would also like to greet Baroness Ashton, High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, who honours us today with her presence."
"This is my first speech, and I would therefore like to greet all my fellow Members in the European Parliament."
"I wish to comment briefly on the creation of the EU's common foreign policy."
"Having a common, stronger voice in our foreign policy is certainly a good thing, but it cannot diminish the importance of the foreign policy of the Member States themselves, or its flexibility or independence."
"We have to ask: who does the EU represent if it is not the Member States?"
"Again, we have to ask: who do the representatives of the Member States represent, if the EU represents them?"
"It must be a basic principle that structures are not created twice over and that the Union's structures do not swell needlessly."
"That is so, especially because it is very questionable as to whether the citizens of the EU in general also desire integration in the area of foreign policy."
"(DE) Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, you have our support for the ongoing development of the European External Action Service (EEAS) and for ensuring that it functions effectively, Baroness Ashton."
"This applies, in particular, to the process of establishing the representations, where considerable improvement is needed as a result of the funds and the limited time available."
"In addition, it is a major problem that every European foreign minister currently feels the need to run once round Tahrir Square carrying his or her national flag."
"However, despite this behaviour, we must ensure that our common strategy is made clear."
"It is our job and also your job to achieve this."
"We must make use of the positions, in actual fact, there are three of them, which have been brought together in the Treaty of Lisbon and which you represent, not to find and then to implement the lowest common denominator among the Member States, but instead to take over political leadership, so that the common position is given a greater role and is so convincing that we can carry the other countries along with us."
"This is extremely important if we really want to make progress in this area."
"Earlier, you agreed with Mr Gualtieri about pooling and sharing."
"I would like to thank him, Mrs Muñiz De Urquiza and Mr Albertini."
"However, we need a three-pronged approach involving leading, pooling and sharing."
"Those are the three things that we should have."
"There are many individual points which we could raise here and which require tasks to be shared."
"What progress is being made in Ukraine?"
"Will war break out between Azerbaijan and Armenia at the end of the summer?"
"There are signs that this will be the case."
"Of course, there are also the major questions relating to the Arab world, which many of my fellow Members have referred to."
"How should we react to events such as the flotilla, which, in my opinion, is a provocative act?"
"How should we deal with President Assad?"
"How can we ensure that the People's Mujahedin in Iran does not receive any support, because I am opposed to supporting it, but, at the same time, guarantee that Camp Ashraf is not attacked again and its occupants killed?"
"We need to take a sensible approach in order to identify a common position."
"We will help you to establish the European External Action Service (EEAS). However, we also expect the type of leadership which will allow for policy making at a higher level and which will convince the Member States, despite the complex requirement for unanimity."
"This will only be possible with convincing leadership."
"We will continue to wait for the results that follow from the development of the EEAS."
"Madam President, can I start by congratulating the Vice-President/High Representative on her personal success in negotiating the compromise in the United Nations on EU speaking rights, where others had failed."
"Whatever people in this Chamber, or anyone else in the European Union, think about our common foreign and security policy, this is the most outstanding objective endorsement of the ambition that you and we have for the Lisbon Treaty, a foreign policy that has real trust and respect from our foreign partners."
"As Socialist coordinator on human rights, I also want to congratulate the High Representative on her strategic review of human rights and on the commitment in her letter to foreign ministers to integrate human rights with trade development and other EU policies and to achieve 'specific deliverables'."
"In this Parliament, we called on her to create a human rights and democracy directorate and to consistently meet human rights defenders in all of her visits, and we thank her for doing so."
"When she says that ending the death penalty is her personal priority, this Parliament must also give her our strong support."
"Our group supports Ms Muñiz De Urquiza in calling for greater visibility for the EU in the Human Rights Council."
"We back Mr Albertini in saying that the EU must act, as well as speak, in the face of human rights violations."
"We emphasise Mr Gualtieri's conclusion that respect for human rights can never be compromised."
"On behalf of my group, I also want to record our support on the issue of returning tax revenues to the Palestinians."
"This is our annual debate on foreign policy, and in the next year, we hope to see clear outcomes to the human rights review and significant steps to developing a human rights culture in everything that the European External Action Service does."
"(FI) Madam President, the events in North Africa have once again shown that the EU's common foreign policy is behind the times and ineffective."
"The EU's calls for a respect for human rights and democracy mainly look like a delusional Don Quixote in rusty armour battling with windmills, when compared to the lucrative arms trade engaged in by the Member States of the EU."
"Seven of the world's ten biggest sellers of weapons are EU countries, EU Member States, and weapons have been sold to Libya, Egypt, Tunisia, Bahrain and Yemen."
"Baroness Ashton, might it be time to make a ban on the export of weapons a priority for EU foreign policy?"
"The coordination of 27 different foreign and security policies is not the easiest of tasks, and you cannot blame the captain alone for the shipwreck."
"Member States have a right to their own foreign policy."
"We could, however, expect one or two things from the skipper, namely, initiative and ideas, and we are still waiting."
"Madam President, following the appalling massacre in Camp Ashraf on 8 April, the situation there remains critical."
"Another bloody attack could take place at any moment."
"I have just returned from Baghdad, where I led a small delegation of MEPs in high-level talks with the President of Iraq and senior government ministers."
"I have now brokered a solution to the Ashraf crisis, which you have seen, Baroness Ashton."
"It requires the involvement of the UN, the US and the EU and needs your active encouragement to achieve the resettlement of the 3 400 refugees from Ashraf to the US, Canada, Australia, Norway, Switzerland and the EU Member States, or wherever they have family or other connections."
"This is the only option that can avoid another humanitarian catastrophe, and it has been agreed by the people of Ashraf themselves."
"The European Parliament relies on you to seize this opportunity to save innocent lives and avoid further violence and bloodshed."
"Madam President, Europe Day this week was supposed to be a celebration of European national identity."
"It is not."
"It marks the ongoing replacement of European nation states with an EU supranational government, meaning above nation states."
"This is in contrast to intergovernmental, where nation states freely cooperate, but do not cede powers to a higher central authority."
"The Libyan no-fly zone illustrates the difference."
"The intergovernmental United Nations agreed a no-fly zone pioneered by nation states such as Britain, France and the United States, whilst nation states such as Germany and Russia abstained for their own valid reasons."
"The intergovernmental NATO is now conducting that operation through voluntary participation."
"In contrast, the supranational EU vigorously opposed David Cameron's proposal for a no-fly zone."
"It is ironic that the Red Baroness herself, Cathy Ashton, stood against this no-fly proposal, her aide reportedly calling it 'headline grabbing desperation'."
"The lesson of this is that principal nations act intergovernmentally while supranational bodies merely fiddle as Libya burns."
"(IT) Madam President, High Representative, ladies and gentlemen, your job, Baroness Ashton, is a very difficult one and you carry a heavy burden on your shoulders."
"I hope you will take my questions not as provocation but as an aid to reflection."
"Baroness Ashton, at the end of our joint debate, we shall vote on the report on the European Union's role in multilateral organisations."
"Two years ago, at the hearing that preceded your taking office, I asked you what your position was on the European Union having a single seat in the United Nations."
"You replied on that occasion that you had not had time to think about it."
"The Muñiz de Urquiza report contains the Millán Mon amendment defining Parliament's position on the issue."
"What is yours today?"
"Have you had time to think about it over the last two years?"
"Baroness Ashton, 17 May is Europe-Iraq Day in Baghdad."
"The EU presence in Iraq consists of two officials and one ambassador."
"These three people operate in the British compound."
"You would rightly like to find the resources to resolve the situation."
"To help you, I would point out that there are seven EU officials in the Bahamas."
"What happens that is so infinitely more decisive for the fate of the European Union in the Bahamas compared with Baghdad?"
"Would it not be better to have 17 officials in Baghdad, since we are close to signing the first EU-Iraq agreement in post-Saddam history?"
"Might they perhaps even resolve the Camp Ashraf drama in situ, since I am sure that your personal intervention could easily lead to a positive solution to it?"
"Baroness Ashton, you have already intervened on the subject of the Egyptian Copts; however, not only has the persecution continued, but today, it is a worrying element in the so-called 'Arab Spring'."
"The communications from the European External Action Service still talk of it as being a conflict between extremists."
"However, only Christians are dying and only churches are burning in Egypt."
"What is preventing us from acknowledging the truth, calling it by its name and extricating the Copts from their awkward position as hostages to a fundamentalist political project?"
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the turbulent events laden with uncertainties and hopes that are changing the political geography of the southern shores of the Mediterranean are increasingly posing a challenge to Europe and its external policy."
"In view of what is happening, it should be increasingly important for the European Union to be able to rely on a sound, consistent external policy capable of dealing with a difficult present and planning for a problematic future, in which international relations will be altered and the world will be profoundly changed."
"In view of the strategic repositioning of countries such as the United States, China and Russia, and growing shortages of raw materials and energy resources, Europe should develop a crucial, decisive role, but it is quite clearly showing itself to be unprepared for such challenges."
"For some time now, it has been moving too slowly towards coordination of the external and domestic policies of its Member States."
"There has been no substantial progress."
"Evidence of this is, on the one hand, the lacklustre action deriving from its external policy and, on the other, the obstinacy of certain countries that are nostalgic for a colonial period that can no longer return and insist on believing that they protect their interests better by doing things alone and not delegating anything to European authority."
"We need to turn over a new leaf."
"Baroness Ashton, you have an important role; please fulfil it to the utmost, in the knowledge that the time available is quickly running out."
"(SL) Mr President, Baroness Ashton, you embody the political ambitions of the European Union through the common foreign and security policy."
"I would ask that you pay a visit to Iraq, in person, as soon as possible."
"You need to be seen in Baghdad, and indeed in Kurdistan."
"The Americans will be leaving the place by the end of the year and there will be a great void after they have gone."
"However, the European Union does not have a presence in Iraq or, to be precise, our diplomats there are so few that they are invisible or unable to make themselves visible."
"What they want in Iraq is our and your personal presence, they want political cooperation, and they want economic cooperation."
"I welcome your statement today on Bosnia and Herzegovina - that was a fine statement, but you have failed to appoint a head for the delegation in Sarajevo."
"By failing to appoint a head for the delegation in Sarajevo, you are playing into the hands of many who are destabilising Bosnia and Herzegovina both internally and externally."
"Appointing a head would put a stop to that."
"(PL) Mr President, Europe is today facing two problems."
"The first is the need for a new vision of the Neighbourhood Policy."
"I was in Tunisia recently, and I saw how much is being expected of the European Union."
"We are in permanent contact with Ukraine, and I know that there, too, they are hoping for more - more opportunities for the development of social cooperation and more contacts, and they are hoping that we do not retreat into our European selfishness."
"I know it is difficult for you to carry out your work, Mrs Ashton, because you are on your own and it was not you who decided this - this is how the EEAS was set up - but the impression is being given that in the autumn, we thought Belarus was the most important issue, while today - a little like children who have become interested in something else - we are looking at North Africa."
"What is needed is a new vision of the Neighbourhood Policy, and that, today, is in your hands."
"In recent months, you have shown you are a strong person and that you are up to this task."
"Perhaps Europe should not, today, as in the days of ancient Rome, be defending itself along a Limes line, along the Rhine or some other place, but should be proposing a bold political vision, not just one concerning the problem of immigration, but a political vision."
"One might say that the fate of Europe, today, at this historic moment, is in your hands, Mrs Ashton, and we are very much counting on this."
"Mr President, atrocities are happening in Camp Ashraf - atrocities that we obviously condemn and about which we are profoundly concerned - but I would like to ask Lady Ashton what instruments we are using apart from words?"
"Are we considering trade measures, aid measures, and other concrete and real measures, rather than persuasion, which is fruitless?"
"Regarding Neighbourhood Policy towards the countries on the doorstep of the Union, I think this is the most important part of your portfolio, Lady Ashton."
"It is the core of foreign policy, because if we fail there, we fail in overall foreign policy."
"The naked truth is that we are in retreat and in defensive mode in the southern neighbourhood and the eastern neighbourhood."
"We have been taken by surprise."
"Lady Ashton says there are storms in the neighbourhood."
"That is the word she used."
"Where is our meteorological road map?"
"Time is a key factor in this policy and a scarce resource."
"In our Neighbourhood Policy, we are always lagging behind events."
"Even Lady Ashton's and Commissioner Füle's review of the European Neighbourhood Policy is delayed for the third time - and delayed in her office."
"Our sin is inaction."
"Foreign policy is about acts that change the course of events, not about words, series of meetings, fruitless persuasion and floods of statements."
"We should be using real and hard instruments to change things in Libya, Syria, Camp Ashraf and Belarus."
"Following Member States and waiting for permission from Foreign Ministers to go ahead has become Lady Ashton's doctrine and she treats it as virtue."
"It is the wrong approach."
"It condemns our foreign policy to the lowest common denominator and to always being late."
"We want a High Representative to lead, not to follow."
"Our debate has two weaknesses."
"First, we very often content ourselves with condemnation and making ineffective visa bans, which are ridiculously weak instruments."
"We also call for more money, to clear our conscience, but there is a lot of Arab money which is not invested in Arab democracy and Arab prosperity."
"(CS) Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, developments in North Africa and the Middle East are extremely important to security and stability in Europe."
"The Arab and Muslim nations here are going through a process of political democratic emancipation which might be termed the 'Prague Arab Spring'."
"Young people from Tunisia to Egypt, Yemen, Syria and Bahrain are demanding more freedom, more democracy and more human rights."
"It is not only in the political and security interests of the EU but, above all, also our moral duty to provide broad assistance to our Arab friends in their struggle for emancipation, because the values they are fighting for are also our values, and the successful fulfilment and application of these values is also a fundamental precondition for lasting peace, stability, development and prosperity."
"Broad assistance should not mean interference, however, because the development of civil society, democracy and the rule of law must, in my opinion, remain in Arab and Muslim hands."
"Only in this way can these nations and societies become long-term parts of the global ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(NL) Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to begin by congratulating the High Representative on the success she enjoyed in New York."
"Strengthening Europe's role at the United Nations is a good thing."
"It does lead me to a number of questions, however."
"What is our and your message to the General Assembly?"
"How can you get a single common position from the Member States without falling back on the lowest common denominator?"
"What specific action - Mr Daul asked the same thing - will we subsequently undertake in order to realise our message?"
"Mr President, we are all facing mammoth challenges to which we need to find an answer."
"These challenges are not only to be found in Bahrain, Yemen, Iran and Armenia."
"They are also to be found in our immediate neighbourhood: Belarus, Syria, Egypt and Libya."
"These challenges are very real."
"There is suppression, war and violence against religious minorities, refugees are flooding towards us and too slow a start has been made in establishing the rule of law and democracy."
"Baroness Ashton, you are our figurehead, the figurehead of the European Union."
"We cannot allow ourselves, the European Union, to be left behind in discord and indecision."
"You have a crucial role to play, both formally and informally, not just behind the scenes, but also in the meeting rooms and, in particular, beyond them."
"I am aware, I do realise, that you have to tread on eggshells, but you should know that we, the European Parliament, support you as you push on to convince the Member States that a joint European approach is worthwhile, push on to achieve an effective, coherent and common foreign policy and to be the face of that policy, push on in order to get the best people in the best positions in the External Action Service and push on in order to strengthen Europe's position and that of its citizens, who are the important thing."
"Do more, therefore."
"Do more in Syria and do not lend your support to half-baked solutions."
"(EL) Mr President, Lady Ashton, today, we are debating the key issues in the field of the Union's foreign policy and three important European Parliament texts on the role of the European Union in the world."
"However, the question that we are all asking in today's debate is if, in fact, there is a common foreign policy."
"With Europe delaying in finding its feet and appearing to be cowardly, weak and, for a long time, to have no voice in the historically important event of the last decade, by which I mean the uprisings in the Arab world, with the Member States failing to take a united stand on the critical UN Security Council Resolution 1973 on Libya, and with the Union hesitating on Syria, I wonder whether perhaps the question has already been answered in practice."
"We had high hopes following the Treaty of Lisbon."
"However, if the Council is not up to the job, when national selfishness and personal strategies prevail in decision making, then Europe and the European ideal have lost yet another battle."
"(DE) Mr President, I share the opinion of my fellow Members with regard to the unfortunate and inconsistent approach taken by individual governments to the challenges currently facing us."
"I also join with Baroness Ashton in calling for the debate to be extended to include the national governments."
"I would specifically like to ask what benefit government A or government B hopes to gain from pressing ahead unilaterally or from blocking a decision."
"What is the benefit?"
"It must be greater than the impact that we can have by taking united action in the Union."
"I believe that some governments would find it difficult to explain their actions."
"However, I am confident that we are in the painful process of learning from our mistakes."
"The financial crisis and the debt crisis have, to a certain extent, had a beneficial impact by creating a greater sense of cooperation, in particular, as far as the common foreign and security policy is concerned."
"Other speakers have referred to pooling and sharing."
"On 8 April, the EU Military Staff submitted 300 projects from the Member States in this area."
"I would like to know what you now plan to do with these projects."
"Are there plans to use this initiative to launch the permanent structured cooperation which has not yet been put into operation?"
"Will you ensure that the European Defence Agency and the EU Military Staff have central responsibility for implementing this initiative?"
"Mr Bütikofer listed four priorities for the next year which I largely support."
"On several occasions, the European Parliament has called for a White Paper to be drawn up on the security and defence policy."
"What is your opinion on this?"
"Are you prepared to bring together the existing units within your service that are working on these questions to make one department which could be called the operational headquarters?"
"(ES) Mr President, firstly, I would like to congratulate you on your work, Baroness Ashton."
"If you do not mind me saying, you are like a hard-working ant, who achieves results little by little while the grasshoppers chirrup and laze around in the Member States."
"Ladies and gentlemen, you will forgive me for not going any further, because colleagues from my group and fellow Members from other groups have expressed the same opinions."
"I just want to make four points, which could be seen as levers to help you act, elements to support you in making the common foreign and security policy ever more worthy of this name."
"Firstly, unlike the situation on other issues, European public opinion is 65-70% in favour of a common foreign and security policy."
"Secondly, this very Parliament, except for a small eurosceptic minority, supports federal European action, above all, in foreign and security policy."
"Thirdly, the most pro-European, most pro-federal Member States, which do exist: form an alliance with them ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(ES) Mr President, I would like to start with two initial observations."
"I prefer individual debates to a joint debate."
"We are dealing with separate issues, which deserve independent and in-depth discussion."
"Meanwhile, I would like to echo the words of Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra about the death of the Cuban dissident, Mr Soto."
"Please allow me to make three additional comments."
"Unfortunately, when all of us were hoping we could focus on the European Union's external role these years, the serious economic and financial crisis has been taking up all our efforts."
"However, a great number of external challenges, particularly in our Mediterranean neighbourhood, mean we cannot afford to wait."
"The European Union must have a political and economic presence in the processes of change taking place in the Arab world."
"I am also celebrating, Baroness Ashton, the fact that the European Union's voice in the United Nations General Assembly was finally strengthened in New York last week as the result of a vote that received widespread support."
"I congratulate you on that, given that last year's disaster raised worrying questions about the future role of the Union in the world and in international organisations."
"However, the divergent European votes on Resolution 1973 of the United Nations Security Council highlight the enormous difficulties - I stress, enormous difficulties - involved in achieving an effective common security and defence policy."
"To summarise, Baroness Ashton, you and Mr Van Rompuy, who also has many responsibilities in foreign matters, have the huge task of convincing the Member States of the need for unified and coherent external action."
"The two of you will have to work hard to push, drag and lead, at a moment in history that we had intended to tackle with the new instruments of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"(PL) Mr President, let us stop moaning that we do not have a common European policy."
"In some areas, we do have a common policy, while in other areas, we do not."
"In fact, as far as the Neighbourhood Policy is concerned, a common policy is in operation."
"The new Member States are able to support the West in North Africa in a unique way because the West does not have the necessary credibility."
"That credibility is provided by those who carried out the revolutions in the countries of Eastern Europe."
"In the East, we all have interests in these matters - in the East just as in the West."
"However, the old Member States have the money, they have the means."
"We need that money to pursue a common Neighbourhood Policy in both the East and the South and to build our credibility."
"While we are talking about policy in the area of defence - what kind of a defence policy is it in which Europe does not have an army?"
"Sixty European aircraft are operating over Libya - 60 deaf and blind aircraft."
"There is no intelligence service, and these aircraft are not in a position to carry out their mission effectively."
"If the Americans had not joined the mission at the beginning, the mission would not have achieved anything."
"There would be no effect at all."
"So let us stop moaning that we do not have a common policy."
"As long as we do not have a common army, we will not have a common policy on security and defence."
"(FR) Mr President, Baroness Ashton, the Libyan crisis has, unfortunately, once again illustrated the European Union's difficulties in existing diplomatically and militarily."
"However, it would be most unfair to blame you solely for the lack of political will displayed by the Union, even if many of us believe that more decisive action could have been and should have been taken."
"It is also true that the Member States bear a great deal of responsibility for this inability to come up with a coherent, effective and visible policy on this matter, while our US friends relied heavily on Europe to act."
"The Libyan crisis aside, however, we must be mindful of the major strategic developments that mean that we must not give up on the ambition of a common security and defence policy, as enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon, and which you, Baroness Ashton, must continue to inspire, support and speak up for."
"Taken together, the unprecedented fiscal constraints on defence budgets, the many international crises and the United States' strategic redeployment are significant factors that leave us no choice but to take our destiny into our own hands."
"Faced with these many crises and threats, we cannot just hand over the keys to our US friends and allies or to NATO."
"Neither the United States nor NATO was able to end the 2008 conflict between Georgia and Russia, for example, and nor can the United States or NATO observe the current ceasefire there."
"It is the European mission that has full legitimacy."
"We can clearly see in Libya that the United States did not want to be in the front line and that NATO's minimum undertaking is insufficient."
"Baroness Ashton, the common security and defence policy is not just something achieved over 10 years or just an ambition enshrined in the Treaties."
"It is also a strategic requirement, and you must be at the forefront taking the necessary initiatives."
"(Applause)"
"(SL) Mr President, in the future, we can only expect ever more challenges in the area of foreign policy and security, which makes the emphasis on credibility even more important."
"Without credibility, we cannot be effective."
"Credibility means, first of all, adherence to our values and principles."
"Madam Ashton, I agree with you that we must not forget the origins from which the European Union was born."
"Many years ago, it put the human being centre-stage."
"Let us honour human dignity and all cultural identities and let us make a greater contribution to the inter-cultural dialogue."
"The world expects the European Union to play a stronger role, not to have 27 individual foreign policies."
"Greater unity does not mean that we have to lose diversity."
"To conclude, I would emphasise three matters:"
"first: we urgently need to break the deadlock in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as a new outbreak of violence is possible;"
"second: we urgently need to find a way to a unified and strategic relationship with Turkey, of which there has hardly been any mention today;"
"third: I am pleased to see your determination with regard to Camp Ashraf; our voice in opposition to violence against civilians must be clear and decisive there and everywhere else in the world."
"(ES) Mr President, on 29 July 2009, Iraqi troops violently stormed the Iranian refugee camp in Ashraf and shot or beat to death 11 people living there."
"The attack was repeated on 8 April this year, when 35 were killed, either by bullet wounds or by being crushed by armoured vehicles."
"Baroness Ashton, you were warned months ago by Members of Parliament that this latest massacre was going to occur, and we repeatedly asked you to act on this."
"You ignored our warnings for months and only reacted after the catastrophe."
"Although better late than never, the next aggression could be a bloodbath of horrendous proportions if you fail to make this humanitarian crisis one of the top priorities on your agenda right now."
"There is a solution, as Mr Stevenson explained to you."
"We hope you will take immediate and firm action to make it possible, and we welcome the commitment you made this morning."
"Three thousand four hundred defenceless men and women, surrounded by tanks, are looking to us, trusting that our actions will match up to our values."
"Parliament has done, is doing and will do everything in its power."
"We are asking you to have the same interest in saving these lives."
"If you act as we hope, you will have us at your side."
"If not, your conscience and this Chamber will hold you to account."
"(FR) Mr President, the European Union has finally imposed sanctions on Syria."
"Unfortunately, however, it appears to have done so with some trepidation, taking care to avoid calling the head of the Syrian regime into question."
"This lack of determination and clarity is obviously interpreted by the demonstrators as a form of abandonment and by the authorities as an indulgence enabling them to step up their repression, a repression so cruel that it is unimaginable that Syria may be elected to sit on the UN's Human Rights Council when the country's authorities are right now refusing UN observers access to the city of Deraa, the scene of terrible violence against unarmed civilians."
"Having Syria on the Human Rights Council would be an insult to the victims and their families, and an encouragement for that regime to use brute force against its own people, with complete disregard for the values that the Human Rights Council is supposed to uphold."
"So, Baroness Ashton, what diplomatic options do you have in mind in order to avoid such a disaster?"
"(SV) Mr President, as I only have one minute, I will be very brief."
"Two of my fellow Members have already mentioned the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh and the fact that the situation there is getting more complicated."
"All of the reports also indicate that the situation has changed dramatically over the last few weeks."
"In light of the fact that certain military movements can be observed in the areas of Azerbaijan occupied by Armenia, in other words Nagorno-Karabakh, my question is whether you, Baroness Ashton, are aware of the developments in the situation and whether you are doing anything to prevent a possible escalation, not only in this conflict, but also in the occupied territories of Georgia?"
"I would merely like to bring this matter up with you as a starting point and I will also send you a written question later. Thank you."
"Mr President, how can the EU be a force for law and human security without identifying and trying the criminals who let refugees die in the Mediterranean."
"Baroness Ashton, Bashar al-Assad should not just top the list of those subject to EU sanctions but should be put on the list of criminals to be tried by the ICC or European courts for the brutal repression of the Syrian people."
"In Libya, besides the office in Benghazi, the EU should have already employed EUFOR, not just to support humanitarian assistance to the people under attack as in Misrata, but to implement the arms embargo via sea or land borders as recommended by this Parliament."
"For that, we do not need any other UN resolution or request; all we need is political will from Member States."
"If you take the initiative, Lady Ashton, and confront EU governments with their responsibilities, this Parliament will strongly back you."
"Finally, as Palestinian reconciliation is a major step ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, while unrest in the Middle East and North Africa requires the European Union to play a greater role in the Mediterranean region, I would like to raise the point of the second flotilla to Gaza."
"We all remember the outcome of the first flotilla and its consequences for talks and attempts to resume the peace process in the Middle East."
"As you mentioned, Madam Vice-President/High Representative, you doubt that a new initiative of this kind would end in a more positive way."
"I would like to ask if you can update us on actual humanitarian needs in Gaza, as well as on the goods and support currently channelled through the existing crossing points from Israel and Egypt."
"Did you, or do you intend to, engage with Member States and with the Israeli authorities to discuss the development of this initiative and maybe to propose a positive contribution by the European Union that could lead to a more responsible outcome?"
"Mr President, my comments are for Baroness Ashton."
"Vice-President/High Representative Ashton, you have very clearly heard this morning that Parliament will fully support your leadership role and is demanding that you take the initiative in our common foreign and security policy."
"You have also heard the many questions by colleagues about who and which Member States are blocking our common efforts."
"My suggestion to you would be that, now that the European External Action Service is putting in place its rules on access to information and access to documents, please make this a modern organisation which is accessible to citizens and which does not deal with foreign policy as if it were only the domain of some secretive diplomats."
"I am sure this would be the best way to boost our common efforts for a truly common foreign and security policy."
"(NL) Mr President, Baroness Ashton, there is a major threat in the Middle East."
"There is discrimination, including structural discrimination, against Christians in various Islamic countries."
"The Christian community in Iraq has already been more than halved."
"We are now seeing the same thing happening in Egypt."
"There are attacks on the ancient Coptic community, there are innumerable cases of daily harassment, forced marriages, and it is pretty much impossible to build a church."
"Last February, I received 60 Copts here and they called out for help."
"I therefore have two requests of you, Baroness Ashton."
"Make the Copts a top priority in your policy."
"A stop must be put to the systematic discrimination against them."
"Secondly, on 20 January, we asked, in this House, for an EU strategy for freedom of religion and the permanent monitoring of such a policy."
"Will you make that a reality, please."
"I would appreciate your reaction."
"Thank you for your patience."
"(PT) Mr President, the foreign, security and defence policies of the European Union are principally policies in defence of the economic and geostrategic interests of the European powers."
"Increasingly, they are aligned with the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), and relegate cooperation and development aid to second place."
"The results of this are largely catastrophic, as is clear from the cases of Afghanistan, Palestine, Iraq, Libya and other countries."
"In general, there is a policy of double standards protecting the economic interests of European arms manufacturers, which have made millions by selling arms to dictators who have subsequently used them to massacre their own people and those of neighbouring states."
"Consequently, some of the key questions arising from this debate are whether policies on the arms trade will finally be changed, and what exactly is going to be done to put an end to the expansionist and warmongering policies of Israel ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(SK) Mr President, Baroness Ashton, it is clear to us all that we cannot expect you to set up extensive security operations in crisis areas throughout the world in the short time that has elapsed since the creation of your office."
"On the other hand, your office already provides you with extensive scope for negotiating in any place where the EU can play a useful role through its opinions and political influence."
"One of the problems directly affecting the EU and where there is a need to look for a solution through sensitive round-table negotiations is the occupation of EU territory by the Turkish army in Cyprus."
"Turkey is a privileged partner of the EU and, on the outside, declares a definite interest in becoming a full member of our European group."
"I therefore firmly believe that you should make full use of the potential that is already available to you through your role in solving this thorny issue, in which the EU is directly involved."
"Mr President, it is self-evident that foreign and security policy is the defining role of a sovereign state."
"To make it the role of a supranational authority ignores or devalues the vital question of relations between Member States, or is, in fact, an admission that they are no longer sovereign states."
"There is nothing wrong with an EU policy of avoiding all European wars, but I would reject the supposition that a surrender of sovereignty is necessary to achieve that."
"It should also be the function of every European state to defend Europe's great achievements from distraction or dilution."
"Aggressive wars in which European nations have no legitimate interest must be avoided at all costs."
"Equally, we must not engage in behind-the-scenes agitation in a hypocritical attempt to plant so-called 'European values' in inhospitable soil."
"We must avoid Europe being the repository of migrating Third-Worlders."
"Their cultures are the product of distinctive peoples."
"Bring the population of the Third World to Europe ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank Baroness Ashton for the report she has put before us today."
"However, I should like to point out to her that public opinion in Europe is unfortunately not aware of the European Union's presence."
"As many of my fellow Members have also mentioned, our external policy is still in a rudimentary state, as can be seen from certain events that have happened in recent days."
"Europe cannot remain absent from Camp Ashraf: it is a camp where not only international policy is measured but also human rights protection."
"It is our duty to intervene in that part of the world, just as it is in Syria."
"This country is in a really very serious situation, in which human rights and the chance to oppose a dictatorial government must get the European Union interested ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, only one remark: I think Ankara's increasingly active foreign policy poses new challenges and opportunities for European foreign policy."
"Madam High Representative, I think that it is necessary to establish an institutionalised dialogue on key strategic issues such as energy policy, stability in the Western Balkans and the Caucasus regions, Iran's nuclear dossier or the democratic awakening under way in the Middle East."
"Turkey, in particular, can play a constructive role in helping the EU consolidate the gains of the recent democratic awakening in the Middle East."
"However, such dialogue should not substitute but complement and reinforce Turkey's accession track."
"Mr Albertini now has the floor to speak for the two minutes he has remaining as rapporteur."
"Mr President, in my first speech I had four minutes available and I only used up two."
"Now that I have two minutes, I would like to ask to be allowed to use four minutes for my final speech."
"You are quite right that you have four minutes."
"You say you have used two, so you have two left, if that is the case."
"You have four minutes for your speech."
"(IT) No, Mr President, in my first speech, I spoke for two minutes and I had four minutes available ..."
"Mr Albertini, you have four minutes for your two speeches."
"You have used two."
"Please take the floor and we will be flexible, but I obviously do not want to get to a point where nobody will hear you."
"I want you to be heard, and if we waste another five minutes, nobody is going to listen to what you have to say."
"(IT) Mr President, since I will not manage to say what I had to say in two minutes, I will give up my speech."
"Many thanks, Mr Albertini."
"We are all grateful to you and it is a pity we cannot listen to you."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe Mr Albertini was right because as rapporteur, he had four minutes for his speech and two for his reply."
"I therefore take the liberty of pointing out that he should have his four minutes."
"For my part, I think this has been a useful and important debate, which shows how united Parliament is and how ready it is to offer its support for consistent and effective external action by Europe."
"We have not only heard recriminations for the obvious limitations shown by Europe in recent events, but we have also heard proposals offering a kind of strategic partnership between Parliament and the other institutions in order to make Europe a credible actor in security and defence matters."
"I believe this partnership would be not only an opportunity but a necessity as well because, if what we have been saying is true, which is that Europe's integrated approach is its main potential, achieving that integrated approach will require the support of a body endowed with clear legislative and budgetary powers."
"For that reason as well, I think we should find a balanced solution to the matter of interparliamentary cooperation."
"It has become clear from the discussion how we must act."
"We must first of all assess the possibilities offered by the Treaty: by permanent structured cooperation and by Article 44, which makes it possible to delegate the task of carrying out a mission to particular Member States, but within an EU procedural framework, which is not the same thing as renationalisation."
"We need to make use of existing structures - starting with the European External Action Service - and set ourselves ambitious tasks in the field of capabilities."
"Of course, we also need to know how to offer leadership ability."
"We would like to thank Baroness Ashton for her commitment and for the important statements she has made."
"It is an attractive thought, as she said, that a small group can do great things, but Europe is a great civilised power which cannot shirk its responsibilities."
"Mr Albertini, please accept my apologies."
"I have found out exactly what the situation was."
"You had four minutes plus two."
"You spoke for three minutes in your first speech."
"Therefore, you have three minutes left and we will proceed with all the flexibility required."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, during a hearing in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, a Member asked the High Representative/Vice-President a loaded question."
"He said that, when Henry Kissinger was criticised for the United States' isolationist stance, particularly in relation to the European Union, he replied 'There is no fellow foreign minister nor a phone number I can call to speak to Europe'."
"The Member then asked Baroness Ashton, 'Is there a foreign minister and a phone number he can call now?'"
"Her very British answer was: 'Yes, I do that job, although I am called High Representative/Vice-President and not foreign minister."
"There is also a phone number, but it is answered by a machine saying to press 1 for the British position, 2 for the French, 3 for the German, and so on'."
"Baroness Ashton, you have heard the speeches by many of my fellow Members, and this message is also in my report."
"You have a number of voices in the world, but you listen to ours - Parliament's - more because we always support a European policy, and not just that of the Member States, to which you reply in the Council, or that of the Commission, to which you reply in the appropriate places."
"I would like there to be a third place in which you could express your third loyalty."
"This place is in the middle of this Chamber, behind the podium, because you are the Council, the Commission and also Parliament."
"I believe this dialogue needs to be developed and strengthened in order to achieve democratic legitimacy for our external policy, directed and controlled by Europe's citizens."
"We will help you carry out this role."
"Mr President, with regard to Camp Ashraf, we can do nothing less than join in the condemnation of the human rights violations that have taken place there."
"However, this condemnation of human rights abuses must never be confused with political support for the movement in Camp Ashraf."
"There is a democratic opposition in Iran, represented by the Green Movement, by various political groups within the Green Movement, and the condemnation of human rights violations should in no way be confused with political support for this group."
"In addition, I ask the Vice-President of the Commission and High Representative that, when she launches or opens this investigation into the situation in Camp Ashraf, that she also investigate the human rights abuses being committed against the population by the Mujahedin, which have been witnessed and documented by organisations such as Human Rights Watch."
"In relation to my report, Baroness Ashton, I would particularly like you to take note of paragraph 6, which calls for the drafting of a White Paper with a strategic focus on the European Union's role in international organisations through to 2020."
"I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their help in preparing and drafting this report, and I would also like to decry the fact that some infinitely small-minded political forces in Parliament prevented my report from mentioning an academic organisation that contributed a study to serve as its basis."
"This was the Fundación Alternativas, which provided a good foundation for me, as well as the shadow rapporteurs and the secretariat, in our work to produce this report."
"I hope the report will prove useful in politically determining and stimulating the redefinition of the European Union's role in international organisations."
"I would like to say to Mr Stevenson that a decision was made before I took the chair not to use the blue card procedure in this debate, precisely in order to be able to give the floor to all Members who asked to speak."
"Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. - Mr President, I should like to thank honourable Members for what has been a full-ranging debate."
"Mr Albertini, I am happy to stand anywhere as long as it is actually in the room - I suspect there may be a few people who would prefer it if I was not - and I am very happy to speak from the podium; it is the obvious place between the two."
"I do appreciate very much the work that you, Mr Albertini, and the other rapporteurs have done in producing what I think are really useful and helpful reports in terms of addressing the breadth of European action."
"But I want to say, too, that there is greater coherence than perhaps anyone listening to this debate might imagine."
"We do have strong united foreign policy positions on a whole range of issues, from the breadth of our concerns on human rights to the specific work that we are doing on the Middle East, in our neighbourhood, on Serbia/Kosovo, on Bosnia, or in our approach in Africa, where we now look at the situation hopefully beginning to be resolved in Cote d'Ivoire but worrying today in Uganda."
"All of these positions are worked out with the 27 Foreign Affairs Council ministers and I have to pay tribute to them."
"I think that we are moving inexorably to a greater sense of coherence."
"There is a lot more to do - I do not dispute that - and there is a lot more that you would wish us to do; but do not let us underestimate what we have already managed to achieve and the journey that we are on to do that."
"So I want to pay tribute to them and the fact that they often speak on behalf of all of us too; we cannot be everywhere in the world all at once."
"Today, we have Foreign Ministers in different parts of the world carrying messages on behalf of myself, on behalf of the European Union."
"That is an important aspect of what we do as well."
"Can I say, too, that we are almost always the first to produce statements, the first to come out and say what we think should happen."
"It was my office that produced the non-paper on sanctions on Syria; we are in the driving seat."
"Not always reported, may I say, not always put forward in the press across the European Union, but we are the first to actually put out our statements and we produce hundreds of them to make the point consistently of the importance of what we do; and consistency is a critical factor in what is being discussed today."
"In the course of our debate, we focused on certain parts of the world, but in the course of further speeches, honourable Members have raised a whole range of different issues which we still must continue to deal with."
"Mr Salafranca talked about what has been happening in Cuba over the weekend with Mr Soto and we are looking carefully at that."
"We have asked for more information on that case because clearly that is an area of enormous importance."
"Some honourable Members have asked about Gaza, about making sure that the aid is getting through, that we continue to support the people of Gaza - which we do, but we are engaged in a dialogue to increase and improve that."
"Then there are the events in Nagorno-Karabakh between Azerbaijan and Armenia, where we have been in discussion with both, and where we are looking to support what France is doing in terms of trying to drive forward the process there."
"In Albania, we have been in discussions with the Prime Minister and with the opposition to try to get the dialogue moving."
"And, of course, across Africa, I mentioned two countries, but we could talk about many more, not least as regards what is happening again today in Sudan and the importance of ensuring that South Sudan is created with the best possible chances of success"
"And then there is Ukraine, an important neighbourhood country which was mentioned I think by Mr Saryusz-Wolski and others too."
"We have a breadth of things to do and we must continue to do all of them."
"So, honourable Members, I would just say to you it is important to recognise that."
"Let me just, in the final minutes I have got, kill off a few of the myths which have grown up."
"I am not looking for a Security Council seat."
"I looked for proper status for the EU on the UN General Assembly, and we got that with nobody opposed to it, and honourable Members will know that took a lot of work, and I pay tribute to all of those involved, but we now have that stronger voice."
"I think it is important too that we look at what we are really doing on CSDP; let us not mess around with descriptions that are not true."
"In Libya alone, we managed to support through our aid 55 000 people being able to get home."
"I did not oppose a no-fly zone in the European Council and Prime Minister Cameron will back that up; that is not at all what I said."
"What I said was that for it to be effective and to be done quickly, it was important that those who could act quickly should do so."
"On our delegations, I support trying to strengthen what we have in our delegations opening in Benghazi, and what we do in Iraq."
"But let us not play this off against what happens in other countries like the Bahamas."
"The staff in the Bahamas are development staff from the Commission working on rural programmes, on agriculture, for some of the poorest people, and we should not, in my view, see this as being an 'either/or' situation."
"Honourable Members, we have to do as much as we can to support countries across the world."
"So I end as I began by saying that we do not lack ambition, we need the resources to do the job properly, we need to be able to be consistent, we need to develop and strengthen what we do, and that is what we will do, but we will do it by taking the 27 Members of the European Union on that journey with us, leading sometimes, pushing sometimes, working alongside sometimes, and your support will be invaluable to that."
"(Applause)"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote on the three reports will take place today at 12:30."
"(The sitting was suspended for a few moments)"
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"I would like to congratulate my colleague, Mr Albertini, for drafting this thorough report."
"It touches again on subjects where more active involvement is required from the EU."
"I can mention here the Eastern Partnership and Black Sea Synergy."
"These two initiatives play a vital role both in strengthening relations with the states in the immediate vicinity and in terms of energy security."
"Organising the Eastern Partnership summit for this autumn and setting up the Euronest Parliamentary Assembly are promising signs indicating that these guidelines are being implemented."
"Strengthening relations with the Republic of Moldova is also included among the common foreign policy priorities, in view of signing the association agreement with the EU."
"Mentioning this point will ensure positive progress in the negotiations between both sides."
"I would like to emphasise in this Chamber the importance attached to settling unresolved conflicts, particularly the one in Transnistria."
"I welcome this step, especially in the wake of the failure of the Vienna dialogue conducted last month."
"I support continuing the negotiations in the 5 + 2 format."
"in writing. - Europe must not fail the Palestinian people yet again."
"Now, following the unexpected reconciliation agreement between Fatah and Hamas, which commits to establishing a technical, non-party interim government and early elections, Europe must grab this opportunity to play a positive role in the region."
"It can do so by working with the interim government which is to be formed in the next few days; by supporting early elections; and, most importantly, undertaking to fully respect the outcome of elections and working with the new administration that emerges from those elections."
"Europe cannot, on the one hand, work with democratic movements in Libya, Syria, Tunisia and Egypt, and refuse to work with a government democratically elected by the Palestinian people."
"Israel's initial response to the reconciliation, withholding Palestinian Authority (P.A.) taxes, is illegal and potentially catastrophic for peace, putting at risk the state-building efforts of Prime Minister Salem Fayyad."
"The EU must step in to fully cover the loss of this income while making it clear that we will recover that money from Israel by freezing all money due to Israel from the EU to the same value, until it stops this further breach of international law."
", in writing. - In 2010, I submitted a written question to Commissioner Malmström to see what action the Commission had taken to uncover the role of non-governmental organisations in financing terrorism."
"The fact that the organisers of last year's flotilla are planning to repeat their action on the anniversary of the incident and MEPs from the GUE and Greens/EFA political groups organised a hearing at the EP on 10 May put the issue yet again in the spotlight."
"If we Europeans consider peace, democratisation in the Middle East, the eradication of extreme poverty and the development of living conditions in Gaza as our ultimate goal, the appropriate means for the facilitation of this noble cause is not the flotilla, as VP/HR Ashton pointed out earlier today."
"We cannot refer to something as humanitarian action that is not necessarily what it seems."
"Judge Bruguière, the respected and recognised counter-terrorism expert, proved that the organiser of the flotilla, IHH, had maintained contact with al-Qaeda."
"The umbrella organisation of IHH, Union of Good, supports the activity of extremist radicals through selling weapons to them."
"I ask fellow MEPs to refrain from exploiting the Middle East crisis for their own political goals, which do not have anything to do with the peace process and from a biased attitude which very much sounds like the language and mechanism of the Communist and Soviet attitude towards Israel."
"The motion for a resolution shows clearly that there are still serious shortcomings over fulfilment of the relevant provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"It does not look good to Member States when the European Parliament (EP) 'urgently requests' the European Council to develop a 'European foreign policy strategy', or when it calls on the European Council 'to go about this task on the basis of political dialogue with the EP'."
"If there was a European foreign policy strategy already today, the equilibrium of the EU in that regard would be much better, for example, concerning the movements in the Arab world and the double or even triple standards applied towards the countries from this region."
"The positions taken by the EU towards the increasingly turbulent developments in the Balkans represent another problem."
"The EU has not yet found the 'key' to this region and lacks a systematic approach."
"The result of this, among other things, is that the prestige of the EU and the attractions of EU membership go into free fall in the Western Balkan countries."
"The ideas of Valentin Inzko, High Representative of the international community and EU Special Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina, regarding the approach towards Serbia will not resolve the situation, but will rather do the opposite."
"Last week, a particularly significant event took place."
"After lengthy negotiations, we finally managed to convince our partners from the United Nations to grant the EU a new status in the organisation."
"This is a definite success, especially in view of the General Assembly's initial resistance."
"However, we must not fall into the trap of triumphalism and think that from now on, the EU will present a uniform standpoint in the forum of the United Nations."
"The fact that we will now be represented by the President of the European Council or the High Representative does not mean that Member States will present a common standpoint on particularly controversial topics."
"The example of Libya shows how deep the divisions between us are even in matters which would seem obvious, such as the protection of the civilian population."
"So we need to say clearly that without the political will from Member States, this decision will be meaningless."
"This is why I cannot agree with Mrs Ashton that the world will hear one, clear voice from the EU."
"Instead, I am afraid that for a long period of time, we will have to deal with many voices, as the uniform views of the EU will be weakened not only by the permanent members of the Security Council, but also by the Presidency, which is searching for its niche after the Treaty of Lisbon."
"How does Mrs Ashton intend to establish a uniform voice for the EU at the United Nations, and how does she intend to build a good image for the EU in this organisation?"
", in writing. - I am encouraged by the approach of the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy: realising that what counts, in addition to statements, are actions."
"I would like to remind you, Baroness Ashton, of Joseph Daul's advice: do not be afraid, and you will have the support of this Parliament."
"It is our joint responsibility to make authoritarian rulers believe that we take our basic values seriously."
"This means, first of all, conditionality: readiness not only to suggest and implore, but also to cause pain, i.e. to apply real sanctions to regimes which do not respect even the lives of their subjects."
"I agree that sanctions against Syria have to include hundreds of people, not just a dozen."
"I thank you for your condemnation of the massacre in Camp Ashraf on 8 April 2011."
"I strongly suggest that, in this case, you follow the clear message of the European Parliament from April 2009: we need a clear and convincing message that the EU really cares about the lives of 34 unarmed members of the Iranian opposition and will no longer tolerate the brutal crushing of their liberties and dignity."
"I ask the Commission to take the lead in the proposed resettlement issue."
"The common foreign and security policy is always a major problem in the EU."
"On the one hand, the large states are traditionally used to relying on their own forces, with France and Great Britain in particular still feeling they are great powers."
"This can be seen in their approach to solving foreign policy problems."
"In recent times, this has been oriented rather towards a military solution to any sort of dispute, as they neglect peaceful solutions in favour of intervention."
"I think there is reason to believe that today's world is heading towards multi-polarity, and it is a peaceful foreign policy that is in accordance with international law and the UN Charter."
"Instead of military ventures, the latest of which is unfolding before us in Libya, what today's world needs is to put all of its efforts into fighting poverty and illiteracy, and into solving other serious problems."
"In order to do this, it is absolutely essential to have arms control and disarmament, including general agreements on the dismantling of nuclear weapons."
"Assistance in mitigating the consequences of disasters should be an important element in EU foreign policy."
"These operations should not be linked to military deployments."
"Police deployment is possible only in extreme cases, on the basis of a UN resolution, and in order to protect workers in the social, health and public service sectors, and to train the police."
"The common foreign and security policy must be rigorously separated from NATO."
"For these reasons, the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left refuses to back this report."
"A week ago, the UN General Assembly authorised the EU to speak with one voice at its meetings."
"From now on, high-level representatives will be able to convey the Union's message in the highest international body."
"This provision is a significant step forward in the implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon, but it is not enough."
"The EU needs a real strategy so that it can actually apply the powers conferred on it by the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Be it in the Security Council, the Human Rights Council, NATO, the WTO or the G20, the EU should no longer have to hide in the shadows."
"What is more, we should take the lead in establishing a global parliamentary system."
"High-level diplomacy is obviously needed, but it must be carried out in consultation with the people."
"And how better to achieve that than to enable citizens from the world over to be represented at the UN?"
"There is the European Parliament, but there are also regional parliaments, such as the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly."
"What we need today is a world parliament."
"Baroness Ashton, the European Union must be ambitious."
"I hope that this proposal will appear in your White Paper."
", in writing. - First of all, I would like express my sincerest gratitude to Baroness Ashton for the EU's full support to Estonia in trying to resolve the hostage crisis in Lebanon."
"The kidnapped Estonians are, however, still at the mercy of their abductors."
"Therefore, we would be grateful for your further involvement and assistance in the resolution of the situation."
"Coming to the future of the common foreign and security policy, I would like to call for more coherence and consistency when dealing with non-democratic regimes."
"We have applied sanctions on Belarus, but we have not done so with regard to the Magnitski case in Russia, although this had been pointed out by the European Parliament in the Annual Report on Human Rights in the World 2009 and in the European Union's policy on the matter."
"We are still committed to the one-China policy, while Beijing has recently become more suppressive and violent both in Tibet and the Uyghur region."
"Instead of flirting with Beijing, we also ought to pursue a free trade agreement with Taiwan, which is a prosperous democracy."
"The one-China policy is outdated and morally undermining to the image of the European Union."
"Let us align our policies with our values."
", in writing. - The Lisbon Treaty provided us with a major opportunity to move forward in the field of defence and security."
"But, as evidence indicates, this is not enough."
"In spite of the relatively numerous operations, there is still an evident divorce between the instruments we are equipping us with - see the battle-groups, for instance - and the improvised collection of national means we actually employ, when the EU is required to intervene."
"Take Libya, for instance: because of the absence of political consensus and proper military assets, a 'coalition of the willing' - a concept we were so adamantly opposed when others have used it before - had to be formed and NATO had to be called in to take command!"
"Practically, Libya completely sidelined our CSDP, exactly at a time it was needed and, therefore, had the chance to demonstrate itself in practice!"
"In consequence, my opinion is that we have to look again at our CSDP, to see what it really needs to become a functional concept, both politically and militarily, so next time we would need to appeal to it, it will not let us down like this time."
"Our common foreign and security policy is at a crossroads."
"The Treaty of Lisbon has made it possible for the Union's foreign relations to develop in a way which was formerly impossible."
"The progress so far, however, has been quite slow."
"Our common European values nevertheless allow us to build a European foreign policy that relies on sustainable development and human rights."
"We need a clear European external agenda in order for the EU to be able purposefully to promote a global policy based on multilateralism."
"Crucial elements in that policy would be support for the work of the UN and a clarification of the EU's policy with regard to the UN."
"The situation in Syria is deeply concerning."
"We do not have complete, reliable information as the foreign press has been refused access."
"However, the repressive measures carried out by the Assad regime are intensifying and have already resulted, based on the figures supplied by the NGOs, in the murder of 600-700 civilians and the arrest or disappearance of another 8 000 people."
"Syria's citizens have been demonstrating for nearly two months and they must not be left on their own to fight for democracy."
"Brutal repression is unacceptable and must be stopped."
"The EU must take a leading role in the quest for a speedy solution."
"This is why I would like to welcome the restrictive measures adopted by the Council against the Syrian regime at the start of the week."
"However, we need to do more, in cooperation with the Union's partners, to urge the Syrian authorities to halt the repression."
"Assad is isolated."
"Only the Gaddafi regime is condemning at the moment 'the international conspiracy attacking Syria's national security', a statement which says a great deal about the situation in Syria."
"Finally, I would like to stress that, in the current circumstances, Syria's application for a seat on the UN's Human Rights Council is unacceptable."
", in writing. - The protracted violent actions against the Coptic Church in Egypt and largely against Christians in the Middle East require an immediate response from the European Union."
"An essential part of the Christian-European heritage is under threat."
"People are persecuted in their hundreds of thousands because of their religious beliefs."
"The new Egyptian authorities benefited from widespread sympathy and direct EU financial and political support."
"But now, after churches were burned and Christians killed in a renewed wave of attacks, the time has come for the EU to make it abundantly clear to the Egyptian authorities that they are responsible for the internal security of the country and for the protection of the rights and livelihood of all Egyptian citizens."
"Suspicions that the Egyptian authorities turned a blind eye to or even encouraged religious violence should be dispersed by a firm undertaking that the Christian community will be safe in Egypt."
"The EU should ask for explanations from the Egyptian authorities and make it clear that further violence will be followed by the cessation of European financial and humanitarian assistance."
"This unequivocal warning should condition all present agreements and should be included in all future agreements with Middle East governments."
"During the January debate on the situation in Tunisia and Egypt and the freedom of religious expression, I mentioned the tragic situation of Christians in Arab countries, particularly the Egyptian Coptic Christians, who are being persecuted."
"I pointed out the radicalisation of Islam, which is directing its aggression against the followers of Christ."
"It can be seen, today, that my misgivings were justified."
"Clashes in the vicinity of the Church of St. Menas are only the tip of the iceberg with regard to the tragedy of Egyptian Christians and the silence from international organisations."
"In this context, it would be worth recalling the attacks on the St. Bishoy monastery in March of this year, which were ignored by Parliament and Mrs Ashton, when the Egyptian army fired at a monastery full of refugees from Cairo, and the actions of the Salafist Islamic community which holds extreme views."
"In April, they carried out a series of attacks on Christian buildings in Beni Ahmad, Bashtil and Kamadir."
"As we can see, the European Union still cannot work out a cohesive reactive strategy towards human rights violations in Asia and North Africa and how to prevent them in the future."
"We should put more pressure on the Egyptian authorities to defend the Coptic Christians."
"It is essential to strengthen the section for the prevention of religious intolerance of the Subcommittee on Political Affairs of the European External Action Service, with particular regard to persecuted Christians"

"'The European Parliament and the Council are mindful of the importance of providing accurate information to consumers, in particular, when products are marketed with an indication of origin so as to protect them against fraudulent, inaccurate or misleading claims."
"The use of new technologies such as electronic labelling, including radio frequency identification, may be a useful tool to provide such information while keeping pace with technical development."

"You are going a little fast and there is a little delay."

"We deleted the name 'Macedonia' in order to avoid trampling on some people's sensibilities, including those, I believe, of the President."

"As you know, all the interpreters have a voting list in front of them."
"If they do not, they should."
"It does not depend on how fast or how slowly a President announces in whatever language the numbers; the interpreters have the list in front of them."
"At any rate, I will try to be a little slower if that would make it better."
"Is that OK?"

"Why, therefore, do you persist in this charade - pantomime - of speaking this unnecessary Greek?"

"I may be wrong, but I do not remember voting on the oral amendment to paragraph 68."
"Unless I am mistaken, we have skipped the oral amendment I mentioned earlier concerning condemnation of the attitude of the Bahraini Government."
"We should therefore proceed to the vote."
"Mr Albertini, the answer to that is that we adopted Amendments 13 and 18 and so the original paragraph on which you had the oral amendment fell."
"Before the final vote:"
"Mr President, I wanted to support Mr Albertini."
"I think we could vote his oral amendment as an addition to the paragraph we voted on because it would be positive if this House were to condemn what is happening in Bahrain, especially the death sentences."

"Mr President, I want to support that because it must have been a mistake, either in our voting lists or in our voting procedure, but there was such unanimity in supporting it that it would be very strange if it were not included."

"Because this is important to me personally, I should like you to grant me a roll-call vote on every amendment on this report under the same Rule whereby you granted it to the gentleman over there."
"Colleagues, under our rules and our practice, granting roll-call votes or not is in the hands of the President every time."
"The President may grant a roll-call vote if he feels it does not disrupt the session or, for example, if there are many requests, he may ask the House."
"There is no particular rule one way or another."
"I just want to make this clear to everyone so that we do not set any precedent here that was not intended to be set."
"Under the circumstances, nevertheless, I have no objection to granting the request in this particular case, but I would very much like to ask Members not to abuse this potential because, if they do, then the President will ask the House every time and there will be contentiousness where there should be none."

"Explanations of vote"
"Oral explanations of vote"
"(IT) Mr President, I voted in favour of the report on the labelling of textile products because I think that Europe could and should do more to support enterprises in the industry."
"The proposal made by the Commission was purely technical and aimed to simplify the current provisions regarding labelling."
"Yet Parliament achieved two significant results."
"Firstly, textile products comprising non-textile parts of animal origin - fur and leather - must show this information on the labels in order to allow consumers to make informed choices."
"Secondly, by 2013, the European Commission must present an impact study on the introduction of labelling, clearly showing which garments have been produced in Europe, and which outside of Europe."
"The latter objective is an important milestone for the competitiveness of European textiles in Europe and the world."
"(DA) Mr President, congratulations to Mr Manders for having succeeded in drawing up this proposal."
"It has proven to be more complicated than it looked at the start."
"I am pleased that we succeeded in reaching agreement on this Textile Labelling Regulation, which will strengthen the textile industry's competitiveness and benefit consumers by providing a greater choice of new and innovative products."
"It is a good compromise that I believe the Council will be able to live with, too."
"During this process, I have not disguised my own scepticism regarding the introduction of origin labelling."
"I am therefore also pleased that we agreed on a text that merely requires the Commission to analyse the need for origin labelling."
"Thus, the agreement will not lead to the introduction of mandatory origin labelling."
"I will be unable to vote in favour of a regulation that makes it mandatory for businesses to provide this country of origin label."
"I know that the Council is of the same opinion."
"Unfortunately, yesterday's debate highlighted the fact that Commissioner Tajani does not share this view."
"If we do not succeed in avoiding this, I will then take up the fight against it."
"(IT) Mr President, the proposal for a regulation on which we are being called to vote undoubtedly has the merit of bringing together in a single text all the existing legislation relating to textile products."
"This regulation will make it possible to simplify and improve the existing regulatory framework on the development and use of new fibres, as well as supporting the development of innovative products and encouraging innovation in the textile and clothing sector."
"I welcomed the fact that Mr Manders considered other aspects too, such as the reduced administrative burden for Member States resulting from the transposition into national law of the technical adaptations required by the addition of the names of new textile fibres to the harmonised list."
"While I consider that we could have gone further by introducing a specific article regulating the indication of origin of textile products, I voted in favour of the proposal for a regulation."
"(IT) Mr President, this regulation is vital for the European textile industry because it guarantees a free market in compliance with rules that prevent the irregularities and illegal practices of the past."
"We wish to favourably highlight the institutions' decision to welcome the proposal and to explore the problem of the traceability and origin of products in order to ensure that European consumers are correctly informed, even though the timescales established are too lengthy."
"Ultimately, the objective is to safeguard consumers."
"I would point out that last October, Parliament, by a large majority, voted in favour of the proposal for a regulation on the indication of the country of origin of certain products - including textile products - imported from third countries, and that to date, the Council has not opened negotiations or discussions with Parliament, even on an informal level."
"I would like to thank the Hungarian Presidency for having included the issue among its priorities, but I would also ask for the debate to be accelerated, or else we run the risk, for example, of providing safeguards for European consumers with regard to foodstuffs but not with regard to manufacturing products."
"(IT) Mr President, the report on the labelling of textile products which we endorsed today marks an important step towards simplifying legislation for the benefit of consumers and all the European manufacturers working in the industry."
"With this regulation, we are laying down new rules on labelling in the textile industry; we are focusing increasingly on innovation in the sector and on speeding up the integration of European legislation, in order to benefit from innovative products safely."
"The text proposes, in fact, to combine the three directives on the labelling of textile composition into a single European regulation, simplifying the existing regulatory framework and improving the transparency of procedures."
"Therefore, we cannot help but applaud the positive result achieved today in safeguarding European production."
"At the same time, however, we cannot fail to mention the indication of the country of origin issue."
"We hope that a further step forward can be taken soon with the approval of legislation regulating indications of origin in this sector as well."
"(DE) Mr President, in my opinion, this report is attempting to solve two major problems."
"Firstly, the aim is to promote innovation."
"This means that the process of including new fibre names in the standard list of names must be made more transparent and must involve less red tape."
"Secondly, origin labelling must be improved."
"Here, we can honestly say that this point has not yet been finally and satisfactorily resolved."
"I would like to make it very clear that this is not the fault of the rapporteur."
"This was simply due to the widely differing opinions held by members of the Council which the Commission could not reconcile."
"I hope that we will continue to work on this issue, because origin labelling is becoming increasingly important."
"It is one of the rights of consumers."
"I would like to see a discussion on this point in the near future in the European Parliament and I would like the Commission to submit a proposal."
"(IT) Mr President, quality, labelling and traceability: these are the consumer protection tools that guarantee product excellence."
"Until today, Europe was the only market in the world without legislation on this issue, which put it at a disadvantage relative to its main trading partners."
"Today, the European Parliament has made its voice heard, by adopting a regulation capable of safeguarding the excellence of the European textile industry."
"Our production and manufacturing needs protecting, particularly at a time of economic crisis such as the one we are currently experiencing."
"Until now, we have managed to achieve recognition through research and innovation, which guaranteed the production of innovative textile fibres."
"Consumers will no longer run the risk of buying textile products that are potentially harmful to their health perhaps because they have been treated with chemical agents."
"Adoption of this regulation finally guarantees due protection of the rights of over 500 million European citizens."
"From now on, it will no longer be possible to deceive them with incorrect labelling."
"Mr President, today, we have voted on the addition of new textiles and fibres and labelling-related matters."
"From the outset of this textile report, I have been of the opinion that Parliament should keep to the scope of the proposal as it was originally designated and that the extension of this scope was not compatible with the aim of simplification for putting a new fibre on the market."
"I have concerns about the provision of a review clause which will ask the Commission to investigate the possible introduction of a number of labelling requirements which have little added value and would place unacceptable burdens on businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises."
"This includes the harmonisation of size labelling, social economic labelling and, most worryingly, a radio frequency identification tag which would increase costs for business and prices for the consumer."
"Nonetheless, from this report, I feel that some of the provisions in this regulation will make a difference, will improve the application process for business and enhance consumer protection, especially on the labelling of animal-derived products."
"But we need to be mindful that we are legislating for the real world, not making a wish list for an ideal world, and that Parliament should stick to its areas of competence in future."
"Mr President, may I begin by saying that I hope you will continue to address this Chamber in your native tongue, which matches any language in the world for its accomplishment, its diversity and its antiquity."
"There are times when reading the voting list is a more eloquent comment on the behaviour and nature of this Parliament than almost anything else I could say."
"Let us just look at the subjects of some of these reports: indications or marks identifying the lot to which a foodstuff belongs; approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to units of measurement; permissible sound level and exhaust system of motor vehicles; narrow-track wheeled agricultural and forestry tractors; controls of wheeled agricultural or forestry tractors; braking devices of wheeled agricultural or forestry tractors; driving position and the doors and windows of wheeled agricultural or forestry tractors; rear-mounted roll-over protection structures; excise duty applied to manufactured tobacco; denominations and technical specifications of euro coins; textile names and related labelling of textile products ... and I could go on."
"There is almost no nook or cranny of our national life so remote that Brussels has not curled its tendrils thither, choking out the natural light and blocking out the native growth."
"If Brussels confined itself to cross-border issues, then no one would have a problem."
"(DA) Mr President, during the debate, a great deal was said about Mr Hökmark's report on our radio spectrum policy programme - something that does not sound very glamorous, I have to admit."
"However, it is actually a question of whether we can secure broadband connections and cheap data transmission for our citizens in future."
"I will very briefly say that, when we are trying to look into the future, it is quite impressive that the negotiators, and our rapporteur in particular, have succeeded in achieving such a broad majority in favour of the report that we voted on today."
"That was the result of very fine political skill and all credit to our rapporteur, Mr Hökmark."
"(DE) Mr President, radio frequencies are a very scarce and valuable resource in our modern society."
"Therefore, it makes sense to coordinate the use of these frequencies efficiently throughout Europe."
"Broader access to the radio spectrum is important not only for businesses, but also for the citizens of the European Union."
"For this reason, we should take particular care to ensure that this policy is developed in line with economic, social and cultural interests."
"In particular, we must not allow this regulation to put at risk the direct wireless transmission used in Germany in regional theatres, at rock concerts and in churches."
"I would also like to ask the Commission to sit down with the Member States and work closely with them in this area and not to interfere in their national powers."
"(DA) Mr President, following today's vote on the lobbyists register, I think it is important to state that lobbyism is essentially a good thing."
"It is actually an indispensable part of the democratic process."
"Without lobbyism, politicians' knowledge, facts and opinions with regard to all aspects of society would be far too limited."
"Therefore, all of us in this House and the press have a responsibility to ensure that, behind what we do, there is a critical, but also true, picture of what the issue is all about."
"Secondly, I would like to say that, as we know, the best is the greatest enemy of the good."
"The fully legitimate demand for transparency, as reflected in the debate and the vote today, must, of necessity, be balanced so that we do not, with the best of intentions, destroy a well-functioning system."
"The demand for total transparency, mandatory individual registration of everything under the sun, an ethical control committee and so on, are, in the best case, expressions of something naive and, in the worst case, part of a populist political agenda that will do more harm than good."
"In practice, this is about trust."
"If deemed necessary, control must be in line with what is feasible in practice in respect of the work process."
"I would also like to contest the vote on paragraph 9."
"During the very quick vote, I got the impression that we did not actually obtain the right result."
"(DA) Mr President, I am in complete agreement with Mr Løkkegaard."
"I am not sure that we obtained quite the right result in the vote on paragraph 9, but if we did, there is something not quite right with the perception of reality in this House."
"It is absolutely right that we should have as much transparency as possible."
"However, to demand that we all publish the names of everyone we hold meetings with is, of course, absolutely absurd."
"It is absolutely absurd because when is a meeting a meeting?"
"This has to be defined."
"Does it include when we meet in the corridor or on the bus or somewhere else?"
"Does it include telephone meetings and Internet meetings?"
"When is it classed as a meeting?"
"What about many of those people we are having meetings with today from rebel movements in North Africa?"
"Are they to see their names in the newspapers?"
"Surely not?"
"In this regard, it should be logical for it always to be possible to guarantee that people can come to us in confidence."
"In any case, I will never be involved in breaking this confidence."
"(IT) Mr President, making it easy for citizens to scrutinise how decisions are made, together with the processes, elements and resources that influenced them, helps both to ensure greater transparency and to close the gap between the European institutions and citizens, which is often discussed in relation to legitimacy and to the so-called democratic deficit in the European Union."
"Great progress has been made in the last few years."
"One need only think of the register of interest representatives adopted by the European Parliament in 1996, or of the Commission's 2006 proposal to the European Parliament for a 'one-stop shop' register for lobbyists."
"The approval of the Stubb-Friedrich report by this House led to the creation of a joint working group."
"We can safely say that the results achieved by that group with regard to the objectives set by Parliament are more than satisfactory."
"I fully agree with Mr Casini's report, as the transparency of political institutions is a fundamental condition of their legitimacy."
"This is why I have supported the proposal."
"(IT) Mr President, there is no doubt that this regulation marks an important step in the process aimed at focusing attention on the European institutions."
"There needs to be more transparency, more publicity, more clarity of conduct and accessibility of information, and finally, a common transparency register."
"If we think that in the United States, the law governing lobby groups was introduced as long ago as 1948, we realise that they undoubtedly have a role to play, and while they essentially represent predominantly selfish interests, they must be duly taken into account."
"This is a forward-looking draft report, and while it is not the finished article, it is undoubtedly a way of safeguarding the legitimacy of the activities and decisions of the European institutions."
"For this reason, I voted in favour, as I am absolutely convinced that this is the path we must take."
"Mr President, I think we owe a debt of gratitude to the Sunday Times for exposing the 'amendments for money' scandal."
"As a result, as you know yourself, a working group has been established by the Bureau to introduce binding codes of conduct for all MEPs."
"Part two of cleaning up the act is what we did today by voting for this report in huge numbers."
"I believe that the register of lobbyists is long overdue, but I have a number of reservations."
"First of all, I think that it should be mandatory."
"However, it is a step in the right direction and it is worth noting that the lobbyists themselves, the reputable lobbyists, actually are in touch and are in favour of compulsory registration."
"I am disappointed, however, that the Council has not signed up to the proposal."
"It is worth noting that the three MEPs who were exposed in terms of the 'amendments for money' scandal are all former government ministers."
"The registration of lobbyists is a big issue and lobbying is a big issue, and we need to push on, use this as an experiment and hopefully, in the future, make it compulsory and mandatory."
"Mr President, the moment the lobbyist arrives in Brussels, he perceives immediately that this was a system designed by, and for, people like him."
"He is usually a man, although his female equivalent can increasingly be found stalking our corridors in her sharp trouser suit."
"This is a system where decisions are taken - I would say in smoke-filled rooms, but these days in smoke-free rooms - behind closed doors with the voters frozen out."
"You had a perfect example of that with the new restrictions and bans on herbal and alternative medicines which came in a couple of weeks ago."
"Such a ban would never have passed a national parliament, all of them being subjected as they were to real anger from their constituents."
"However, the big pharmaceutical corporations understood that they could push through in this system what they could never get through the national legislatures, precisely because this system is much more invulnerable to public opinion."
"So, yes, let us have this register - I voted for it and my group supported it - but the real solution is to disperse the power away from these unaccountable Brussels and Strasbourg institutions back to genuinely answerable national, democratic parliaments."
"Mr President, the government of Singapore and the authorities in Hong Kong and Shanghai are scouring London and the other financial centres of Europe looking to recruit the people who have been driven abroad by the excessive regulatory burden being imposed by the European Union."
"Our generation is witnessing an epical shift in wealth and enterprise from Europe to Asia."
"It is our tragedy to live at a time where, just as Asia has discovered the secrets of decentralisation, diffusion of power, enterprise and personal responsibility, we in this part of the world are going in the opposite direction, copying the old Asian empires - the Mings, the Moguls and the Ottomans - in regulating, uniformising, standardising and taxing."
"Of course, it is my own country, my own capital city of London, which will be most adversely affected by these new restrictions, but the EU as a whole has an interest in preventing this haemorrhage of wealth, of jobs and of enterprise from Europe to younger and more virile economies."
"Again, the solution is to push powers down back to national authorities which have genuine affinity and allegiance from their voters."
"(DA) Mr President, India is the largest democracy in the world, it is one of the world's fastest growing markets, and it is well on the way to becoming a knowledge-based economy."
"In light of this, it does, of course, make perfect sense for us to conclude a free trade agreement."
"It is also in our own interests."
"The question therefore arises as to how on earth the Left can be against this free trade agreement."
"How can anyone be against lifting millions of Indian people out of poverty, and how can the Left be against fighting for an open market for European enterprises?"
"I find it incomprehensible."
"I simply cannot understand why it is so difficult to learn from history."
"Free trade is good!"
"Free trade is good!"
"Free trade is good!"
"Free trade creates growth, freedom for people and, therefore, also peace."
"Mr President, I voted against the motion for a resolution that deals with the negotiations for a free trade agreement with India."
"In my opinion, the conclusion of any such agreement negotiated by the European Commission would only serve big multinational corporations, both in India and in Europe."
"In contrast to the last speaker, in my opinion, the trade negotiations are not driven by the interests of raising people out of poverty and improving people's living standards; they are driven by those big business agendas to get more market access and increase profits."
"I stand with the poor farmers, trade unionists and workers of India who oppose the FTA as it will mean a further undermining of living standards and working conditions for large parts of the Indian working class, in particular, those that work in the large informal sector."
"Furthermore, this FTA agenda and its drive to enforce intellectual property rights and data exclusivity endangers access to cheap generic medicines that are produced in India."
"Today, these generics are of vital importance to people across the world suffering from the likes of HIV and AIDS. Because of the profiteering of the private major pharmaceutical companies, they simply cannot afford the branded equivalents."
"(FI) Mr President, the free trade agreement to be signed with India is the most remarkable of the EU's free trade agreements negotiated so far."
"The European Union must emphasise the importance of social responsibility."
"We know very well what India's biggest problems are: child labour, poverty and inequality."
"We are now to conclude a trade agreement, the real beneficiaries of which are industry and big companies in Europe."
"The European consumer, of course, certainly benefits from India's cheap labour force, as reflected, for example, in lower prices for products, but that should not be allowed if India's primary producers are going to suffer."
"It is hypocritical to claim that Europe is a pioneer in the area of social responsibility."
"In offering free trade benefits, the EU must insist that the problems are addressed, and must oversee the process."
"It is important that the Commission incorporates into the free trade agreement legally binding clauses relating to human rights, social and environmental standards and the social responsibility of companies, and that it ensures, moreover, that these demands are met."
"(DA) Mr President, it is, of course, interesting, and in its way charming, that there can always be Members of this Parliament that are against free trade."
"In a way, I think this is fantastic."
"However, I would like to say that I fully support it."
"I believe that free trade is the way forward, and it is also free trade that should show us the way forward with regard to India."
"The reason it has been so long coming, of course, is that there are problems with various details - major details we could say - namely, the question of generic medicines, which the previous speaker also mentioned."
"I would call on both parties in this matter, in other words, both the EU and India, to try to find a solution to this problem that both respects copyright, because that is absolutely essential, and, at the same time, ensures that practical means are provided to enable the many poor people in India to obtain cheap medicines."
"Finally, there are some critics who believe that we should not follow the bilateral path in the negotiations and enter into bilateral agreements."
"They believe that this goes against the World Trade Organisation (WTO) negotiations."
"I think that this is completely in line with the WTO."
"We need to do something to make sure that we do not founder any more than we are already doing in the WTO."
"It is quite simply necessary to have these bilateral agreements, and therefore I welcome them."
"(DA) Mr President, it is amazing every time we discuss free trade in this Parliament."
"A few old radio signals from Radio Tirana always turn up in the debate."
"At any rate, that is the impression you can get when you listen to the thoughts of the Left on free trade."
"They thereby make it clear that they have not learnt anything at all from history."
"We are now talking about the region of Japan."
"The EU and Japan are two of the world's largest economies."
"Together, we account for a fifth of global trade."
"We invest significant sums in each other's economies, we have common interests at global level and yet the negotiations are only progressing slowly."
"Therefore, let us say from our side that the barriers must be removed."
"We have to accept that concessions are needed from both sides, because together our economies can complement each other and create innovation, growth and jobs."
"(DA) Mr President, I merely wish to add to what has already been said."
"There is no doubt that one of the barriers for the Japanese is the extremely high technical barriers that exist and have always existed in Japanese society."
"Europe should make a strong appeal to Japan to get out of the bunker and ensure that something is done about these technical barriers."
"The background issue of the disaster that Japan is experiencing is, of course, tragic."
"However, if nothing else, we could say that something positive has come out of it in that they will have the opportunity to think again and realise that there really is a need now for outside help."
"There is a considerable need for enterprises from other regions to come in and help."
"That might cause Japan to look forward, to see the situation with fresh eyes, and to remove these numerous technical barriers."
"(FR) Mr President, I would like to remind our fellow Member on the left, Mr Murphy, that Karl Marx was in favour of free trade with India."
"I would also like to remind our liberal fellow Members, and, in particular, Mr Rohde, that the reason he was in favour of free trade was because of its devastating effects, since he maintained that the fact that the British bourgeoisie was driven by dishonourable interests was of little consequence: Indian society needed to be destroyed in order to precipitate the dawn of the global revolution."
"As far as I am concerned, I do not think we should be dogmatic on this matter."
"Systematic free trade is not necessarily beneficial."
"It can be a good thing when there is a level playing field."
"That is pretty much the case in many areas with Japan, but I recognise Japan's right, for instance, to protect its rice market, to protects its rice farmers, to pay its farmers higher prices than those on world markets and to say no to massive imports which would obliterate its peasant farmer population, in the same way that I recognise our economies' rights to protect certain sectors of their activity."
"That is why I did not vote for the majority resolution."
"I would have preferred other resolutions that, in my opinion, seemed more appropriate."
"There must be a level playing field, but only in clearly defined sectors."
"(DA) Mr President, I would actually have been surprised if I had not heard the French Members intimate that protectionism is a good thing."
"Well, enough of dogmatics."
"We must move on to the forests and, in this regard, we are today debating our report on the Commission Green Paper on forest protection and information in the EU."
"European forests have many social, economic and environmental functions, and they are, without a doubt, making an important contribution to solving the climate crisis - it is actually a very effective way of solving this crisis - and to the attainment of the EU's 2020 target."
"We in the Danish Liberal Party are therefore very pleased that today's vote has ensured that the forests will receive more consistent and long-term protection while, at the same time, we have retained our ambitions with regard to ensuring the global competitiveness of European forest-based industries."
"However, we were a little surprised that the proposal for a 30-year ban on building on land where there has been a forest fire was successfully voted through."
"This is a typical leftist method of solving crime problems - by banning everything and everyone and, what is more, for 30 years. We obviously do not support this."
"(IT) Mr President, as shadow rapporteur of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I am completely satisfied with the outcome of today's vote."
"The report by Mr Arsenis on the protection of forests is a policy report; it is a basis for confirming how the European Parliament intends to tackle the protection of our forest heritage and the adaptation of forests to climate change."
"Today, the European Parliament clearly expressed its point of view, in the light of which we expect the Commission to make the necessary proposals and so enable even more detailed policies to be drafted for the sector."
"I would particularly like to thank Mr Arsenis for his expert and professional work, which involved a long and difficult debate, because - as we are well aware - the forest situation is not the same in all the Member States."
"Despite this, we found common ground and also achieved some specific objectives, for example, the protection of certain parts from land speculation, greater protection of forests which are prized for their biodiversity, such as the northern Boreal and Mediterranean forests, and a ban on building on land cleared by arson."
"Mr President, as I have said, this is very important for many Mediterranean countries, including your own country, Greece."
"(DE) Mr President, the forests are our future and our cultural landscape."
"They are carefully managed to provide services for us and for the environment, including producing oxygen, storing carbon and offering a habitat for plants and animals."
"The people who manage our woodlands are paid little or nothing for providing these hidden functions which many people take for granted."
"This makes it all the more important for us to take into consideration the economic aspects of our forests."
"These include the timber industry and, increasingly, the production of biomass, not only for heating, but also for electricity generation."
"In future, we must strengthen and make greater use of the economic aspects of woodlands and we must take national and personal responsibility for this."
"We are expecting the Commission to produce a White Paper which reflects this comprehensive approach and puts the focus on it to ensure that our forests have a future and that we are all prepared to invest in this future."
"If I plant a grain of corn, I am thinking only of today, but if I plant a tree, I am looking to the future."
"(SV) Mr President, the requirements for forests are very different in different parts of Europe."
"Forest legislation is therefore best dealt with at national level."
"Moreover, the Treaty of Lisbon does not provide support for a common European forestry policy."
"The biggest problem with the proposed regulations relating to climate and forests is that forests are key to the EU being able to achieve the climate targets that have been set."
"Forests are necessary for conversion to a green economy, for example, through production of biofuels from forestry by-products."
"Therefore, forestry must not be subjected to unnecessary, complicated regulations that make its products less competitive compared with fossil fuels."
"For example, it is very strange to propose binding sustainability criteria for a renewable resource like forests, but to not have similar criteria for fossil fuels like coal."
"I will continue to oppose a European common forestry policy in future, too."
"I would instead like to put resources into research, education, information and innovation with regard to how to prevent the effects that climate change will have on our forests. Thank you."
"Mr President, I voted against the report on the EU's common foreign and security policy."
"I am in complete disagreement with the views and ideas it expresses about Europe's current and future role in the world."
"In a nutshell, this report stands for a militarised and imperialist Europe."
"It defends an aggressive raw materials strategy and asks for, and I quote, 'a less rigid distinction between military and civilian crisis management operations'."
"This is disguised language for a further militarisation of foreign policy."
"It welcomes the trade agreement with Colombia, despite the fact that hundreds of trade unionists have been killed in recent years, guilty simply of being trade unionists."
"This report hypocritically names social unrest as one element of a new generation of security challenges and risks."
"What hypocrisy!"
"The capitalist system has created poverty and misery across the world and is incapable of dealing with the consequences."
"It is the right of people to defend their legitimate interests and struggle for a better future without any interference from the mighty political, economic and military powers."
"(IT) Mr President, first of all, I would like to say - and I hope this will not be deducted from my speaking time - that, on the subject of hypocrisy, there are very few of us who believe in certain things."
"We each take the floor to explain our vote after we have cast it."
"There are around five or six of us, and we listen to each other and are sometimes filmed for television. However, the whole thing is rather depressing."
"Therefore, I would like to make a suggestion, and I will certainly do so at the next meeting of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats)."
"I suggest that from now on, the explanations of vote should precede the vote itself, so that perhaps by talking and listening to each another, we may even convince each other about which way to vote, rather than playing a sort of team game that has all been decided beforehand."
"Having said this, I stated in my explanation of vote that I voted in favour."
"I continue to believe in Europe, just as I continue to believe in the effectiveness of the presence of a High Commissioner."
"However, I continue to believe that the Member States believe in it much less than we ourselves do."
"Therefore perhaps it should be pointed out - as was reiterated to Baroness Ashton this morning and on other occasions, too - that, unless Europe stops being partly economic and becomes more political instead, our role probably cannot be carried out as well as it could be, either."
"(PL) Mr President, I agree that European foreign policy must take account of the external dimension of the European area of freedom, security and justice."
"That is why I welcome any action which contributes to the promotion of peace, stability and the rule of law in countries and regions in crisis."
"I support commitment to the transatlantic partnership as one of the main pillars of the EU's foreign policy, aiming to create a free market with the United States."
"Eastern European politics are especially important from Poland's point of view."
"The report acknowledges that there should be political and economic integration with the EU's neighbours and also calls for a cohesive approach in negotiations on a new agreement with Russia, paying attention to the rule of law and protection of human rights there."
"It also acknowledges that negotiations for the accession of Turkey should be intensified and that there should be a continuous commitment to the accession process for the Balkan countries."
"Mr President, I voted in favour of this report for its moderate approach to the most pressing issues in the common foreign and security policy."
"Thanks to the Socialist Group's amendments, a more constructive language for the dialogue on Russia and Iran has been achieved."
"The amendments on the EU strategy on Afghanistan also contributed to improving the structure of the report."
"The Albertini report is a step forward towards a better EU security policy."
"While I support the efforts and the commitment of the rapporteur, I should also stress that the EU is still far from having a coherent long-term strategy in this area."
"The EU contribution to global peace and stability is still quite small and still depends too much on the USA's vision of international security and on the 'needle approach' to the same issue."
"Let us work for a more autonomous, EU-centred foreign and security strategy, because that is what European citizens expect from us and that is what we should deliver to them."
"(GA) Mr President, I found the number of Members who spoke in support of Lady Ashton and her ongoing work in the foreign services, and also the number of Members who proposed that we speak with one voice, interesting and satisfying this morning."
"If we speak with one voice, we will be effective and listened to; if we do not, we will not be listened to or effective."
"I was also reminded of the words of the great Irish poet, William Butler Yeats, who said 'peace comes dropping slow'."
"That was certainly the case in Northern Ireland, where the European Union played a crucial part through its support for the International Fund for Ireland, and that peace was copper-fastened last weekend with successful elections."
"(GA) The work which the European Union did in Northern Ireland can be repeated on the world stage for the benefit of peace and of the poor provided we speak with one voice and if Lady Ashton does her work diligently."
"(PL)."
"Mr President, I supported the report on the European common security and defence policy."
"However, I would like to point out that the report not only evaluates the policy, but focuses principally on the future, on development."
"In my view, this requires not only the various justified and accurate assessments and clever words, of which there are many in the report; the common security and defence policy needs to be looked at seriously and from a different angle."
"I think that three things are needed."
"Firstly, the EU should define its common strategic interests, for example, concerning energy security and Neighbourhood Policy."
"Secondly, the EU should increase its own capability regarding the planning and coordination of civil and military operations and crisis management."
"Finally, thirdly, within the EU budget, there should be a joint budget for joint action."
"(PL) Mr President, the increasingly significant interdependency of international organisations in the face of economic, environmental and energy problems requires constant adjustments to the foreign relations of individual states."
"Security issues form an element of policy requiring particular care by every country, and they need constant readjustment in a changing world."
"The report's main theme is a call to protect the strategic autonomy of the EU in the field of security and defence."
"However, it does not take the EU's lack of military experience into account, but, at the same time, calls for further efforts to expand the EU's operational options."
"For countries such as Poland, the basis of its defence policy remains the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation."
"Tightening the strategic partnership between the EU and NATO and the proposal to strengthen mutual support for action could considerably slow down the procedures involved in taking operational decisions."
"In my view, the report seems too radical, and this is why I voted to reject it."
"Mr President, the most significant document on the EU security strategy was delivered by Xavier Solana."
"It is entitled 'A secure Europe in a better world' and was adopted by the European Council on 12 December 2003."
"Since then, little progress has been made in this field."
"The Union still lacks an effective strategy for its foreign security and, on most relevant issues, still follows the lead of the United States."
"This report tries to introduce some positive changes on tactical topics like crisis management, the fragmentation of the EU defence technological industrial base, and the ineffectiveness of the 24 EU security and defence missions around the world."
"I voted in favour of it, and I hope this Parliament will continue to make a contribution towards the goal of enhancing EU strategic autonomy in security affairs."
"In particular, what we need is a redefinition of the major threats to our security after the collapse of the so-called Islamic terrorist threat and the emergence of new dangers like the financial crisis."
"(FI) Mr President, I supported the report, but I wonder if the European Union has the ability to work to promote peace and stability in our neighbouring countries, by which I now mainly mean Syria, Libya and Egypt."
"Our actions in Libya will show the actual state of our security and defence policy."
"The EU's main objective in Libya is to protect the civilian population and to support the attempts by the Libyan people to establish a democratic society."
"Memories of the Balkan countries in the 1990s are still fresh in our minds."
"Then, Europe had to rely on help from the United States of America."
"Libya has, in any case, shown that the EU is not a military power: our actions have been dependent on the independent initiatives of the Member States."
"The examples in North Africa make us realise now that the EU's need for military preparedness and capability at the gates of Europe remains a fact."
"The External Action Service has been in operation for more than a year: we can now expect some results from it."
"Mr President, there are two words that spring to mind to describe where we find ourselves today with regard to the common foreign and security policy."
"Unfortunately, they are not very nice words."
"The ones I think of are 'mess' and 'a bit of a joke'."
"Unfortunately, it is rather a sick joke."
"In the last 15 months - a period that has presented ample opportunities throughout the world to prove its credentials - our so-called common policy has failed to make any positive impact."
"I say that not as a great aficionado of foreign affairs, but I have to answer my constituents as to what does Europe add in value to us?"
"It is of real concern to them that the cost of delivering this common policy is not being carefully allocated and not being carefully accounted for."
"I have to answer my citizens about what service this is giving them, and I still, after the lengthy debates on these reports, struggle to come up with an answer."
"(SK) Mr President, the submitted report talks about human rights as a priority agenda of the EU in international organisations, while particularly emphasising the rights of women and children, and freedom of expression."
"At the same time, the report calls on Member States to support the position of the EU in these organisations."
"However, so-called reproductive rights, which is just another name for the right to abortion, are a priority component of the European human rights agenda."
"On the other hand, European diplomacy is still not consistent in promoting religious freedom in all of its aspects, with an emphasis on respecting the rights of Christians worldwide."
"I would therefore prefer to see myself and my constituents represented by Slovak diplomats."
"I believe they will promote a fundamentally different viewpoint to that of the EU in these matters, many of which fall within the competence of nation states."
"The EU is still a very limited global actor; its role in the UN system and in all multilateral organisations does not match its democratic, economic and cultural weight."
"This report addressed this deficit and calls for removing some obstacles to the full participation of our Union to the global context."
"This is the reason why I voted in favour of it."
"The EU can make a powerful contribution to the peace and prosperity of our planet."
"Let us allow its civilian power to expand its influence everywhere."
"Mr President, as I may be the last speaker, let me take this opportunity to thank your staff and the interpreters for your patience."
"Please do not think it goes unnoticed or unappreciated."
"The European Union is hungry and eager in its acquisition of all of the attributes and trappings of statehood."
"It has its own Parliament, its own currency, its own president, its own foreign minister, its own external borders, its own flag, anthem, passport and driving licence."
"It was only a matter of time before it would apply for formal recognition as a state in the United Nations, which, of course, is what has now happened, with - rather disgracefully and to me bafflingly - the support of my own government."
"This is a legal regularisation of something that has been happening de facto for some time: the pushing of the powers that we regard as definitive of statehood from national to Brussels level."
"But the other Member States of the European Union should be wary of what they agree."
"One of the consequences of giving the EU full recognition of statehood is that they now can be addressed at length by Baroness Ashton and by Mr Van Rompuy as, respectively, the foreign minister and the head of state of the new entity."
"And, as Members of this House I am sure will privately be able to let them know, that is not an unmixed blessing."
"Written explanations of vote"
"I voted in favour of this document, codifying Council Directive 89/396/EEC of 14 June 1989 on indications or marks identifying the lot to which a foodstuff belongs."
"Codification is an effective means of consolidating the rules governing a certain area in a single legislative act."
"It provides more clarity, because various provisions regulating the same issue are often spread over different legal texts."
"As they are amended, it becomes difficult to understand which provision is currently in force."
"Codification is also a suitable means of developing European Union law which is simpler, clearer and more understandable to citizens."
"I welcome the efforts that have been made towards clarifying Union law in order to make it more accessible to all EU citizens."
"Therefore, bearing in mind the importance of trade in foodstuffs, I am voting for this proposal for a directive on indications or marks identifying the lot to which a foodstuff belongs."
"This system will contribute to better information on the identity of the products, and will also help to develop international trade."
"I totally agree that the recommendations of the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission should be taken into consideration as I think that the proposal in question is simply limited to a straightforward codification of the existing texts without any change in their substance."
"This proposal concerns the straightforward codification of the rules already in force on indications or marks identifying the lot to which a foodstuff belongs, without making changes to their substance on which Parliament might need to give an opinion."
"Nonetheless, I would highlight the increasing importance, in my opinion, of providing consumers with factual and complete information, especially on the lots, dates of manufacture and other information enabling them to trace the movement of a product from its source."
"This report relates to the proposal for a directive of Parliament and of the Council on indications or marks identifying the lot to which a foodstuff belongs, in a codified text."
"Simplifying the lives of European citizens is one of the EU's concerns. Many legislative changes have been carried out by the Commission and by Parliament in order to achieve this objective."
"One of the things which really complicates the life of the ordinary EU citizen is reading and interpreting information about the indications or marks identifying the lot to which a foodstuff belongs."
"The proliferation of such information makes this more difficult and contributes to decreasing the public's quality of life."
"To address this issue, since 1994, there has been an interinstitutional agreement between Parliament, the Commission and the Council on an accelerated working method for the adoption of codified acts."
"I am happy to finally be able to adopt a directive that, in consolidating Directive 89/396/EEC, makes the public's lives easier by simplifying and clarifying EU law."
"in writing. - Trade in foodstuffs occupies a very important place in the internal market."
"Indication of the lot to which a foodstuff belongs meets the need for better information on the identity of products."
"It is therefore a useful source of information when foodstuffs are the subject of dispute or constitute a health hazard for consumers."
"In view of the variety of identification methods used, it should be up to the trader to determine the lot and to affix the corresponding indication or mark."
"At international level, there is a general obligation to provide a reference to the manufacturing or packaging lot of pre-packaged foodstuffs."
"It should be the duty of the Union to contribute to the development of international trade by also applying those rules."
"Taking into consideration the good of society and consumers in the European market, we try to simplify as many rules and regulations as possible so that they are transparent and able to be understood by every citizen."
"A case in point is the common agricultural policy."
"The overriding principle in work on its future form is simplification of a policy whose main aim is to ensure food security for Europe."
"Codification of the directive on marks identifying the lot to which a foodstuff belongs aims to achieve this approach and to simplify consumers' understanding of the legislation."
"At the same time, by retaining the wording of the original texts, the codification is being carried out in full compliance with the procedures involved in adopting acts in the EU."
"in writing. - I voted for this report on a proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on indications or marks identifying the lot to which a foodstuff belongs."
"The aim of this proposal is the codification of existing legislative texts on indications or marks identifying the lot to which a foodstuff belongs."
"Increasing importance should, however, be given to ensuring that consumers are given accurate and comprehensive information, especially with regard to lots, dates of manufacture and other information which enables them to track the progress of the product from its point of origin."
"in writing. - The report of MEP Sajjad Karim contains a legislative resolution on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on indications or marks identifying the lot to which a foodstuff belongs (codified text)."
"The purpose of this proposal is to undertake the codification of Council Directive 89/396/EEC of 14 June 1989 on indications or marks identifying the lot to which a foodstuff belongs."
"I totally support the new directive because it will supersede the various acts incorporated in it; this proposal fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself."
"I voted 'in favour'."
"Based on the opinion of the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, this proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on indications or marks identifying the lot to which a foodstuff belongs concludes that the proposal in question is restricted to the straightforward codification of the existing texts without any change in their substance."
"For this reason, I voted in favour of Parliament's proposal, which takes over the Commission proposal as adapted to the recommendations of the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission."
"We are in favour of this directive on indications or marks identifying the lot to which a foodstuff belongs, not least because criminals all too often falsify codes for illegal purposes."
"Grouping together and simplifying all the existing legislation on indications or marks will facilitate controls and the identification of any illegal practice."
"I voted in favour of this document, codifying Council Directive 80/181/EEC of 20 December 1979 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to units of measurement and the repeal of Directive 71/354/EEC."
"Codification is an effective means of consolidating the rules governing a certain area in a single legislative act."
"It provides more clarity, because various provisions regulating the same issue are often spread over different legal texts."
"As they are amended, it becomes difficult to understand which provision is currently in force."
"Codification is also a suitable means of developing European Union law which is simpler, clearer and more understandable to citizens."
"I welcome the efforts that have been made towards clarifying Union law in order to make it more accessible to all EU citizens."
"In view of this, and taking into account the importance of measuring instruments for most areas of human activity, I am voting for this proposal for a directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to units of measurement."
"This system will contribute to better performance in the areas of public health and safety, as well as administrative operations."
"With due regard for the opinions of the legal services of Parliament, the Council and the Commission, which have concluded that the Commission proposal was confined to straightforward codification of the existing texts, without any change in their substance, I welcome the adoption of this proposal at the first reading."
"This report relates to the proposal for a directive of Parliament and of the Council on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to units of measurements, as a codified text."
"Simplifying the lives of Europeans is one of the EU's concerns."
"in writing. - Units of measurement are essential in the use of all measuring instruments to express measurements or any indication of quantity."
"They are used in almost all fields of human activity and it is therefore necessary to ensure the greatest possible clarity in their use and set rules for their use within the European Union for economic, public health, public safety or administrative purposes. Member States should be able to require that measuring devices on their territory bear indications of quantity in a single legal unit of measurement."
"This directive supports the smooth functioning of the internal market through the degree of harmonisation of units of measurement."
"In this context, it is appropriate for the Commission to monitor market developments relating to this directive and its implementation, particularly with regard to possible barriers to the internal market and further harmonisation needed to overcome these obstacles."
"in writing. - I voted for this report on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to units of measurement."
"This proposal is confined to codification of the existing texts relating to units of measurement, without any change in their substance, so I am voting in favour."
"in writing. - As I understand, the report contains a legislative resolution on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to units of measurement."
"The purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Directive 80/181/EEC of 20 December 1979 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to units of measurement and on the repeal of Directive 71/354/EEC."
"It is very good that the new directive will supersede the various acts incorporated in it; this proposal fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself."
"I voted 'in favour'."
"Based on the opinion of the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, this proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to units of measurement concludes that the proposal in question is restricted to the straightforward codification of the existing texts without any change in their substance."
"For this reason, I voted in favour of Parliament's proposal, which takes over the Commission proposal as adapted to the recommendations of the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission."
"I voted in favour of this document, codifying Council Directive 70/157/EEC of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the permissible sound level and the exhaust system of motor vehicles."
"Codification is an effective means of consolidating the rules governing a certain area in a single legislative act."
"It provides more clarity, because various provisions regulating the same issue are often spread over different legal texts."
"As they are amended, it becomes difficult to understand which provision is currently in force."
"Codification is also a suitable means of developing European Union law which is simpler, clearer and more understandable to citizens."
"I welcome the efforts that have been made towards clarifying Union law in order to make it more accessible to all EU citizens."
"I am therefore voting for this proposal for a directive on the permissible sound level and the exhaust system of motor vehicles, as I believe that the proposed system of codification drafted using a data processing system is more efficient."
"This proposal relates to the straightforward codification of the existing laws on the permissible sound level and the exhaust system of motor vehicles."
"No changes have been made to their substance on which Parliament, in particular, would be required to express an opinion."
"This report relates to the proposal for a directive of Parliament and of the Council on the permissible sound level and the exhaust system of motor vehicles, in a codified text."
"Simplifying the lives of Europeans is one of the EU's concerns. Many legislative changes have been undertaken by the Commission and Parliament in order to achieve this objective."
"One of the areas that make the lives of the EU public difficult is the constant amendments to legislation."
"These sometimes arise due to a need to update them, but this hinders and diminishes the quality of life of the individual."
"In 1987, the Commission recommended that all acts that had up to 10 amendments be codified, so that Community legislation would be easier to understand."
"To address this issue, since 1994, there has been an interinstitutional agreement between Parliament, the Commission and the Council on an accelerated working method for the adoption of codified acts."
"I am pleased, therefore, that we can finally adopt a directive codifying Council Directive 70/157/EEC of 6 February 1970, which approximates the laws of the Member States relating to the permissible sound level and the exhaust system of motor vehicles."
"in writing. - Directive 70/157/EEC is one of the separate directives of the EC type-approval system provided for in Directive 2007/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 September 2007 establishing a framework for the approval of motor vehicles and their trailers, and of systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles, and lays down technical prescriptions concerning the permissible sound level and the exhaust system of motor vehicles."
"Those technical prescriptions concern the approximation of the laws of the Member States to enable the EC type-approval procedure provided for in Directive 2007/46/EC to be applied in respect of each type of vehicle."
"Consequently, the provisions laid down in Directive 2007/46/EC relating to systems, components and separate technical units for vehicles apply to this directive."
"It is desirable to take into account the technical requirements adopted by the UN Economic Commission for Europe (UN/ECE) in its corresponding regulations annexed to the Agreement of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe concerning the adoption of uniform technical prescriptions for wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts which can be fitted and/or be used on wheeled vehicles and the conditions for reciprocal recognition of approvals granted on the basis of these prescriptions."
"in writing. - I voted for this report on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to units of measurement (codified text)."
"This proposal is confined to the codification of the existing texts relating to the permissible sound level and the exhaust system of motor vehicles, without any change in their substance, so I am voting in favour."
"in writing. - The European Parliament legislative resolution on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the permissible sound level and the exhaust system of motor vehicles will help to achieve the main purpose of the proposal - to undertake a codification of Council Directive 70/157/EEC of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the permissible sound level and the exhaust system of motor vehicles."
"I agree with the initiative of Mr Sajjad Karim and I voted 'in favour'."
"Based on the opinion of the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, this proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the permissible sound level and the exhaust system of motor vehicles concludes that the proposal in question is restricted to the straightforward codification of the existing texts without any change in their substance."
"For this reason, I voted in favour of Parliament's proposal, which takes over the Commission proposal as adapted to the recommendations of the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission."
"The importance of the transport sector to the European economy is reflected in the employment that it directly provides for more than 10 million people and in the 5% of gross domestic product (GDP) that it represents."
"Its development is vital for the EU's economic growth, and in order to bridge physical and psychological gaps."
"Moreover, as outlined in the White Paper entitled 'Roadmap to a Single European Transport Area', it is essential that the goal of a 60% cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 be met."
"This report is thus intended to simplify and clarify EU law, which is spread over numerous pieces of legislation that have already been amended several times, making them difficult to understand."
"One of the EU's objectives is the transparency of the Community acquis as a way of bringing Europe closer to its citizens, so that they can benefit from the specific rights that are given to them."
"The codification of the existing legislative texts is the result of approximating the legislation of the Member States to the establishment of technical rules on the permissible sound level and the exhaust system of motor vehicles, which promote environmental sustainability at European level."
"I voted for document 2010/0261 on the codification of the permissible sound level and the exhaust system of motor vehicles."
"This is another example of the European Commission attempting to simplify and regulate the acquis communautaire so that it becomes more transparent and accessible to EU citizens."
"The legislative proposal codifies the existing texts and creates a legislative act which is easier to understand and more accessible."
"In standardising technical norms, the regulation brings together Member States and establishes a procedure for official EU certification, defined in Directive 2007/46/EC with regard to every type of vehicle."
"I voted in favour of this document, codifying Council Directive 87/402/EEC of 25 June 1987 on roll-over protection structures mounted in front of the driver's seat on narrow-track wheeled agricultural and forestry tractors."
"Codification is an effective means of consolidating the rules governing a certain area in a single legislative act."
"It provides more clarity, because various provisions regulating the same issue are often spread over different legal texts."

"I believe that the proposed system of codification drafted using a data processing system is more efficient."
"This report concerns the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on roll-over protection structures mounted in front of the driver's seat on narrow-track wheeled agricultural and forestry tractors, as a codified text."

"in writing. - Council Directive 87/402/EEC of 25 June 1987 on roll-over protection structures mounted in front of the driver's seat on narrow-track wheeled agricultural and forestry tractors has been substantially amended several times."
"In the interests of clarity and rationality, the said directive should be codified."
"The directive mentioned above is one of the separate directives of the EC type-approval system provided for in Council Directive 74/150/EEC, as replaced by Directive 2003/37/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 May 2003 on type-approval of agricultural or forestry tractors, their trailers and interchangeable towed machinery, together with their systems, components and separate technical units, and repealing Directive 74/150/EEC, and lays down technical prescriptions concerning the design and construction of agricultural or forestry tractors as regards the roll-over protection structures mounted in front of the driver's seat."
"Those technical prescriptions concern the approximation of the laws of the Member States to enable the EC type-approval procedure provided for in Directive 2003/37/EC to be applied in respect of each type of tractor."
"Consequently, the provisions laid down in Directive 2003/37/EC relating to agricultural and forestry tractors, their trailers and interchangeable towed machinery, together with their systems, components and separate technical units, apply to this directive."

"This proposal is confined to the codification of the existing texts relating to narrow-track wheeled agricultural and forestry tractors, without any change in their substance, so I am voting in favour."
"in writing. - The European Parliament legislative resolution on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on roll-over protection structures mounted in front of the driver's seat on narrow-track wheeled agricultural and forestry tractors is very timely."
"The purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Directive 87/402/EEC of 25 June 1987 on roll-over protection structures mounted in front of the driver's seat on narrow-track wheeled agricultural and forestry tractors."

"For this reason, I voted in favour of Parliament's proposal, which adopts the Commission proposal as adapted to the recommendations of the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission."
"We are in favour of this directive on roll-over protection structures on narrow-track wheeled agricultural and forestry tractors."
"Grouping together and simplifying all the existing legislation on the subject is an important step and will help protect those who use agricultural machinery on a daily basis."
"This report, which I voted for today, relates to specific Union legislation on the EU approval system for narrow-track wheeled agricultural and forestry tractors, establishing technical rules on roll-over protection structures mounted in front of the driver's seat on tractors."
"The codification of Community legal texts is an essential procedure in order to simplify and facilitate the European public's understanding of them, thus contributing to the actual implementation of EU directives."
"In this particular case, the technical rules imposed on the Member States allow the EU approval system, established in Directive 2003/37/EC, to be applied to every model of tractor."
"There are two important issues in this report: the simplification and the transparency of EU law."
"We are living in times when the European public feels excluded from the Union project."
"I therefore believe that it is essential to find solutions in order to narrow this gap, thereby demonstrating that the main purpose of the EU is the well-being of its people."
"I voted in favour of this document, codifying Council Directive 86/415/EEC of 24 July 1986 on the installation, location, operation and identification of the controls of wheeled agricultural or forestry tractors."

"I am in favour of the report because it aims to protect operators of agricultural machinery, as the controls must be easily accessible and not represent a hazard."
"They must be designed and located, or protected, so as to prevent any involuntary movement or other manoeuvre that could endanger the machinery operator."

"This report is aimed at clarifying and simplifying Council Directive 86/298/EEC of 1986, along with various amendments already made to it, on the subject of rear-mounted roll-over protection structures on narrow-track wheeled agricultural and forestry tractors."
"The clear purpose of this process of codification is to make EU law more accessible and comprehensible for the European public."
"This directive and the corresponding changes set out technical rules on the design and manufacture of agricultural and forestry tractors, and on their respective approval system, which requires EU-level harmonisation with a view to creating the conditions necessary for road safety."
"This European harmonisation also ensures that if the protection of workers is at risk when they are using tractors, the Member States can implement the necessary and required measures, bearing in mind compliance with the Treaty and technical regulations on the protection structures specified in this directive."
"I am voting for the amended Commission proposal having regard to the interinstitutional agreement of 20 December 1994 on an accelerated working method for the official codification of legislative texts and, in particular, to point 4 thereof."
"The Consultative Working Party, consisting of the respective legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, met on 23 November 2010 for the purpose of examining the aforementioned proposal submitted by the Commission."
"An examination of the proposal for a Council directive codifying Council Directive 92/79/EEC of 19 October 1992 on the approximation of taxes on cigarettes, Council Directive 92/80/EEC of 19 October 1992 on the approximation of taxes on manufactured tobacco other than cigarettes, and Council Directive 95/59/EC of 27 November 1995 on taxes other than turnover taxes which affect the consumption of manufactured tobacco, resulted in the Consultative Working Party's concluding, without dissent, that the proposal is a straightforward codification of existing texts, without any change in their substance."
"I voted in favour of this document, codifying Council Directive 92/79/EEC of 19 October 1992 on the approximation of taxes on cigarettes, Council Directive 92/80/EEC of 19 October 1992 on the approximation of taxes on manufactured tobacco other than cigarettes and Council Directive 95/59/EC of 27 November 1995 on taxes other than turnover taxes which affect the consumption of manufactured tobacco."
"Codification is an effective means of consolidating the rules governing a certain area in a single legislative act."
"It provides more clarity, because various provisions regulating the same issue are often spread over different legal texts."
"As they are amended, it becomes difficult to understand which provision is currently in force."
"Codification is also a suitable means of developing European Union law which is simpler, clearer and more understandable to citizens."
"I welcome the efforts that have been made towards clarifying Union law in order to make it more accessible to all EU citizens."
"I am therefore voting for this proposal for a directive on the structure and rates of excise duty applied to manufactured tobacco."
"I believe that the proposed system of codification drafted using a data processing system is more efficient."
"With due regard for the opinions of the legal services of Parliament, the Council and the Commission, which have concluded that the Commission proposal was confined to a straightforward codification of the existing texts, without any change in their substance, I welcome the adoption of this proposal."
"This report concerns an amended proposal for a Council directive on the structure and specific rates of excise duty applied to the consumption of manufactured tobacco, in a codified text."
"Simplifying the lives of Europeans is one of the EU's concerns. One of the areas that make the lives of the EU public difficult is the constant amendments to legislation."
"On 1 April 1987, the Commission recommended that all acts that had up to 10 amendments be codified, so that Community legislation would be easier to understand."
"This would go on to form part of the conclusions of the Presidency of the Edinburgh European Council, which took place in December 1992."
"To address this issue, since 1994, there has been an interinstitutional agreement between Parliament, the Commission and the Council on an accelerated working method for the adoption of the codification, which should be carried out in complete compliance with the EU legislative process."
"I therefore voted in favour of this proposal, codifying Council Directive 92/79/EEC of 19 October 1992 on the structure and specific rates of excise duty applied to the consumption of manufactured tobacco."
"in writing. - The Treaty aims to maintain an economic union with healthy competition and properties that are similar to those on the domestic market."
"As regards manufactured tobacco, the achievement of this aim presupposes that the application in the Member States of taxes affecting the consumption of products in this sector does not distort conditions of competition and does not impede their free movement within the European Union. As far as excise duties are concerned, the harmonisation of structures must, in particular, result in competition in the different categories of manufactured tobacco belonging to the same group not being distorted by the effects of charging the tax and, consequently, in the opening of the Member States' national markets."
"The imperative needs of competition imply a system of freely formed prices for all groups of manufactured tobacco and implementation of this policy needs to guarantee a high level of human health."
"in writing. - I voted for this report on the amended proposal for a Council directive on the structure and rates of excise duty applied to manufactured tobacco (codified text)."
"This proposal is confined to the codification of the existing texts relating to the structure and rates of excise duty applied to the consumption of manufactured tobacco, without any change in their substance, so I am voting in favour."
"in writing. - The report of Sajjad Karim contains the European Parliament legislative resolution on the amended proposal for a Council directive on the structure and rates of excise duty applied to manufactured tobacco."
"It is known that the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Directive 92/79/EEC of 19 October 1992 on the approximation of taxes on cigarettes, Council Directive 92/80/EEC of 19 October 1992 on the approximation of taxes on manufactured tobacco other than cigarettes and Council Directive 95/59/EC of 27 November 1995 on taxes other than turnover taxes which affect the consumption of manufactured tobacco."
"This initiative is very important and timely."
"I voted 'in favour'."
"The Consultative Working Party with authority on this issue has considered the proposal for a Council directive codifying Council Directive 92/79/EEC of 19 October 1992 on the approximation of taxes on cigarettes, Council Directive 92/80/EEC of 19 October 1992 on the approximation of taxes on manufactured tobacco other than cigarettes, and Council Directive 95/59/EC of 27 November 1995 on taxes other than turnover taxes which affect the consumption of manufactured tobacco."
"The Consultative Working Party concluded that the proposal is a straightforward codification of existing texts, without any change in their substance."
"I therefore voted in favour."
"This report - like the many others we have examined up to now - promotes the simplification and clear formulation of European legislation, not least because, as in the case of excise, there are many different provisions that have been amended several times."
"Unifying them and making them comprehensible can only help operators and users alike."
"We voted in favour."
"I voted in favour of this document, codifying Council Regulation (EC) No 975/98 of 3 May 1998 on denominations and technical specifications of euro coins intended for circulation."
"Codification is an effective means of consolidating the rules governing a certain area in a single legislative act."
"It provides more clarity, because various provisions regulating the same issue are often spread over different legal texts."
"As they are amended, it becomes difficult to understand which provision is currently in force."
"Codification is also a suitable means of developing European Union law which is simpler, clearer and more understandable to citizens."
"I welcome the efforts that have been made towards clarifying Union law in order to make it more accessible to all EU citizens."
"I am therefore voting for this proposal for a regulation on denominations and technical specifications of euro coins intended for circulation."
"I believe that the proposed system of codification drafted using a data processing system is more efficient."
"With due regard for the opinions of the legal services of Parliament, the Council and the Commission, which have concluded that the Commission proposal was confined to a straightforward codification of the existing texts, without any change in their substance, I welcome the adoption of this proposal."
"This report concerns a proposal for a Council regulation on denominations and technical specifications of euro coins intended for circulation, in a codified text."
"Simplifying the lives of Europeans is one of the EU's concerns."
"One of the areas that make the lives of the EU public difficult is the constant amendments to legislation."

"To address this issue, since 1994, there has been an interinstitutional agreement between Parliament, the Commission and the Council on an accelerated working method for the adoption of codification, which should be carried out in complete compliance with the EU legislative process."
"I am therefore voting in favour of this report, codifying Council Regulation (EC) No 975/98 of 3 May 1998 on denominations and technical specifications of euro coins intended for circulation."
"in writing. - The European single coinage system should inspire public confidence and include technological innovations to ensure that it is secure, reliable and effective."
"Public confidence in the system depends on the physical properties of coins, which should be as user-friendly as possible."
"After consultations with consumer associations, European Blind Union representatives and the vending machines industry, research was carried out to take into account the specific requirements of important categories of coin users."
"In order to ensure a smooth changeover to the euro and to facilitate acceptance of the coinage systems by users, easy distinction between coins through visual and tactile characteristics needed to be guaranteed."
"The coins need to be covered with some special security features to limit the scope for fraud."
"The fact that they have one European and one national side is an appropriate expression of the idea of European Monetary Union between the Member States."
"in writing. - I voted for this report on the proposal for a Council regulation on denominations and technical specifications of euro coins intended for circulation (codified text)."
"This proposal is confined to the codification of the existing texts relating to denominations and technical specifications of euro coins intended for circulation, without any change in their substance, so I am voting in favour."
"in writing. - The report of Sajjad Karim contains a legislative resolution of the European Parliament on the proposal for a Council regulation on denominations and technical specifications of euro coins intended for circulation."
"Taking into account the likelihood of the accession of new states to the euro area, this initiative provides a new opportunity to prevent the activity of money counterfeiters."
"I voted 'in favour'."
"Based on the opinion of the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, this report on the proposal for a Council regulation on denominations and technical specifications of euro coins intended for circulation concludes that the proposal in question is restricted to the straightforward codification of the existing texts without any change in their substance."
"For this reason, I voted in favour of Parliament's proposal, which adopts the Commission proposal as adapted to the recommendations of the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission."
"Since, according to the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, the proposal in question contains a straightforward codification of the existing texts without any change in their substance, I am adopting its position at first reading, taking over the Commission proposal as adapted to the recommendations of the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission."
"I support this report because this proposal involves no more than a straightforward codification of the existing texts without any change in their substance."
"in writing. - With this 'whereas, according to the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, the proposal in question contains a straightforward codification of the existing texts without any change in their substance, the EP adopts its position at first reading, taking over the Commission proposal as adapted to the recommendations of the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission'."
"I voted in favour of Mr Karim's reports."
"The 10 reports from the Committee on Legal Affairs focus solely on the codification of various acts, as established by common accord by the Legal Service."
"As a result, there will be no changes to the content."
"The resolution adopted today fully supports the Commission's position, which is in line with the recommendations of the Consultative Working Party of the Legal Services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission."
"According to the Consultative Working Party, the proposal in question is a straightforward codification of existing texts, without any change in their substance."
"Given that the purpose of this directive is the codification of previously disparate pieces of legislation, with benefits in terms of the accessibility and comprehensibility of the legislation, without any changes in their substance, I voted in favour of this report."
"I support this proposal for the committee to continue its work on this important document on the basis of the amendments adopted by Parliament at first reading, and I hope that the Council will also take a favourable approach towards promoting access to information about textile products."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this important resolution on textile fibre names and related labelling and marking of fibre composition of textile products."
"With the adoption of this resolution, Europe has achieved a unanimous commitment to protect consumers through the indication of the country of origin and the adoption of a new mechanism for traceability of textile products."
"We, Members of the European Parliament, today adopted a joint declaration, which aims to protect European consumers from false or misleading claims on the origin of the products."
"I strongly believe that the resolution and declaration will give a major impetus towards the creation of a mechanism of providing accurate information to consumers, particularly with regard to the exact origin of the products purchased."
"EU citizens must have the right to know the place of origin and quality level of products and textiles that they purchase."
"I voted in favour of this report because it is important that consumers be fully informed when buying textiles."
"Thanks to the report, clear labelling of textiles that have any animal content will be mandatory in future."
"This will help people with allergies as well."
"New fibres and innovative products could be brought to market without delay because of the changes proposed in the report, and consumers will have better choice as a result."
"I particularly welcome what the report says about doing two studies: on the possibility of a link between allergies and the chemicals used in textiles, and on the feasibility of implementing a scheme of labelling by place of origin to ensure full traceability of textile products."
"I am in agreement with the rapporteur in that a balance should be struck between implementing a high level of protection for consumers and the need to simplify the regulatory framework for textile products."
"I voted in favour of this report."
"It aims to simplify and improve the existing regulatory framework for the labelling of textile products, encourage innovation in the clothing and textile sector, and the development and uptake of new fibres."
"I agree that the right balance should be struck between a high level of consumer protection and the simplification of the regulatory framework for textile products."
"Extending compulsory labelling should not impose a disproportionate burden on enterprises without bringing real added-value for consumers, who may even be confused by an excess of information on the label of textile products."
"I believe that it would be useful for the Commission to submit a report to the European Parliament and the Council regarding possible new labelling requirements to be introduced at Union level."
"This should examine, in particular, consumer views with regard to the amount of information that should be supplied on the label of textile products, and investigate which means other than labelling may be used to provide additional information to consumers."
"The proposal for a regulation adopted by the Commission on 30 January 2010 is aimed at simplifying the existing regulatory framework, bringing the three existing directives on naming and labelling textile products together in a single regulation."
"At first reading, on 18 May 2010, Parliament approved 63 amendments with a large majority."
"Most of these were technical amendments aimed at aligning the text with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
"It also adopted a number of substantive amendments, including rules on origin marking, indication of animal-derived materials, multi-fibre textile products, and so on. In its assessment, the Council rejected all substantive amendments proposed by Parliament."
"I voted for this report, the recommendation for second reading, because it restores the vast majority of Parliament's amendments at first reading, including those relating to origin marking, indication of animal-derived materials and multi-fibre textile products."
"These changes will contribute to the promotion and innovation of European industry, and will increase the level of information provided to consumers."
"Equally important will be the study that the Commission will have to submit by September 2013 to determine whether there is a causal link between allergic reactions and the chemicals or mixtures used in textile products."
"In January 2009, the Commission adopted the proposal for a new regulation on textile names and related labelling of textile products."
"The aim of the proposal is to simplify and improve the existing regulatory framework for the labelling of textile products with a view to encouraging the development and uptake of new fibres."
"By transforming the three existing directives into a single regulation, the proposal facilitates the process to adapt legislation to technical progress whilst allowing fibre users to benefit more readily from innovative products on the market."
"I welcome this proposal, and I consider it particularly significant that the new regulation contains a specific reference to 'Made in' labelling."
"It is crucial, in fact, to continue along this path in order to furnish the European Union with the tools to compete with and face its main trade partners, such as the United States, Canada, China and Japan, on the globalised market."
"Furthermore I wish to emphasise here what is, in my view, the most important aspect of the agreement reached with the Council, namely, the commitment by the European Commission to present, by 30 September 2013, after it has carried out a suitable impact assessment, a report accompanied by legislative proposals regarding indication of origin labelling, traceability and the use of new technologies."
"I voted in favour of this report because it aims to simplify and improve the existing regulatory framework for the labelling of textile products and thus encourage the development and uptake of new fibres and better consumer protection."
"As the final text is still being negotiated with the Council, the European Parliament's report proposes to identify issues such as the origin marking of textile products imported to the EU, according to which it would be compulsory for the label to indicate not only the manufacturer of the end product, but the country of origin of the imported textile products used to manufacture it, as is already done in Canada, the US, China and Japan."
"In general, the report proposes that labels should show as much information as possible about the composition of the product and that we should call on the Commission to investigate whether imported products are damaging to human health due to their composition, in order to improve consumer protection."
"However, at the same time, the report proposes rejecting any unnecessary administrative burden for goods manufacturers."
"For example, it proposes replacing markings on labels with language-independent symbols to avoid translation of fibre names into several EU languages."
"It is also proposed that self-employed tailors should be exempt from this future regulation."
"I voted in favour of this resolution, which has the merit of simplifying the existing system concerning the labelling of textile products, as well as encouraging the development and uptake of new fibres and shortening the time between the submission of an application and the adoption of a new fibre name."
"These new rules would allow consumers to benefit more readily from innovative products."
"Furthermore, the document we approved today also encourages the introduction of origin marking, which would facilitate consumer choice and contribute to reducing fraudulent or misleading claims of origin."
"In this regard, I support the amendment laying down the requirement for manufacturers to indicate the presence of non-textile parts of animal origin on the labelling."
"This will protect consumers from the risk of inadvertently purchasing real fur products, for example, and will provide greater protection for those suffering from allergies."
"I believe in the positive impact of simplifying and improving the existing regulatory framework for the labelling of textile products, particularly encouraging the development and uptake of new fibres."
"In view of this, I am voting for the adoption of the regulation tabled by Parliament and the Commission."
"However, I believe that the amendments tabled by the rapporteur are important."
"In order to prevent consumers from inadvertently purchasing products made from animal-derived materials (fur and leather), I supported this report, which provides for mandatory labelling containing the phrase 'non-textile parts of animal origin'."
"The label will also guard against certain problems that might affect some consumers who suffer from allergies."
"This regulation is aimed at establishing rules on the use of textile fibre names and related labelling of textile products, as well as rules on the quantitative analysis of binary and ternary textile fibres mixtures."
"This entails transforming Directive 96/74/EC into a regulation and repealing Directives 96/73/EC and 73/44/EEC."
"The aim is to make the process of adding new fibres to the harmonised list of textile fibre names more transparent, and to adapt the legislation to technological developments in the textile industry."
"The amendments reintroduced by the rapporteur cover the issues of identifying the origin of the textile, non-textile parts of animal origin, a review clause, a request for a study on hazardous substances, language-independent symbols or codes for fibres, requirements for the technical file to be attached to the application for the authorisation of a new textile fibre name, multi-fibre textile products, self-employed tailors, laboratories testing textile mixtures, and the mandatory indication of the fibre composition for felts and felt hats."
"I voted in favour."
"This recommendation for second reading concerns the Council position on the adoption of a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on textile fibre names and related labelling and marking of fibre composition of textile products."
"The textile sector is very complex and represents a significant share of economic activity in the Member States."
"The rapporteur has managed to reach an agreement on issues as controversial as origin marking, non-textile parts of animal origin, hazardous substances and others."
"Furthermore, he has managed to include a review clause which allows obstacles to the proper functioning of the Internal Market to be eliminated."
"Despite some initial difficulties, it was possible for the three European institutions to come to an understanding, which amounts to a very satisfactory result."
"The Council can therefore quickly adopt this legislation with a view to its entry into force in January 2012, which would greatly benefit consumers."
"I am therefore pleased with the consensus that has been reached, and I am voting in favour of this regulation repealing Council Directive 73/44/EEC, Parliament Directive 96/73/EC and Directive 2008/121/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council."
"The aim of this proposal for a regulation is to simplify and improve the existing regulatory framework for the labelling of textile products, with a view to protecting and encouraging the development and uptake of new fibres."
"The proposal facilitates the process of adapting legislation to technical progress by transforming the three existing directives into a single regulation, thereby avoiding the transposition of merely technical updates and shortening the time between the submission of an application and the adoption of a new fibre name."
"The long-standing wishes of producers are focused on naming and labelling."
"The simplification of the existing regulatory framework has the potential to encourage innovation in the textile and clothing sector, whilst allowing consumers to benefit more quickly from innovative products."
"At first reading, in 2010, Parliament approved amendments to rules on origin marking, indication of animal-derived materials, use of language-independent symbols and a review clause, but the Council did not accept everything."
"It is vital that it now accept the different proposals, especially those on origin marking."
"For these reasons, we voted for most of the positions adopted here."
"The initial aim of this proposal was to simplify and improve the existing regulatory framework for the labelling of textile products."
"During its negotiations with the EU Council of Ministers, Parliament included new provisions in the regulation, such as those requiring the indication of animal-derived materials in textile products and conducting a study to determine whether there is a causal link between allergic reactions and the chemicals used in textile products."
"The presence of animal-derived materials should be clearly indicated, so as to prevent consumers or individuals who suffer allergies from running the risk of inadvertently purchasing real fur products when they would prefer not to do so."
"The Commission will have to prepare a study by 30 September 2013 to determine whether there is a causal link between allergic reactions, and the chemicals or mixtures used in textile products."
"On the basis of this study, the Commission will table legislative proposals, where appropriate."
"This regulation should soon be adopted by the EU Council of Ministers and enter into force on the 20th day following its publication."
"There will be a transitional period of two and a half years for the rules on labelling requirements, and for those on the indication of 'non-textile parts of animal origin'."
"in writing. - The current absence of harmonised rules on origin marking puts the EU at a disadvantage and also deprives European producers of origin-sensitive consumer goods of the opportunity to reap the benefits associated with producing within the Union, while consumers miss the opportunity to have access to information on the origin of products."
"Origin marking would facilitate consumer choice and contribute to reducing fraudulent, inaccurate or misleading claims of origin."
"This amendment introduces a requirement to indicate the presence of non-textile parts of animal origin in textile products."
"It should be highlighted that fur is often used as trimming in relatively inexpensive garments, which are often imported from Asia."
"In order to eliminate potential obstacles to the proper functioning of the internal market caused by diverging provisions or practices by Member States, and in order to keep pace with the development of electronic commerce and future challenges in the market for textile products, it is necessary to examine the harmonisation and standardisation of other aspects of textile labelling with a view to facilitating the free movement of textile products in the internal market and achieving a uniform and high level of consumer protection throughout the EU."
"The process within the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection was a turning point for Mr Manders's proposal, as that was where it was decided that it should be made compulsory to include the full composition of a product rather than just some of its parts."
"Subsequently, however, our group mentioned the need to safeguard the textile industry and the 'Made in' label, but no response to this position was given in the negotiations with the Council."
"Nevertheless, there are elements which are worthy of support, such as streamlining the registration of materials."
"As I consider safeguarding the 'Made in' label to be a priority issue, I cannot vote in favour, and have therefore chosen to abstain."
"I voted for the Manders report on regulations covering the labelling of textile products."
"I am very happy that Parliament, on the occasion of this vote at second reading, has reintroduced a series of amendments, despite opposition from the Council."
"It is important for consumers to be able to make their purchases in full knowledge of the facts, and for them not to purchase leather or fur inadvertently as is the case, in particular, when fur is used as trimming on cheap clothing."
"Furthermore, the text highlights the need for traceability of textile products and a study will be commissioned by the Commission on the potential health hazards of products such as synthetic fibres or dyes."
"The resolution on textile fibre names and related labelling and marking of textile products which has been adopted by the European Parliament is particularly important for the textile sector in the European Union."
"It will enable the more rapid introduction to the market of new fibres which will help innovative textile firms in particular in the practical application of their research and development."
"The resolution was the subject of a long debate between the European Parliament and the Council."
"Parliament called for new elements to extend the regulation, in particular: indication of the country of origin, indication of fibres of animal origin, and more rigorous requirements concerning the use of harmful substances in the production of textiles."
"Parliament managed to convince the Council that it was essential to clearly label fibres of animal origin."
"This provision is very useful, in particular, for those consumers who have an allergy to leather goods, and to consumers who, for ideological reasons, do not want to buy textiles containing elements of animal origin."
"I hope that in the near future, we will also be successful in achieving an understanding on indicating the origin of goods."
"This issue has remained unresolved for too long."
"I think that European firms and consumers will benefit from clearly formulated principles."
"I endorsed this document because it proposes laying down rules on the presence of non-textile parts of animal origin in certain products, as well as indicating products' origins precisely."
"Above all, this regulation should provide for requirements to indicate non-textile parts of animal origin when labelling or marking textile products, so that consumers can make a choice on the basis of the information in their possession."
"Labelling or marking should not be misleading and should be provided in such a way that the consumer can easily understand to which part of the product the particulars refer."
"I am pleased that, at last, we in Parliament have reached a decision on an act relating to textile labelling involving some very substantial proposals for improvements, which the Council is also prepared to endorse and implement."
"Working on the regulation in committee sometimes involved some very ambitious notions, which, luckily, we abandoned."
"It is an obvious improvement that products must henceforth be clearly marked if they contain matter of animal origin, for reasons of public health, since fur, for example, is a health risk for many people who suffer from allergies."
"Although some of the manufacturers of products opposed this initiative, referring to existing laws on the requirements for labelling parts of animal origin, an improvement has now been made, and it is a very real indication of the EU's consumer oriented thinking."
"However, the compulsory marking of the origin of products from third countries would have been ineffective and expensive in itself to accomplish."
"It is difficult to make an impromptu estimate of the added value to the consumer that such a requirement might bring, especially as, in the global world, products are rarely manufactured or originate in just one country."
"For that reason, it is important that the Commission should now investigate the matter and that the practical aspects of going ahead should be weighed carefully."
"In the same connection, it is natural that the reform and harmonisation of product labelling should be assessed overall, as has now been agreed."
"in writing. - I welcome the Commission's proposal, as it simplifies the existing regulatory framework and has the potential to encourage innovation in the textile and clothing sector, whilst allowing fibre users and consumers to benefit more readily from innovative products."
"The new rules on labelling of textile products are crucial for preventing the problems that arise if consumers are poorly informed."
"The presence of animal-derived materials must be clearly indicated, so as to prevent consumers or individuals who suffer allergies from running the risk of inadvertently purchasing real fur products when they would prefer not to do so."
"The initial aim of this proposal is to simplify and improve the existing regulatory framework for the labelling of textile products."
"During the negotiations with the EU Council of Ministers, the inclusion of new provisions in the regulation was very important, such as those requiring the indication of animal-derived materials in textile products and conducting a study to determine whether there is a causal link between allergic reactions and chemicals or mixtures used in textile products."
"in writing. - The report of Toine Manders is aimed at helping the buyers of textile products."
"New rules on textile labelling are proposed which will help customers avoid the risk of buying textile products which contain natural fur or leather."
"I voted 'in favour'."
"Consumers' awareness of the goods they buy is constantly growing."
"For the majority of people, the origin of the products plays a very important role in their decisions about what they want to spend their money on."
"In the textile sector, there is a need for a great deal more information in this area so that consumers know where the jumpers, jackets and trousers, etc. that they are buying come from and which materials they are made of."
"As things currently stand, the labelling requirements are highly inadequate."
"We need clearer labels to indicate where animal products are used to make a garment, in particular, in the case of fur and fur trim."
"I voted in favour of the report because it deals with providing detailed information that is urgently needed by citizens, who have the right to know where their textiles come from and what materials they are made of."
"The text being examined today is, unfortunately, very different from the one approved by this House at first reading."
"The substantive difference lies in the fact that this report makes no reference to the origin marking to be included on textile product labels."
"The Council has strongly opposed the idea, and it is difficult to understand why."
"Is it not right for consumers to know where the clothes they wear come from?"
"The presence of origin marking would surely have provided a guarantee of product quality and protection."
"I am really puzzled by the fact that only two Member States, Italy and Lithuania, insisted in the Council on including origin marking, and I wonder what interest the other European countries have in not protecting their own businesses in this way, since they are thus left more exposed to problems of unfair competition and counterfeiting."
"Parliament has unfortunately bowed to the Council's short-sighted decision not to endorse the much-needed origin marking, and I therefore feel I must vote against today's report."
"This report is a recommendation for second reading on the Council position at first reading on the adoption of a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on textile fibre names and related labelling and marking of fibre composition of textile products."
"The Council rejected all substantive amendments proposed by Parliament at first reading, as it believes that these would not be compatible with the intended simplification."
"The main amendments proposed by Parliament and reintroduced in the report, which I voted for, relate to issues that I believe to be of the utmost importance for the European market."
"Of these, I would like to highlight origin marking and the inclusion of a requirement to indicate the country of origin of textile products imported from third countries."
"The current absence of harmonised rules on origin marking puts the EU at a disadvantage as regards its main trade partners, such as Canada, China, Japan and the US, which require origin marking for imported goods."
"Origin marking would facilitate consumer choice and contribute to reducing fraudulent, inaccurate or misleading claims of origin."
"At first reading, Parliament approved 63 amendments to the Commission proposal on a regulation on textile fibre names and related labelling of textile products."
"Some of these amendments were of a technical nature while others were related to the substance, including rules on origin marking, indication of animal-derived materials, the use of language-independent symbols and a review clause."
"The technical amendments were largely accepted by the Council, but it rejected all substantive amendments proposed by Parliament."
"Most of these amendments have now been restored, as it is considered important that the Council recognise their expediency and give them due consideration."
"in writing. - In its position at first reading, adopted on 18 May 2010, the European Parliament approved, by a very large majority, 63 amendments."
"The vast majority were technical amendments aimed at aligning the text with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and with the new legislative framework for the marketing of goods."
"Parliament also adopted a number of substantive amendments, including rules on origin marking, the indication of animal-derived materials, the use of language-independent symbols and a review clause."
"I supported the report because it is a step towards better consumer protection and stresses the quality of textiles products."
"It is nonetheless a pity that we have failed to push through the demands for country of origin labelling, as this is one item of information which adds to the possibilities for consumer choice and can help to reduce the occurrence of various inaccurate and misleading statements regarding origin."
"The absence of harmonised rules in this area also deprives European producers of advantages relating to production in the EU."
"I believe the Commission will continue its efforts to find an acceptable solution in this matter."
"The Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV) is voting against this recommendation of the European Parliament."
"The original Commission proposal envisaged a simplification of formalities in order to make it easier to introduce new textile fibres."
"The European Parliament has added a requirement that, in future, businesses will be obliged to state where a textile product comes from via what is known as country of origin labelling."
"We do not support Parliament's position in this regard."
"Consumers benefit where labels contain information about materials that pose a health hazard or that cause allergic reactions."
"Stating the country of origin on the label is pointless European nitpicking."
"Obviously, the origin of a product tells us nothing about the production process or the quality of the product, nor does it increase consumer protection."
"Even if the so-called country of origin is specified, other parts of the production process can take place elsewhere."
"All the 'made in x' label does is create a false sense of clarity for the consumer, while in reality bringing about extra costs and bureaucracy."
"Businesses have to face additional administrative hassle, the checking of labels requires additional customs formalities and, ultimately, it becomes more expensive to import products."
"The PVV will thus also be voting against this recommendation."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of labelling country of origin and fur and welcome this piece of legislation."
"I welcome the agreement that has been concluded between the European Parliament and the Council on the extremely complex issue of textile names and related labelling of textile products."
"Consumers must be provided with accurate information on the presence of non-textile animal-derived products, such as fur, so that they can make informed choices."
"I would also insist on the need for the Commission to examine, with the greatest attention, the issue of social labelling."
"I believe that consumers should be informed about the social conditions under which a textile product has been manufactured in order to give them greater responsibility for the working conditions of workers in the textile industry."
"We must obviously not overload the labels with information, but social labelling could enable working conditions in the European Union and worldwide to undergo lasting change thanks to a citizen-based approach by consumers when they make purchases."
"The agreement that was approved today after two years of intensive negotiations will simplify the placing on the market of new fibres and improve consumer protection on the internal market thanks to clear, visible and legible textile labels."
"In addition, the European Parliament was able to put its clear stamp on this regulation."
"Textile products which comprise non-textile parts of animal origin, such as fur or leather, should, in future, state this clearly on the label."
"It also proved possible to honour Parliament's explicit requests for further investigation into the use of language-independent symbols on clothing labels and into possible links between allergic reactions and chemical substances used in textiles."
"The commitment that Parliament sought and obtained from the Commission that it would, where necessary, and after having a thorough study carried out, bring forward legislative proposals in 2013 in relation to the traceability of textile products, is an important step forwards."
"For these reasons, I voted in favour of the agreement that Parliament was able to reach with the Council at second reading."
"As regards the Manders recommendation on textile names and related labelling of textile products, I voted in favour of the compromise proposal by the political groups because I am in favour of a compulsory system of labelling of the country of origin of third-country textile products."
"I also consider that this may promote fair competition in the EU and on the international stage."
"The Lithuanian textile and clothing sector is one of the most specialised in Europe, with 1 000 enterprises involved in this sector employing 40 000 people."
"For me, and the majority of Lithuanians, it is therefore important for the new rules on the labelling of textile products mentioned in this report to help protect the reputation of our textile sector."
"Hopefully, the new legislation will simplify the current labelling rules."
"Furthermore, we need reliable chemical tests to confirm that textiles created meet hygiene and environmental criteria."
"European consumers have the right to know what they are buying."
"The use of any products of animal origin must be clearly shown on the label of the textile product."
"The new textile labelling rules should help stop consumers from unwittingly buying textile products made from real fur or leather."
"The fate of the Lithuanian textile and clothing sector is closely linked to the EU, as 84% of Lithuanian textiles are exported to the EU."
"Not many people are aware that Lithuanian textile manufacturers sew uniforms for various military and police forces throughout Europe, including NATO."
"Therefore, both Lithuania and Europe should be interested in increasing efforts to improve quality control and transparency."
"in writing. - Following today's vote on labelling, consumers will no longer face the risk of mistakenly buying textiles containing real leather or fur."
"I believe that consumers have the right to know what the products they buy are made from, and this report ensures that any animal-derived materials will be indicated on textile product labels."
"This is good news not only for people who do not want to buy products that contain real fur or leather, but also for those who suffer from allergies."
"I am disappointed that this report did not make origin labelling compulsory for textile products, but I am encouraged that the Commission will come forward with an assessment report to address such issues in the future."
"I have voted in favour of the report on naming and labelling textile products."
"The proposed revision of EU legislation primarily concerns technical issues which do not have a major political impact."
"However, the resulting simplification of the processes will help to promote innovation within the industry."
"The compromise reached by several groups in the European Parliament also takes into consideration existing problems involving counterfeit products in the European textile sector and calls for transparent and coherent trade regulations to ensure protection for consumers."
"I voted in favour of the report by Mr Manders."
"The text on which we have voted not only proposes to combine the three directives on the labelling of textile composition into a single European regulation applicable to all the Member States, but it is also designed to simplify the procedure for recognising new fibres."
"Mr Manders's report would probably have been more complete if it had included a rule on compulsory origin labelling for products originating in non-EU countries but, given the difficulties that occur when certain subjects are tackled, I believe that in the end, a good compromise was reached in the final text that was put to the vote."
"I am voting for this proposal as it amends certain aspects of Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009, so as to extend its validity to 31 December 2015 and make certain adjustments resulting from the entry into force of bilateral agreements with Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Serbia."
"Given that the interim agreements/stabilisation and association agreements (SAAs) grant trade concessions to Bosnia and Herzegovina on the products identified in the autonomous trade preferences, these concessions have to be withdrawn from Council Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009."
"These concern the preferential tariff quotas for baby beef, sugar and sugar products, certain wines, as well as for certain fishery products."
"The termination of the trade preferences would take from the beneficiaries an objective economic advantage in their trade with the EU."
"This could have extremely negative consequences on the overall economic performance of the whole Western Balkans region, with subsequent negative repercussions on their domestic reform and transition processes."
"Moreover, their economic recovery could be seriously jeopardised."
"I voted in favour of this report."
"The European Union has granted the countries of the Western Balkans exceptional unlimited duty-free access to the EU market for nearly all products."
"The key aim of these measures is to revitalise the Western Balkan economies through privileged access to the EU market."
"In turn, economic development is to foster political stability in the entire region."
"These trade preferences were granted for a period ending on 31 December 2010."
"I agree that the validity of the exemption provisions should be extended to 31 December 2015."
"The termination of the trade preferences would take from the beneficiaries an objective economic advantage in their trade with the EU."
"This could have negative consequences on the overall economic performance of the Western Balkans, with subsequent negative repercussions on their domestic reform and transition processes."
"I support the introduction of exceptional trade measures for countries and territories benefiting from the Stabilisation and Association process."
"Everyone is aware that trade is a driver of economic development and these trade measures will revitalise the economies of the Western Balkans."
"In addition, granting the Western Balkan countries privileged access to the European Union market will also enable us to encourage more rapid integration of their economies with that of the European Union."
"We are voting today on the extension of exceptional trade preferences such as tariff exemptions and trade preferences for Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, and Kosovo until 2015."
"Under the terms of Council Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009, the preferential tariff quotas apply to baby beef, sugar and sugar products, certain wines, as well as certain fishery products."
"This extension is aimed at addressing the widespread economic crisis, given that terminating trade preferences would compromise these countries' economic recovery, and would have consequences for the whole stabilisation and transition process of the Western Balkans."
"This report focuses on a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009, which introduces exceptional trade measures for countries and territories participating in or linked to the EU's stabilisation and association process."
"The countries of the Western Balkans are in this situation, and products originating from them enjoy duty-free status and exceptional unlimited access to the EU market."
"These measures are aimed at mitigating the crisis and revitalising the economy of these countries."
"These exceptional measures came to an end on 31 December 2010 and if they are not extended, there will be severe consequences for wealth creation, jeopardising economic recovery and the internal reform and transition processes."
"I therefore agree with the amendments proposed by the rapporteur, as well as the extension of these measures until 31 December 2015, subject to the necessary adjustments resulting from the new bilateral agreements with Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia."
"This report is aimed at extending exceptional, unlimited, duty-free access to the EU market for nearly all products originating in the countries and territories benefiting from the stabilisation and association process."
"The pretext of this is to revitalise the Western Balkan economies through privileged access to the EU market, in the belief that any economic growth resulting from this will foster political stability throughout the region."
"These measures cannot, however, be considered in isolation from the situation of severe economic and social crisis that exists today in the Balkans, particularly in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Kosovo."
"The current crisis in this region is obviously part of the wider crisis of capitalism and is being aggravated by its impact: however, it is deeply rooted in a long history of interference, aggression and military occupation, promoted by the EU and its main powers, and the US, seeking to impose their economic and political dominance on the region."
"The secession of Kosovo and the role of the EU in this are indicative of that, and the internal process dubbed 'reform and transition' represents the current stage of this process of the imposition of imperial rule over the region."
"The proposals made here today should be viewed, analysed and understood in this light."
"This report is aimed at extending exceptional, unlimited, duty-free access to the EU market for nearly all products originating in the countries and territories benefiting from the so-called stabilisation and association process."
"The pretext of this is to revitalise the Western Balkan economies through privileged access to the EU market, in the belief that any economic growth resulting from this will foster political stability throughout the region."
"These measures cannot, however, be considered in isolation from the situation of severe economic and social crisis that exists today in the Balkans, particularly in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Kosovo."
"The current crisis in this region is part of the wider crisis of capitalism and is being aggravated by its impact: however, it is deeply rooted in a long history of interference, aggression and military occupation, promoted by the EU and its main powers, and the US, seeking to impose their economic and political dominance."
"The secession of Kosovo and the role of the EU in this are indicative of that, and the internal process dubbed 'reform and transition' represents the current stage of this process of the imposition of imperial rule over the region."
"in writing. - In Council Regulation (EC) 2007/2000, the European Union granted exceptional unlimited duty-free access to EU markets for almost all products originating in the countries and territories benefiting from the stabilisation and association process."
"The main objective of these measures is to revitalise the economies of the Western Balkans through privileged access to the EU market."
"In addition, economic development has promoted political stability throughout the region."
"These trade preferences were granted for the period that ended on 31 December 2010 and which currently apply to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Kosovo."
"The abolition of trade preferences could, however, have very negative consequences on the overall economic performance of the Western Balkans and, consequently, a negative effect on their domestic reforms and the transformation process."
"Moreover, it could seriously jeopardise the economic recovery."
"In order not to disrupt trade, it is therefore desirable to extend the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 to 31 December 2015."
"The purpose of these measures is to help countries in the process of stabilisation, such as the countries of the Western Balkans, through preferential trade measures with the EU compared to third countries."
"In view of the proper decision to extend the regulation until 2015, giving particular attention to Bosnia and Herzegovina and to Serbia, I confirm that I voted in favour."
"I welcomed this important document because, through Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000, the European Union has granted exceptional unlimited duty-free access to the EU market for nearly all products originating in the countries and territories benefiting from the Stabilisation and Association process."
"The key aim of these measures is to revitalise the Western Balkan economies through privileged access to the EU market."
"In turn, economic development is to foster political stability in the entire region."
"The trade preferences were granted for a period ending on 31 December 2010 and currently apply to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Kosovo, as defined by UNSCR 1244/99 for all the products under the scope of Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009."
"Products originating in Albania, the Republic of Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia or Montenegro continue to benefit from the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 when so indicated or from any measures provided in the same regulation which are more favourable than the trade concessions provided for in the framework of bilateral agreements between the European Union and these countries."
"This proposal amends certain elements of Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 in order to permit the extension of its validity to 31 December 2015 and make certain adjustments consequent to the entry into force of bilateral agreements with Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia."
"in writing. - I strongly support the amendment of certain elements of Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 in order to permit the extension of its validity to 31 December 2015 and make certain adjustments consequent to the entry into force of bilateral agreements with Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia."
"This report endorses the pressures exercised by the European Union on the Balkan States to serve the interests of the former."
"It even charges Parliament to take, in cooperation with the Council, 'appropriate measures' if the governments of these States do not show sufficient desire to liberalise their economies."
"This is overweening imperialism!"
"I shall vote against."
"Under Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000, the EU granted exceptional, unlimited, duty-free access to the EU market for nearly all products originating in the countries and territories benefiting from the Stabilisation and Association process."
"The key aim of this measure is to revitalise the Western Balkan economies through privileged access to the EU market."
"The economic development that comes about as a result will foster political stability throughout the region."
"The benefits from this regulation came to an end on 31 December 2010."
"Given the economic and financial crisis that we are currently experiencing, it is necessary to extend these conditions to 31 December 2015 so that the cessation of these special conditions does not lead to stagnation in the economies of these regions, as good economic conditions are needed to maintain stability and peace in this troubled Balkan region."
"in writing. - When the European Union adopted Regulation No 2007/2000, it granted exceptional unlimited duty-free access to the EU market for nearly all products originating in the countries and territories benefiting from the Stabilisation and Association process."
"The key aim of these measures is to revitalise the Western Balkan economies through privileged access to the EU market."
"In turn, economic development is to foster political stability in the entire region."
"The validity of the trade preferences should not be terminated because this could have negative consequences on the overall economic performances of the Western Balkans, with consequent negative repercussions on their domestic reform and transition processes."
"Moreover, their economic recovery could be seriously jeopardised."
"Therefore, I agree with the rapporteur who strongly supports the amendment of certain elements of Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 in order to permit the extension of its validity to 31 December 2015 and I voted 'in favour'."
"In order to stimulate the economies of the countries in the Western Balkans, they have been given privileged access to the European market."
"This applies to almost all goods produced in countries participating in or linked to the EU's Stabilisation and Association process."
"The trade preferences were granted for a period ending on 31 December 2010 and cover the following countries: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Kosovo."
"The preferences remain in place for goods from Albania, Croatia, Macedonia and Montenegro."
"If these trade preferences were to come to an end now, this would jeopardise further economic growth in these countries."
"I have not voted in favour of the report because, as has already been explained, some points in the new regulation are not clearly worded."
"This report aims to extend the validity of Council Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009, which adopts exceptional trade measures for countries and territories participating in or linked to the EU's Stabilisation and Association Process."
"The EU has granted exceptional, unlimited, duty-free access to the EU market for nearly all products originating in the countries and territories benefiting from the Stabilisation and Association process."
"The key aim of this measure is to revitalise the Western Balkan economies through privileged access to the EU market."
"I argue that there should have been provision for a study of the impact on the Internal Market with such exceptional access."
"These trade preferences were granted for a period ending on 31 December 2010."
"The termination of the trade preferences would withdraw from the beneficiaries any objective economic advantage in their trade with the EU."
"This could have serious consequences on the overall economic performance of the Western Balkans, with subsequent negative repercussions on their domestic reform and transition processes, and it could jeopardise their economic recovery."
"I voted in favour of this proposal, which is aimed at extending the validity of these measures until 31 December 2015."
"Under Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000, the EU granted exceptional, unlimited, duty-free access to the EU market for nearly all products originating in the countries and territories benefiting from the Stabilisation and Association process."
"The key aim of this measure is to revitalise the Western Balkan economies through privileged access to the EU market."
"These trade preferences, which currently apply to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Kosovo, were granted for a period ending on 31 December 2010, but their validity should now be extended to 31 December 2015 so as not to jeopardise these countries' economic recovery."
"in writing. - Although the final vote was postponed, we voted on several amendments."
"These 'exceptional trade measures' with the partners in the Western Balkans, under the EU Stabilisation and Association process, are indeed preferential tariff measures which guarantee easier access to the EU market for the partner countries' exports."
"They need to be notified to the World Trade Organisation."
"The programme ran out at the end of 2010, and what we have now is simply the extension to it."
"It has been blocked because of the delayed comitology decision."
"Early in January 2011, the International Trade Committee made a proposal to the Council to ensure that the procedure was speeded up, but received no answer."
"Thus, Parliament had to await the adoption of the Szájer report on comitology in March in order to proceed further."
"An informal trialogue resolved the issue to permit adoption at first reading."
"The delay has created hardship in some receiving countries, and particularly in Kosovo, and Parliament has been wrongly blamed for this."
"I am voting for this proposal as I agree with the guiding principle that runs through it."
"The EU is indeed the world's largest economy."
"Neither the US nor China is larger, contrary to what is usually stated in discussions on what is and what will be the number one global economy."
"The difference is that the US and China have the bigger markets, as they offer better preconditions for competition, competitiveness, new services, products and innovations."
"The need for a single Internal Market is critical if Europe is to become a leading player in the global economy, with a focus on the service sector and the knowledge economy, but, at the same time, the Digital Agenda and the digital economy can serve as a spearhead for realising the Internal Market for all parts of our economy."
"This requires the ability to become a leader in terms of broadband and Internet use."
"Opening Europe up to new services and increased mobile traffic lays the ground for new opportunities for culture and content, broadcasters and public services within the framework of broadband while, at the same time, ensuring the same opportunities for broadcasting."
"I voted in favour of this resolution on a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the first radio spectrum policy programme."
"I agree with the rapporteur's opinion that the need for one single internal market is crucial for Europe to take a leadership in the global economy, with a focus on the service sector and the knowledge economy."
"The Digital Agenda and the digital economy can serve as a spearhead for making the Internal Market real for all parts of our economy."
"This requires an ability to take the lead regarding broadband and the use of the Internet."
"We must aim to make Europe the best and do what is best for Europe: free up spectrum for new services and increased mobile traffic, laying the ground for new opportunities for culture and content, broadcasters and public services within the framework of broadband."
"The first radio spectrum policy programme (RSPP) is a significant step in ensuring the efficient and optimal use of this finite resource."
"Europe must be in the lead in this process of change, creating the best opportunities for a competitive European knowledge economy characterised by vitality, change and innovations."
"That requires access to Internet and broadband applications with the greatest capacity and the highest speed."
"I voted in favour of this report."
"The Digital Agenda and the digital economy represent one of the most important objectives of the EU 2020 strategy, aimed at closing the digital gap, and increasing the productivity, cohesion and competitiveness of European industry, and ensuring better access to the single market for the EU's consumers and companies."
"Today, Europe is lagging behind the US and China, which are freeing up large parts of the spectrum in order to allow for the rapid development of new services and high speed mobile Internet."
"Effective spectrum use must be promoted in the EU in order to satisfy the growing need for radio frequencies, and mobile broadband capacity must be increased, ensuring better opportunities for the public and commercial sector."
"We must overcome the digital divide so that by 2020, all EU citizens have access to broadband services at a speed of at least 30 Mbps."
"Future spectrum policy must also guarantee a suitable, simple and non-discriminatory authorisation system, which would create a level playing field throughout the EU and would promote competition."
"I voted in favour of this report because its aim is to create maximum opportunities for business and individual consumers to take advantage of wireless Internet, radio and television services, freeing up radio spectrum."
"This would benefit European citizens in two ways - easing access to modern means of communication and telecom networks would reduce the exclusion of EU citizens which still exists, particularly for those living in rural and peripheral areas, and would promote the EU economy more actively, because there would be stronger conditions for developing an innovative services sector and knowledge economy."
"Europe has set itself the task of ensuring that by 2013, all EU citizens have the opportunity to use broadband, and wireless technology represents the most convenient way of achieving this task and requires the least investment."
"I congratulate Mr Hökmark on preparing such a topical report on the radio spectrum policy programme."
"I voted in favour of it since I firmly endorse all measures aimed at supporting and implementing the internal single market."
"Europe needs to adopt advanced systems for broadband and Internet use that are accessible to all and are also able to reach rural and outlying areas, as required by the Digital Agenda."
"At the same time, it is important to ensure security for private individuals, producers, users and public authorities."
"Moreover, the high cost of fibre optics and the growing demand by users for high-speed connections mean that the technological framework must be reviewed in both legislative and operational terms."
"To that end, multiannual radio spectrum legislative programmes need to be prepared in order to establish strategic planning and to meet the growing demand for broadband access, particularly because official estimates suggest that data traffic will double every year until 2013."
"The objectives set in the Digital Agenda in the form of broadband cover for all European citizens by 2013, and high-speed cover of 30 Mbps or more (up to 100 Mbps for half of European households) by 2020, must be regarded as the minimum, and the ambition should be for Europe to have the best capacity and the highest broadband connection speeds in the world."
"This is connected with the idea that securing a wireless broadband connection is essential in order for all citizens to have access to new and innovative services."
"I fully agree with the deadline proposed by the Commission as regards making the 800 MHz band available for electronic communications services by 1 January 2013."
"Any exemptions or exceptions should be granted only for technical reasons, but specific public safety and defence needs must be taken into account."
"The other bands should be released by 1 January 2012, as stipulated in the Commission proposal."
"In my opinion, we should push for the allocation of more frequencies to mobile services, with a minimum target of 1 200 MHz."
"It is essential to introduce sensible rules that will make it possible to release further spectrum bands in the future."
"I also consider it appropriate to deal with further thorny questions, including, above all, the costs for releasing bands."
"We need to allocate radio spectrum more efficiently in the EU to ensure that we do not remain behind other developed countries progressing towards the digital society."
"The points in this report are also totally consistent with the EU's Digital Agenda."
"Both consumers and businesses in the EU are increasingly using broadband Internet and mobile Internet via their smartphones or tablets, which requires the provision of fast connections."
"This requires the 800 MHz band to be freed up as soon as possible for broadband mobile Internet services and even the band below 790 MHz, if it transpires that such a measure is required to cope with the increase in data traffic."
"The measures advocated in the first radio spectrum policy programme are vital for reducing the digital divide and offering rapid, reliable telecommunications services in rural and isolated areas with a view to revitalising them."
"Last but not least, these measures support innovation and the wider use of new technologies, which is an absolute must for the European economy's competitiveness, as was also emphasised in the Single Market Act."
"I voted for Mr Hökmark's draft report, which supports freeing up the 800 MHz band for mobile services between now and January 2013 and sets some very ambitious objectives such as freeing up 1 200 MHz for mobile data traffic by 2015."
"The rapporteur also insists on spectrum use efficiency, greater flexibility in the promotion of innovation and on investment, as well as the need to improve the inventory of current and future spectrum usage."
"Given the importance of the European telecommunications industry and information technologies for higher productivity and competitiveness in our market, I am voting for the radio spectrum policy programme."
"I believe in the ability of this programme to create the conditions necessary for successful competition with the new technology markets of China and the US, as well as maintaining European leadership in the telecommunications industry."
"I voted in favour of this report, which will enable the exponential demand for access to high frequency-consuming mobile Internet to be met in the short term, in particular, through the allocation of the entire 800 MHz band, freed up by the changeover to digital television in our various countries, to electronic communications services."
"In the medium to long term, our aim must be to improve the use of spectrum across the board, by recognising its social, cultural and economic value."
"At the same time, we are promoting innovative technologies (femtocells, cognitive technologies) in order to respond qualitatively to the demand for use of frequencies."
"This will contribute to the objectives that the Union has set itself, including that of bridging the digital divide, so as to ensure that all Europeans have broadband access by 2015."
"in writing. - I voted to reject Amendment 20, second part; Amendment 69, second part, as this had been recommended by both S&D voices on the Culture Committee, on which I sit as a substitute member."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of the radio spectrum report today."
"It will ultimately create employment in this sector, aid the completion of the Digital Agenda and lend itself to achieving wireless frequency targets by 2013."
"In Romania, we have one of the fastest Internet speeds in Europe."
"By enhancing European broadband, this will increase our competitiveness."
"It is noteworthy that the International Telecommunications Union argues that capacity has to be opened up and preferably harmonised at a global level."
"We all use radio spectrum in our daily lives for listening to radio programmes, for using our mobile telephones, for remotely locking our cars and for using satellite navigation systems."
"This report will aim to coordinate the EU approach for the management of spectrum across the Union."
"It is important that Member States continue to engage in bilateral communications and negotiations with third countries in order to achieve their Union frequency targets."
"I voted in favour of this report as it presents a set of measures that make a significant contribution to universal access to less-favoured or remote areas, such as rural areas or islands."
"Access to the radio spectrum is essential to ensure that all European citizens, whether in rural or urban areas, have access to digital technologies and broadband, with the total turnover of this industry representing approximately EUR 200 billion."
"Therefore, given the value of the radio spectrum, it is imperative to set out the EU's priorities for its allocation and use."
"The Digital Agenda, the digital economy and this, the first policy programme for five years, are therefore aimed at stimulating our economy and realising the Internal Market in all its aspects."
"It is crucial for the European telecommunications industry to regain its global leadership and create an impetus for greater productivity, cohesion, competitiveness and access to a single market."
"I would therefore like to congratulate the rapporteur on the result that has just been achieved due to an effort at finding a compromise between all the groups in an ambitious and encouraging report."
"This report is on a proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the first radio spectrum policy programme."
"As the EU is the largest global economy, it needs to monitor all its modernisation and technological innovation processes: otherwise, it runs the risk of being overtaken by emerging economies such as China and South Korea."
"The latter is an example of this development, based on digital communications, as its speed of traffic and the respective broadband coverage make it the world leader."
"The objectives set out in the Digital Agenda, taking account of the constant downgrading in the speed and volume of data traffic, which is expected to double each year up to 2014, should be seen as minimal or reassessed if the EU is to dethrone South Korea in this area."
"Given that the Internet is the main instrument for creating better conditions and development and knowledge for citizens in cultural terms, particularly through the broadcasting of audiovisual content, I welcome the adoption of this report and hope that the EU will play a leading role in the radio spectrum and in the creation of development and innovation software."
"We recognise the need to plan and organise the radio spectrum."
"This should be done on the basis of cooperation between the Member States, mindful of the fact that the spectrum is a public good, which is important in outlining and improving a range of services for the public, including in areas of public services."
"We do not agree with planning the radio spectrum based on the Commission imposing guidelines, with the aim of making the spectrum a fulcrum for 'the goals and key actions outlined in the EU2020 strategy and the Digital Agenda', nor do we agree with the view of this as one of the '50 priority actions of the Single Market Act'."
"These are EU strategies and policies which have contributed to the current crisis that we are experiencing, and persisting with them will inevitably exacerbate this crisis."
"Although it mentions that the radio spectrum is 'a key public resource for essential sectors and services', the report points the way towards the 'possibility to trade spectrum rights' and invites the Commission to adopt measures 'to ensure that Member States allow trading within the Union of spectrum usage rights'; once again, we do not agree with these guidelines and we would distance ourselves from them."
"We agree with the need to plan and organise the radio spectrum on the basis of the necessary cooperation between Member States, as it is a public good, which is important in improving services, particularly public services."
"We do not agree with the imposition of guidelines by the Commission with the aim of making the spectrum a fulcrum of 'the goals and key actions outlined in the EU2020 strategy and the Digital Agenda and [...] included among the 50 priority actions of the Single Market Act'."
"We believe that these strategies are EU policies that have contributed to capitalism's current state of systemic crisis."
"While mentioning that the radio spectrum is 'a key public resource for essential sectors and services', the report points the way towards the 'possibility to trade spectrum rights' and invites the Commission to adopt measures 'to ensure that Member States allow trading within the Union of spectrum usage rights'."
"We still do not know about these proposals, and thus far, we have not voted in favour of this report."
"in writing. - The European Union is the world's biggest economy."
"The need for one single internal market is crucial for Europe to take leadership in the global economy, with a focus on the service sector and the knowledge economy."
"The Digital Agenda and the digital economy can serve as a spearhead for making the internal market a reality for all parts of our economy."
"This requires an ability to take the lead on broadband and use of the Internet."
"It is crucial for the European telecom industry to regain global leadership, but also in order to take the lead in the development of information technologies as such and in the emergence of new services and applications."
"Even more importantly, it is also crucial in order to create a momentum for higher productivity, cohesion, competitiveness, and access to one single market for the European industry as a whole."
"We must aim to make Europe the best and make what is best for Europe: opening up new services and increased mobile traffic, laying the ground for new opportunities for culture and content, broadcasters and public services in the framework of broadband and, at the same time, securing the same opportunities for broadcasting as of today."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this report for the reason that a renewed economic and social approach with regard to the management, allocation and utilisation of the spectrum should be adopted."
"Particular focus should be directed towards the formulation of regulation which ensures greater spectrum efficiency, better frequency planning and safeguards against anti-competitive behaviour and the taking of anti-social measures with regards to the usage of the spectrum."
"As highlighted in the Single Market Act, the establishment of a radio spectrum programme is key for the enhancement of the digital society and the development of technology."
"I believe that the Commission should take a holistic approach towards the proper coordination of the management of the spectrum across the EU in view of the fact that this public good is a scarce and finite resource and is crucial to the furtherance of consumers, citizens and businesses within the single market."
"The modern information society and the scarcity of frequency bands make strategic planning and harmonisation of the use of the spectrum essential."
"Of course, this relates to mobile and wireless broadband communications, radio and television broadcasting and also radio communications at concerts or in theatres."
"In addition to the issue of the frequencies, this concerns cultural diversity and also involves taking into consideration which technical options are and are not available and affordable."
"Affordability is a concern, for example, for cultural organisations without a great deal of money which do not always have the funding to buy new equipment."
"The goals of introducing complete broadband coverage of the EU by 2013 and universal high-speed Internet access by 2020 are praiseworthy, but perhaps not entirely realistic."
"In addition, the proposal gives no consideration to the specific problems in border areas where greater coordination is needed."
"By approving the Hökmark report, Parliament is opting for innovation: the broadband and mobile telephony sector is not only of great interest to Europeans, but it makes it possible to develop new prospects in terms of research and development, areas in which the European Union can and must aspire to play a leading role."
"In this respect, it is important to ensure that the first European radio spectrum policy programme is in line with the objectives already outlined in the EU 2020 strategy and the Digital Agenda and comes within the priority actions of the Single Market Act."
"The EU must endeavour to overcome the digital divide that results in huge disparities within Europe - between urban and rural areas in particular - so as to ensure all citizens have equal access to services, especially those involving new technologies."
"I therefore welcome the ambitious targets proposed, to provide broadband access throughout Europe by 2020, with particular emphasis on wireless networks."
"I welcomed this document because Europe needs to set free more spectrum for wireless broadband."
"This can and must be done with respect for present broadcasting, ensuring the same opportunities for broadcasters as they have today, and compensating for eventual migration costs where necessary."
"Broadcasting and culture must be a natural part of the development of wireless services."
"Today, Europe is lagging behind, while the US and China are freeing up large parts of the spectrum in order to allow for the rapid development of new services and high speed mobile Internet."
"We must aim to do what is best for Europe: free up the spectrum for new services and increased mobile traffic, open up new opportunities for culture and content, broadcasters and public services in the framework of broadband and, at the same time, secure the same opportunities for broadcasters as they enjoy today."
"Wireless broadband is essential for ensuring that new and innovative services are available to all citizens."
"It seems obvious that this objective cannot be achieved through the use of optical fibre, the installation of which requires considerable investment, but through the use of a mix of wireless technologies available to extend the coverage of broadband (terrestrial radio, cable, fibre or satellite systems) to cover the whole territory of the Community, rural and peripheral areas included, enabling the market to choose the most efficient technology from the point of view of cost for operators and citizens."
"Today, telecommunications are as important as ordinary communications, both for people and companies."
"Furthermore, that is true in both rural and urban areas."
"The wireless Internet is a requirement for receiving fast broadband connections for all Europeans."
"This requires separately allocated radio spectrum in order to guarantee troublefree connections."
"It is good that new radio spectrum is to be made available as the Member States are switching from analogue to digital television."
"It should now be taken advantage of."
"Europe needs the greatest broadband capacity and the fastest speeds to keep up with rising economic powers, like China and India, in the modern economy."
"Let us work to ensure that the next generation's Googles and Facebooks originate in Europe."
"I supported the report on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the first radio spectrum policy programme."
"I believe that a common radio frequency spectrum policy will provide European Union Member States with new possibilities for developing information and communications technology industries."
"For their part, entrepreneurs will have the opportunity to offer new quality services, which will stimulate the development of the common European economy."
"Nevertheless, in making changes to frequency spectrum policy, we must also bear in mind international agreements on the freeing up of different frequencies at an international level."
"Countries that border the European Union's eastern neighbours will have difficulty freeing up frequencies if the neighbouring countries do not do likewise."
"This situation must be borne in mind, and we must anticipate that the freeing up of frequencies will only be possible when countries such as Russia and Belarus also do so."
"Member States must not be placed in the forefront of the European Union's ambitions without regard to the facts on the ground."
"I was responsible for the opinion on the radio spectrum policy programme in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, and I am very pleased with the text that has now been voted on."
"I have been strongly advocating a forward looking and ambitious spectrum policy that would promote new innovations and global competitiveness."
"This is essential while we are searching for new channels for economic growth in Europe."
"Wireless Internet services, and the mobile sector in particular, desperately need new spectrum, because in recent years, there has been a dramatic growth in the sale and use of equipment using a wireless network for smart phones and other such devices."
"The lack of spectrum must not be allowed to hinder innovation while we are developing new technology and services."
"Radio spectrum is a scarce natural resource and a public good, of which we also have to try to make far more effective use."
"The main aims of the radio spectrum policy programme are broadband access for the entire EU by 2013 and fast Internet connections by 2020."
"In addition to considerations about the 'digital dividend' to be shared among Internet services (that is to say, the 800 MHz band), we have to look to the future and survey the opportunities afforded by the next potential radio bands, such as the 700 MHz band."
"The best capacity and the fastest speed would offer the best basis for competition and innovation."
"The growing need in Asia and the United States of America has already been taken into account."
"It is therefore especially important that we in the EU understand the importance of setting sufficiently ambitious targets in order to remain competitive in this sector."
"One of the strategy's major lines of action aims to guarantee Internet access throughout Europe by 2013 and high-speed broadband coverage of at least 30 Mbps by 2020."
"Many relatively isolated rural and island areas depend on wireless connections from mobile Internet for access to high-speed broadband."
"If they are to enjoy uninterrupted connection, they must have radio frequencies dedicated entirely to them."
"Frequency allocation comes under national jurisdiction but the regulations governing the sharing of the spectrum between users and operators is under the control of the European Union."
"Universal access to high-speed access is largely dependent on this sharing of frequencies."
"I voted for the report on radio spectrum policy as it lays the foundations for universal coverage for mobile Internet."
"On 1 January 2013, the 800 MHz frequency will be used for mobile Internet, and will provide wireless users with high quality access and thus reduce the digital divide."
"This project goes even further still, by providing a new frequency band in the 1.5 to 2.3 GHz range by 2015."
"in writing. - I voted for this report."
"Radio frequencies serve the public interest in a wide range of areas in the Member States."
"In that connection, due account has to be taken of a host of specific national and regional characteristics."
"It is doubtful whether the EU can reconcile these matters of public interest and these characteristics as well and as efficiently as its Member States."
"For that reason (and in the light of the allocation of competences laid down in Article 9(1) of the Framework Directive), I oppose the establishment of an overarching spectrum planning and management system at European level."
"In this day and age, when new technologies have an increasingly important role, it is vital that all European citizens have the same conditions of access to digital technologies and broadband, regardless of whether they live in rural or urban areas."
"Thus, the Digital Agenda, the digital economy and this, the first policy programme for five years, which have just been adopted, are vital for the development of the Internal Market."
"The aim is for the European telecommunications industry to regain its global leadership and increase productivity, cohesion, competitiveness and access to a single market."
"The European Union has the largest economy in the world and yet it is lagging behind other international players in digital strategy and digital economy."
"Europe must take initiatives on broadband and Internet use in order to become a leader in the development of this area."
"Wireless broadband is essential if we are to ensure that all citizens have access to new, innovative services."
"We must bridge the digital divide and ensure that all European citizens are connected to high-speed broadband by 2020."
"Mobile broadband alongside, amongst other things, smartphones, PC tablets and smart keys, plays an increasingly important role in service supply and innovation in other areas, such as healthcare, education, culture and public administration."
"We must also ensure that new technologies and equipment for consumption are accessible."
"As far as the radio spectrum is concerned, our policy must have realistic yet ambitious objectives so that European companies are able to compete in the world market on a sounder footing."
"in writing. - The rapporteur, Gunnar Hökmark, believes that it is crucial to defend the dates as set out by the Commission (for example, the 800 MHz band should be available for electronic communication services by 1 Jan 2013)."
"Any exceptions or derogations should only be given for purely technical reasons while specific needs for security and defence must be taken into account."
"Bands already designated by the Commission should be freed up by 1 January 2012, according to the Commission's proposal."
"The Union has to work to get more frequencies allocated for mobile services, with a target of a minimum amount of 1 200 MHz."
"It is necessary to get the right principles in place that can enable additional spectrum releases in the future."
"I support the rapporteur and therefore voted 'in favour'."
"The economic recovery is based, among other things, on the utilisation of new technologies and the digital economy."
"Although the EU has set ambitious targets in its emblematic initiative entitled 'Digital Agenda', such as broadband cover for all EU citizens by 2013, with speeds of 30 Mbps or more by 2020, it is still lagging behind the USA and Japan in terms of competitiveness."
"Therefore, releasing large sections of the radio spectrum to allow for the fast development of new services and high Internet speeds, via mobile connections offering citizens high capacities, is a first practical step."
"It is a technical, but necessary, parameter if we are to create a clear trend towards greater productivity, cohesion, competitiveness and access to a single market for European industry as a whole, and that is why I voted for this particular report."
"This report concerns the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the first radio spectrum policy programme."
"This programme is a significant step in ensuring the efficient and optimal use of this finite resource."
"Spectrum policy has a prominent place in the Digital Agenda for Europe and is crucial for the realisation of the policy objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth."
"This programme is aimed not only at creating a competitive and vibrant European industry for the provision of broadband services and equipment, but also at establishing an environment that is conducive to the development of pan-European services."
"Mobile broadband is playing an increasingly important role in the delivery and innovation of services in other fields such as healthcare, education, culture and public administration."
"The harmonisation of frequencies will lower the costs of deploying mobile networks and the cost of mobile devices for consumers, and boost competition and consumer choice."
"Furthermore, it will reduce harmful cross-border interference and disturbance."
"I voted in favour of the establishment of the radio spectrum policy programme for all of these reasons."
"In the context of the knowledge economy, communications networks can boost the development of the Internal Market."
"To this end, broadband coverage for the whole EU, including the outermost regions, will make a clear contribution to establishing the EU as an integrated area for information sharing, furthering its claim to be a cutting-edge digital economy."
"I therefore voted in favour of this report."
"We are told - and quite rightly - that radio spectrum is a scarce resource. I should like to point out that it is also a shared resource, that is to say, a resource over which no one can claim exclusive ownership or an 'entitlement'."
"If it is both a shared resource and a scarce resource, we need to understand how it is utilised today; in other words, we must carry out an in-depth study of all the stakeholders in the spectrum, including the civil security and military services."
"The way in which it is used today is far from optimal."
"We should encourage the use of technologies that allow different services to cohabit."
"Let us not forget either that not all uses are necessarily commercial in nature and therefore do not necessarily yield a profit - I am thinking of the use of the spectrum for cultural or public service purposes, for instance."
"This is a very relevant issue for Lithuania."
"We have the densest network of public Internet access points - my country has a population of 3.2 million, 2.1 million of whom use the Internet."
"We also have one of the highest mobile penetration rates."
"There is no doubt that these are positive changes."
"The connection with Europe could potentially help convince international companies to establish shops and invest in Lithuania."
"Other possible advantages include long distance medical diagnosis, smart energy grids and greater political accountability at local level."
"However, let us not get carried away, let us get our priorities right."
"On the basis of this report, the main objective of the radio spectrum policy programme is broadband coverage by 2013 for all citizens of Europe, and high speed Internet by 2020."
"But what about the million Europeans who live at risk of poverty? Twenty per cent of Lithuanians live in poverty."
"This is too high a figure for our nation."
"In my country and throughout Europe, there are families who struggle to feed and educate their children and do not even consider having a computer, never mind high speed broadband."
"The promotion of the EU radio spectrum should not overshadow the needs of the poorest people in Europe."
"in writing. - I backed the Commission's radio spectrum policy programme (RSPP) because I believe that all EU citizens should have access to a faster broadband connection by 2020."
"The RSPP will ensure that the digital divide is reduced by introducing measures to bring faster web access to all citizens and businesses."
"This will be especially beneficial to those living in rural or remote parts of the EU that currently have little or no Internet connection."
"This improved network will also contribute to making Europe's digital economy more competitive, in the hope of developing an innovative and creative environment that can foster future advances in digital technology."
"Transmission frequencies are a national asset."
"European legislation must therefore respect Member State sovereignty when looking for a common European interest in the use of these frequencies."
"On the other hand, the interests of Slovakia are in harmony with those of other Member States here."
"Citizens and businesses will both profit from the use of the bands released for high quality and rapid data transmission."
"European coordination is important here, because Internet technologies are not restricted by borders, and their benefits increase with the number of users."
"The aim of this proposal was to make a start on solving the issue of released frequencies as soon as possible, in order to give Europe an advantage over the other strong economies."
"This will bring new jobs, create new services and attract new investment to Europe."
"I voted in favour of the report."
"Following the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament's powers have been strengthened and it is now colegislator in almost all areas under the ordinary legislative procedure."
"As a result, it is the focus of attention of an even larger number of varied lobbyists."
"In the light of these developments, and against this constitutional background, and in keeping with their commitment to transparency, Parliament and the Commission have agreed to establish and maintain a common register in order to keep a list of the names of and exercise scrutiny over the organisations and individuals who take part in the drafting and implementation of EU policies."
"The amendments mentioned require the European Parliament's Rules of Procedure to be amended accordingly, which will be done with this report."
"There has been much discussion in recent weeks about the role of lobbyists within the European Parliament."
"Ever since four MEPs were accused of having accepted money from 'bogus' lobbyists in return for tabling amendments, the institution has been seeking to clarify and reform the rules governing the activity of lobbyists in Parliament."
"A kind of permanent suspicion has long surrounded MEPs' relationships with interest representatives, hence the creation of a first register of lobbyists in 1996."
"Today, this register, in which lobbyists will have to register themselves, is being reformed."
"The 'voluntary' registration process is actually mandatory, as only registered lobbyists will be granted access to Parliament."
"I also welcome the adoption of the 'legislative footprint': the idea of publishing the names of the people one has met when drafting reports is, to my mind, a perfectly normal transparency measure."
"It is regrettable, however, that the Council, unlike the Commission, has not joined in the initiative."
"I voted in favour of this report because it is necessary to amend Parliament's Rules of Procedure following the establishment by the European Parliament and the Commission of a common transparency register."
"I would like to underline that following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament's powers have been strengthened and it is now colegislator in almost all areas under the ordinary legislative procedure."
"As a result, it is the focus of attention of an even larger number of lobbyists, who, moreover, play a key role in the open, pluralist dialogue, and act as an important source of information for Members in the context of the performance of their duties."
"In the light of these developments, and in keeping with their commitment to transparency, Parliament and the Commission have agreed to establish and maintain a common register in order to keep a list of the names of, and exercise scrutiny over, the organisations and individuals who take part in the drafting and implementation of EU policies."
"This register must be kept in a manner consistent with the right of Members to perform their parliamentary duties without restriction and must not be used as a pretext to deny their voters access to Parliament's premises."
"I voted in favour because I believe all measures aimed at fostering and increasing the transparency of Parliament's work are to be welcomed."
"Following the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament's powers have been strengthened and it is now colegislator in many areas under the ordinary legislative procedure."
"As a result, Parliament's work has become the focus of attention of a growing number of lobbyists, who act as an important source of information for Members."
"I therefore welcome the proposal to establish and maintain a common register in order to exercise scrutiny over the organisations and individuals who take part in the drafting and implementation of EU policies."
"The submitted change to the Rules of Procedure comes in response to the corruption revealed in recent months, with three MEPs accepting a corrupt proposal from investigative journalists."
"It is impossible to accept that MEPs will not be subject to public scrutiny regarding the interests they defend in their role, or the pressure they are subject to or who is putting them under pressure."
"I therefore very much welcome the introduction of the common register of lobbyists and lobbying organisations."
"The European Commission has already introduced such a register, and the European Parliament is therefore only extending its application to MEPs, officials and other staff of the European Parliament."
"The register will include information on contacts between these people and lobbyists, and will be publicly accessible."
"A similar system already operates in the US Congress, and experience there shows that it is a sensible anti-corruption measure."
"I firmly believe that the expansion of the register will also prove an inspiration for the Parliament of the Czech Republic."
"The introduction of a register in the Czech Republic would make a decisive contribution to the development of Czech politics."
"Creating a common transparency register is certainly an important step forward, much awaited by European citizens."
"EU institutions, whether elected or not, make decisions which affect citizens' everyday lives."
"In a democratic system, which the EU aspires to, it is completely natural for there to be a high level of transparency in the decision-making process."
"This common transparency register also simplifies matters for lobbyists as this will provide a single means of registration instead of two, which is currently the case."
"On the other hand, this register will not, admittedly, be an adequate instrument for resolving the problem of corruption."
"However, I do not believe that the register's primary aim is solely to combat corruption as the instances of corruption have, however, been very few and far between."
"in writing. - UKIP MEPs abstained on this vote, not because we do not want transparency, but because these proposals are inadequate, and to vote in favour would have been to endorse inadequate provisions."
"I support this decision because it makes a significant contribution towards strengthening transparency by approving the conclusion of an agreement between Parliament and the Commission on the establishment of a common transparency register."
"In a representative democracy, it is important that Union institutions be able to establish and maintain open, transparent and regular dialogue with the public, their representative associations and civil society."
"Following the increase in Parliament's powers under the Treaty of Lisbon, it has become essential, in the interests of transparency, to establish a common register between Parliament and the Commission for the registration and monitoring of organisations and individuals participating in the development and implementation of EU policy."
"It is therefore necessary to modify Parliament's Rules of Procedure in order to institute the mandatory registration of any lobbyists in contact with Members of Parliament, the European institutions and their staff."
"This information should be accessible to the general public."
"I voted in favour of this report proposing that the register of interest groups should cover all the different European institutions."
"To date, more than 1 700 organisations have been accredited as interest groups in the European Parliament, and 3 900 in the Commission."
"If you want to be able to make valid comments on a subject of a technical nature, you normally seek information from those people who are most knowledgeable about these issues."
"It has always been thus and will continue to be so in the future."
"Lobbies play a useful and essential role in legislative work, providing that there is transparency."
"In order to achieve this, the report adopted establishes new rules and creates a 'transparency register' which is common to both the Commission and Parliament."
"Citizens will find a comprehensive compilation of information about the different contact people in the EU institutions."
"This 'one-stop shop' system will make it easier to register representatives of special interests, whether from commercial or non-commercial organisations."
"Parliament also particularly wants all meetings between MEPs and interest groups on a particular issue to be mentioned at the end of the reports."
"I regret that registration is not mandatory, but as the saying goes: 'Chi va piano va sano'."
"I voted in favour of the report on the amendment to Parliament's Rules of Procedure following the establishment of a common transparency register because the principle of transparency should govern all those involved in decision making and in implementing EU policy."
"The common transparency register following the conclusion of an interinstitutional agreement on transparency between Parliament and the Commission entails the amendment of the Rules of Procedure so as to incorporate the new situation, and so that it can be workable in Parliament's main legal instrument."
"Having voted in favour of the conclusion of this agreement, I would also like to give my support to the procedural changes."
"Transparency is a right for citizens, and it helps to maintain the credibility of the European institutions: Parliament, the Commission and the Council."
"This report, which has been drawn up by Mr Casini, is on the need to amend Parliament's Rules of Procedure following the establishment of a common transparency register between Parliament and the Commission."
"Following the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament is a colegislator in almost all areas."
"Thus, in conjunction with the Commission, it has decided to establish a common register to list and monitor the individuals and organisations that have any kind of influence over the preparation and/or implementation of EU policy."
"Indeed, transparency is vital to the functioning of the European institutions and it has often been seen as lacking."
"The European public demands a high level of transparency from its representatives, not only in theory, but in practice, above all."
"The EU must set an example in terms of the transparency of its institutions, so I welcome the amendments proposed by the rapporteur to modify Parliament's Rules of Procedure in line with the decision made by the Conference of Presidents at its 18 November 2010 meeting."
"The amendment being proposed to Parliament's Rules of Procedure is aimed at establishing and maintaining a common register for the registration and monitoring of organisations and individuals who participate in any way in the drafting and implementation of EU policy."
"The existing system, on which the proposal is based, was created and launched by Parliament in 1996."
"At the time, it was the first EU institution to do this, with the Commission subsequently adopting one with similar objectives in 2008."
"It will be modified in a process that cannot be dissociated from recent problems involving alleged lobbying, which have affected Parliament."
"The arguments put forward this time are, however, different, focusing on the new powers of Parliament following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"The transparency of the institutions, their functioning and the decisions made by their representatives should be an intrinsic part of democracy."
"Measures helping to increase this transparency are therefore welcome and necessary."
"It is not, however, clear that this will be the result of all the changes proposed here."
"Although we support some of the measures proposed, we will follow their implementation with a view to evaluating their future results."
"This concerns the establishment and maintenance of a common register for the registration and monitoring of organisations and individuals participating in the drafting and implementation of EU policy."
"Based on existing systems which were created and launched by Parliament in 1996 and by the Commission in 2008, it seeks to address certain recent problems, although the argument for it in the report is the new powers entrusted to the European Parliament following the Treaty of Lisbon's entry into force."
"Some aspects of it are positive, but we have serious doubts about other amendments."
"We support greater transparency, but it is not always clear that this is the aim of all the adopted amendments."
"We will see how it is implemented in the future."
"in writing. - Following the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty, Parliament's powers have been strengthened and it is now colegislator in almost all areas under the ordinary legislative procedure."
"As a result, it is the focus of attention of an even larger number of lobbyists, who, moreover, play a key role in the open, pluralist dialogue on which a democratic system is based, and act as an important source of information for Members in the context of the performance of their duties."
"In the light of these developments, against this constitutional background, and in keeping with their commitment to transparency, Parliament and the Commission have agreed to establish and maintain a joint register in order to keep a list of the names of, and exercise scrutiny over, the organisations and individuals who take part in the drafting and implementation of EU policies."
"One of the important corrective measures necessary is to improve the rules on lobbying firms' reporting of expenditure incurred for lobbying activities."
"The current legislation allows lobbyists to report much less than is actually incurred."
"Equally important is transparency with regard to the financial resources from which a lobbying and consulting company draws its revenue."
"I would like to congratulate Mr Casini on the excellent work he has done."
"I will vote in favour of his proposal to create a register of lobbyists so as to increase transparency in the European institutions."
"I hope, however, that representatives of the regions, for instance, will be given due recognition."
"Given the fact that pressure groups, whether they represent private or public interests, play an undeniable role in European affairs, there must be greater transparency regarding the relations they have with our institution."
"In my view, it should be mandatory for them to be listed on the transparency register."
"I support, in particular, the idea of a 'legislative fingerprint', which enables those lobbyists met by parliamentarians during the legislative process to be registered."
"It is indeed vital that we do all we can to regain or strengthen the confidence of the citizens in the functioning of the European institutions, and that is the direction in which this register quite rightly takes us."
"I endorsed this document because the Treaty on European Union and, in particular, Article 11(1) and (2) thereof, provides a framework for, and seeks to foster relations between, the European institutions and European political leaders, on the one hand, and civil society, EU citizens and representative associations, on the other: 1."
"The institutions shall, by appropriate means, give citizens and representative associations the opportunity to make known and publicly exchange their views in all areas of Union action."
"2."
"The institutions shall maintain an open, transparent and regular dialogue with representative associations and civil society."
"Following the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament's powers have been strengthened and it is now colegislator in almost all areas under the ordinary legislative procedure."
"As a result, it is the focus of attention of an even larger number of lobbyists, who, moreover, play a key role in the open, pluralist dialogue on which a democratic system is based and act as an important source of information for Members in the context of the performance of their duties In the light of these developments, and against this constitutional background, Parliament and the Commission have agreed to establish and maintain a common register in order to keep a list of the names of, and exercise scrutiny over, the organisations and individuals who take part in the drafting and implementation of EU policies."
"It is noted that the register must be kept in a manner consistent with the right of Members to perform their parliamentary duties without restriction and must not be used as a pretext to deny their voters access to Parliament's premises."
"In addition, it will not encroach upon the powers or prerogatives of the parties concerned and will have no bearing on their powers to organise their own activities."
"in writing. - I welcome this report."
"Following the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty, Parliament's powers have been strengthened and it is now colegislator in almost all areas under the ordinary legislative procedure."
"As a result, it is the focus of attention of an even larger number of lobbyists, who, moreover, play a key role in the open, pluralist dialogue on which a democratic system is based and act as an important source of information for Members in the context of the performance of their duties."
"In the light of these developments, and against this constitutional background, and in keeping with their commitment to transparency, Parliament and the Commission have agreed to establish and maintain a joint register in order to keep a list of the names of, and exercise scrutiny over, the organisations and individuals who take part in the drafting and implementation of EU policies."
"Parliament and the Commission are setting a good example by establishing a common transparency register to provide accreditation for lobbyists and other interest groups."
"It is just as important that the Council join this initiative."
"The requirement for Members to list their meetings with lobbyists on legislative matters annexed to their reports is also an important step towards greater transparency, which is needed in this type of relationship in order to avoid the kind of situations that have arisen in the past."
"I did not vote for the Casini report on the establishment of a common transparency register."
"I consider that the establishment of such a register is a breach of the freedom that all politicians should enjoy."
"All parliamentarians take responsibility politically for their decisions and standpoints."
"They are sanctioned by the electorate."
"in writing. - The scope of the register covers all activities carried out with the objective of directly or indirectly influencing the policy formulation or implementation and decision-making processes of the European institutions."
"All organisations, irrespective of their legal status, engaged in activities falling under the scope of the register are expected to register."
"In the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, many across the party lines stressed the importance of the Council becoming part of the system."
"The vote by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs is an important step forward but our work on transparency continues."
"I support the report of Carlo Casini and voted 'in favour'."
"Not only the European Parliament but also the European Union as a whole is suffering from a huge credibility problem."
"Although Parliament has finally reached an agreement on the transparency register, no doubt bowing to the pressure of the recent lobbying scandal, this register will be powerless."
"It will be necessary to record not only all work undertaken for businesses or for international companies, but also all paid lobbying for interest groups, such as professional organisations and trade unions."
"Citizens have a right to transparency because it is their mandatory contributions which keep the statutory lobby groups in existence."
"Complete disclosure should include not only salaries, but also fees, invitations to dinner, etc. As these measures are a step in the right direction, I have voted for the report."
"Setting up a common transparency register and improving all the rules on transparency in the European Parliament are required to increase citizens' confidence in Parliament's activities and ensure the necessary transparency for these activities."
"I voted for both Casini reports and I look forward to the strongest possible proposals from the European Parliament's working group on the transparency and regulation of lobbying activities."
"The Treaty on European Union provides a framework for, and encourages relations between, the European institutions and European political leaders, on the one hand, and civil society, EU citizens and representative associations, on the other."
"Following the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament's powers have been strengthened and it is now colegislator in almost all areas under the ordinary legislative procedure."
"As a result, it is the focus for the attention of an even larger number of lobbyists, who, moreover, play a key role in the open, pluralist dialogue on which a democratic system is based and act as an important source of information for Members in the performance of their duties It is, however, essential to establish mechanisms for recording and monitoring."
"In view of this, I voted in favour of this report on the amendment to Parliament's Rules of Procedure following the establishment of a common register for the registration and monitoring of organisations and individuals who participate in any way in the drafting and implementation of EU policies."
"in writing. - I support this report on the conclusion of an interinstitutional agreement between Parliament and the Commission on a common transparency register."
"Any actors seeking to influence decision making and policy implementation at a European level are expected to join the common register, which will make both registration and access to information about lobbyists easier."
"Those who do not register shall be refused a long-term access pass to the European Parliament."
"This is but a first step forward towards transparent relations between European institutions and lobbyists."
"Registration should be made mandatory and the Council should also join this agreement as soon as possible."
"Following the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament has taken on the status of colegislator in almost all areas, thus making it the focus of much attention from lobbyists."
"In view of this, and in the interests of transparency, which should guide the dialogue between these stakeholders and Union institutions, Parliament and the Commission have agreed to establish a common register to list and monitor individuals and organisations involved in drafting and implementing EU policy."
"To this end, it is necessary to make amendments to the Rules of Procedure, and I voted in favour of these."
"We must fight for transparency within the European institutions and, in that respect, I welcome the agreement with the Commission which seeks to set up at last a common register of interest groups of the European institutions."
"I should just like to make one remark to say that I regret the Council's reluctance to sign up to this common register."
"Is it necessary to be backward-looking and keep on defending a lack of transparency rather than openness?"
"It is, however, the duty also of the representatives of the Member States to provide information and transparency in their dealings with European citizens."
"I also have a wish for the future."
"I think that it is essential to move gradually towards an American-style system, which has 65 years' experience behind it, and which is based on the publication of key documents by lobbying groups (for example, of all contracts for more than USD 10 000)."
"I would like to say a final word about the legislative fingerprint, which is a good idea in theory but not in practice."
"Not because it would undermine the principle of parliamentarians' independence, but rather because it would lead to endless discussions in parliamentary committees on the whys and wherefores of the choice and frequency of the meetings with one lobbyist rather than another."
"To conclude, what is important is to come up with an effective and robust system."
"We are still far from achieving that."
"It is useful to listen to the points of view of different stakeholders when the European legislator is drafting and adopting a piece of legislation."
"However, in order to quantify these influences, we must have mandatory listing of all lobbyists in a register that is common to all the institutions."
"The text that has just been adopted constitutes an interesting first step towards identifying the different types of lobbyists and the sums they use to try to influence the decisions to be made."
"It must develop further."
"The Council should also participate in the common register, which should be made mandatory and serve as a dynamic instrument in guaranteeing the transparency of the decision-making process."
"That is in the interests of European democracy."
"The Treaty on European Union seeks to recognise and foster relations between the institutions and European politicians, on the one hand, and civil society, EU citizens and representative associations, on the other."
"The institutions shall give citizens and representative associations the opportunity to make known and publicly exchange their views in all areas of Union action."
"In particular, the institutions shall maintain an open, transparent and regular dialogue with representative associations and civil society."
"The adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon has strengthened Parliament's powers and it is now colegislator in almost all areas under the ordinary legislative procedure."
"In the light of these developments, Parliament and the Commission have agreed to establish a common register in order to keep a list of and exercise scrutiny over the organisations and individuals who take part in the drafting and implementation of EU policies."
"In order to take account of changes to existing rights and obligations and the establishment of new rights and obligations for Members, the resolution adopted today advocates the need to amend Parliament's Rules of Procedure."
"We were initially opposed to the report since it applied the same rules to lobbyists as to public bodies, including the regions' representatives to the EU; following our requests, however, the report was amended."
"We think it is right to establish a code of conduct for those who have access to Parliament on behalf of private associations or companies, and we also believe it is right not to apply the same rules to churches, political parties, trade unions and public bodies."
"We have therefore voted in favour."
"The Casini report emphasises the importance of amending the European Parliament's Rules of Procedure following the establishment of a common transparency register."
"I voted in favour of this report, which confirms the importance attached to transparency by the European institutions, because I share the view that the establishment of this register will help in controlling all the organisations and persons involved in making and applying the EU policies."
"in writing. - I supported today's report calling for a joint register of lobbyists and interest groups to be set up."
"This is a first step towards greater transparency in both the European Parliament and Commission."
"A 'transparency register' will improve ease of access for citizens wishing to find specific information regarding which organisations and individuals have contact with both MEPs and Commission officials."
"The Parliament has made clear that registration for lobbyists who want to meet with MEPs will be mandatory from now on."
"I am encouraged by the Council's signal that it will also consider arrangements to put in place such a register and urge them to do so without delay."
"I voted in favour of Mr Casini's report."
"Transparency in the activities that involve the European institutions, even though it has recently ended up tarnished, is a prerequisite for legitimacy and a basic factor in the establishment of proper, open relations with representative associations."
"I therefore believe that creating a common register for Parliament and the Commission in order to bring together all information on the organisations and individuals who have contact with the institutions will not only streamline bureaucratic procedures by providing for a single registration, but will also be a clear improvement leading towards an increasingly open and transparent dialogue with said lobbyists."
"I voted in favour of this report."
"It is a first step towards providing more transparency in the institutions' work and ensuring compliance with the Union's public administration rules."
"The transparency register, as it will be called from now on, is not obligatory, but lobbying individuals or organisations will be forced to register if they want permission to gain access to the European Parliament."
"Registered entities will also have to declare their sources of income and interests, as well as legislative proposals submitted."
"This will increase transparency and provide more comprehensive information on individuals or organisations who contact Members of the European Parliament about certain issues or with certain proposals."
"I believe that we should continue talks with the Council, so that it joins the transparency register and this register becomes a common register for all three institutions."
"Between Parliament and the Commission, there are approximately 4 600 organisations accredited as interest groups."
"Following the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament's powers have been strengthened, making it colegislator in almost all areas under the ordinary legislative procedure."
"This has attracted the attention of an even larger number of representatives of interest groups."
"This report, which I voted for, follows the institutional agreement on the creation of a joint space for registering and exercising scrutiny over lobbyists and other interest groups in the Commission and Parliament."
"A common register between the various institutions will be created with the aim of contributing to greater transparency, and which will differentiate between interest groups representing civil society and public authorities."
"In the interests of transparency, the creation of a system for the compulsory declaration of all meetings between registered organisations and the Members responsible for related legislation is equally important, and should be recorded in an annex to the respective reports or recommendations."
"It is just as important that the Council join this register."
"in writing. - UKIP MEPs abstained on this vote, not because we do not want transparency, but because these proposals are inadequate, and to vote in favour would have been to endorse inadequate provisions."
"The establishment of a common register by Parliament and the Commission to bring together in a 'one-stop shop' all information on the actors in contact with the institutions is a step forward on the way to greater transparency."
"Transparency in the political institutions is, in my view, crucial for an open dialogue with civil society."
"In fact, ensuring that opinions and information can be made known and exchanged publicly in the various sectors in which the Union acts and, at the same time, guaranteeing that the organisations and individuals who play an active part in EU policy making and policy implementation are monitored, are important factors in the democratic lives of the institutions."
"I would, however, like to express some reservations."
"I do not agree with excluding a series of actors from the scope of the register, such as the social partners and local, regional and municipal authorities."
"Their exclusion is unjustified, because these actors have specific interests and play just as active a part in decision making as many other representative associations."
"I also think the information required needs to be specified more clearly so that it cannot give rise to different interpretations, as happens in the current situation."
"I voted in favour of this report because transparency of political institutions is a prerequisite for legitimacy."
"We must scrutinise how decisions are made, what the influences behind them are and, finally, how resources, i.e. taxpayer's money, are allocated."
"Therefore, rules for lobbying are ultimately a question of legitimacy."
"The European Parliament was the first European institution to address the phenomenon of an increasing number of interest groups at European level, and it is therefore necessary to examine the consequences of this evolution."
"Following the European Parliament elections, a new working group was formed between the Parliament and the Commission which was able to adopt in November 2010 a draft agreement on the establishment of a transparency register."
"According to the new draft, registration is not obligatory, but currently, only the representatives of registered interest groups are allowed access to the premises of the European Parliament."
"The common register ensures the widest participation of all categories of operators and makes it easier for non-commercial organisations to carry out their work."
"I believe that this common register is another step forward towards greater transparency in the European institutions, and will also increase citizens' faith in the work of the institutions."
"I voted in favour of this report as it is important to clarify matters at a time when the role of lobbies is still giving rise to much debate and, at times, conjecture among European citizens."
"We regret, however, that the registration of organisations has not been made compulsory, especially as it is a de facto obligation to register in order to receive a card to enter our premises."
"On the other hand, we have fought to ensure that the offices representing local, regional and municipal authorities in the European institutions are not affected by this measure, contrary to what was planned in the initial text."
"We consider these structures to be the direct product of democratically elected bodies."
"They represent the general interest, and should therefore be distinguished from lobbyists, who defend individual interests."
"Nevertheless, this register is an important step forward because, in many areas, the lack of transparency surrounding the role of lobbies can present a real democratic problem."
"This agreement is a first step, although undoubtedly an important one, towards greater transparency, by making the registering of all lobbyists who wish to enjoy permanent access to Parliament and the Commission de facto obligatory, including all information that identifies the legal structure and financial interests of the organisation in question."
"The existence of a register of organisations and employees involved in decision making and the implementation of EU policy thereby strengthens transparency in the dialogue between these representatives of civil society and Union institutions while, at the same time, establishing binding measures in the event of an infringement of the code of conduct in the annex to the agreement."
"I hope that a second step will soon be made towards the creation of more stringent standards that ensure consistency in the public administration of the EU and the strengthening of its institutional rules."
"I regret that the Council has not yet participated in the agreement and joined the transparency register, as this affects the likelihood of achieving the necessary level of transparency at all stages of the EU legislative process."
"I would like to remind you that the level of transparency of political institutions is increasingly linked to its legitimacy."
"in writing. - Transparency of political institutions is a prerequisite for legitimacy."
"It should be easy to scrutinise how decisions are made, what are the influences behind them and finally, how resources, i.e. taxpayers' money, are allocated."
"Therefore, rules for lobbying are ultimately a question of legitimacy."
"I supported this report which establishes a common register for lobbyists (transparency register) between the European Parliament and Commission."
"The scope of the register covers many activities carried out with the objective of directly or indirectly influencing the policy formulation or implementation and decision-making processes of the European institutions."
"All organisations, irrespective of their legal status, engaged in activities falling under the scope of the register are expected to register."
"This agreement with the European Commission provides only for voluntary registration, even though lobbyists not included in the joint register will no longer be able to obtain a long-term access badge to the European Parliament."
"The next step will be to extend the joint register to all the EU institutions and to convince the Commission and Council to make it mandatory."
"We need clear rules to prevent people and organisations from influencing EU decision making in a non-transparent manner."
"I welcome the adoption of the Casini report on the introduction of a transparency register common to both Parliament and the Commission."
"The introduction of a public register to which lobbies must sign up if they are to have access to these two institutions constitutes genuine democratic progress to the benefit of citizens."
"In this respect, the future obligation for rapporteurs to make public the names of the lobbies they have met is a further step in the direction of the full independence of the European Parliament, and will ensure that there is a balanced representation of the interests of all European citizens."
"I voted in favour of this report proposing that the list of interest groups should be common to all the different European institutions."
"To date, more than 1 700 organisations have been accredited as interest groups in the European Parliament, and 3 900 in the Commission."
"If you want to be able to make valid comments on a subject of a technical nature, you normally seek information from those people who are most knowledgeable about these issues."
"It has always been thus and will continue to be so in the future."
"Lobbies play a useful and essential role in legislative work, providing that there is transparency."
"In order to achieve this, the report adopted establishes new rules and creates a 'transparency register' which is common to both the Commission and Parliament."
"Citizens will find a comprehensive compilation of information about the different contact people in the EU institutions."
"This 'one-stop shop' system will make it easier to register representatives of special interests, whether from commercial or non-commercial organisations."
"Parliament also particularly wants all meetings between MEPs and interest groups on a particular issue to be mentioned at the end of the reports."
"I regret that registration is not mandatory, but as the saying goes: 'Chi va piano va sano'."
"I voted in favour of the report on the amendment to Parliament's Rules of Procedure following the establishment of a common transparency register because the principle of transparency should govern all those involved in decision making and in implementing EU policy."
"I believe, however, that this register should be mandatory and extended to all the European institutions."
"In 2006, the Commission proposed a 'one-stop shop' to register lobbyists of the Commission and Parliament."
"In a resolution adopted in the plenary of 8 May 2008, Parliament welcomed the proposal and called for an interinstitutional agreement on the establishment of a common register between Parliament, the Commission and the Council."
"Moreover, at that time, Parliament proposed negotiations on a common code of conduct for the lobbyists and discussion of the sanctions that should apply in the event of an infringement."
"Under this agreement, permanent access to the Parliament premises is allowed only to the registered interest representatives."
"Nevertheless, the common register seeks to ensure the widest participation of all categories of operators while respecting their different or specific duties."
"The scope of the register excludes social partners, churches, political parties and local, regional and municipal authorities, taking into account their particular characteristics."
"Such an agreement would benefit from being joined by the Council."
"I believe that Parliament and its Members should lead by example as regards the transparency of their activities and the clarity of their aims."
"I voted in favour."
"Transparency is the basis of democracy."
"The public has a right to it and it helps maintain the credibility of the European institutions: Parliament, the Commission and the Council."
"This report, drafted by Mr Casini, concerns the conclusion of an interinstitutional agreement between Parliament and the Commission on a common transparency register."
"I would like to highlight that Parliament was the first institution to analyse the phenomenon of pressure groups, having launched the register for lobbyists in 1996."
"In 2006, the Commission proposed the creation of a 'one-stop shop' register for lobbyists in the Commission and the European Parliament, through the 'European Transparency Initiative'."
"Indeed, transparency is essential to the functioning of the European institutions, which are often accused of a lack thereof."
"The European public demands a high level of transparency from its representatives, not only in theory, but most importantly in practice."
"As such, I welcome the adoption of the draft agreement on the creation of a 'transparency register', and I am certain that it will constitute a significant step forward in the European institutions' transparency and will contribute to consolidating the European project among the public."
"Let us begin with the assumption, as stated in the report, that the 'transparency of political institutions is a prerequisite for legitimacy."
"It should be easy to scrutinise how decisions are made, what are the influences behind them and finally, how resources [...] are allocated'."
"The institutions' transparency and the clarity of their representatives' actions should be an intrinsic element of real and genuine democracy."
"Unfortunately, we know that there is sometimes a great difference between the nice-sounding words that are said and what is done."
"Parliament was the first European institution to broach the subject of the increasing number of lobbies at European level, having launched the register for representatives of interest groups in 1996."
"The Commission later also began initiatives in this area, and a working group was established in 2008 between Parliament and the Commission."
"In 2009, the group approved a joint declaration and a proposal for a common code of conduct."
"In 2010, a new working group approved a draft agreement for the establishment of a 'transparency register' which ensures the widest possible participation of all categories of operator, while respecting their different or specific identities."
"It is important to monitor the practical results of this."
"The report states that the 'transparency of political institutions is a prerequisite for legitimacy."
"It should be easy to scrutinise how decisions are made, what are the influences behind them and finally, how resources [...] are allocated'."
"However, there is often a big gap between theory and reality, despite Parliament having been the first EU institution to deal with the phenomenon of the growing number of interest groups at European level and, in particular, with the consequences of this development for the legislative process."
"Following various reports and in-depth debates, Parliament launched its register for representatives of interest groups in 1996."
"In the meantime, the Commission also launched initiatives, creating a high-level joint working group in 2008 between Parliament and the Commission."
"In 2009, the group approved a joint declaration and a proposal for a common code of conduct."
"After the European elections, a new working group was established between Parliament and the Commission."
"In November 2010, the working group was able to approve a draft agreement for the establishment of a 'transparency register' which ensures the widest possible participation of all categories of operator, while respecting their different or specific identities."
"in writing. - Transparency of political institutions is a prerequisite for legitimacy."
"It should be easy to scrutinise how decisions are made, what the influences are behind them and how resources, i.e. taxpayer's money, are allocated."
"Therefore, rules for lobbying are ultimately a question of legitimacy."
"Parliament was the first European institution to address the phenomenon of an increasing number of interest groups at European level and, in particular, the consequences of this evolution for the legislative process."
"While registration is not obligatory, it can be considered as such 'de facto' because permanent access to Parliament's premises is granted only to registered representatives."
"However, it is desirable for the future to achieve a system of registration that is obligatory 'de jure'."
"The common register ensures the widest participation of all categories of operators while respecting their different or specific identities."
"The new name - transparency register - makes it easier for non-commercial organisations to join the register."
"This will be a step forward towards greater transparency in the European institutions, and I hope it will contribute to giving the European project greater legitimacy among Europe's citizens."
"It is a well-known fact that there are more than 15 000 lobbyists active in Brussels trying to influence the legislative texts that are adopted there, and that they intervene at all stages of the legislative process."
"Despite the fact that this activity is viewed in very negative terms in France, it is not entirely illegitimate for interest groups, whether commercial, social, trade unions, etc. to make their points of view and expertise known, especially to the less knowledgeable civil servants and elected representatives."
"It therefore makes sense for these lobbies and their representatives to be listed in a register, and that their principal sources of funding should also be mentioned in this register, particularly if they come from the European budget."
"Registration should be mandatory not only for these organisations, but also for all groups outside Parliament, including those which are meant to fulfil a role provided for by the Treaties (trade unions, churches, philosophical organisations, local authorities, etc.), including groups composed, in part or in whole, of Members of Parliament, such as the European Friends of Israel, because in that instance, they are acting as interest groups and not as parliamentarians."
"In that respect, the agreement we are voting on today does not go far enough in terms of transparency."
"Following recent events which have highlighted the potential abuses of lobbying, it has appeared all the more necessary to increase transparency regarding the work of interest groups at the European institutions."
"The merging of the lists of lobbyists registered at the Parliament and the Commission represents a first step towards compiling an exhaustive register of the lobbies active in Brussels and, subsequently, towards greater citizen access to democratic checks and balances in the decision-making process."
"I have, however, fought to prevent the offices representing local authorities at the European institutions from being affected by this measure."
"Indeed, I consider these structures to be the direct product of democratically-elected bodies (town, departmental, regional councils, etc.)."
"They represent the general interest, and should therefore be distinguished from lobbyists who defend individual interests."
"Furthermore, I hope that this register will develop to become mandatory one day, and include all lobbyists who are active at the European institutions."
"The notion of transparency is crucial to European Union policy and it must be extended to cover all interest groups that participate in its operation."
"The approval of a common transparency register, following a broad majority vote in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, is another step towards greater transparency in parliamentary activity."
"A common register between the European Parliament and the Commission that is public and accessible online will make it easier for citizens to check the various stakeholders with whom MEPs interact."
"However, the agreement still needs to be improved as registration by actors is still on a voluntary basis, although a pre-requisite for obtaining access to the institutions."
"The next objective will therefore be to make registration mandatory for all lobbyists."
"We also expect that, like the other European institutions, the Council will adhere to the indications of Parliament and the Commission and participate in the register."
"I welcomed this report because transparency of political institutions is a prerequisite for legitimacy."
"It should be easy to scrutinise how decisions are made, what the influences behind them are and, finally, how resources, i.e. taxpayer's money, are allocated."
"Therefore, rules for lobbying are ultimately a question of legitimacy."
"The result achieved corresponds to the objectives laid out by the Parliament in the most essential points."
"Firstly, although registration is not obligatory - which was the aim of Parliament - it can be considered obligatory de facto, because only registered interest group representatives are allowed permanent access to Parliament premises."
"Secondly, the common register ensures the widest participation of all categories of operators while respecting their different or specific identities."
"The new name - transparency register -makes it easier for non-commercial organisations to join the register."
"Thirdly, the new mechanism provides additional information such as the number of individuals involved in all the activities relating to the register, and the level of EU resources received by the registrant."
"It will also provide clarifications regarding the eligible activities falling under the scope of the register, and the processes by which complaints will be handled."
"I believe that it was essential to adopt the draft agreement on the establishment of a transparency register."
"The common register will be a step forward towards greater transparency in the European institutions, which hopefully will help give the European project greater legitimacy in the eyes of its citizens."
"More than 1 700 organisations have been accredited as interest groups at the European Parliament, and 3 900 at the Commission."
"These organisations have been listed to date in two different registers, one for each institution."
"In 2008, Parliament had called for these records to be merged so as to facilitate record-keeping."
"An institutional agreement was reached between Parliament and the Commission with the aim of setting up a common register."
"This agreement was awaiting validation and was put to the vote in the European legislative assembly."
"I voted in favour of this text because it will enable greater transparency in respect of the actions of interest groups."
"It is true that under this text, it is not mandatory to be listed on this register but Parliament will require such registration for any organisation that wishes to use its premises."
"The text also proposes introducing a 'legislative fingerprint' for lobbying, by recording in an annex to all legislative acts those interest groups that have played a role in drafting them."
"The common register is due to become available online in June."
"in writing. - Transparency of political institutions is a prerequisite for legitimacy."
"It should be easy to scrutinise how decisions are made, what are the influences behind them and finally, how resources, i.e. taxpayer's money, are allocated."
"Therefore, rules for lobbying are ultimately a question of legitimacy."
"The Parliament was the first European institution to address the phenomenon of an increasing number of interest groups at European level and, especially, the consequences of this evolution for the legislative process."
"After several reports and thorough discussions, the Parliament launched its register of interest representatives in 1996."
"The joint register will be a step forward towards greater transparency in the European institutions, which hopefully will contribute to greater legitimacy of the European project among its citizens."
"No pressure group representing commercial interests should obtain a permanent pass to the European institutions."
"Their access to the European Parliament must be strictly limited to meetings granted to them by parliamentarians and political groups."
"The proposed 'transparency register' is nothing other than administrative legitimisation."
"It serves to maintain the current situation."
"The lobbyists have a bright future ahead of them."
"I shall vote against this hypocritical report, which I condemn."
"It would be better to make these people declare their personal links with the media, as well as their parliamentary and administrative links to the European Parliament."
"Parliament and the Commission are setting a good example by establishing a common transparency register to provide accreditation for lobbyists and other interest groups."
"Moreover, the compulsory nature of the register for all lobbyists who want permanent access to Parliament and to the Commission is an important step in increasing the transparency of relations between those organisations and the European institutions."
"Once again, we regret that the Council has not signed up to these measures."
"A voluntary register is complete nonsense and will not result in increased transparency."
"In addition, the Council of Ministers is not yet involved, which means that we do not even have all the key legislative bodies on board."
"Even if the Council were to become involved, there would still be enough loopholes left."
"There are allegedly 1 350 expert groups working on official papers published by the Commission."
"However, the identity of the members of these advisory bodies, which meet behind closed doors, remains a closely guarded secret."
"The Commission is now paying more attention to the activities of former Commissioners in the period immediately after they have left Brussels."
"However, are there also controls in place in the other direction?"
"We only need to think of the latest move from the music industry association to the copyright department."
"As these measures are a step in the right direction, I have voted for the report."
"I fully support the decision we have made today on the conclusion of an interinstitutional agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission on a common transparency register."
"Parliament has kept a register of interest groups since 1996 and should be an example for other institutions in this regard."
"The European Commission did not create its register of lobbyists until 2008, and the Council of the European Union still does not have one."
"The decision taken in the European Parliament will combine the registers of lobbyists and interest groups currently kept separately by the two abovementioned institutions."
"The process will lead to greater transparency and will, above all, simplify access to information, which will be kept in one place."
"Creating a common register is useful for lobbyists too, as they only need to register once."
"The decision also excludes social partners, churches, political parties and local and regional governments from the transparency register."
"In addition, interest groups will be recorded in the explanatory memorandum to the report or recommendation if they have obtained a meeting with a Member about a legislative dossier."
"In my opinion, this decision is an important step in increasing transparency and I am waiting impatiently for the EU Council to join the common register."
"Institutions earn their credentials by operating in a transparent manner."
"This particular report, which I voted for, puts the question of accountability on a proper footing."
"Citizens must have easy and unimpeded access in the decision-making process to the influence and activity of interest representatives."
"It is a fact that, at European level, the European Parliament was the first institution to deal with the emergence of a large number of interest groups."
"It is also a fact that there is still a strong upward trend here, as a result of Parliament's constantly expanding legislative competences."
"Consequently, the common register is a first and important step in controlling and safeguarding transparent action by interest groups."
"The transparency of political institutions is a prerequisite for legitimacy, and it is an ethical imperative."
"Parliament was the first EU institution to tackle the phenomenon of the growing number of interest groups at European level and, in particular, with the consequences of this development for the legislative process."
"After several reports and thorough discussions, the Parliament launched its register for interest representatives in 1996."
"In 2006, the Commission issued a 'European Transparency Initiative' where it proposed a common 'one-stop shop' register for lobbyists in the Commission and Parliament."
"Parliament's answer to this Commission initiative was the report by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on the development of the framework for the activities of interest representatives in the European institutions."
"The resolution was adopted in plenary on 8 May 2008."
"Subsequently, in November 2010, the working group was able to adopt a draft agreement on the establishment of a transparency register, as Parliament had reached its main objectives."
"I believe that the common register is a step towards greater transparency in the European institutions, so I voted in favour of this report."
"The activity of interest representatives from a variety of areas in relation to Union institutions - in this instance, Parliament and the Commission - has undeniable advantages."
"It increases the range of relevant information for decision making and provides knowledge of legitimate interests which are worthy of consideration."
"However, it is essential to safeguard the transparency of the EU institutions' actions so as to ultimately ensure their legitimacy and the thorough consideration of their scope, without misuse of power."
"I therefore welcome the conclusion of this agreement, which, by making the registration of all lobbyists wishing to enjoy permanent access to Parliament and the Commission de facto mandatory, marks a decisive step in strengthening transparency in the dialogue between the EU institutions and these representatives of civil society"
"Transparency of political institutions' activities is a prerequisite for legitimacy."
"It must always and, in all circumstances, be easy to scrutinise how any decision was made, what factors influenced it and, above all, how resources - which means taxpayers' money - were used."
"Parliament was the first European institution to set up a register of lobbyists in 1996."
"The resolution adopted today highlights the fact that the establishment of a common register ensures the widest participation of the various categories of operators while respecting their differences and specific identities."
"This mechanism provides important information such as the number of individuals and organisations involved in all the activities relating to the register and the level of EU resources received by registrants."
"Brussels, which is considered by some to be second only to Washington as a mecca for lobbyists, needs proper regulations and clearly-defined principles of cooperation between decision makers and representatives of various interest groups."
"We should remember that lobbying, interpreted as advocacy by various social groups, is an indivisible part of contemporary democratic systems."
"Once again, Members have expressed their support for the introduction of transparency."
"A common register of lobbyists will increase transparency in EU institutions."
"It will also distinguish between representatives of pressure groups and representatives of non-governmental organisations and government organisations."
"There is no doubt that interest groups present a platform for the exchange of information and are an important channel of communication between citizens and the European Union."
"To make this cooperation as effective as possible so that it achieves the expected results, it should be regulated and transparent."
"The decision concerning the so-called transparency register is not ambitious enough."
"The Commission's register, which is now being put together with Parliament's register, is voluntary and covers a small proportion of the estimated 15 000 lobbyists in Brussels."
"The register lacks relevant information."
"I view the report as representing a certain, albeit limited, amount of progress."
"It would have been better to have waited to see what the group led by President Buzek came up with before taking the decision."
"The scandals that have been brought to light over recent months highlight the fact that Parliament's rules are also inadequate."
"We need a code of conduct which makes it impermissible for MEPs to be paid for supporting the proposals of lobbyist groups."
"The only people that MEPs should represent should be their electorates; they should not represent particular economic or religious interests."
"I believe that all lobbyists should be registered."
"Making exceptions for certain lobbyists will create loopholes in the control system."
"During the election campaign, my party demanded mandatory registration of lobbyists on a register that is common to all EU institutions."
"We also called for information to be provided on the particular issues that the lobbyists were concerned with. The register should contain financial information, including the expenditure for their lobbying activities and who finances these activities."
"A code of conduct for lobbying activities is necessary."
"Lobbyists who behave unethically must be publicly exposed and it must be possible for them to be barred."
"We must have double counting of gifts, travel and lunches for officials and politicians; in other words, both the giver and the recipient must declare the gifts."
"Officials within the EU must not be able to go directly into a lobbyist job with links to their previous work for a period of two years."
"In addition, all in- and out-going post between EU institutions and lobbyists must be made public."
"Lobbyists must not be able to request confidentiality."
"Mr Casini's report does not meet these requirements."
"Transparency is an important component of democracy and a requirement for the participation of citizens, which makes it an essential means of gaining their trust."
"In addition, the accountability which results from transparency requirements is an important instrument for preventing all kinds of abuse."
"This draft agreement concerning the establishment of a transparency register takes all the essential requirements into consideration, which means that I was able to give the agreement as a whole my support."
"The next step must be to follow up the objectives of this new register and to combat any new difficulties which arise immediately and effectively in the spirit of the original agreement."
"Lobbying is a legitimate activity."
"It is a basic element of democracy."
"Representative democracy can function only when citizens communicate with their elected representatives and ask them to promote their interests."
"From this perspective, it is not important whether citizens approach politicians as individuals, associations, trading companies or manufacturing firms."
"No regulation should therefore restrict one of the basic rights of citizens."
"However, the reasons for which an elected representative decides to prefer one interest ahead of another must be based on his convictions, and not on personal gain."
"The transparency of an MEP's work in contact with people who are promoting their own interests is the instrument that will perhaps best prevent corruption in the making of laws."
"I therefore support the proposed common register, which takes account of the varying nature of interest groups, and distinguishes between those that lobby with the aim of boosting their profits and those that address elected representatives with the aim of achieving the greater good of society as a whole."
"Following the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament's powers have been strengthened and it is now colegislator in almost all areas under the ordinary legislative procedure."
"As a result, it is the focus of attention of an even larger number of lobbyists, who, moreover, play a key role in the open, pluralist dialogue on which a democratic system is based, and act as an important source of information for Members in the context of the performance of their duties In the light of these developments, and against this constitutional background, and in keeping with their commitment to transparency, Parliament and the Commission have agreed to establish and maintain a common register in order to keep a list of the names of, and exercise scrutiny over, the organisations and individuals taking part in the drafting and implementation of EU policies The register will be established and kept on the basis of the existing arrangements introduced by Parliament in 1996 and by the Commission in June 2008, as developed by the joint Parliament-Commission working party and on the basis of the experience gained and the suggestions made by the parties concerned The work towards transparency must continue."
"Political institutions are only credible if they are transparent, thus giving them the legitimacy that they need to preserve the democracy that characterises them."
"In view of this, and considering the importance of the issue of legitimacy and informing citizens for the effectiveness and proper functioning of European policies, I voted for the draft agreement on the establishment of a common transparency register."
"The smooth functioning of the Internal Market depends on the stability of the financial system and on the trust placed in financial institutions and transactions by the European public and consumers."
"In the wake of the financial crisis, it has become clear that the quality of consumer protection and safeguards in the financial services sector requires tangible and significant improvement, particularly as regards monitoring and supervision."
"There is a need for an effective and adequate governance system in terms of risk management, compliance with regulations, the internal audit function, strategies, policies, and processes and procedures."
"This challenge, which is as important as it is complex, can be met by a package of measures with either immediate or medium-term effects."
"How the accountability of members of boards of directors is organised must be clearly defined, and must be put into practice in a reasonable way, so as not to jeopardise financial institutions' willingness to seize business opportunities, which is a desirable aspect of their work, or the quality of the human resources at their disposal."
"The report identifies solutions to this, so I am voting in favour."
"I voted in favour of this report."
"The proper functioning of the Internal Market depends on the stability of the financial system and on the trust put by European citizens and consumers in financial institutions and transactions."
"During the recent financial crisis, many financial institutions around the world failed at great cost to the taxpayer."
"I support the Commission's initiative to take a critical look at the soundness of financial institutions and of the financial system as a whole, and at the regulation and supervision of the system, in order to prevent any repeat of the crisis in the future and to ensure that the financial sector meets the needs of the real economy and displays the greatest possible degree of social responsibility."
"I voted for Mr Fox's report."
"As shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), I should point out that the excellent outcome achieved at the final vote highlights once again the close cooperation between the political groups."
"We therefore successfully prevented the European Parliament adopting a position geared too much towards mandatory regulations on corporate governance."
"It is of paramount importance that our group promotes a balanced approach to resolving the global financial crisis."
"This is why we must avoid introducing barriers in financial institutions."
"The final report attaches greater importance and gives more power to the role of the European Supervisory Authorities."
"The most important compromise involves putting the 'comply or explain' principle and the mandatory regulations on an equal footing."
"I think that regulations should be introduced only when the codes of good practice fail."
"The approach based on the 'comply or explain' principle is proportionate and can be applied to a large number of financial institutions."
"At the same time, however, this must be supplemented by regular external evaluation and appropriate regulatory supervision."
"I voted for this report because it represents Parliament's contribution to the discussions on means of ensuring more effective governance in financial institutions in Europe."
"This discussion is particularly important for finding ways of avoiding a repeat of the financial and, ultimately, economic crisis that hit the whole world in 2008."
"The collapse of a series of financial institutions cost and is still costing taxpayers dear."
"Therefore, it is necessary to examine the cause of the problems that arose."
"In response to the Green Paper on improving the governance of financial institutions published by the Commission, the European Parliament's report devotes significant attention to the need to regulate more strictly the procedures for appointing managers, to laying down the competences of board members and aptitude test criteria, and to ways of guaranteeing their independence."
"The report calls for the establishment of mandatory risk committees at board level, for financial institutions to be required to disclose recovery planning and supervisory reports, for an annual report to be drafted on the adequacy and effectiveness of their internal control systems, and for a similar assessment to be included in the annual report drawn up by external auditors."
"Bearing in mind the importance of the trust that European citizens and consumers put in financial institutions and transactions for the stability of our financial system and, consequently, for the smooth functioning of the Internal Market, I welcome the Commission's Green Paper and the opportunity to improve corporate governance structures throughout the EU."
"Several things will need to be done in order to ensure the smooth and sustainable functioning of the European financial market, the most important of which, in my opinion, are a targeted approach responding to the needs of the real economy and the implementation of a policy of increased social responsibility and risk assessment by boards in order to avoid a financial crisis in the future."
"I voted in favour of the alternative motion for a resolution on corporate governance in financial institutions as it tables proposals which would ensure improvements in corporate governance structures throughout the EU, taking into account the fact that the financial sector must respond to the needs of the real economy, contribute to sustainable growth and demonstrate greater social responsibility."
"The smooth functioning of the Internal Market depends on the stability of the financial system and, consequently, on the trust put by the European public and consumers in financial institutions and transactions."
"As such, there is a need to strengthen and review the current systems, which have been shown to be inadequate, with particular emphasis on mechanisms of control and supervision."
"To this end, I welcome the conclusions and observations of the Green Paper and the opportunity to improve the governance of financial institutions through the Union."
"I also join the rapporteur in calling for a cost-benefit impact assessment of the Commission's proposals, with a focus on the need to preserve competitiveness and contribute to economic growth."
"As such, there is an urgent need to find mechanisms and solutions that enable risk reduction and create a permanent dialogue between the supervisory authorities, auditors and the institutions."
"The global financial crisis triggered by the bankruptcy of the Lehman Brothers bank in 2008 and 'subprime credit' - the inappropriate securitisation of mortgage debt - sparked very serious doubts concerning the strength of financial institutions."
"This forced the governments of both the Member States and the United States to inject public funds amounting to roughly 25% of gross domestic product (GDP) into the financial sector."
"This situation led the Commission, through its Communication of 4 March 2009, to introduce a genuine programme of reforms of the financial markets' regulatory frameworks and supervisory regimes."
"Bearing in mind the economic and financial crisis we are currently experiencing, it is never too much to redouble one's efforts with regard to the financial sector, beginning with corporate governance which, most of the time, does not take customers into account, whether they are savers, depositors, etc. I therefore welcome the Commission's Green Paper, and welcome its proposals, which can and should accompany and complement the regulations adopted to strengthen the financial system in the context of the new European supervisory system."
"I am therefore voting in favour of the report on corporate governance in financial institutions, and I hope that this will contribute decisively to their strength."
"This report recognises some important issues and evidence, like the fact that the financial sector should respond to the needs of the economy, contribute to sustainable growth and demonstrate greater social responsibility, as well as that 'during the recent financial crisis, many financial institutions around the world failed at great cost to the taxpayer'."
"However, having made these statements, the report does not draw out all the consequences of the facts presented, simply making a few inconsequential observations."
"According to the rapporteur, everything, or almost everything, boils down to tired arguments about creating an effective and adequate governance system in terms of risk management, enforcement of rules, ethics in the behaviour of some of those involved in the financial markets and institutions, and so on."
"We are aware of the contribution that some of these guidelines may make towards appreciably and temporarily improving the workings of the financial system."
"Nonetheless, it is obvious that they cannot alter the system's most essential aspect: its unsustainability, predatory nature and emphasis on speculation, with the principal aim of increasing profits."
"The report completely fails to address the central issue: the state recovering its role in this area; taking back the financial sector and returning it to its social role, under public and democratic control."
"The only important points that the report makes are the acknowledgements that 'the financial sector should meet the needs of the real economy, help to promote sustainable growth and display the greatest possible degree of social responsibility', and that 'during the recent financial crisis, many financial institutions around the world failed at great cost to the taxpayer'."
"It even claims that some financial institutions and authorities did not understand the nature, amplitude and complexity of the risks they incurred."
"However, the report does not then make the correct inferences, limiting itself to questions of ethics in the behaviour of some people involved in the financial institutions and markets, as well as to creating a governance system which is effective and adequate in terms of risk management, compliance with regulations, and so on."
"Of course, these proposals could slightly improve the working of the banks over time, but they do not change the exploitative nature of the system, or its principal objective of increasing profit and speculative endeavours."
"The report does not, therefore, touch on the central issue: public and democratic control of the entire financial sector."
"That is why we voted against."
"in writing. - Financial risk is essential to the existence of the financial sector, and is equally essential in terms of both the business success of that sector and security functions for the economy in general."
"However, it is in the public interest that risks should be restricted to prevent systemic crisis."
"This challenge, as important as it is complex, can be met by means of a package of measures which will have either direct or indirect impact."
"Financial institutions should be obliged to prepare annual reports on the adequacy and effectiveness of their internal control systems, and boards should have these reports adopted."
"Financial institutions should give greater attention to the implementation of measures to raise awareness about the risks, as better information about risk at all levels of society - and among employees - is often crucial in improving risk management."
"Having noted, and I quote and now utter the following euphemism - 'a lack of values and ethics in the behaviour of certain actors in the financial markets and institutions' - this Parliament has set off on a pathetic crusade to inject some ethics into the sector."
"To use the word crusade is perhaps to overstate the case."
"It might be better to say that some pious hopes are expressed that finally, the interests of customers and workers should be taken into account."
"There is some pitiful bleating about social, cultural and 'gender' diversity on boards of directors (quotas for the Roma, no doubt?)."
"There are some proposals, which have already largely been adopted at European level, on the indecent remunerations in the sector, where we could do considerably better."
"There are some risk controls here and there."
"In short, the point that escapes you is the fact that companies are merely playing by the rules that you set."
"Now these rules, rules that you are basically refusing to question, are the free international movement of capital, the financialisation of the economy, an over-emphasis on the short term, securitisation, complex financial products that are not based on any concrete wealth creation and the constitution of large multinational groups which are more powerful than States and are not subject to control."
"Until you deal with the foundations of this system, you will change nothing."
"in writing. - The worst impact of the recent financial crisis has been on ordinary consumers."
"Various EU governments have used taxpayers' money to bail out some banks that had managed their affairs in an irresponsible way."
"Were it not for the support of taxpayers, such banks would have collapsed with disastrous effect on different sectors of the economy in various Member States."
"Now that the worst phase of this financial crisis is over, banks are still not acting, or conducting their business, in the best interest of consumers."
"Instances of mis-selling of financial services products, and lack of sufficient support by banks for personal customers and small businesses that find themselves facing temporary liquidity problems, show that more tangible action should be taken by regulators to ensure that operators in the financial services industry support their clients and generally offer better protection to consumers."
"Therefore, I voted in favour of this report."
"I welcomed this document because the financial sector should meet the needs of the real economy, help to promote sustainable growth and display the greatest possible degree of social responsibility."
"It is noted that there is a lack of values and ethics in the behaviour of some actors in financial markets and institutions."
"Financial markets and institutions have to take into account, as part of their corporate social responsibility, the interests of all parties involved, including clients, shareholders and employees."
"Effective risk governance is one of the most important factors for preventing future crises."
"Therefore, an effective governance system needs to be established in all financial institutions, with adequate risk management, compliance, internal audit functions (and, in the case of insurers, actuarial functions), strategies, policies, processes and procedures."
"I believe that it is necessary to establish mandatory risk committees or equivalent arrangements."
"We should not take disproportionate risks."
"The financial crisis has highlighted the lack of effectiveness of the current corporate governance principles."
"It is now vital for the lessons to be learnt from what has happened to avoid a similar situation recurring in the future."
"The area of corporate governance is evolving all the time and it is the financial sector which has particular responsibility for serious, sustainable economic strategies."
"We must maintain the sound, stable and competitive nature of financial institutions so that they can make a contribution to economic growth."
"In this regard, I think that effective corporate governance must take into account equally the interests of all the stakeholders and, at the same time, the stability of the financial system."
"This will allow the market to operate at its optimum and consumers will show increased confidence in financial institutions and transactions."
"in writing. - I welcome this report."
"The aim of the Green Paper under consideration here is to draw conclusions from the global financial crisis triggered by the bankruptcy of the Lehman Brothers bank in autumn 2008 following the inappropriate securitisation of US subprime mortgages."
"In the light of the development of new financial instruments in a globalised world, the Green Paper takes a critical look at the soundness of financial institutions and of the financial system as a whole, and at the regulation and supervision of the system, with a view to preventing any repeat of the crisis in the future."
"The Commission regards the strengthening of corporate governance as central to its financial market reform and crisis prevention programme."
"In that connection, the Commission notes, in particular, that in the financial services sector, corporate governance must take account of the interests of other stakeholders (depositors, savers, life insurance policy holders, etc.) and of the stability of the financial system, owing to the systemic nature of many of the players involved"
"in writing. - Poor corporate governance in financial institutions - and particularly banks' murky pay culture - was a key factor in creating the conditions for the financial crisis."
"Labour Euro MPs backed this report which, thanks to amendments adopted at the committee stage, calls for Commission action to raise financial firms' corporate governance standards."
"These demands include stronger oversight of risks that a firm takes on, high standards of independence and diversity for members of firms' boards, including better gender balance and, crucially, transparency around pay, so shareholders and the public can hold banks to account."
"As the Conservative-led government in the United Kingdom has shelved legislation on transparency introduced by the previous Labour Government, I welcome the inclusion of my proposal to introduce such a requirement at the EU level."
"Labour Euro MPs opposed the rapporteur's amendments to weaken the committee report, including a lower requirement for representation of women, a slower timetable for action on pay reform and less information on staff pay."
"The Commission must now complete its consultation and swiftly bring forward ambitious proposals to ensure that governance of financial firms will help prevent, not facilitate, future crises."
"The recent financial crisis reinforced the need for us to look at the moral issues relating to managing financial institutions in a more responsible way."
"Issues relating to remuneration policies, and governance of the remuneration of directors and managers of financial institutions, must be governed by ethical and moral principles that do not allow situations such as those experienced in the recent past, with the awarding of management prizes in companies that immediately afterwards filed for bankruptcy or were found to be in serious difficulties."
"The EU must have a productive, social and environmental model with a long-term outlook that respects everyone's interests: companies, shareholders and workers."
"in writing. - The aim of the resolution is to strengthen corporate governance, which is considered by the Commission to be the major element of the programme of financial market reform and crisis prevention."
"I disagree with that because it may lead to an increase in corruption and violations."
"I voted 'against'."
"The introduction of corporate governance may increase European citizens' confidence in the stability of the financial system, but the markets are reacting by bringing in their own mechanisms and the role played by the rating agencies must not be underestimated."
"It is completely incomprehensible that citizens are having to tighten their belts to pay for the rescue package for the banks, while the very same managers at the banks who were calling desperately for help are now paying themselves bonuses amounting to millions of euro."
"Far too little was done during the process of rescuing the banks to respond to this predictable development."
"At the same time, many small and medium-sized businesses, which the EU always praises on paper as being the engine of the economy, were dealt a fatal blow, because, on the basis of the Basel agreements, the banks preferred to hold onto their money, rather than lending it to companies."
"The banking crisis has also highlighted the collapse of the myth of the self-regulating market."
"It emerged during the crisis in Asia that regulation is a sensible precaution."
"It remains to be seen to what extent the new monitoring and supervisory measures will take effect."
"A whole range of mistakes have been made and there has been a breathtaking lack of ethics, morals and decency, combined with conflicts of interest."
"The report is a move in the right direction, but in some areas, it is not specific enough, which is why I have abstained."
"This report on corporate governance in financial institutions sets out a range of measures to be implemented in the companies governing financial institutions."
"In short, its aim is to draw conclusions from the global financial crisis triggered by the bankruptcy of the Lehman Brothers bank in autumn 2008, related to the inappropriate securitisation of US subprime mortgages."
"In order to prevent this situation from repeating itself, Parliament proposes that corporate governance must, particularly in the financial services sector, take account of the interests of other stakeholders - depositors, savers, life insurance policy holders, etc. - and of the stability of the financial system, owing to the systemic nature of many of the players involved."
"The most important of the measures proposed is the development of objective competence criteria to assess the suitability of candidates for controlled roles, taking into account the nature, complexity and size of the financial institution."
"I would like to align myself with this package of measures by voting for it, in the hope that the measures tabled by the Commission, and now by Parliament, will be sufficient to prevent the recurrence of situations like the one which we experienced in autumn 2008, and which is still being seen in the daily lives of the Portuguese people."
"I voted against for the following reasons."
"The report does not accept that the financial crisis of 2007-2008 was systemic in nature: in other words, that it stemmed from the way the financial system is organised."
"This would mean acknowledging that the way the system is organised strongly influences the decisions of the financial companies' directors, whatever the levels of transparency required of them."
"For example, the report fails to recognise that the commercial banks' ability to make money from speculative financial investments was a very important factor in the crisis."
"The report does not touch on this organisational issue, and no amount of risk boards or competence criteria for directors can avoid the harmful consequences of speculating on families' savings for profit."
"The 'herd behaviour' of the financial markets is an inescapable phenomenon, leading to speculative bubbles which later burst."
"No market in which financial institutions have a pivotal role is able to operate without confidence that the various economic operators work properly."
"As such, there is a need to strike a balance between these institutions' freedom to conduct their business, in what is an essentially private matter, and the economic impact that another crisis in the financial system could have on the real economy, and for the lives of everyone as members of a community."
"If we analyse the causes of the recent financial crisis, we can see that it is necessary to find mechanisms for control of investment risk, of the composition of boards, and of directors' pay, thereby enabling enhanced cooperation between public and private supervisory bodies, while ensuring their independence."
"Since this resolution puts forward proposals in these different areas, I voted in favour."
"in writing. - We had to abstain at the end."
"Our AMR, co-signed by S&D and aimed at giving the resolution a stronger regulatory flavour, was rejected."
"Amendments by the rapporteur to weaken the resolution were, however, adopted, as was the report containing very mixed messages."
"The key player on this in the EPP (Karas) was on our line, and as rapporteur for CRD IV (the Capital Requirements Directive), he will be given the task of dealing with corporate governance rules for financial institutions (the follow-up to this INI)."
"His group, in particular Vice-President Wortman-Kool, let him down (again)."
"Let us hope the actual legislation (proposal expected in July) will be treated with more care and determination."
"The most important revelation to emerge from the financial and economic crisis was that we have an extremely greedy system."
"The financial sector was not only focusing on short-term profits, but was also undermining efforts to introduce sustainable growth."
"The report contains important lessons for us to learn from the financial crisis with regard to risk, boards of directors, supervisory bodies, shareholders and remuneration."
"I have therefore voted in favour of this report."
"I am voting for this motion for a resolution, given that the multilateral trade system continues to be by far the most effective framework for achieving equitable and fair trade at international level."
"Achieving a balanced result in the negotiations of the World Trade Organisation's Doha Development Agenda (DDA) must therefore be a priority for the Union's negotiators."
"The importance of this agreement is due to the fact that India is the seventh largest economy in the world."
"However, I must also mention that, in spite of sustained economic growth, enormous inequalities persist."
"I would like to highlight the need to ensure the free trade agreement (FTA) does not limit the powers that the Indian Government needs to resolve problems of poverty and inequality."
"The final FTA should include a binding state-to-state dispute settlement mechanism, provisions on mediation regarding non-tariff barriers to trade (NTBs), on anti-dumping measures and on compensation rights, and a general safeguard clause based on Articles XX and XXI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)."
"However, it also highlights the need for the Commission to include robust and effective safeguard clauses in the FTA and to insist, during negotiations, that India ratify the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)."
"I voted in favour of this important resolution on the state of play of the EU-India free trade agreement negotiations."
"India is an important EU trading partner: in 2000, India was the European Union's 17th most important trading partner, and by 2010 its eighth."
"Furthermore, India is the largest beneficiary in the generalised system of preferences (GSP), and European Union imports from India by means of preferential tariffs or a zero rate of duty were valued at EUR 19.9 billion and constituted 83% of all EU imports from India."
"Both parties expect to reap significant benefits from the removal of tariffs, and the liberalisation of trade in services and company start-ups, but I share the disappointment expressed in the resolution as regards the slow rate of progress of negotiations on the free trade agreement (FTA)."
"Both parties must make every effort to ensure that a comprehensive, ambitious and coordinated FTA has been concluded by 2011, because this agreement would be the basis for establishing opportunities to increase EU and Indian trade and investment, and develop business, and the FTA would increase overall exports and imports for both the European Union and India."
"I agree with the position set out in the resolution that if economic cooperation between the EU and India is based on common universal values, it may become an example for cooperation with other countries."
"We supported this resolution and tabled a question to the Commission because we believe it is fundamental at this moment in time, when oil prices have been at an all-time high for some months."
"It has become unsustainable for many fishing boats, and especially for small-scale fleets, to see their outgoings constantly increasing because of the rise in oil prices, to the extent that they often make no profit from any of the fishing seasons."
"By calling for a rise in de minimis aid from EUR 30 000 to EUR 60 000 for the next three years, we want to send out a strong signal to the sector, which, in recent years, particularly because of the entry into force of the common fisheries policy and new restrictive measures, has seen some small- and medium-scale modes of fishing cut back, if not killed off completely."
"It should also be noted that measures have already been adopted in other sectors, such as agriculture, to help them cope with this price rise."
"Therefore, this aid - which we should remember is granted at national, not European, level, and is therefore dependent on each individual Member State's economic resources - could be seen by many people as causing an imbalance in competition, but in reality, it would provide a little relief to a sector that is increasingly on its knees."
"I voted against the resolution tabled by the European right, as it promotes an ultraliberal vision of the EU's trade relations with India."
"The right systematically opposed the amendments that I tabled on behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament in order to rule out any liberalisation of public services, strongly condemn child labour, request legally binding clauses on corporate social responsibility and demand respect for the principle of equal pay for equal work with regard to Indians who will come and work in Europe in the future."
"The compromise was impossible, the differences of opinion obvious and irreconcilable."
"Only the resolution tabled by my group, together with those by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, offered a progressive vision of EU-India trade relations."
"Unsurprisingly, it could not hold out against the right-wing majority in Parliament, which is a shame."
"I voted in favour of this resolution."
"After more than three years of talks on the free trade agreement, the EU and India are at a crucial stage, completing negotiations on the most important sectors."
"However, during further negotiations, it is crucial to address some important issues."
"I believe that significant attention must be paid to Europe's most sensitive sectors, such as industry, agriculture and the services sector."
"India is one of the world's largest economies, with a rapidly growing services sector."
"It is very keen to access the EU's services market and therefore, it is necessary to carry out a comprehensive evaluation of how the free trade agreement might affect the EU's services sectors (and other important sectors) and employment."
"At all stages of the negotiations, we must also ensure that future trade policy is conducted in the context of the European Union's objectives, including binding commitments on social and environmental standards."
"I would like to remind you that the eighth global Millennium Development Goal states that a global partnership for development should be established which includes creating an open, rule-based, predictable and non-discriminatory trade and finance system."
"The key factor to achieving this goal is for developed countries to want to open their markets to developing countries, which also includes India."
"This will allow the EU to make a contribution in such areas as sustainable development, eradication of poverty and protection for human rights."
"Adopting the resolution on the free trade agreement between the EU and India will help us take a step forward to fulfilling the Millennium Development Goals."
"I consider regrettable the European Commission's decision not to wait until Parliament has adopted its report on Europe's future international investment policy and that it has decided to go ahead and offer India a mandate to negotiate for an investment chapter."
"It would be usual for the European legislative to be consulted when an international negotiation mandate is involved, in a situation where the European Parliament has a relevant role to play in terms of shaping EU-level investment policies."
"The Commission must respond as soon as possible to the request submitted by Parliament to define clearly the period of investment so that the provisions on investment protection do not undermine the parties' ability to issue compulsory licences."
"Furthermore, the binding state-to-state dispute settlement mechanism only serves to empower foreign investors to initiate legal proceedings at an international level against the governments of the EU and India, while domestic investors only have recourse to national courts."
"This situation could undermine the national policy initiatives on environmental, social or fiscal legislation."
"The free trade agreement should be the most important of all the agreements negotiated so far."
"This is why focusing more attention on it would not do any harm."
"I voted against this report."
"We want a free trade agreement between the EU and India that helps to promote sustainable development, and that is accompanied by clear clauses concerning respect for ILO standards, environmental rules and corporate social responsibility obligations."
"The right's rejection of these requests is particularly regrettable."
"We also deplore the fact that the right-wing in Parliament rejected the amendment designed to ensure equal treatment of European and Indian workers."
"This is not only harmful to Indian workers; it is also very dangerous for European workers."
"We must not accept the liberalisation of services and social dumping aimed at bringing down European wages."
"Moreover, the European Union must not forget its founding principles."
"The Treaty of Lisbon stipulates that trade policy must contribute to sustainable development, eradication of poverty and the protection of human rights."
"As far as the EU-India Free Trade Agreement is concerned, I chose to vote for the resolution proposed by my political group as I felt that it is more balanced than the resolutions proposed by other political groups."
"The resolution from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament highlighted the importance of a free trade agreement with India, while mentioning the continuing inequalities in this country and the need to include in the agreement some clauses on human, social and environmental rights."
"The largest democracy in the world today demonstrates paradoxes and asymmetries that have apparently slotted relatively easily into its many thousands of years of history."
"Although the most extreme poverty has not disappeared, it is no less true that surges and flows of prosperity have raised India to a more prominent international role, and have revealed that its economy and society are prospering and innovating quickly and efficiently."
"A free trade agreement (FTA) between the European Union and India could be a successful conclusion to the process of commercial interaction which has been deepening in recent times."
"I hope that, as well as sharing values, the EU and India will continue trying to understand each other better and benefiting from this deeper understanding, as well as from any profits that may result from this contact."
"This motion for a resolution of the European Parliament concerns a free trade agreement (FTA) between the European Union and India."
"Trade relations between the EU and India are significant, since the EU is India's principal trade partner and its biggest foreign investor."
"For its part, the EU is the principal recipient of Indian foreign investment and, as such, it must continue to prioritise a multilateral trade system which favours developing countries."
"Indeed, India is the largest beneficiary of the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP)."
"If we take into account the importance of strategic relations between the EU and India, as well as the safeguarding of matters relating to agriculture, respect for human rights and the issue of child labour in particular, environmental preservation and compliance with the International Labour Organisation's recommendations on social and copyright issues, all the conditions for voting in favour of this motion for a resolution are in place."
"This free trade agreement (FTA) is the widest-ranging negotiated by the EU to date."
"Beyond its specific content, it also provokes a wider discussion on free trade, its role, its objectives and its consequences."
"Free trade is one of the pillars of neoliberalism which emerged in the 1970s under the so-called Washington Consensus, as one of the key elements of the capitalist system's response to the structural crisis that was making itself known at that time, just like today."
"It represented a way for world powers with imperialist ambitions to expand their control of the markets and force new and more intensive ways of exploiting workers, playing work forces from different countries and regions off against each other."
"This entailed a levelling-down of working and living conditions."
"Its aim was to achieve new conditions for continuing the process of capitalist accumulation."
"That remains the case."
"The consequences are plain to see: on top of the pressure on workers and their rights, the competition between productive systems with very different levels of development tends to accentuate differences, strengthening the strong and weakening the weak."
"It will be no different with this agreement."
"The liberalisation and deregulation of world trade has greatly weakened the productive sectors of the weakest EU economies, such as Portugal, which have been run according to the interests of big business in the European powers."
"Faced with the disastrous consequences of this path, instead of retracing its steps, the EU continues to show signs of wanting to rush blindly ahead."
"It is in this context that we must analyse this agreement, which is the widest-ranging negotiated by the European Union to date."
"What is needed are urgent and profound changes to current trade policy in order to take into account the specificities of each EU Member State, with international trade aiming for complementarity rather than competition."
"This is necessary for the establishment of fair and equitable economic relationships that are mutually beneficial, are at the service of the development of peoples and countries, and are not solely beneficial for a small number of financial institutions and companies."
"The multifaceted crisis that we are facing requires a new economic, social, energy and environmental rationale, as well as the defence of each country's right to produce sustainably: free trade, one of the pillars of neoliberalism, clearly makes this unviable."
"As you frequently remind us, common foreign policy must fulfil the global objectives of the European Union which are defined, in particular, in Article 3 of the Treaty, and where the elimination of poverty features prominently."
"Now, for all those years that you have been signing free trade agreements with every country in the world, and especially those that systematically practise social, monetary or environmental dumping, all you have done is to create poverty for all those victims of relocations and closures of companies directly linked to unfair competition."
"This agreement with India means that you are going even further."
"Out with the Polish plumber, in with the Indian computer programmer or accountant!"
"You are, in fact, intending to open the European market to numerous services of the General Agreement on Trade in Services Mode 4, a barbaric term used to refer to the world version of the Bolkestein Directive."
"As the French winner of the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences, Maurice Allais, pointed out, free trade is only mutually beneficial if it is between countries with comparable levels of development, and further to that, I would add, if it is in targeted areas with the strategic sectors of each country remaining protected."
"Otherwise, it is never a win-win game."
"And there has been, for a long time now, one single loser: Europe."
"I endorsed the document because the EU is India's largest source of Foreign Direct Investment."
"Both parties expect to secure significant benefits from the elimination of tariffs and the liberalisation of trade in services and company formation, and reaffirm their commitment to tariff reductions and further liberalisation of company formation and trade in services."
"Market access is being hampered by non-tariff barriers to trade, such as health and safety requirements or technical barriers, quantitative restrictions, conformity procedures, trade defence mechanisms, customs procedures, internal taxation, and a failure to adopt international norms and standards."
"The EU and India must pledge to speed up FTA talks and to make substantive and efficient progress towards the early conclusion of an ambitious and balanced, broad-based trade and investment agreement."
"Both parties must make every effort to conclude a comprehensive, ambitious and balanced FTA by the end of 2011."
"The agreement should respect sensitivities linked to agricultural trade, but this should not prevent market opening in areas of complementarity."
"The Commission must take due account of any negative impact on European agriculture, particularly in the areas of the opening up of markets, GMOs, milk, beef, intellectual property protection and origin labelling."
"The Commission should also negotiate effective and transparent procurement systems and India should apply transparent and fair procedures when awarding public contracts and grant European businesses access to public procurement systems."
"Good progress is being made in the negotiations on a free trade agreement between the EU and India."
"By adopting the motion for a resolution, the European Parliament has today made its priorities clear."
"With regard to agriculture, Parliament has focused on the sensitive areas, highlighted the sanitary and phytosanitary standards (SPS) and expressed its support for effective safeguard clauses."
"However, there is still a great deal to be done in the area of intellectual property."
"in writing. - I voted for this resolution."
"Any free trade agreement the EU signs with India must in no way limit India's ability to produce generic medicines."
"If it did, it would not only damage India but harm the poor in Africa and elsewhere who depend on cheap medicine from India."
"One merit of this text is that it takes account of the potentially negative effects of GMOs."
"However, it promotes the liberalisation of the trade in services between the European Union and India."
"Furthermore, it leaves States just one right, that of 'regulating' public services, an action that a liberalisation of this nature nonetheless condemns."
"It also calls for the liberalisation of legal and accounting services, the opening up of the market in banks and insurance, and the relaxation of investment rules."
"The interests of the oligarchy are served in Europe as they are in India."
"I am voting against this report."
"The EU is India's largest trade partner, with trade in goods and services worth approximately EUR 84 billion in 2009-2010."
"The EU accounts for 20.15% of India's total exports and 13.32% of India's total imports."
"Conversely, India accounts for 2.6% of the EU's total exports and 2.2% of the EU's total imports."
"In view of this, we cannot fail to take into consideration the fact that the objectives of the common commercial policy must be fully coordinated with the overall objectives of the European Union."
"According to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the common commercial policy must be conducted 'in the context of the principles and objectives of the Union's external action' and must contribute 'inter alia, to sustainable development, the eradication of poverty and the protection of human rights'."
"As such, it is very important that the following not be forgotten in these negotiations: the use of child labour, and the failure to comply with international social and environmental standards, which constitutes a form of dumping, detrimental to European companies and workers."
"It is therefore essential that the Commission clarify these points before concluding a trade agreement."
"in writing. - Given the size of India's market (more than 1 billion inhabitants) and its impressive growth rates (averaging over 7% a year since 2000), coupled with high levels of protection, India is one of the EU's obvious partners for concluding one of the new generation of EU FTAs launched as part of the Global Europe strategy in 2006. The EU-India Summit on 10 December in Brussels instructed both sides to speed up the negotiating process to pave the way for the conclusion of negotiations in 2011."
"It is necessary to take into account the dumping aspect of the relationship with India; if there were no point related to this, I would vote 'against'."
"I think this resolution on the EU-India Free Trade Agreement should be rejected."
"There is no denunciation of any kind in it of the problems that this agreement will cause to the textile industry in Europe, and northern Italy in particular; other industries are mentioned and are given their own clauses, but the textile industry is completely ignored."
"To show the validity of the agreement, the resolution highlights the fact that the Indian and European economies are complementary: the reality is somewhat different, because there are several industries, including precisely the textile industry, in which there is no complementarity at all but rather competition, and often unfair competition, carried out by our Asian counterparts."
"For these reasons, I have decided to vote against the resolution."
"I voted in favour of this resolution on the state of play in the EU-India Free Trade Agreement (FTA) negotiations."
"The negotiations between the EU and India for the conclusion of an FTA have developed significantly."
"India is achieving a new status in the international geopolitical context, going from being a beneficiary of development aid to a donor."
"This agreement is of particular importance; in fact, if the cooperation between the EU and India currently being negotiated is based on a system of shared universal values, it may serve as a model for cooperation with other countries."
"I would like to highlight the emphasis in these negotiations on the protection of the small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) sector in India, with the suggestions that all development cooperation programmes between the EU and India should be aimed at strengthening SMEs through measures to help finance market-driven local projects."
"In India, as in the EU countries, SMEs drive economic growth and thus, job creation."
"Given the significant profits that both parties will be able to make, I hope that the negotiations between the EU and India will be able to continue, with a view to quickly establishing a free trade agreement (FTA) which is ambitious, balanced and comprehensive."
"in writing. - We voted in favour."
"The EP is very much divided on the free trade agreement with India."
"The first compromise (by EPP, ECR and ALDE) was adopted with 390 in favour, 276 against, and 10 abstentions."
"The hope of sending a strong message to the negotiators to conclude the FTA with India failed."
"The EPP, ECR and ALDE resolution recommending rushing into a complete opening of the Indian market at all levels, without binding language on human and labour rights, CSR, environmental dumping, etc. did not get the overwhelming majority it needed if it wanted to be a recommendation for the negotiators."
"The 'counter-resolution' by the Greens/S&D and GUE, which did not come to a vote, had solid support and will certainly be read by the negotiators."
"The very worst in the EPP, ECR and ALDE compromise was avoided."
"We are strongly against the EU-India Free Trade Agreement because, even though that country is making progress in worker protection and health and in the fight against counterfeiting, we have to bear in mind that it is still an unfair competitor towards our businesses."
"For example, when India received a complaint from the World Trade Organisation about the 500% tariffs that it was applying to European wines, it got round it unfairly by having the individual Indian states impose the same tariffs."
"We must also bear in mind the negative economic impact that further liberalisation of trade with India would have, since the EU exports 1.9% of its services to India, whereas India exports 11.6% of its services to us."
"That clearly means it would help India 10 times more than it would Europe."
"I voted, together with my colleagues from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, against the resolution that deals with the negotiations for a free trade agreement between the European Union and India because it does not take sufficient account of the social standards with which all trade agreements must comply."
"According to 'Save the Children', the Indian non-governmental organisation, an estimated 60 million children still work today in fields, restaurants or factories in India."
"I deplore the fact that the conservative majority in the European Parliament has refused to face up to this state of affairs by rejecting an amendment which highlighted the European Parliament's concerns over the use of children for work, children who are frequently exploited in dangerous and unhealthy conditions."
"We also asked the Commission to tackle this problem at the time of the negotiations on the free trade agreement and we invited the Indian Government to do its utmost to eradicate the deep causes of this phenomenon and to put an end to it."
"By rejecting this position, the majority of the right in the European Parliament has placed European and Indian commercial interests above the protection of children's rights, and I am unable to endorse this unacceptable position."
"I voted against the European Parliament resolution on the negotiations for the free trade agreement between the EU and India."
"This report is entirely consistent with policies of increased liberalisation, especially in the public service sector, and with standards which have deleterious effects not only on the supply of medicinal products, but also on the development of research."
"This is another instance of the ultra-liberalism that the EU is seeking to impose on all its partners."
"This is the broadest agreement ever concluded by the EU in this area, and it seeks more to protect the interests of big multinational corporations than to engage in a balanced partnership between all parties and to contribute to India's economic and social development."
"This agreement is certainly not a 'win-win' initiative as this resolution would have us believe."
"I am voting for this motion for a resolution, as it is essential to strike a balance between multilateral, bilateral and plurilateral agreements."
"In particular, Japan is the third largest economy in the world in terms of gross domestic product (GDP)."
"As such, it is essential to raise questions of investment and trade in services in all trade discussions with Japan, ensuring that market opening does not compromise either European or Japanese rules on the protection of public services and cultural diversity."
"I recognise that the multilateral trading system, embodied by the World Trade Organisation, remains by far the most effective framework for achieving open and fair trade worldwide."
"I would reiterate my firm belief that the European Union and Japan should contribute towards a successful conclusion of the Doha Development Agenda negotiations, and I am concerned that bilateral negotiations may disturb this objective."
"Lastly, I would insist that effective safeguard measures be available to prevent any surge in imports resulting from the possible liberalisation of trade between the EU and Japan that may cause, or threaten to cause, serious injury to EU industry."
"I voted in favour of this important resolution on EU-Japan Trade relations."
"The EU and Japan are significant partners and investors in each other's economies with a combined volume of Foreign Direct Investment worth EUR 200 billion in 2009."
"Japan is the EU's sixth largest trading partner, while the EU is Japan's third biggest trading partner."
"I agree with the provision that the time has come to conclude an EU-Japan Free Trade Agreement (FTA), but before beginning negotiations, Japan must make significant commitments on removing non-tariff barriers, which limit market access opportunities for European businesses, in other words, public procurement obstacles, insufficient recognition of international standards with respect to medical devices, and preferential treatment for national champions in financial services."
"Bilateral trade volumes between the EU and Japan lag behind the bulk of the EU's trade exchanges with its other main trading partners because of the negative effects of Japanese non-tariff barriers (NTBs)."
"I supported the resolution's provision that the EU-Japan FTA has the potential to lead to a win-win situation, beneficial for both economies."
"In anticipation of the EU-Japan Summit at the end of the month, Parliament has adopted this resolution stating its views on trade relations between the two partners."
"Unlike the European right, which spoke out very strongly in favour of opening negotiations on the conclusion of a free trade agreement, I defended a more cautious approach."
"Japan is a trade power that needs to be approached with caution when it comes to trade liberalisation."
"That is why my group opposed the present text presented by the European right and stressed the need to launch specific impact studies assessing the consequences of stronger trade relations for all the sectors concerned (in particular, the automotive sector) and for employment in Europe, before we open any negotiations."
"At the same time, we emphasised the problem of non-tariff barriers, which prevent European businesses from accessing Japanese public contracts."
"Indeed, it is wrong that the European Union, the region in the world that is most open to foreign investment, cannot operate on the markets of its industrialised partners under fair conditions."
"I voted in favour of this report because I entirely agree that following the natural catastrophe that recently struck Japan, and which was the greatest in the country's history, the EU can and must help this country's economy to recover quickly."
"The report calls on the Commission to set up a special system, according to which the EU, through various aspects of international trade, would, in future, be able to help countries that have suffered natural disasters."
"Specifically in the case of Japan, the European Parliament resolution proposes exploiting the opportunities offered by international public procurement and services markets, particularly as it is observed that EU and Member State interest in these areas has increased."
"There are still many obstacles to public procurement and trade services, due to legitimate national regulation, and the report proposes removing such obstacles by making efforts to understand the methods of mutual adjustment systems."
"The report nevertheless draws attention to the fact that questions of investment and trade in services need to be raised in trade discussions with Japan in order to ensure that the further opening up of the market does not compromise either European or Japanese rules on the protection of public services, the environment and cultural diversity."
"I voted in favour of the joint motion for a resolution on EU-Japan trade relations."
"In 2009, the European Union and Japan accounted for approximately 20% of the world economy and in 2010, bilateral trade was worth EUR 120 billion."
"In light of these figures, I feel there is an urgent need to start negotiations on the free trade agreements in order to encourage closer cooperation between these two trading partners and enable them to face common challenges together, such as the global economic crisis and the relentless political and economic rise of China."
"The precondition for commencing negotiations and strengthening trade relations remains the obligation on Japan to remove non-tariff barriers and barriers preventing access to Japanese public procurement contracts."
"During this preliminary phase, moreover, the Commission should concentrate on removing the barriers hindering European small and medium-sized enterprises."
"During the vote on trade relations between the EU and Japan, I decided to vote for the resolution tabled by the political group which I belong to."
"This resolution highlighted the need to remove the non-tariff barriers which the Japanese market is subject to and to deregulate access to the Japanese public procurement market before signing a free trade agreement with this country."
"Trade relations between European countries and Japan go back several centuries and have been growing closer since the end of the Second World War."
"Japan has been one of the most notable success stories of economic and social recovery in world history, today being a respected country, worthy of admiration."
"The tragic events that have befallen the country call for our solidarity with our partners."
"The tenacity and courage that its people have been demonstrating in the face of these difficulties should be inspiring for a Europe which often seems too self-absorbed and is not always sufficiently aware of what is going on beyond its borders."
"I believe that both parties would have much to gain from a free trade agreement (FTA) that would strengthen their trade relations and remove barriers which have unjustifiably hindered relations."
"I regret that such an objective still seems far from becoming reality and I hope Europe and Japan will persevere in their efforts to attain it."
"This motion for a resolution of the European Parliament concerns a free trade agreement (FTA) between the European Union and Japan, the third largest economy in the world in terms of gross domestic product (GDP)."
"Trade relations between the EU and Japan are not just important to their respective economies, they are fundamental: in 2009, they represented more than a quarter of global GDP and more than 20% of world trade."
"Moreover, the EU is Japan's third largest trading partner."
"For these reasons, I am voting for this report."
"However, I agree with the rapporteur that the EU needs to demand that Japan, inter alia, remove tariff barriers and obstacles to public tenders before negotiations can begin."
"I also believe Parliament must send a positive signal in the wake of the tsunami which devastated part of the Japanese coast with enormous loss of life and property, not to mention the Fukushima nuclear plant."
"The vision shaping this motion for a resolution is made very clear in its preamble."
"It takes the view that the multilateral trade system put in place by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) represents the most suitable framework for regulating and promoting open and fair trade and, at the same time, it is working towards the successful conclusion of the Doha Development Agenda."
"It is a vision of so-called 'free' trade as a class weapon in the service of big financial institutions and companies, promoting increased exploitation of workers and peoples."
"It involves both social dumping, the destruction of productive strength, and environmental dumping, the degradation of the environment."
"This trade policy and the agreements giving it concrete expression are increasingly lacking in democratic legitimacy."
"They are almost always negotiated in secret, behind the public's backs, seeking to cover up their economic, social and environmental impact, and avoiding clear, informed debate."
"This approach, which is for the profit of big business, is damaging to the needs of the peoples and workers, as well as being disadvantageous for the industries of the EU countries with the weakest economies."
"As such, our only option is to condemn and stridently oppose it."
"The negotiations with Japan, aimed at strengthening trade relations, cannot be used as a class weapon in the service of big financial institutions and companies, promoting the increased exploitation of workers and peoples, the destruction of their productive strength, and the destruction of the environment."
"The EU increasingly lacks democratic legitimacy as it is dragged rightwards; as it negotiates trade agreements in secret, paying absolutely no mind to the sovereignty of the peoples of the Member States; as it seeks to hide the enormous economic and social impacts that its policies will have, while failing to inform, clarify, discuss or take into account the opinion of the people."
"This approach, which is for the profit of big business, is damaging to the needs of the peoples and workers, as well as being disadvantageous for the industries of the EU countries with the weakest economies."
"It continues to mean a loss of rights, unemployment and poverty, with an impact on small and medium-sized farmers, fishermen and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), all of which end up as victims."
"Blinded by profit, this approach limits democracy and sovereignty, and creates greater dependency in countries such as Portugal that need to create employment, and produce and create wealth in order to raise the standard of living; that do not need more deindustrialisation, less agricultural production and less fishing."
"I endorsed this document because, in 2009, the EU and Japan represented together more than a quarter of world GDP and more than 20% of world trade, and Japan and the EU are significant investors in each other's economies."
"The Council and Commission have noted that Japan's capacity to remove regulatory barriers to trade is a precondition for launching negotiations on the EU-Japan Free Trade Agreement (FTA), thus fostering closer economic integration between the two strategic trading partners."
"The multilateral trading system, embodied by the World Trade Organisation, remains by far the most effective framework for achieving open and fair trade worldwide."
"I believe that the European Union and Japan should contribute towards the successful conclusion of the Doha Development Agenda negotiations."
"The EU-Japan FTA would not only yield benefits in terms of an increase in the bilateral trade in goods and services, but also foster cooperation on the EU's horizontal priorities, such as cooperation in the field of innovation, regulatory cooperation and the fight against market abuse, and cooperation on tackling broad environmental challenges, etc."
"in writing. - If Japan demonstrates a real willingness to eliminate non-tariff barriers, I believe the EU should enter into negotiations with Japan with a view to signing a free trade agreement."
"A few short weeks after the natural and nuclear catastrophe in Japan, the European right has had the cranky notion of threatening the Japanese Government."
"Their aim is to force Japan to remove all obstacles to European companies' access to its public contracts."
"Not a word about the nuclear catastrophe."
"Not a single proposal for cooperation to help it out of this situation."
"Scarcely a single line of solidarity after Japan's only nuclear catastrophe."
"Shame on the European right!"
"In 2010, the total amount of bilateral trade between the EU and Japan, the third largest economy in the world in terms of gross domestic product (GDP), reached EUR 120 billion."
"Japan is the EU's sixth largest trading partner and the EU is Japan's third largest trading partner."
"There is, however, significant untapped trade potential."
"As such, it is necessary to strengthen trade relations between the EU and Japan by focusing on the removal of non-tariff barriers to trade and investment, including numerous restrictive rules and regulatory measures for EU companies in accessing the Japanese market."
"In this way, the EU-Japan Free Trade Agreement has great potential for benefiting both economies."
"in writing. - Since the EU and Japan are close economic partners, they represent more than 20% of world trade but bilateral trade volumes are not as large as they could be."
"EU exports to Japan, as a ratio of Japan's GDP, are less than 2%, considerably below the ratio in the EU's other main markets (the US, China, Korea and India)."
"There is therefore a considerable unrealised economic potential that could be explored by reinforcing trade ties between the two blocs."
"Negotiations should implement bilateral movement."
"It is unacceptable to have unequal commodity turnover between the EU and Japan."
"I voted 'in favour'."
"Today, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on EU-Japan trade relations."
"This document highlights the fact that the European Union and Japan are very important to each other as trade partners."
"The resolution takes into account the WTO system and the fact that in 2009, for example, the EU and Japan represented together a quarter of world GDP, and that in 2010, bilateral trade between the two regions was worth EUR 120 billion."
"The resolution also emphasises that the EU is very much in favour of the conclusion of a free trade agreement with Japan, but that in order for this to happen, Japan must abolish non-tariff barriers and remove all obstacles to the development of cooperation."
"It also emphasises - and this is something that I regard as a very important feature of EU-Japan cooperation - that attention should be paid to environmental protection during the trading process, and that measures to counteract climate change and uphold environmental and social standards should be promoted."
"Furthermore, attention is drawn to the recent nuclear disaster, which is still not fully under control."
"As a result, it is not yet possible to estimate fully the extent of the crisis that has hit Japan, and there is no justification for accelerating negotiations on a free trade agreement."
"At present, Japan needs real aid."
"The rules-based multilateral trade system put in place by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) represents the most suitable framework for regulating and promoting open and fair trade, and the EU is in favour of incorporating developing countries into the international trade system."
"At the same time, bilateral agreements such as the one being analysed at present are specific mechanisms that can help achieve the mentioned objectives."
"I voted in favour of this resolution on trade relations between the EU and Japan as I am convinced that the EU-Japan Free Trade Agreement (FTA) has the potential to benefit both economies."
"Indeed, the existence of open and fair trade is a powerful tool for generating more growth and social welfare, building on the comparative advantages of each respective economy and potential synergies flowing from greater economic integration and new inputs to a knowledge-driven economy This means boosting the EU-Japan market, which, together, already represents more than a quarter of world gross domestic product (GDP) and more than 20% of world trade."
"Expresses its utmost sympathy for the courage and determination with which the Japanese people are confronting the catastrophes of 11 March and their terrible aftermath and calls on the Commission and Member States to help Japan with all means to rebuild its social and economic life; 2. Believes that the continuation and deepening of current trade relations between the EU and Japan can play an important role in this regard and calls on the Commission to concentrate all efforts on assuring this; 3."
"We support the text on EU-Japan trade relations because Japan ensures protection and respect for workers and the global economy, despite being a third country."
"Reducing and simplifying the rules and making fair, open trade simpler can only improve its relations with Europe."
"Reciprocal investment in the two economies is worth EUR 200 billion a year: the EU is Japan's third largest trading partner and, in turn, Japan is the sixth largest trading partner for the EU."
"The report also calls for an assessment of any negative impact that such decisions might entail, but we certainly think that the removal of barriers to trade and investment can only be positive."
"We therefore voted in favour of the report."
"I voted in favour of the oral question on trade relations between the EU and Japan, given that Japan is one of the main investors in the European Union."
"Apart from that, Japan is the seventh destination for European exports."
"Continuing our dialogue with Japan is an entirely positive move."
"Ironing out our differences will make an important contribution to both economies."
"In addition, we must focus on reducing tariffs and the regulatory measures which accompany them."
"I wholeheartedly support the development of trade cooperation between the European Union and Japan, which should result in the conclusion of a bilateral free trade agreement."
"The fact that in 2010, the total amount of bilateral trade between the EU and Japan was EUR 120 billion demonstrates that both sides are extremely important to each other as partners."
"Japan is the EU's sixth biggest trade partner, and the EU is Japan's third biggest."
"Both sides are also significant investors in each other's economy, with a combined volume of Foreign Direct Investment worth EUR 200 billion in 2009."
"It is also worth highlighting the fact that the rapid economic growth of developing countries (BRIC), the economic slow-down resulting from the global financial crisis, and the pressing need to gain access to raw materials and renewable sources of energy, are absolutely key challenges which are common to both parties, making negotiations an even more urgent necessity."
"In documents relating to the subject of the resolution, both the Council and the Commission have stated that a precondition for launching negotiations is that Japan should remove regulatory barriers to trade, in particular, non-tariff barriers, which place a significant restriction on access to the Japanese market for European entrepreneurs."
"I believe that we should speed up the process at the highest decision-making levels, which would result in closer trade relations between these two strategic partners."
"Japan's willingness to open bilateral talks on a free trade area with the European Union provides us with an opportunity to build closer political relations and to increase economic benefits, both for the EU and for Japan."
"In view of the fact that Japan is only the sixth largest of the European Union's trade partners, Japan's potential for cooperation with the EU in the field of trade and investment is still unexploited."
"The main obstacle making it significantly more difficult for European businesses to gain access to the Japanese market is non-tariff barriers."
"As a member of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, I am sure that the aviation industry is one of the sectors where cooperation on trade and research and development would have mutual benefits for both the European and Japanese economies."
"I believe that the aeronautics sector could become one of the models for cooperation between the EU and Japan."
"I am voting for this proposal."
"Given the scope of the threats and total EU forest area, common agricultural policy (CAP) financing through pillar 2 for forests should increase, subject to the existence of national forest programmes (NFPs) and operational management plans, which incorporate the EU biodiversity strategy and long timeframes for forestry projects in sustainable forest management (SFM)."
"Eligibility should be extended to public actors and producer groups, shifting to area-based remuneration and including in situ and ex situ conservation measures."
"Active SFM should be clearly mainstreamed and prioritised in research and practice, and should also take into account public ownership of 40% of EU forests."
"Species conservation and nursery practices should extend to associated microbial and fungal species."
"In situ research into mycorhizal symbiosis should be actively encouraged."
"Payments for ecosystem services (PES) should be formalised in view of the next financial perspectives, building on the success of forest and water projects."
"Forest adaptation and resilience should be given special consideration in the creation of an EU-adaptation fund."
"I voted in favour of this resolution on the Commission Green Paper on forest protection and information in the EU: preparing forests for climate change."
"The European Parliament approved the provisions set out in this Green Paper, but the EU's strategy on forests should be strengthened, the objective being to improve the management and conservation of forests."
"This strategy should be directed towards both forest protection and the sustainable use of timber resources, as forests provide solutions to the problems associated with climate change."
"It should be pointed out that, in accordance with the subsidiarity principle, forest strategy should continue to be primarily a matter for the Member States, but the European Union should take action to support, coordinate and supplement forestry policy initiatives by the Member States, taking into account differing regional conditions."
"The objective of this policy is to ensure the sustainable development of forests while helping to enhance quality of life for European citizens and to promote the development of rural areas."
"Forests are the main repository of carbon and have a vital role to play in the fight against climate change."
"Forests and wooded land cover 42% of the European Union's surface."
"Forests make up biospheres which store carbon and are particularly important to environmental conservation and protection against natural disasters."
"All these aspects are vital not only to the quality of life enjoyed by European citizens, but also to agriculture and rural development."
"I would like to stress that sustainable forest management is of pivotal importance to the European Union's achievement of its climate goals and to carbon dioxide capture from the atmosphere."
"Furthermore, forest-based industries provide more than 2 million jobs, contributing to economic growth and employment."
"I voted for this report as I think that the European Union must strengthen its strategy for improving the sustainable management and conservation of forests."
"The forestry sector provides a livelihood for millions of people in the EU, among them, entrepreneurs, farmers and 16 million forest owners."
"Currently, there are 2 million people employed by the forestry sector in the EU, mostly in small and medium-sized enterprises, and the sector earns €300 billion per year."
"It is estimated that there are 16 000 people employed by the forestry sector in Ireland alone."
"The forestry industries contribute to economic growth, they create opportunities for growth and employment in rural areas, and they encourage rural development through local industries and tourism opportunities."
"Forests are a valuable resource for the agricultural sector, the environment and biodiversity, especially in terms of the ecosystems they contain and in terms of soil fertility and protection against soil erosion."
"There are significant development opportunities associated with the European forestry sector in terms of carbon capture and CO2 pools."
"I welcome what the report says about recognising the importance of forestry in socio-economic and environmental terms and the request to the Commission to adopt a coherent approach to help the sector achieve its full potential."
"I voted in favour of this report."
"Forests and wooded land cover more than 42% of the EU's surface."
"Forest-based industries, with a turnover of more than EUR 300 billion, provide more than 2 million, mostly rural, jobs, contributing to economic growth, jobs and prosperity through the provision of timber and opportunities for tourism."
"EU forests face major threats due to climate change, new pests, increasing risk of fire (particularly in the Mediterranean region), and human activity (growing energy sector demand for woody biomass), which is causing deforestation."
"I agree that the Commission and the Member States must intensify efforts to achieve the environment and quality-of-life goals of the Forest Action Plan, the implementation of which is currently lagging behind."
"The EU forestry strategy and forest action plan also need to be updated to include the climate-change dimension and wider forest protection issues."
"The challenge of successfully reconciling the forest policies of southern and northern Europe so as to have a consistent EU-wide approach is by no means easy."
"By adopting this report, however, we have stressed the need for a stronger commitment to environmental protection in forest policy."
"We have also highlighted the challenge that climate change presents to our forests."
"While I am not sure that we need a legislative initiative prohibiting building on land cleared by fires, I am in favour of discussing robust, long-term solutions to help curb this terrible phenomenon of forest fires caused by arsonists wanting to clear land for building."
"I voted on this report because it presents the European Parliament's reaction to the Green Paper published by the Commission, intended to begin public consultation on forest protection and preparing forests for climate change throughout the European Union."
"In the report, Parliament welcomes the Commission's Green Paper and calls for the EU forestry strategy to be updated, while properly taking into account the application of the subsidiarity and proportionality principles and including the climate-change dimension and broader forest protection issues."
"Parliament also reaffirms its view on the need for increased levels of funding for forest protection measures through the rural development pillar of the common agricultural policy, particularly given the new challenges entailed in climate change."
"Among other possible sources of financing, the report also proposes considering the possibility of paying companies for ecosystem services, through which they contribute to biodiversity conservation and forest protection."
"Among many other measures, such as strengthening coordination at EU level and information exchange between Member States, the Commission is also urged to consider submitting a legislative proposal prohibiting building on land cleared by fires proven to have resulted from arson."
"The Forest Action Plan adopted in 2006 set four important objectives."
"However, not enough attention has been given to them equally, as indicated by mid-term evaluations of its implementation."
"The major shortcomings concern enhancing protection and biodiversity conservation and indicate that 66% of forest habitats have an unfavourable status."
"In practical terms, the conclusions show that, while attention has been focused on improving long-term competitiveness, the objectives of improving the environment, enhancing quality of life and promoting coordination and communication have not been implemented strongly enough."
"Forests provide livelihoods for millions of workers, entrepreneurs and 16 million forest owners."
"The forest-based industries in the EU provide more than 2 million jobs, mostly in SMEs, and have a EUR 300 billion turnover."
"There are also more than 350 000 people employed in forest management."
"From this perspective, it is important to pursue the objectives set out in the forestry strategies."
"This fact, combined with climate change, provides sufficient grounds for mobilising all EU Member States and making equal, consistent efforts to manage the Union's forests."
"This action must be backed up with adaptations to the energy, industry, commercial, research and cohesion policies, including regional policy and the Solidarity Fund."
"Europe's large wooded areas create considerable business and employment within the EU."
"Taking this into account, and not forgetting the importance of these green spaces for the environment, I consider it essential that measures be taken to combat the negative effects of climate change recorded at global level in recent years."
"This is crucial in order to safeguard European forests, with all the benefits that will bring."
"As such, I welcome the Commission's initiative in the form of a Green Paper on forest protection."
"In order to act effectively, it is necessary to have an understanding of the harm that our forests have suffered lately due to the new global climate situation, principally with regard to storms, increased fire-risk levels, pests and fungal diseases."
"Forests and wooded land cover more than 42% of the EU's area."
"Despite the fact that approximately 500 000 hectares of EU forest are lost every year as a result of forest fires and illegal logging, the long-term trend of increasing forest coverage in the EU appears stable."
"Even though forestry policy is primarily a matter for the Member States, it is nevertheless up to the EU to coordinate and complement the Member States' initiatives and forest programmes, giving them added value, and defining a common EU strategy and action plan."
"Stepping up forest protection should form part of the EU's and the Member States' strategies, especially in the face of climate-related extreme phenomena such as fires and floods, landslides and desertification."
"I therefore support the creation of new instruments and increased funding for measures designed to protect the EU's forests, particularly in order to address the new challenges brought about by climate change."
"Information on forest resources, the state of the forests and the impact of climate change is equally essential in order to ensure that any decisions made relating to the forests bring about the greatest possible socio-economic and environmental benefits."
"The economic, social and environmental importance of forests at an international, European, regional and national level is generally well known and legitimised, to some extent, in international agreements and relevant cooperation and financing programmes."
"Climate change has a huge impact on forests in every region of Europe, but with varying intensity."
"Any reform made to the approach of European Union policies to forests must not simply be reduced to the challenges posed by climate change, but take into account all the aspects relating to forests' contribution to sustainable development at regional, European and global level."
"Another aspect concerns the instruments and schemes at EU level supporting the forestry sector, which are very lightweight compared with those applied in other business sectors and given the current and future contribution made by forests to achieving the sustainable development targets."
"However, any reform made to the approach of European Union policies to forests must not simply be reduced to the challenges posed by climate change, but take into account all the aspects relating to forests' contribution to the sustainable development of the environment, the rural economy, etc. at regional, European and global level."
"The Arsenis report demonstrates the European Parliament's concern for forestry policy."
"Its content stresses the need to plan, for the future, sufficient and ambitious financial resources for the forest and the timber industry."
"I therefore support the adoption of this text and, at the same time, renew my support for the adoption of a specific financial instrument to protect the Union's forests."
"More than 42% of the territory of the Union is covered by forest."
"The timber industry provides a total of 2 million jobs, mainly in SMEs, and creates revenue of EUR 300 billion."
"Forest management employs 350 000 people."
"The ratio of felling to increment is stable throughout the Union, and is in the region of 60%, but this ratio is projected to increase to more than 100% in some countries, with, as a result, a reduction in standing timber after 2010."
"I am convinced that the sustainable management of forests is essential if we are to maintain the capacity of the Union's forests to fulfil their economic, ecological and social functions."
"That is why I have called on the Commission to put forward proposals aimed at supplementing Regulation (EU) No 995/2010 on timber in order to ensure that timber and products derived from such timber placed on the European market all come from sustainably managed forests."
"The Commission and the Member States must make the introduction of sustainable forest management mandatory within the European Union"
"I voted in favour of the report on 'preparing forests for climate change'."
"In view of forests' potential for climate change mitigation and adaptation, as well as their economic, social and environmental value, there is a need to strengthen EU policy in the area of sustainable development and forest conservation, in particular, legislation on forest fire-risk prevention and management."
"Forests and wooded land currently cover more than 42% of the EU's area."
"Forests provide 2 million jobs, many in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and a turnover of EUR 300 billion."
"These figures reflect a fundamental need for effective European policy on forests, and on their use and sustainability, not only in environmental terms, but also as a key economic resource."
"When discussing the protection of forests as an economic and environmental resource, I cannot forget, being Portuguese, that combating forest fires - something from which my country has greatly suffered - must be an absolute priority for any European policy in this area."
"As far as national forest programmes (NFPs) are concerned, while I fully support their establishment, I would draw attention to their shortcomings."
"NFPs must become a reality and actually reach the forests so that they can be truly as effective as we intend for them to be."
"This report deals with the Commission Green Paper on forest protection and information in the EU: preparing forests for climate change."
"Forests and wooded land currently cover more than 42% of the EU's area and constitute an important source of revenue, generating more than EUR 300 billion a year and providing more than 2 million jobs."
"On top of this, forests are essential for all of us and are part of our identity."
"In recent times, we have witnessed disasters and storms threatening forests."
"Without forests, the consequences of climate change would be even more serious."
"However, despite their importance, they have not been granted the financial investment that they merit."
"I welcome the adoption of this report, which draws attention to the neglect the sector has suffered and calls for recognition and appreciation of the diversity of species existing in the EU, as well as of the need to implement a modern and active forestry policy that is able to take advantage of the area of biomass and of carbon credits, as well as of traditional activities."
"Forests and wooded land currently cover more than 42% of the EU's area, providing a means of subsistence for millions of workers."
"The conservation of forest heritage represents an important contribution to the welfare of populations, as well as contributing to job creation in rural areas."
"It is inseparable from preventing forest fires: disasters which decimate extensive areas of forest annually in southern Europe, particularly in Portugal."
"It is crucial to follow up on the recommendations on natural disaster prevention recently adopted here."
"The report takes a wide-ranging approach to the forestry issue, focusing on certain aspects which we believe to be important."
"However, it is essential to put theory into practice, especially when it comes to mobilising enough financial resources through Union support programmes and measures to enable the monitoring of forests' ecological and phytosanitary state and, wherever necessary, their reclassification, including reforestation."
"It is also essential to provide Natura 2000 with the financial means for its management and the effective pursuit of its objectives, bearing in mind that many forest areas are covered by it."
"It is also essential to recognise the diversity of forest ecosystems in Europe and the multifunctionality of many of them, such as, for example, the Mediterranean's montado agro-forestry pastures."
"This report takes a wide-ranging approach to the forestry issue, focusing on certain aspects which we believe to be important."
"However, it is essential to put theory into practice, especially when it comes to mobilising enough financial resources through Union support programmes and measures to enable the monitoring of forests' ecological and phytosanitary state and, wherever necessary, their reclassification, including reforestation."

"in writing. - Forests and other wooded land account for more than 42% of EU territory, providing a livelihood to millions of workers and entrepreneurs and 16 million forest owners."
"Forest sector industries provide more than 2 million jobs, and forestry employs 350 000 people."
"Among the common policies with an impact on forest protection are environmental policy, energy, industry and trade policies, as well as policy coherence, including regional policy and the Solidarity Fund."
"Given the scale of the threats and the total area of forests in the EU, the financing should increase, eligibility to receive assistance should be extended to public bodies and producer groups, and contributions should be paid on an area basis and should cover protective measures."
"Last week in Ireland, forest fires - on a scale not seen for a long time - caused severe destruction on lands in Donegal, Sligo and other regions of the country."
"It is for local authorities, with support from the national government, to take responsibility for such events."
"This is a question of subsidiarity."
"In relation to the fires which occurred in Ireland recently, the Irish Government must make a full estimate of the damage done with a view to assisting those affected."
"An emergency plan, like the one already in place for road accidents and flooding, must be put in place for forest fires with a view to ensuring a better response to such situations in future."
"In conclusion, more funding must be given to Donegal County Council to pay the exceptional costs that will be involved."
"Forty-two per cent of the entire area of the European Union is covered in forests and woodland."
"Forestry industries generate revenues in excess of EUR 300 billion, and provide work for approximately two million people."
"These are the figures that we must bear in mind in order to understand the importance of a European strategy for sustainable forestry management and in order to protect this significant European heritage more effectively."
"We must remember the important role that forests play in terms of socio-economic services as well as their crucial role in the fight against climate change."
"It is therefore urgent that we improve our ability to prevent forest fires, as these continue to destroy more than 400 000 hectares of forest every year."
"In order to do this, it is important to improve the collection of information about forests, increase research, and especially to encourage Member States to exchange knowledge and experience, starting from a cross-border perspective."
"At this point, I would like to underline the importance of the work carried out by the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS) and, in particular, the importance of the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) programme which allows the necessary charting and surveillance of forests."
"The European Parliament has sent out a strong political message to stress the importance of managing forests sustainably."
"There is an urgent need to introduce the recommendations relating to the prevention of disasters."
"Indeed, forest fires are one of the greatest threats to European forests and their ecosystems."
"The protection of the forest against climate also helps maintain the forest industry and its competitiveness."
"With revenue of more than EUR 300 billion, the timber industry in Europe provides more than 2 million jobs and is an important pool for growth."
"Finally, it is vital for debates on the future of the common agricultural policy after 2013 to take account of the role played by forests."
"Rural producers and public bodies must qualify for forestry measures under the second pillar of the CAP: the EU must support forest planting within the framework of national programmes for rural development."
"The specification of a European forest protection strategy is part of the EU's overall commitment to the fight against climate change."
"Particularly positive points in the report that has been approved are the proposal for a specific regulation on the prohibiting of building on land cleared by fires proven to have resulted from arson, and the request for suitable funding for forestry strategies, which is currently at a very low level."
"Finally, the request for appropriate sustainability criteria for biomass produced for the use of energy is also important."
"We therefore urge the European Commission to continue along this route, by presenting a White Paper on forest protection to deal with these issues."
"I endorsed this document because EU forests and other wooded land account for more than 42% of the EU's surface."
"Forests provide livelihoods for millions of workers, entrepreneurs and 16 million forest owners."
"The forest-based industries (FBIs) provide more than 2 million jobs, mostly in SMEs."
"350 000 people are employed in forest management."
"The EU ratio of felling to increment is stable at around 60%."
"This ratio is projected to increase in several countries to over 100%, causing a decline in growing stock after 2020."
"European forests and forestry are governed by a variety of regional and national models, grouped according to their productive or protective orientation."
"Forests provide both resources and ecosystem functions."
"There are proposals to draft obligatory programmes."
"Assistance must also be allocated in a targeted manner, i.e. linked to climate change."
"The proposals include increasing competitiveness in the long-term, improving and preserving the environment, improving quality of life, and promoting coordination and communications."
"We must make every possible effort to ensure that we safeguard and use this resource sustainably so that our future generations can also exploit it, and we should also contribute to reducing environmental pollution."
"The forests and the forestry industry are already making a significant contribution to the production of local raw materials."
"The forests are also a recreational area for many of the citizens of Europe and play an important role in preventing climate change."
"Hardly any other area has such closely interlinked environmental, economic and social functions."
"However, there are some enormous challenges facing our forests."
"One of the most important of these is climate change."
"It is the job of the Member States, with the support of the European Commission, to protect and develop our forests for future generations so that they can continue making a contribution in future to our natural habitats, our society and our economy."
"This includes ensuring that the forests play a permanent and growing role in combating climate change and safeguarding the economic basis of the forestry and timber industries, so that we have an adequate future supply of wood."
"in writing. - Today, it was an easy task to vote for the report on forest protection and information in the EU: preparing forests for climate change."
"The EU forests are now facing more pressure than ever before, not necessarily because of climate change, but rather because of some of the decisions made in the EU to combat it."
"The fact that we now have requested within this report legally binding sustainability criteria on energy-creating biomass is an important initiative."
"The EU biofuel legislation, along with legislation for renewables, has driven our forest use in an unsustainable direction."
"If we consider forests solely as a source of renewable energy, we totally have missed the point of combining sustainable industry and environment protection."
"Forests are an important source of livelihood and well-being within our borders."
"Therefore, this valuable natural source should be used for production rather than short-sighted energy."
"One should also remember that the wood products themselves tie carbon during their whole life cycle."
"Therefore, we should avoid any corner-cutting in trying to reach our renewable goals."
"The European forestry industry is more sustainable than almost any other sector of the economy."
"For generations, the owners of European forests have complied with the strictest legislation on forests and nature conservation."
"However, the report submitted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety relating to the Green Paper on forest protection and information introduces a rising tide of regulation, without acknowledging the importance of the forests as a job creator and an economic engine."
"The report calls for excessive sustainability criteria to be applied to forest management within the EU, without taking into consideration regional factors and the powers of the individual countries."
"The main points which exceed the authority of national forestry policy and weaken the forests in economic terms are the provisions concerning timber supplies within Europe."
"Also, the concept of 'sustainability' has still not been defined."
"Another point which I am opposed to is the implication that woody biomass is not sustainable."
"I believe that we should highlight the variety of protective and useful functions provided by the forests and not take a one-sided approach."
"The EU should make a greater effort to ensure that sustainable forest management is put into practice in Europe and that we act as a model for other countries."
"Due to the significant contribution forests make in tackling the climate crisis, sustainable forestry management is of major importance to ensuring that the EU achieves its climate objectives."
"The EU must enhance its strategy for combating the factors causing deterioration of the forests, such as uncontrolled deforestation, fires and air pollution."
"At the same time, biodiversity conservation, protection against natural disasters and CO2 capture from the atmosphere are crucial to improving our citizens' quality of life and to preserving the environment."
"I therefore think that protection of the forests in the EU must be aimed at providing a guarantee that forests will fulfil their productive, socio-economic and ecological functions in the future, too."
"in writing. - I voted for this important report."
"EU forests and other wooded land cover more than 42% of the EU's surface area."
"Forests provide livelihoods for millions of workers, entrepreneurs and 16 million forest owners."
"The forest-based industries (FBIs) provide more than 2 million jobs, mostly in SMEs, and have a EUR 300 billion turnover."
"350 000 people are employed in forest management."
"In addition, 40% of EU forests are state-owned."
"The EU ratio of felling to increment is stable at around 60%."
"This ratio is projected to increase in several countries to over 100%, causing a decline in growing stock after 2020."
"Measures to protect forests are vital."
"European forests can be grouped in five bioclimatic zones: the Boreal, Temperate Oceanic, Temperate Continental, Mediterranean and Mountain zones (5), compatible with the EEA's forest typology, developed to guide policy decisions (6)."
"I voted in favour of the report on the Commission's Green Paper entitled 'On forest protection and information in the EU: preparing forests for climate change'."
"Forests should be thought of as fundamental to combating climate change."
"Crucially, the European Union must step up its strategy to combat those phenomena which harm the forest, such as forest fires and atmospheric pollution."
"The capacity of the forest to recover from these threats and resume its normal development in the face of the impact of climate change depends on biodiversity, not just of trees, but also of all the other organisms that live in the forest, particularly wild animals."
"Consequently, those wild species that naturally colonise these special habitats that the forest provides merit particular attention from forest owners as they contribute to preserving biodiversity."
"The preservation of the forest is crucial to the interests of the whole of humankind."
"It is indeed a pity that it once more serves as a pretext for promoting the carbon market."
"European green capitalism is at a dead end."
"Capitalism and ecology are mutually incompatible."
"Forests and wooded land currently cover more than 42% of the EU's surface and are an industry which provides approximately 2 million jobs, with an annual turnover of EUR 300 billion."
"These numbers reflect a need for European policy on forests to make them sustainable, both in environmental and economic terms."
"Only in this way is it possible to protect them from the dangers they face, namely fires, which are the principle reason for their destruction."
"This is especially the case in southern European countries and, in particular, my country, Portugal, which loses thousands of hectares of forests every year to fires."
"Climate change and forests are inextricably bound up with each other."
"In the fight against climate change, it is crucial to protect the forest."
"Better use can be made of the forest in this fight, not only through preventing felling, but also through afforestation and reforestation programmes."
"Climate change means that every type of forest and the forestry sector as a whole are exposed to specific and unforeseeable threats such as storms, drought and forest fires."
"It is therefore vital that the European Union steps up its strategy for combating these phenomena."
"Sustainable forest management must aim to reconcile aspects relating to production and those relating to forest protection."
"We must manage forests sustainably if we are to maintain their capacity to fulfil their economic, ecological and social functions."
"Crucially, we must pay greater attention to the maintenance, balance and enhancement of the services rendered by the forest."
"The preservation of biodiversity must be a priority for our political action."
"in writing. - It is known that the report stresses the fact that forests should be seen as a major contributor to climate change mitigation and adaptation, rendering necessary the reinforcement of the EU strategy for combating the factors causing their deterioration, e.g. pests, forest fires, etc. Moreover, the report focused on establishing a general context concerning forest protection, namely subsidiarity, diversity of threats according to different forest types, the central role of Sustainable Forest Management and the importance of forests for competitiveness and employment."
"I voted 'in favour'."
"Dying forests throughout Europe represent both an environmental problem, in terms of natural habitats and climate change, and an economic problem."
"The 5 million people who work in the forests and the 16 million forest owners produce an annual turnover of EUR 300 billion."
"Current environmental conditions are responsible for bringing about changes in European forests."
"We have to expect that in the long term beech trees will disappear completely in the Mediterranean region and that coniferous forests will decrease in area throughout continental Europe."
"Other factors include new forms of pest attacks whose impact cannot yet be assessed and a significant increase in the risk of forest fires."
"ICP Forests and the EU operate one of the world's largest biomonitoring networks with the aim of quantifying these changes and helping to understand the cause and effect relationships."
"I have abstained from voting because in my opinion, the measures proposed in the report relating to the extent to which the individual Member States will be held responsible and will be involved do not go far enough."
"I voted against a part of paragraph 36 because the provision it contains is, to say the least, unrealistic."
"I do not think that we should ban construction on forest land which has been affected by fire because it is actually impossible for this land to be used for other purposes."
"I do not think that we should present cases of abuse as the general rule and harm the property rights of the forests' owners who have already been affected by a forest fire."
"However, I find acceptable the idea expressed in paragraph 37, which proposes imposing a ban where a fire is proven to have been started deliberately."
"However, in this situation, I think that we may be faced with the adverse consequences which would result from this: the arsonist is not necessarily the property owner and I do not understand why the latter ought to be punished."
"The Commission Green Paper report entitled 'Forest protection and information in the EU: preparing forests for climate change' presents European Parliament's concerns on the matter."
"Forests and wooded land currently cover more than 42% of the EU's surface and there are more than 16 million forest owners."
"Forests provide 2 million jobs, many in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and represent an annual turnover of EUR 300 billion."
"On top of this, they have an essential role in combating climate change due to their capacity to absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen."
"These figures reveal the importance of forests for all EU Member States, but particularly for Portugal, which has forests with very specific characteristics and plays an important role in regional planning and combating forest fires."
"I voted in favour of this report since it advocates measures that I think contribute to combating forest destruction, especially fires, pests, forest fragmentation, changes in species composition and an increased demand for woody biomass."
"in writing. - I welcome the Commission's Green Paper on forest protection and information in the EU."
"Since forests are the main absorber of carbon, sustainable forest management is key to achieving the EU's climate change goals."
"We need to bring protection and production together in the management of our forests in order to ensure the viability of their environmental, social and economic functions."
"The EU has a role to play in promoting best management practice that suits the needs of local actors and communities, and in incentivising forestation efforts compatible with local conditions and native species."
"I voted in favour of this report since I consider it absolutely essential to strengthen European policies on the conservation and sustainable management of forests, whose incalculable economic, social and environmental value it is important to preserve."
"I have voted against paragraph 36 (split 2) and against paragraph 37, because issues of environmental planning come under regional or national authority, which means that decisions in these areas must be made by regional or national parliaments."
"In my opinion, any intervention on an EU level would be an intervention in subsidiarity and would therefore go too far."
"It goes without saying that forest protection is a key environmental issue."
"Forests, when they are well maintained, provide the main carbon sink and play a vital role in combating climate change."
"If they are not, and are subjected to intensive deforestation, they would produce 25% of all CO2 emissions, a greenhouse gas caused by human activity."
"In other words, the European Union, including Sweden and Finland, which together account for 33% of Europe's forest, and also the Mediterranean countries, have every interest in stepping up their strategy to combat threats to the forest, such as atmospheric pollution and forest fires."
"In this respect, I am delighted that, as part of the vote on the Green Paper entitled 'Preparing forests for climate change', paragraph 38 of the Arsenis report has been adopted, which 'urgently calls on the Commission to present a legislative proposal on forest fire prevention' and plans, in particular, 'a 30-year ban on building on land where there has been a forest fire'."
"This is a good way of countering the widespread practice of using forest fires to promote the interests of property developers."
"in writing. - This is a good report with good proposals, which include recognising the generally positive trend in terms of carbon storage in forests in Europe, but also the fact that carbon storage still remains far below natural capacity, and that the forest sector could reverse to a source, due to pressures; calling for Commission proposals to complement the Timber Regulation, in order to ensure that all timber or timber products placed on the European market are sourced from sustainably managed forests; urging the Commission to study options for payment for ecosystem services; and calling for a legislative proposal on forest fire prevention, including consideration of a 30-year ban on building on land where there has been a forest fire."
"I am in favour of the report because forests, which cover more than 42% of the EU's surface area, provide a livelihood for many workers and businesses in the forestry sector."
"A framework of Commission guidelines should be established; binding sustainability criteria should be introduced, including mandatory national forestry programmes; payment for ecosystem services should be formalised; and forest protection policies should be strengthened by reintroducing the fire prevention regulation."
"It is particularly worthwhile and striking that the amendment to prevent speculative building on land cleared illegally by fire was adopted."
"There is already such a rule in Italy, prohibiting building on land destroyed by arson."
"in writing. - Forests provide us with many essential eco-services, ranging from regulating the water cycle to preventing soil erosion and sequestering carbon."
"The environmental and economic benefits of forests require that they be afforded urgent, continuing and long-term protection, and this is especially important in the context of climate change, in terms of both mitigation and adaptation."
"This report covers a wide range of issues and is the result of much hard work and fruitful negotiation involving all the main political groups."
"I sincerely hope the Commission and the Member States will act on its constructive suggestions."
"I welcome the adoption of this report on the Green Paper on forests presented by the Commission."
"Forests are part of our countryside and our heritage and are crucial to our well-being."
"At a time when threats are becoming increasingly serious, it is vital for us to protect these exceptional natural resources better."
"We are, indeed, all aware of the consequences of climate change on forests, yet our inertia in finding solutions to them is putting their preservation in serious danger."
"It is our duty to preserve these fragile ecosystems, this inestimable biodiversity and this strategic sector of the economy."
"I am therefore pleased at the strong political message that Parliament has sent in this, the International Year of Forests."
"We cannot adopt a wait-and-see approach to the measures that have to be taken to adapt to climate change."
"We also need to strengthen the European Forest Fire Tactical Reserve, given that in this area, prevention is just as important as reaction."
"If we are to preserve our forests as we know and love them, we must be at the forefront of the fight to ensure sustainable management of forest areas and to protect them from the threats that hang over them."
"I am voting for this proposal, given that the report has achieved a balanced approach between the most important issues for the organisation and the activities of the European External Action Service, and for the key areas of security and defence policy."
"This balance has been achieved through military and civilian cooperation on the resolution of collaborations between the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO)."
"I believe that the proposed amendments, tabled by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, and adopted in committee, contribute to a more inclusive definition, encompassing freedom of religion and an extension of the list of minorities in need of international protection."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of the resolution on the EP's annual report on the CFSP."
"It gives an overview of the strategic role that the EU should play outside its borders, in particular, as regards the contribution to the development of democracy and respect for human rights."
"With this resolution, the European Parliament reaffirms its prerogatives: key player and holder of the function of management and budgetary control of European civilian and military missions."
"We, Members of the European Parliament, once again stressed our main objective of a strong and decisive Parliament in foreign policy, particularly now having in mind the provisions of the Lisbon Treaty."
"Also important is the EU multilateralism issue and the need to be always well represented in the different strategic contexts, taking advantage, in particular, of the new EEAS, the European diplomatic corps that has finally become a reality."
"The reports on the CFSP of the EU and its role on the international stage, which was supported by the main coalition of the political representatives of capital in the European Parliament, namely the conservatives, social democrats and liberals, illustrate its acutely reactionary character and anti-grassroots role."
"Moreover, we must not forget that the European Parliament passed a resolution putting it at the vanguard of and seeking to legalise the war being waged against Libya by the EU, the USA and NATO, in order to plunder the wealth-producing sources of that country and control developments in the area as a whole, in the midst of serious imperialist infighting."
"The political staff of the bourgeois classes in the European Parliament are demanding the strengthening of the imperialist character of the EU, its further militarisation and the development of its military capabilities and those of the Euro Army, especially 'flexible' battlegroups and rapid reaction forces, such as those being prepared with EUFOR Libya for land operations in Libya, in which Greece is heavily involved as leader of the Balkan battlegroup."
"They are promoting the strategic alliance between the EU and NATO and laying plans for imperialist interventions and wars by the EU in all corners of the planet on the pretext of 'crisis management', 'humanitarian aid' and 'the fight against terrorism', with priority being given to securing positions in the infighting between the imperialists raging in North Africa and the Middle East in general."
"in writing. - I voted to oppose the measures in this report relating to the Mercosur Trade deal."
"The Mercosur Trade deal has the potential to seriously undermine European agriculture and the work of European farmers in delivering public goods and high quality, safe food."
"A quota of the size demanded by Mercosur would completely undermine Ireland's beef production."
"It is estimated that an EU/Mercosur deal could reduce Irish beef prices by 30% which would inflict losses of up to EUR 500 million in Ireland alone."
"The Irish agri-food sector accounts for 60% of exports from Irish-owned companies, valued at EUR 8 billion per year, and provides up to 250 000 jobs."
"This deal would result in major job losses at farm and industry level across rural areas in Ireland and the EU as a whole."
"I voted in favour of this report."
"The Treaty of Lisbon gave the EU great powers, with which the EU should further develop its foreign policy objectives and defend its interests worldwide with the overall aim of contributing to peace, security, solidarity, conflict prevention, the promotion of democracy, the protection of human rights, respect for international law, etc. The EU must also act more strategically in order to bring its weight to bear internationally."
"The EU's ability to influence the international order depends not only on coherence between its policies, actors and institutions, but also on a strategic concept of EU foreign policy which must unite all Member States behind the same set of priorities and goals, so that they speak with one strong voice in the international arena."
"While supporting the annual report from the Council to the European Parliament on the main aspects and basic choices of the common foreign and security policy (CFSP), which is one of the European Union's key policies, I wish to express my endorsement of the policy which the European Union is conducting at a global level."
"Our adoption of this annual report reflects the strong position and role of the European Union in the field of international relations."
"The Albertini report contains ideas that I agree with, but there is an underlying problem."
"The basic assumption is that the EU should gradually take a predominant position in foreign and defence policy over the individual national governments."
"That means that the Member States would have to give up further large portions of sovereignty over foreign policy to EU bodies, which would be charged with reaching a common position to be presented in the international community and in all multilateral forums."
"I cannot agree with this prospect: the Member States would no longer be able to establish their own foreign policies on the basis of what they deem to be national priorities."
"We agree that in certain contexts, the EU must strive to speak with a single voice in order to be stronger on the global stage and to represent the desires that are common to all its Member States, but that cannot come about at the cost of the Member States' freedom to draw up their own foreign policies."
"Moreover, the report calls on the EU to renew the momentum in Turkey's EU accession process, a point on which I have never been in agreement at all."
"Turkey must stay out of our organisation, because it is not and never will be Europe."
"I voted against the report."
"I voted in favour of this report because the Council's annual report provides a consistent overview of the direction and actions of the common foreign and security policy (CFSP)."
"It is very important for the Council to continue to focus, above all, on regional conflicts and react to them swiftly."
"However, the Council's report does not contain any possible approaches to resolving those conflicts and issues."
"The Council should seek to ensure that the report is more than just a catalogue of country-based events and developments."
"Thus, this document should also address the issue of the implementation and safeguarding of EU foreign policy and instruments."
"In addition, the Council should also include in the report evaluations of coordination and coherence between the CFSP and other external policies of the Union, as well as strategic and organisational recommendations for the future on the basis of the assessment of CFSP actions."
"I would like to draw attention to the fact that the annual report on the CFSP should serve as an instrument for enhanced interinstitutional dialogue in order to evaluate its effectiveness and outline the future direction of this policy."
"I welcome the Council's annual report and the efforts made to develop a European foreign policy."
"I consider it of the utmost importance to adopt a position which is harmonious with the Member States' foreign policies, since such cohesion will lead to peace, security, solidarity and conflict prevention at international level."
"It will also lead to sustainable development and increase the EU's capacity to influence the international order."
"I therefore urge the continuation of the work already under way to form a united front which will improve relations between Europe and other world powers, promote a more effective response in situations of international crisis, and improve Europe's standing on the world stage."
"I did not vote in favour of paragraph 85 of the Albertini report which welcomes the resumption of the negotiations on an association agreement with Mercosur."
"Such an agreement, which is intended to promote free trade, should be entered into with great caution so as not to destabilise agriculture in the Community still further."
"Mercosur products are not required to meet the same environmental and social standards as their European counterparts - conditions under which there is a real risk of unfair competition."
"We must ensure that we avoid such a situation."
"I voted in favour of this report as the Council's annual report provides a clear view of the policies and actions of the EU's common foreign and security policy (CFSP) and contributes to strengthening interinstitutional dialogue."
"This year's report is similar in structure to the 2009 common foreign and security policy (CFSP) report."
"A special section is dedicated to the implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"As before, there is a demand for further dialogue with the Council on the principal objectives of the CFSP."
"I endorse the rapporteur's emphasis on the need to move from a mere description of CFSP activities towards a dialogue with a strategic approach."
"The rapporteur also urges the Council to consider the positions of Parliament when reaching decisions."
"I believe further discussion of the strategic framework of the Union's foreign policy is necessary, as well as a deeper knowledge of the scope of the CFSP and the mechanisms for its establishment, which should be made available to the various political players."
"The high number of amendments tabled is representative of Members' increasing interest in these matters."
"This report is on the annual report from the Council to the European Parliament on the main aspects and basic choices of the common foreign and security policy (CFSP) in 2009, presented to the European Parliament in application of Part II, Section G, paragraph 43 of the interinstitutional agreement of 17 May 2006."
"It is a report based on the new institutional framework established by the Treaty of Lisbon and, in accordance with its restructuring, presents more transparently the EU's CFSP."
"It addresses the situation in various parts of the world where regions and countries are in crisis, like the Western Balkans, countries neighbouring Eastern Europe, Central Asia, Russia, Turkey, the Middle East, the Mediterranean region, Asia, Africa and Latin America."
"Whilst I acknowledge that it could be improved, particularly by detailing events by country, describing the necessary means for achieving EU foreign policy objectives and by making a more qualitative assessment of this policy, which includes strategic and organisational recommendations for the future, I welcome the drafting of this report and hope that the EU continues to develop an effective multilateralism that is one of the hallmarks of the geostrategic concerns of the EU."
"This is yet another report supporting the development of the European Union's common foreign, security and defence policy."
"The arguments are repeated here fastidiously."
"As such, we would like to reiterate our opposition to it, with the arguments to back this up: we are talking about the defence, through various means including soldiers and diplomats, of the European powers' economic and geostrategic interests, in collaboration with the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO)."
"We must remember the track record of these institutions and their tragic consequences: Iraq, Afghanistan, the Balkans and Libya, and other countries that are also on the list."
"Development cooperation and aid policy, which, in the current international context, should constitute one of the principal pillars, if not the principal pillar, of a foreign and security policy, is relegated to an extremely secondary role."
"There is also the typical and tedious hypocritical stance protecting the economic interests of European arms manufacturers, who have made millions by selling arms to dictators who have used them to massacre both their own people and those of neighbouring states."
"These and other matters are still not being met with the response that they need: the necessary rectification of the policies backing them up."
"The support given to Israel's policies of aggression and occupation and to the policy of non-compliance with United Nations resolutions, as practised by Israel and other countries like Morocco, are other factors that we also denounce here."
"This is yet another report which essentially reaffirms support for the development of the European Union's common foreign, security and defence policies."
"These are principally policies in defence of the economic and geostrategic interests of the European powers."
"They are increasingly aligned with the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), putting development cooperation and aid in second place."
"The results of this are largely catastrophic, as is clear from the cases of Afghanistan, Palestine, Iraq, Libya and other countries."
"We are also aware that there is a double standard protecting the economic interests of European arms manufacturers, which have made millions by selling arms to dictators who have subsequently used them to massacre their own people and those of neighbouring states."
"Therefore, some of the principal questions arising from this debate are left without the required response: arms deals, the expansionist and warmongering policies of Israel and the systematic non-compliance with United Nations resolutions on the Western Sahara and Palestine."
"That is why we voted against."
"in writing. - The report was adopted in the Committee on Foreign Affairs by an overwhelming majority."
"It has achieved a balanced approach to the most pressing issues concerning the organisation and activities of the European External Action Service (EEAS) and to key issues for the common foreign and security policy (CFSP), such as promotion of the values of democracy, human rights and the rule of law, promotion of gender equality and energy security, the situation in Iran and in Afghanistan, the EU response to the democratic changes in the Southern Mediterranean region, and relations with major players such as Russia, China, Japan and India."
"The report strikes a balance on civilian-military cooperation in crisis resolution and on EU-NATO interaction: on the one hand, it avoids relegating the EU exclusively to trade, development and humanitarian issues, the course pursued by the ECR Group, and, on the other, it rejects the GUE/NGL Group's insistence on excluding any military component from the CFSP."
"Mr Albertini's proposal cannot have my vote because there are too many points on which we cannot agree."
"One of these is the proposal for a uniform EU foreign policy."
"The idea is impeccable but, in view of the North African crisis this year and the ongoing Libyan crisis, it is obviously not feasible."
"There are two many fine distinctions made by different countries in the EU."
"Another point on which we cannot agree is the call to increase our efforts for Turkey to join Europe."
"That is why I will vote against the report."
"In 2009, the really crucial common foreign and security policy (CFSP) decision was the appointment of the High Representative."
"One has to admit that it was not the best decision."
"It is quite clear that Lady Ashton is more gifted at issuing moralising press releases and playing Lady Bountiful than she is cut out for dealing with the diplomatic issues that you want her to tackle on behalf of the 27 Member States."
"Thanks to the Baroness, the European Union was absent, out of synch or swimming against the tide for all key events."
"However, as usually happens in times of crisis, a handful of States took the initiative - for better or for worse - got organised and took action."
"The remainder either tagged along or complained when they were forced to give an opinion."
"In reality, the Union's foreign policy essentially involves distributing funding and engaging in trade, often in ways that are at variance with its professed political principles."
"This is only logical: diplomacy is a matter of State sovereignty."
"It is the product of each State's history, resources and economic or geopolitical interests."
"The Union's interests are neither an amalgamation nor an extension of those of the Member States."
"They are specific to the Union and often at odds with national interests."
"It is wholly unreasonable that these interests should take precedence over national interests."
"I endorsed this document because it is aimed at ensuring that national defence systems are consistent with EU defence systems, as well as coordinating strategies with the most important global actors, such as the United States, Russia, China, Turkey and the Arab countries."
"It stresses and aims to promote a moratorium on executions."
"It also indicates orientations and objectives in cooperation with other countries."
"Effective multilateralism should be the overriding strategic concern of the Union and, in this context, the EU should take a leading role in international cooperation, support international institutions, facilitate international consensus and advance global action."
"There is an urgent need to address global issues of common concern for EU citizens, such as fighting terrorism, organised crime, pandemics and climate change, cyber security, ensuring the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the eradication of poverty, ensuring energy security, the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, peaceful conflict resolution and disarmament, migration management and the promotion of human rights and civil liberties, and attention is drawn to the need for improved monitoring of EU funds in line with the European Court of Auditors Special Report No 15/2009."
"It takes the view that the EU should seize the opportunity of the adoption of NATO's new Strategic Concept in order to substantially strengthen its partnership with NATO while, at the same time, developing the EU's foreign, security and defence policies."
"I believe that an organisation-to-organisation relationship must be adopted."
"I voted in favour of adopting the annual report on the main aspects of the common foreign and security policy (CFSP) in 2009."
"It is a well-written and crucially important report, which discusses aspects of the common foreign and security policy in detail."
"I am particularly glad to see that the report includes the amendment I tabled regarding Georgia."
"My aim was to stress the significance of exerting constant and consistent political pressure on Russia to put into effect all of the provisions of the 2008 agreement, including, in particular, allowing the European Union Monitoring Mission (EUMM) to enter the occupied territories."
"I hope that Mrs Ashton, the High Representative, will take our recommendations into account."
"in writing. - I voted for this report and take the view that, in order to be consistent with the EU's own values, EU foreign policy and external action must give priority to promoting democracy and the rule of law, good governance and fair societies, given that a rule-based democratic society is the basis for upholding human rights as well as for enhancing stability."
"Reiterating the position that human rights need to be firmly mainstreamed into EU foreign policy, I believe that the new institutional structure of the EU, with particular reference to the EEAS and its dedicated department, offers an opportunity to enhance the EU's coherence and effectiveness in this area; urge the VP/HR to proactively pursue, through bilateral relations with third countries and active participation in international fora, the engagement of third countries in respecting human rights as well as to speak up against human rights abuses and not to refrain from taking adequate measures if they are violated; considering the growing grave violations of freedom of belief, call upon the Commission to conduct a thorough evaluation and to mainstream freedom of belief into the EU human rights policy."
"The Albertini report on the annual report from the Council to the European Parliament on the main aspects and basic choices of the common foreign and security policy (CFSP) in 2009 represents an important crossroads for the future of the Union's foreign policy."
"It is really important that Parliament should unanimously call on the Council not to limit the scope of the CFSP annual report to a mere description of policy activities but, as the report rightly points out, to 'make it a policy- and solution-focused tool'."
"We must also stress that 'the report should provide more than a catalogue of country-based events and developments and should also address the question of the effectiveness of the EU foreign policy as well as of the means necessary to pursue the objectives of European external action'."
"The EU should continue to develop its foreign policy objectives and promote its values and interests at international level, with the general aim of contributing to peace, to security, to solidarity, to conflict prevention, to the promotion of democracy, to the protection of human rights, to gender equality, to respect for international law, to support for international institutions, to effective multilateralism, to mutual respect between nations, to sustainable development, to free and fair trade, and to the eradication of poverty."
"These objectives will only materialise with an effective common foreign and security policy (CFSP) shared by all the EU Member States."
"As you know, I am a keen advocate of Turkey joining the EU."
"I am also convinced that Europe would benefit at least as much as Turkey from its accession."
"Turkey is fortunate in being located at the meeting of two worlds: it has one foot in the European West and one in Asia."
"Jacques Chirac said that the European Union and Turkey have a 'shared destiny'."
"Turkey's accession would prove that constructive, conciliatory, innovative and creative dialogue is possible between East and West."
"After all, Europe is already home to between 15 and 20 million Muslims."
"Turkey is a founding member of the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and of the Western European Union (WEU)."
"It has just been elected as a non-permanent member of the Security Council."
"Finally, the fact that it is part of the G20 goes to show how significant the country is and the geostrategic role that it could play in the alliance of nations."
"We need to rebuild trust between our governments and put flesh on the bones of the hopes expressed by the population and young people."
"In the coming years, we need to work to bring Turkey into the European family."
"in writing. - The report was adopted in the Committee on Foreign Affairs by an overwhelming majority where I voted 'in favour' too."
"It has achieved a balanced approach to the most pressing issues of the organisation and activities of the European External Action Service and key issues of common foreign and security policy, such as the promotion of the values of democracy, human rights and the rule of law, promotion of gender equality, energy security, the situation in Iran and Afghanistan, the EU's response to the democratic changes in the Southern Mediterranean, and relations with major players, such as Russia, China, Japan and India."
"I am a supporter of the common European foreign and defence policy, where the word 'European' is of the greatest importance."
"Europe must free itself from the USA with regard not only to its economy, but also its foreign policy."
"It must become more autonomous in order to be seen throughout the world as a strong and independent player."
"However, we have not yet identified any signs of movements in this direction."
"On the contrary, this report supports and safeguards the links with the USA, in particular, via NATO."
"Some people even believe that these links should be strengthened."
"This would have a highly counterproductive impact on the future of the EU and would make it difficult to agree on a common European approach or attitude to important issues, as the crisis in Libya has demonstrated."
"For this reason, I have voted against this report."
"EU foreign policy has seen a significant development following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"The EU needs a coherent foreign policy strategy based on the objectives and principles established in Article 21 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU)."
"EU action on the international stage is based on the principles that guided its creation, development and enlargement, with the objective of promoting the following values all over the world: 'democracy, the rule of law, the universality and indivisibility of human rights and fundamental freedoms, respect for human dignity, the principles of equality and solidarity, and respect for the principles of the United Nations Charter and international law'."
"I voted in favour of this report on the annual report from the Council to Parliament on the main aspects and basic choices of the common foreign and security policy (CFSP) in 2009, as I agree with the majority of the observations made by Parliament."
"I would stress the fact that the report does not propose possible approaches for resolving the conflicts and issues that it presents in such a transparent way."
"In view of this, I support the rapporteur's request that the Council not limit the scope of this report to a mere description of the activities of this policy, but rather transform it into a political tool that is focused on solutions."
"I voted in favour of this resolution on the grounds that the Council's 2009 annual report on the common foreign and security policy (CFSP) - whose transparency I commend - stresses the importance of the European Union continuing to develop its foreign policy objectives, and to promote its values and interests at international level, with the general aim of contributing to peace, to security, to solidarity, to conflict prevention, to the promotion of democracy, to the protection of human rights, to gender equality, to respect for international law, to support for international institutions, to effective multilateralism, to mutual respect between nations, to sustainable development, to free and fair trade, and to the eradication of poverty."
"We are now faced with the annual report on the common foreign and security policy (CFSP), this time relating to 2009."
"My vote in favour is based on the wisdom of this report, which not only embraces the innovations of the Treaty of Lisbon in matters of foreign policy and security, but also calls for greater coordination between the recently created European External Action Service, the Member States and the Commission."
"The EU must be consolidated as a strong and credible player on the international stage, and to do this, we have to move towards an unequivocal message to promote our values, such as democracy and human rights, in our foreign relations, but also in the pursuit of our interests, such as those connected with energy security."
"The terms values and interests must be compatible, not exclusive in our external action."
"Seen from a socialist point of view, the thematic and geographical recommendations of the report satisfy our principal demands."
"I believe that it is right in its concept of transatlantic relations, particularly the EU and NATO, and in underlining the need for civil and military cooperation in crisis management."
"in writing. - Three of our six amendments were adopted: the one calling for separate budget lines on common security and defence policy missions, the one calling on the Council and the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy to overcome the imbalance between civilian and military planning capabilities, and the one on the urgency of addressing water management issues in Central Asia."
"As for Syria, the S&D Group amendment was adopted, causing our amendment calling for the resignation of Assad to fall."
"In the end, the report was adopted with an overwhelming majority."
"Our group abstained."
"The report emphasises the guiding role of the European Union as an effective global actor on the international stage."
"Performing that role requires a more strategic external action and a single foreign policy uniting all the Member States."
"That seems utopian to me in view of the ongoing events in the Middle East and in the Mediterranean countries."
"I voted against the report because it seeks to limit national powers while creating new agencies and tackling new military operations, which would entail increased spending, and it also wants to give added momentum to Turkey's accession negotiations."
"This month, Lithuania is marking the seventh anniversary of EU accession."
"When we joined the EU, most Lithuanians dreamt of democracy and what Europe could give."
"Unfortunately, after seven years, few of those expectations have been met, either in Lithuania or at European level."
"Foreign policy is one of them."
"Recently a few European leaders were quick to celebrate the triumph of democracy and the death of the dictators of the Arab world - a victory of European values."
"Sadly, this is far from the truth."
"The EU's efforts to consolidate its foreign policy have not been very successful."
"The Treaty of Lisbon was supposed to help Europe find a single voice on foreign policy, but last week we saw more proof of the lack of cohesion in EU foreign policy: after Osama bin Laden was killed last Monday, the Heads of State of the EU issued no less than five different statements within 24 hours."
"If Europe wants to remain a serious player on the world stage, we must speak with one voice."
"The EU must also get its foreign policy priorities right: focusing attention on the south while neglecting our eastern borders is not a sustainable policy."
"The EU must define the broad thrust of its common foreign and security policy (CFSP) in the light of growing global instability."
"I am pleased to see that the report emphasises the need to involve Parliament in the process."
"As representatives of the interests of European citizens, we need to contribute to defining a European defence policy."
"The European Union's fundamental aims include defending peace, human rights and democracy."
"The promotion of our values must be based on an ambitious external action and diplomacy strategy."
"The Treaty of Lisbon has given the Union a voice through the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy/Vice-President of the Commission."
"Our CFSP cannot tolerate division."
"This vote is therefore a call for improved coordination between all institutions: the European External Action Service, the European Commission, the Member States and, of course, the European Parliament."
"In a changing world, our Union needs to be more than a purely economic Union."
"We have a historical obligation to make it a political Union."
"The CFSP should be one of the vehicles used to achieve that."
"This is the message that Parliament wanted to convey and I support this position."
"I voted in favour of this report."
"In order to strengthen the EU's influence at a global level and, therefore, indirectly, the influence of the individual Member States, we need the insight and the determination to ensure increased cooperation and coordination between the different levels."
"We must not put unnecessary obstacles in the path of the European External Action Service (EEAS) to enable it to live up to its founding principles."
"I have also voted in favour of the amendment, which, at the same time, calls on Baroness Ashton to make full use of her powers."
"We need the active involvement of both sides to ensure that the EEAS is a success."
"As a member of the Committee on Budgets and an advocate of the greatest possible transparency, I have, of course, also voted in favour of the amendment calling for separate budget lines for each mission."
"I support this proposal and recommend that measures be taken to remedy the difficulty of finding professionals for civilian missions, the most utilised form of intervention."
"As regards gender mainstreaming in line with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325, and to make civilian and military missions more effective, I recommend that female personnel be involved as appropriate at every level of crisis management."
"I would stress the need for women to be included in senior-level decision-making positions, regular consultations with civil society, and that capacity to work on gender issues within missions be enhanced."
"I call for the establishment of adequate public complaint procedures in the context of common security and defence policy (CSDP) missions, and call on Lady Ashton to include a detailed report on women, peace and security in the six-monthly evaluation of CSDP missions."
"I believe this would enable the experience acquired to be turned to account from a political, strategic, technical, legal and operational point of view and, in the long term, could provide a starting point for improving interventions under way and for criteria to be applied to emerging crises so as to make for the best possible balance between strategic interests and available resources."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of the resolution on the development of the common security and defence policy following the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty."
"It is important to stress that the new CSDP introduced by the Lisbon Treaty provides a firm political statement about the Union's intention to act as a force for stability in the world."
"I support the position that current economic austerity and the provisions of the Lisbon Treaty may help Member States towards smarter spending on defence by pooling and sharing a larger proportion of their defence capabilities, budget and requirements, while achieving more security for their citizens, although the reality is that the economic and financial crisis affects EU national defence budgets, programmes and force structures and, therefore, more than one year after the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, there are not yet clear signs of a post-Lisbon EU holistic approach enabling traditional procedural and institutional barriers to be overcome."
"Therefore, it is important that Member States find appropriate means for the implementation of the CSDP as the Lisbon Treaty provides a framework for upgrading cooperation on defence whilst achieving economies of scale, maintaining strategic relevance and providing security for the Union's citizens."
"At a time of economic and financial crisis, the European Union is being called upon to enhance its strategic autonomy in order to uphold its values, and protect its citizens by developing a shared vision of the main challenges and threats and by aligning its resources and capabilities to adequately respond to them."
"I think that the new provisions on the common security and defence policy introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon offer a strong political statement of the Union's intention to act as a force for stability in the world."
"They provide a clear legal framework for reinforcing its capacities to pursue its foreign and security policy through a comprehensive approach drawing upon all the instruments available to the Union and its Member States, to prevent and manage crises and conflicts, as well as to build lasting peace."
"I voted in favour of this report."
"I think that the European Union needs a strong and effective security and defence policy to prevent conflicts, protect its citizens' security and reaffirm its basic values, by making its contribution to supporting international law, the promotion of respect for human rights and democratic values throughout the whole world."
"The international system is undergoing rapid and profound change."
"This is driven by the shift of power towards emerging international actors and deepening interdependence, encompassing economic and financial problems, environmental deterioration and climate change, energy and resource scarcity, and interconnected security challenges."
"I endorsed this important report."
"In a turbulent global context, and at a time of economic and financial crisis, the EU must enhance its strategic autonomy to uphold its values, pursue its interests and protect its citizens by developing a shared vision of the main challenges and threats and by aligning its capabilities and resources to adequately respond to them, thereby contributing to the preservation of international peace and global security."
"I voted for this report as it marks an important step towards implementing the Treaty of Lisbon."
"The amendments proposed in this document will improve the flexibility of Europe's military capabilities."
"I should mention here that the diversification of threats at a global level requires the common security and defence policy to be adapted."
"Cyber attacks, illegal migration flows and terrorism are just a few of them."
"Indeed, the Union has become a preferred target of international crime."
"I should also emphasise the size of the financial resources which support this policy."
"I think that the review of the ATHENA mechanism by the Polish Presidency will solve the budget problem."
"This will help establish a simpler contribution from Member States to the shared costs of European military operations."
"The disbanding of the Western European Union and introduction of a reciprocal defence clause in the Treaty marks a step towards a common defence policy."
"When we talk about a political Europe, a hotline to Europe, or even of Europe speaking with one voice, we often forget to specify that this can only happen if we have a European defence policy in place."
"Recent events in Libya have shown just how much work remains to be done on this front."
"Given the current financial difficulties, pooling our resources is not only politically desirable, it is essential."
"Defence policy is one of the areas most jealously guarded by the Member States."
"The impression one gets from this report, or indeed from others on the same subject or on foreign policy, is that the intention is to push the European Union into ensuring that it gradually gains the upper hand over the Member States in drawing up foreign and defence policy."
"Apart from the objections that can be made to this approach on principle, I cannot understand how anyone can think that the EU can ever speak with one voice on such sensitive subjects, in which the interests of the individual Member States are very often different, if not quite openly conflicting."
"One need only look at what has happened in the case of Libya and humanitarian intervention."
"It is virtually impossible for the Member States to reach agreement and put forward a single, agreed position on events of this magnitude."
"Even if it did happen, it would necessarily be at the cost of governments' decision-making freedom and of what national politicians regard as priorities."
"I voted against the report."
"I voted in favour of this report because the European Union must continue to enhance its security strategy, uphold its values, pursue its interests, and protect its citizens, thereby contributing to the preservation of international peace and global security."
"The new provisions of the common security and defence policy (CSDP) introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon provide a clearer legal framework for reinforcing the implementation of foreign and security policy, drawing upon all the instruments available to the EU and its Member States, to prevent and manage crises and conflicts, and to build lasting peace."
"When conducting foreign and security policy, the EU must ensure consistency and coherence between the different areas of its external action and between external and internal policies."
"I would like to stress that a credible external security policy requires closer cooperation between the Member States, mutual trust and solidarity."
"I am concerned that, more than a year after the Treaty of Lisbon entered into effect, there are still no clear signs of a comprehensive EU approach to foreign and security policy, within the framework of which it would be possible to overcome the traditional procedural and institutional barriers restricting the EU's ability to act."
"I am concerned about the unwillingness of EU Member States to define a common position on the crisis in Libya, or on UN Security Council Resolution 1973 and how to implement it."
"Ideas about creating ad hoc coalitions of countries as possible substitutes for a common security and defence policy are dangerous, in my opinion, as no European state in the 21st century has a real chance of being a significant player in the area of security and defence."
"I would like to point out in this context that the Treaty of Lisbon provides the possibility of entrusting the implementation of crisis-resolution operations to a group of Member States, although only within the framework of a Council decision defining the objectives, scope and terms of their implementation."
"A common response to the developments in Libya is essential to the creation of a new and credible approach to the Neighbourhood Policy with southern countries."
"It is similarly necessary to emphasise the development and deepening of the Eastern Partnership, within the framework of which a parliamentary assembly made up of MEPs and members of the parliaments of participating states has recently begun operating."
"In this context, we should insist on a tough and principled position towards the regime of President Lukashenko in Belarus."
"in writing. - (DE) For a variety of reasons, I have voted in favour of the Gualtieri report."
"The rapporteur has worked very well together with my group."
"Many of our amendments have been turned into compromise texts."
"Out of 29 amendments tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, 21 have been included in the report."
"Finally, many of the positions which we have supported and called for form part of the report."
"I am very critical of the call for the incorporation of arms research into the common strategic framework for research and innovation."
"The proposal for the use of so-called Battlegroups in the case of natural disasters is also inappropriate."
"The extensive reference to the US Department for Homeland Security as an example of a suitable anti-terrorism policy is at best irritating."
"I take a very positive view of the extremely open and realistic assessment of the individual common security and defence policy (CSDP) missions, of the statements on women and security, on disarmament and on the human rights clause in anti-terrorism measures, and of the clear reference to the decision not to mix civilian and military operations."
"Finally, the rapporteur also covered one fundamental issue: opposition to absolute strategic autonomy as the final outcome of the CSDP."
"I consider it of the utmost importance to adopt a position in harmony with the Member States' foreign policies, since such cohesion will lead to peace, security, solidarity and conflict prevention at international level."
"It will also lead to sustainable development and increase the EU's capacity to influence the international order."
"I therefore urge the continuation of the work already under way to form a united front which will improve relations between Europe and other world powers, promote a more effective response in situations of international crisis and improve Europe's standing on the world stage."
"The Treaty of Lisbon should represent a new political model in Europe, both in terms of the need to pool the resources of Member States in order to achieve optimum results, and of working on shared strategies and operations that will also make Europe into the political union its founding fathers dreamed of years ago."
"This week, we are celebrating Europe Day, when we remember the Schuman Declaration, which spoke of a Europe which 'will be built through concrete achievements which first create a de facto solidarity'."
"At the moment, it is this solidarity that is missing, especially in the expression of a strong shared political will by all the Member States, which would not only give greater protection to our borders, but also make our economy more credible."
"The Gualtieri report clearly underlines the fact that the European armed forces are not adequate to build a common European defence system or to reach the targets for the Union's internal and external security set out in the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Without a credible military capacity, the common European security and defence policy will remain on paper and in the words of those who do not have the necessary tools to effectively implement it."
"The Treaty of Lisbon was a step forward for the EU."
"It has brought greater political and institutional involvement in relations between Member States, bringing them even closer on key foreign and domestic policies and strategies."
"I voted in favour of this report as I understand that the analysis therein is extremely relevant to the development of a common security and defence policy (CSDP)."
"The tabled document maximises the EU's role, strengthening the synergies between Member States, and between them and the EU institutions."
"The development of the CSDP is even more relevant given the current economic/financial crisis, which makes it advisable to share resources between Member States in order to effectively ensure public safety, crisis/conflict management and the establishment of lasting peace."
"It is more of an asset because of the observation of the legal structure presented, looking to clarify the institutional barriers verified in the post-Treaty of Lisbon period and trying to specify legislative solutions for any problems that are identified: 'Lisbon' requires a CSDP."
"I feel that the European public wants it."
"The new reality will be more rational, more synergistic and more European."
"The idea behind this resolution is that the common security and defence policy (CSDP), following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, envisages the Union's firm political intention to act as a force of stability in the world, with a clear legal framework for making it more able to pursue its objectives."
"Nonetheless, there are still no clear signs of a post-Lisbon approach which is holistic enough, allowing traditional procedural and institutional obstacles to be overcome, as well as allowing for the security and defence of the public and the European states."
"I hope that the current economic austerity will encourage states to spend their resources more intelligently and that they will be capable of cooperating more effectively."
"The current report evaluates the development of the common security and defence policy (CSDP) in the wake of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"It is a report based on the new institutional framework created by the Treaty of Lisbon, according to which the European Union must speak with a single voice and, based on its restructuring, present common foreign and security policy in a more transparent way."
"However, it is necessary to recognise that the EU has still not achieved a comprehensive post-Lisbon approach, able to overcome traditional procedural and institutional obstacles."
"As such, a realistic foreign policy assessment becomes crucial, including more muscular intervention by EU forces, rather than leaving military intervention solely in the hands of France and the United Kingdom."
"Whilst I recognise the need for public debate on foreign and defence policy towards setting out Parliament's future policies on this matter, I welcome the drafting of this report and hope that the EU continues to develop an effective multilateralism, which is one of the hallmarks of its geostrategic concerns."
"Some of the contents of this report are, from certain perspectives, worrying."
"In essence, it confirms many of the warnings and alerts that we made as the Treaty of Lisbon was being debated and then brought into force: an irrefutable course of EU militarisation is under way, and it is now being accelerated and intensified."
"The militarisation of the EU does not serve peace or the interests of the people."
"The transformation of the EU into a European pillar of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), as advocated by the Treaty of Lisbon, entails involvement in conflict zones at international level."
"This is within a framework of collaboration with the United States, which assumes leadership in the process of affirming an imperial hegemony and guaranteeing the control of markets and resources, some of which are becoming increasingly scarce."
"As affirmed by the proposed amendments made by the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, the military interventions, supposedly undertaken in order to stabilise certain countries or regions, are on the wrong track."
"Instead of stabilising these countries and regions, they destabilise them."
"Instead of resolving problems, they exacerbate them."
"The situation in Libya is another example of this, to add to those of Afghanistan and Iraq."
"The development of the common security and defence policy (CSDP) serves the interests of the EU's industrial-military complex, but not the interests of the people or of peace."
"As we have been warning, with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the militarisation of the European Union will be accelerated even more."
"This report consolidates this approach."
"As pointed out by the amendments tabled by our group, military intervention or any sort of military approach to conflict resolution, with the alleged aim of stabilising certain regions or countries, is the wrong track."
"Instead of resolving problems, this worsens them, as we can see in the cases of Libya, Afghanistan and Iraq."
"The militarisation of the EU is not in the interest of any of its peoples."
"The transformation, already under way, of the EU into a European pillar of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) is part of a process of dividing up the international sphere into spheres of influence, under the leadership of the United States."
"This serves to ensure greater exploitation of labour forces and control over ever scarcer natural resources, particularly hydrocarbons, as well as control of the markets."
"The development of the common security and defence policy is a threat to peace."
"It is an element which deepens political intervention, contributes to the arms race, including nuclear weapons, and promotes vast profits for the EU's industrial-military complex."
"in writing. - This report, which is in five parts - headed respectively Security and foreign policy, Security and defence, External and internal security, Security through operations and Security in partnership - provides a clear vision of how the EU should pursue its common security and defence policy in order to become an autonomous strategic player and to act as a force for security and stability in Europe and the world."
"The Libyan crisis has revealed the limitations of the European Union's external action in both diplomatic and military terms."
"At the moment, the unity of intent of which so much has been said seems to have been thwarted by the rightful aspirations of the Member States to retain their prerogatives in the area of security policy."
"I do not agree with the idea of calling for a larger budget for this policy without there being real agreement among national governments on the use of these funds."
"As I think this kind of policy should be on the list of national competences, I feel I must vote against this report."
"I endorsed this report because the international system is undergoing rapid and profound change, driven by the shift of power towards emerging international actors and deepening interdependence, encompassing economic and financial problems, environmental deterioration and climate change, energy and resource scarcity, and interconnected security challenges."
"In a turbulent global context, and at a time of economic and financial crisis, the EU is being called upon to enhance its strategic autonomy to uphold its values, pursue its interests and protect its citizens by developing a shared vision of the main challenges and threats and by aligning its capabilities and resources to adequately respond to them, thereby contributing to the preservation of international peace and global security, also by pursuing effective multilateralism."
"Enhancing strategic autonomy in security affairs entails, for the EU, the capacity to agree upon common political objectives and strategic guidelines, to establish strategic partnerships with relevant international organisations, including NATO, and with other countries, to collect adequate information and generate joint analyses and assessments, to harness and, where necessary, pool financial, civilian and military resources, to plan and run effective crisis management operations across the extended range of the Petersburg-type missions, and to frame and implement a common defence policy, laying the first tangible foundations on which to build common defence."
"It is necessary to draw upon all the instruments available to the EU and its Member States in order to prevent and manage crises and conflicts and to build lasting peace."
"I supported the report on the development of the common security and defence policy following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Nevertheless, I consider that we still have a long way to go before we arrive at a comprehensive common security and defence policy."
"It is not permissible that individual Member States should enter into transactions that threaten the security of another Member State."
"France has entered into a transaction with Russia involving warships; a Russia that, in the recent past, occupied Georgian territories in the course of hostilities."
"In the same way, Russia has conducted provocative military manoeuvres in the proximity of the Baltic States, which expressed their concern over the transaction to which I referred."
"Although the Baltic nations have repeatedly expressed their concerns, European Union officials and institutions have not responded in any way to prevent French involvement in a military transaction with Russia."
"French politicians' concerns over their economy and jobs in their shipyards are understandable."
"However, within the European Union, the growth of one nation's economy must not be achieved at the cost of another nation's security."
"This kind of action is contrary to the existing solidarity principle within the European Union."
"This principle should brook no exception, and it is applicable to both large and small nations."
"Only when Member States show true solidarity will there be a comprehensive common security and defence policy."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of the Gualtieri report."
"However, I underline once again the need for enhanced cooperation between the EU and NATO."
"My original amendment to paragraph 87 aimed to confirm, rather than merely recognise, NATO's role as the bedrock for collective defence - a role which is not just 'still continuing' but should be seen as the only option for the foreseeable future."
"In addition, NATO's role cannot be deemed to concern only its Member States, as the Gualtieri report states: it creates security for the EU's non-NATO members too."
"NATO has been, and is going to be, the foundation of collective defence, so that has to be stated in strong, affirmative language."
"This morning, the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Baroness Ashton, declared that the EU and NATO are, for the first time, sharing information and data on Libya."
"This is an encouraging example for further similar cooperation."
"It sends a clear signal that, if there is a will, the way to meaningful cooperation will be always open."
"Recent events in North Africa and Asia show that the European Union needs to strengthen its foreign policy and the alliances in which it participates."
"The threat of terrorist attacks, which is still very real, points to the need to strengthen European security standards."
"However, some of the proposals set out in the Gualtieri report are unacceptable."
"They run counter to the strategy which has been pursued up until now, aimed at building international alliances based, for the most part, on the assumption that the North Atlantic Alliance will play a leading role."
"The proposed strengthening of the European Defence Agency would not mean a genuine increase in the level of security in the EU, but merely the creation of another bureaucratic monster, incapable of performing the tasks assigned to it."
"Who would take the decision to mobilise European armed forces?"
"Whose interests would their units be acting in?"
"How much of a say would the new Member States have?"
"Would the EDA's headquarters be relocated?"
"Fears have also been voiced regarding institutional matters, such as whether growth of the EDA would not result in a reduction in the size of certain Member States' armies, and whether there would be a clash with the remit and objectives of the European External Action Service."
"As can be seen from previous reports, in spite of substantial financial investment and very good logistics and management, European forces could not cope with simple police missions in Kosovo and Bosnia."
"We should perhaps give some thought to how to improve their operations before encouraging them to extend their duties to include military actions."
"in writing. - I voted for this report and particularly welcome calls for increased controls of private security companies through their regulation, licensing and monitoring."
"I voted in favour of the report on the development of the common security and defence policy following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Our role in the Mediterranean, in the Middle East and, hence, throughout the world, will become increasingly important."
"The ongoing upheavals, which will increase after the death of Osama Bin Laden, must be tackled in full compliance with the Treaty of Lisbon."
"The key to the future will lie in strengthening our political ability to define common strategies and objectives in an increasingly coordinated and timely manner."
"Taking its lead from the Treaty of Lisbon, this text argues that the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) should form the basis for the collective defence of EU Member States."
"It welcomes both organisations' desire to further strengthen their partnership."
"It seeks to expand the role of the European Commission and of the extremely Atlanticist Baroness Ashton in the field of defence."
"Not content with bowing to the leadership of the United States, it advocates the rapid implementation of measures to liberalise the arms industry."
"I voted against the report."
"The Treaty of Lisbon has seen increased responsibilities for Parliament with regard to foreign and security policy."
"Nevertheless, we must make every effort to ensure that these policies promote the values and interests of the EU at international level, with the general aim of contributing to peace, to security, to solidarity, to conflict prevention, to the promotion of democracy, to the protection of human rights, to gender equality, to respect for international law, to support for international institutions, to effective multilateralism and mutual respect between nations, to sustainable development, to free and fair trade, and to the eradication of poverty."
"This is the only means by which the objectives that we are proposing will be realised."
"The geopolitical situation in the southern Mediterranean region is currently undergoing a sea change."
"If we ignore these excellent and laudable aspirations, there is a danger that the revolutions could be manipulated for the worse by some when they ought, in reality, to improve things."
"We need to show the people of these countries that the EU supports their desire for change."
"Since the conflict in Libya began, I have suggested that the international community should put all its energies into supporting the overthrow of the Gaddafi regime."
"The duty to protect humans wherever they live and whoever they may be is a sacred universal right and duty."
"What is self-determination worth when it is based on dictatorial actions or where it serves to justify the unspeakable?"
"Self-determination, and even an absolute majority, do not entitle any government to deny universal values."
"The delays, wavering and semantics about the scale of intervention have allowed the regime to weaken the citizen's uprising."
"The EU urgently needs to establish a credible approach for the Mediterranean element of the European Neighbourhood Policy."
"in writing. - I have scrutinised the report very attentively."
"The report is divided into five parts: security and foreign policy, security and defence, external and internal security, security through operations and security in partnership."
"The report provides a clear vision of how the EU should implement its general security policy and defence policy in order to become the strongest autonomous strategically acting player, with the aim to provide security and stability in Europe and the world."
"I voted 'in favour'."
"The report being examined today contains some aspects that are welcome and others that are less so, thus representing in the best (or worst) possible way the typical contradictions that the European Union reveals in its external actions."
"For example, it hopes for greater integration and common management in crisis situations: recent events in Libya have shown that Europe acts dispersedly, with some Member States directly engaged, others that have wriggled out, and practically only one country - Italy - to manage the direct consequences of the Libyan crisis and the North African crises in general, in other words, a flood of migrants."
"We therefore need to decide how Europe should behave: should it always be 'united' whatever the consequences, or should it always leave the Member States free, in which case the European Union itself must adapt?"
"I am baffled by the emphasis placed on the need to increase the power and resources of common actions and the European Defence Agency: given the precedents, I would not like that, too, to become a useless bureaucratic machine that is an end in itself, and its actions to become totally ineffective."
"For the reasons given above, I have decided to abstain, while waiting to see what the European Union will do as a really 'great' organisation."
"I am voting in favour of Mr Gualtieri's report."
"This report helps confirm the EU as a player contributing to global stability and is a necessary step in developing a genuine pan-European approach in foreign and defence policy."
"I believe that better harmonisation of already existing instruments and reaching consensus on the strategic aims of the common security and defence policy in the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon are of paramount importance."
"While relying on existing financial, civilian and military resources, Europe can take even more decisive actions in the event of natural and man-made disasters and be even more involved in averting and managing crises and conflicts, and in establishing a lasting peace in third countries."
"In addition to this, the European common security and defence policy and the European development cooperation policy are two sides of the same coin."
"I strongly support the report, which calls for better coordination of them."
"The organisation of regular meetings of a crisis management board, which will cooperate with the EEAS, is of crucial importance to this."
"The proposals made in the report for a more resourceful, harmonised use of the resources for EU defence programmes and the sharing of military capacity in the EU will help achieve this policy's objectives."
"I voted in favour of this report because it provides a vision of how the EU could become an independent strategic force for security and stability in Europe and throughout the world."
"The Treaty of Lisbon gave the EU security and defence policy more opportunities."
"This policy became more integrated into EU foreign policy."
"The European External Action Service is making a significant contribution to ensuring EU security."
"When drafting the report, our Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats received support from most of the other groups, because the EU must become an independent security actor and it is necessary to review the concept and structure of the Battlegroups in the EU's mixed civilian and military missions."
"There was also general agreement with our group's call for the EU to improve the planning process of humanitarian aid missions as a matter of urgency."
"I voted in favour of this report on the development of the common security and defence policy (CSDP) following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"The common security and defence policy is an integral part of the common foreign and security policy (CFSP)."
"Both dimensions have been placed within the legally binding institutional framework of EU principles, namely, democracy, the rule of law, the universality and indivisibility of human rights and fundamental freedoms, respect for human dignity, the principles of equality and solidarity, and respect for the principles of the United Nations Charter and principles of international law, including the responsibility to protect."
"In addition, their objectives have been merged with the general objectives of EU external action."
"On this matter, I support the rapporteur's proposal to enhance cooperation with EU national parliaments in exercising democratic scrutiny over the CFSP and the CSDP, with the goal of mutually reinforcing their respective influence on the political choices made by the other European institutions and by the Member States, while fully respecting national parliaments' defence policy prerogatives."
"Under the framework of EU values and principles, it is crucial that its CSDP be guided by a transparent and democratic process."
"The European Union's international status can only be achieved through a concerted effort by the Member States and the EU bodies."
"In this context, a common security and defence policy (CSDP) capable of responding to the challenges ahead remains of the highest priority."
"Indeed, it will only be possible to guarantee the Union's active voice at international level if it has sufficient defence instruments of its own."
"I therefore voted in favour of this report."
"The Treaty of Lisbon lays the foundations for the European Union to establish itself as a credible and influential player on the international scene."
"From this stems my support for a report that is necessary in order to evaluate advances made in the common security and defence policy following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and to identify what scope there is for improvement."
"As a member of the Subcommittee on Security and Defence, I have followed this report closely."
"Personally, I have stressed the need for cooperation among Member States in the field of research, development and innovation in matters of defence."
"We find ourselves in the middle of an economic crisis and, as a consequence, we must pull together in order to reduce costs and increase the interoperability of the military capacity of our Member States."
"All this will serve not only to reduce defence expenditure but also to increase the autonomy of the European Union on the international scene."
"I believe that this point of view has been well captured in the report, which constitutes a step in the right direction in terms of promoting a common security and defence policy which is more effective, coordinated and consistent with the rest of the policies of the European Union and its Member States."
"in writing. - I decided to abstain at the final vote because we lost Amendment 1 on reference to NATO, Amendment 3 against a nuclear dimension in the common security and defence policy, Amendment 4 against flexible use of Battlegroups, Amendment 5 against using Battlegroups for mixed civilian-military tasks, Amendment 6 deleting a provision on defence research, Amendment 7 deleting a provision on defence research, Amendment 8 deleting reference to the US Department of Homeland Security, Amendment 9 deleting reference to CSDP cooperation with Frontex in the Mediterranean, and despite the fact that we won Amendment 2 on European External Action Service/Commission permanent working structures and Amendment 1 saying no to NATO developing civilian capabilities."
"The report outlines the need for the European Union to operate in the global context as a stabilising force, endeavouring to keep the peace, strengthen international security and manage crisis situations."
"I voted in favour of this report because I join the chorus of disappointment in Parliament at the European Union's lack of a genuinely global and uniform post-Lisbon approach to the common security policy."
"Credible and reliable military systems and capabilities are an essential condition for the development of an independent security and defence policy."
"I believe, however, that a common political will needs to be adopted over the long term in order to strengthen the EU's ability to respond to crises, while safeguarding its strategic independence."
"The report in question points out the developments in European defence policy since the Treaty of Lisbon came into force."
"I voted against it because it is clear from the latest events in Libya that the European Union has not acted in a united, consensual manner."
"There has been a lack of solidarity in the management of the migrant crisis, revealing that when national interests are at stake, the EU forgets about noble concepts, as it has taken no interest in the problem."
"in writing. - I voted in support of our common foreign and security policy report, with the hope that such a policy would take shape at last."
"Up to now, our common foreign and security policy is a collection of disagreements and misguided initiatives."
"The recent Euro-row over action in Libya and the subsequent German opt-out made it clear to the rest of the world that the EU is still not able to project a real common foreign and security policy."
"Moreover, the French initiative aiming at consolidating the financing of the southern neighbourhood at the expense of the eastern neighbourhood sent a disastrous message to our eastern partners."
"This is even more sensitive at a time when other quintessential European projects are in doubt, if not in crisis."
"The euro is under constant pressure and the problem is, in part, generated by the same lack of European ambition and coherence."
"The Schengen Area is rolled back on a daily basis and national barriers re-emerge as the European spirit and legislation are ignored or broken by fellow Member States."
"A non-existent common foreign and security policy assisted by a huge External Action Service would seriously undermine European credibility in the world."
"I am voting for this proposal as it suggests a strengthening of the EU's role in the multilateral system."
"It is entirely fair for the EU to have more effective representation in international organisations and for this representation to be valued, inasmuch as the EU is the organisation that contributes the most to development aid."
"The EU's principles and values, which promote more effective and preventive multilateral action, make it an important international player in the emerging interpolar world order."
"In particular, the EU must initiate efforts to stop being a mere observer in United Nations programmes and conferences."
"It must also reinforce its position in international bodies in the area of economics and monetary stability, in accordance with its role as one of the principal economic powers at international level."
"I also approve of the statements in the report seeking to strengthen the EU's role in multilateral security organisations, in the G8 and the G20, among others."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of María Muñiz De Urquiza's report on the EU as a global actor and its role in multilateral organisations."
"I would like to stress once again the need to better coordinate actions of the EU Member States in the UN and, in particular, in the UN Human Rights Council."
"We consider that the new institutional structure of the EU and establishment of the Directorate for Human Rights and Democracy in the EEAS system and Brussels-based COHOM Office offer good opportunities to increase the coherence, visibility and credibility of the EU actions in the UNHRC."
"Finally, in the EP, we welcomed the recommendation by the UNHRC and subsequent decision by the UN General Assembly to suspend Libya's membership of the UNHRC."
"Following efforts and actions made by some Member States in the HRC, today Syria has stated that it is withdrawing its candidacy to become a member of the UNHRC."
"Taking into account these examples and our common experience in the past with the UN Human Rights Commission and, since 2006, with the UN Human Rights Council, we suggest that clear membership criteria should be introduced in the UNHRC, and the EU should stand firmly behind this initiative."
"The Treaty of Lisbon enhances the EU's capacity to join various international organisations, entrusting it with a wider range of competences in its external action and offering it an opportunity to have a clearer and stronger single voice in the world."
"The Treaty also encourages cooperation with relevant international and regional organisations and groups of states, offering the Union an opportunity to become an effective global player."
"The EU's commitment to effective multilateralism is the guiding principle of European external action."
"I think that, drawing on its internal experience of cooperation among nations and institutions, the European Union has a global responsibility which it should continue to uphold."
"This is why I voted in favour of this report."
"I voted in favour of this report."
"The processes of globalisation carry a wide range of opportunities, challenges and threats for global governance."
"Global challenges, such as financial markets, energy security, combating poverty, climate change and human rights violations require joint and coordinated action."
"The Treaty of Lisbon, by introducing the Union's legal personality, enhanced the EU's capacity to join various international organisations and provided the opportunity to assume a stronger and more influential position globally."
"Hitherto, the representation of the EU and its Member States in international organisations has been fragmented, which has prevented the EU from speaking with a single voice in the international arena."
"The EU must become an influential global actor and be able to defend its position."
"In order to achieve this, it is necessary to enhance coordination within the EU, and this will require strong political will and flexibility on the part of the Member States concerning their representation."
"I voted for the report drafted by María Muñiz De Urquiza because the European Union's presence in multilateral organisations is one of the guiding principles of its foreign policy."
"At present, the EU has a legal personality, which provides it with a higher global profile."
"In addition, the Union has become, by means of the Treaty, a fully-fledged participant in international politics."
"The Treaty of Lisbon has enhanced the foreign policy instruments, especially within the UN."
"In this regard, I would like to highlight point 12 of the report - the first step towards coordinated, effective action from Member States in the Security Council."
"I should emphasise that, at the moment, the UN is right in the midst of reforming its structures, which also allows the EU's representation in this forum to be restructured."
"I supported this resolution because I am convinced that the European Union's desire to bolster its presence within international organisations is entirely legitimate."
"European citizens, through our governments, have given a legal personality and specific powers to the Union."
"European integration has built on a set of fundamental values that are constantly being extended."
"We have a duty to coordinate our activities and to promote the unity of our Union, as we have already done in the World Trade Organisation."
"More work remains to be done."
"However, there are some encouraging signs."
"The Union is trying to equip itself with the right foreign policy tools (appointment of a High Representative, creation of the European External Action Service)."
"With its newly improved status, the Union will now be able to express its position within the United Nations General Assembly."
"We are living in a world which has seen a sharp increase in the number and frequency of new crises."
"In the face of this new reality, political decision makers are charged both with taking preventive action and with responding effectively to new developments."
"Yet at this level, it is not a case of simply waving a magic wand."
"When the EU is unable to combine forces, to agree procedures and to speak with one voice, it is often left behind."
"Within the United Nations, and particularly within the International Monetary Fund, the EU needs to promote its interests."
"The European Union could stand up for European interests and, consequently, the interests of Member States."
"That means we need to get organised and get organised now."
"This is the purpose and aim of this report."
"I consider it extremely important for the European Union to play a key role in international organisations."
"I believe that the decisions made on international policy should not violate the sovereignty of individual Member States."
"I am also against weakening the role played by each country in the European Union individually in international organisations."
"We have seen in the past differences in Member States' foreign policies."
"If the European Union gains a place on the UN Security Council, such a conflict may have a very adverse impact on the European Union's image."
"For this reason, I voted against both point 20 and the whole report."
"This report is completely unbalanced in favouring a prospect whereby the EU would, in future, enjoy a status at least equivalent to that of the Member States in global and regional multilateral organisations."
"In essence, that would mean the end of the Member States' diplomatic freedom of action, since they would have to adjust their positions so as not to clash openly with those of a future Union representation."
"As a result, the national governments would be unable to adequately assert their own interests in international forums."
"While we can agree that in certain areas, such as monetary policy, the EU can represent the prevalent position in the appropriate multilateral organisations, it is difficult to accept the idea that the European External Action Service might take on the role of representing a common position of the Member States on the world stage when very often, the countries of Europe have such different interests that it is impossible to achieve a common position."
"By voting against the report, I intend to show my opposition to its proposed future scenario in which national diplomacy would substantially be superseded by Union diplomacy, to the detriment of the Member States' diplomatic autonomy."
"I voted in favour of this report because there has been a sharp increase in political and humanitarian crises in the world, which calls for improved and more preventive EU multilateral action."
"The EU should make better use of its foreign policy instruments so as to ensure better use of its leverage in multilateral organisations and to take the lead in addressing current and future international crises more effectively."
"In addition, there is a need to involve non-state actors more in multilateral policy making and to promote and facilitate improved consultation with civil society organisations and social partners in the future governance structures of international organisations."
"The European Union should play an active and leading role in global governance reform, by enhancing cooperation, improving institutions and engaging all stakeholders, This would make international institutions and organisations more legitimate, effective and conducive to shared responsibility."
"Given that the EU is one of world's foremost economic powers, arrangements for the representation of the EU in international bodies in the area of economic, monetary and financial stability need to be reviewed."
"The EU's mechanisms for reaching consensus and taking concerted action make it a model for a rules-based international order."
"This is why the EU must cooperate with leading regional powers and actively participate in building and improving an international environment which enables it to promote its values and interests."
"The timing is particularly appropriate with a sharp increase being noticed in the number of political and humanitarian crises in the world, which gives rise to the need for the European Union to deploy its foreign policy instruments more effectively so as to ensure better use of its leverage in international organisations and to take the lead more effectively in resolving current and future international crises."
"On the other hand, the globalisation processes also offer a wide range of opportunities, challenges and threats for global governance, while revealing social loopholes and failures, including in areas such as the financial markets, energy security, the fight against poverty, climate change policy and human rights violations."
"Indeed, the EU must enhance its role as a global actor and act as a global decision maker."
"I welcome the efforts made to improve Europe's multilateral action, and would stress the importance of the EU having an active leadership role in global governance reform."
"This is a good opportunity for the EU to make use of its foreign policy instruments and to assume leadership through a more effective approach to current and future international crises."
"I therefore commend the attention given to the EU's position in the United Nations system, in the international financial institutions and in other multilateral institutions, and I agree with the reform proposals which strengthen several of the positions that we have taken."
"The oft-used phrase 'an economic giant but a political dwarf' takes on new meaning when we analyse the EU's presence in international organisations and in other regional organisations of which it is part."
"We urgently need to change this situation."
"I therefore believe this own-initiative report to be timely, and I support it in general."
"This report examines the role of the EU as a global player in international bodies."
"In this respect, like the rapporteur, I believe that there is still a long way to go on the path to credible, consistent and visible EU external action, as there is no European strategy for every organisation of which the Member States or the EU are part."
"The increasing complexity that characterises the international system makes it necessary to objectively coordinate the relationships between the Member States, and between the Member States and the EU on the various stages where we interact."
"That is why we adopted the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Moreover, there is already an example of good practice: our presence in the World Trade Organisation (WTO)."
"There is, therefore, an urgent need for the EU to be represented with a single voice in the various international bodies."
"I think that drawing up a White Paper on this subject, as is proposed in the report, could be a good 'beginning of the end' for this bizarre situation."
"In its reports on EU foreign policy, Parliament has once again been utterly blinkered."
"Brussels is seeking to impose European diplomacy and security and defence policies, but is failing: not for want of funding, but rather because the rationale and assumptions underpinning the approach are still wrong."
"For starters, no one hears the EU's voice on the world stage."
"Only a handful of champions of a federal Europe would like to hear it speak with one voice, yet diversity and diplomatic cooperation constitute the real value of Europe, whether within the United Nations or elsewhere."
"Secondly, no one heeds the muted and incomprehensible mutterings of European leaders who have no mandate and, above all, no legitimacy."
"When Europe does speak with one voice, it has nothing to say."
"I welcome the adoption of this report, which calls for a stronger role for the European Union in the structures of multilateral organisations (United Nations, international financial institutions, North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, World Trade Organisation, and so on)."
"In early May 2011, the EU was awarded 'super-observer' status by United Nations General Assembly, which means that it will now be able to take the floor and exercise a right of reply in the Assembly on the same terms as other UN Member States."
"This is just the first step: we should continue to press for more."
"Another important element is the reform of the Security Council with a view to improving its legitimacy by reviewing regional representation."
"This report invites the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy/Vice-President of the Commission to do something that I consider very important, namely, to seek common EU positions on the subjects to be decided in the Security Council in order to implement these positions through joint voting practices and to avoid a repetition of past dissensions."
"I voted for this report because it advocates strengthening the EU's role in peace, security and regulation at global level."
"For the Union's definitive affirmation as regards foreign policy and in the light of the objectives set out in the Treaty of Lisbon, there is a need to continue working towards the EU having a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council one day."
"This European Parliament resolution is on the EU's role in the United Nations (UN) system, in international financial institutions, in multilateral security organisations, in 'summit diplomacy' and in other multilateral organisations, and calls for its role at multilateral level to be strengthened."
"There is a clear need to better coordinate the action of the Union, as such, with that of the Member States."
"I believe the Union should play an active and leading role in the reform of global governance so as to make international institutions and organisations more legitimate, effective and suited to shared responsibility."
"I am not unaware of the many problems that a radical revision of the Union's current system of institutional representation in multilateral international bodies would lead to, in particular, as regards potentially strengthening the EU's position in the UN."
"The House's insistence on the need for a comprehensive review of the UN Security Council and the need to make it more legitimate, representative of regions and effective by assigning the Union a permanent seat therefore remains an objective that will be hard to achieve in the short term."
"This report by Mrs Muñiz De Urquiza is on the EU's performance as a global player and its role in multilateral organisations."
"The world is currently experiencing a major growth process in globalisation terms, in particular, with the revolutions and transition to democracy of countries that have traditionally been closed and governed by totalitarian regimes, which constitutes a set of opportunities that the EU should not neglect."
"Effective multilateralism constitutes the guiding principle of EU foreign policy, in line with the commitment set out in the 2003 European security strategy."
"The legal personality conferred on the EU by the Treaty of Lisbon, according to which the European Union should speak with one voice, strengthens its capacity for involvement, as an authorised voice, in the various international organisations where questions of foreign security and defence policy are debated."
"Although she advocates increased EU cooperation and development aid, I agree with the rapporteur's proposals and voted for her report."
"The EU does not have the legitimacy that they are attempting to ascribe to it: only the Member States and their peoples do."
"This report seeks to legitimise and consolidate a path that has gradually been forged on the backs of the people in an affront to their sovereignty: to national sovereignty and its legitimacy."
"The goal is to ensure EU representation in multilateral organisations - the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the World Bank - as if it were a (super)state."
"It is seeking to replace the Member States, thereby corrupting the spirit of bodies like the United Nations General Assembly, where each country and its people still have the same weight, irrespective of their size."
"The report also proposes increasing, particularly through the European External Action Service, the resources placed at the disposal of a political and diplomatic agenda whose goals include increasing the EU's weight and influence in various forums and organisations, with a view to exploiting them."
"This is an attempt to subvert the current international order, replacing it with a new, less democratic one that guarantees better conditions for big business and finance to pursue their ambitions in the endless contest for markets and resources."
"The majority in Parliament is seeking to consolidate a path and a policy that goes over the heads of the organs of national sovereignty and the sovereignty of the peoples, presenting the EU as having a legitimacy that only the Member States and their peoples have, however much it costs them."
"They are seeking to legitimise the EU in multilateral organisations - the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the World Bank - and are seeking to replace states with regional integration organisations, for example, in the United Nations General Assembly, where each country and its people still have the same weight, irrespective of their size."
"They are proposing to increase, particularly through the European External Action Service, the resources for implementing a political and diplomatic agenda whose principle goal is increasing the EU's weight and influence in these organisations, with a view to exploiting them."
"The objectives are clear: to establish a new, less democratic international order so as to guarantee better conditions for big business and finance to compete in the endless contest for markets and domination of the world's natural resources; this requires the increased militarisation of the EU, and integrated and permanent cooperation with NATO, under the leadership of the United States and the great powers of the EU."
"That is why we voted against."
"in writing. - The EU is the largest contributor of development aid and the most important trade bloc, but representation of the Union, as such, in multilateral organisations remains fragmented."
"On the other hand, the EU Member States are over-represented in all multilateral organisations with the exception of the World Trade Organisation."
"This over-representation - particularly in the Bretton Woods institutions - often results in dissonance among the European voices and is perceived as hugely problematic by the emerging powers, which consider the status quo to be unfair."
"It would be appropriate that, in areas of exclusive competence, the EU should be the pre-eminent actor, with full membership, while the Member States might also - but not necessarily - be present as members, without, in most cases, an independent role."
"The effects of the Treaty of Lisbon necessarily mean that the role played by the European Union in international organisations must be revised."
"However, as we have seen all too often recently, the so-called single voice with which Europe should approach multilateral issues is often damaging to the Member States' own prerogatives and autonomy of decision."
"I must therefore abstain, because the report has some positive aspects, but they are invalidated by the considerations expressed above."
"I endorsed the report because the added value of EU membership in multilateral organisations lies in the fields where it has exclusive or shared competences: economic and trade matters, environmental policy, development aid, and security and defence policy."
"The Treaty of Lisbon, by introducing the Union's legal personality, enhances the EU's capacity to join various international organisations, entrusts it with a wider range of competences in its external action, provides, notably by the creation of the post of a Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy (VP/HR) and the European External Action Service (EEAS), the Union with an opportunity for a clearer and stronger single voice in the world, as well as encouraging all types of mutually beneficial cooperation with relevant international and regional organisations and groups of states, and enables the Union to organise itself in such a way as to be able to become an effective global player."
"I believe that hitherto, the representation of the EU and its Member States in multilateral organisations, informal summits and international regimes has been fragmented, often ineffective, and still varies considerably."
"I also take the view that EU Member States should increasingly consider and rely on the EU as a multiplier of power in achieving the objectives they cannot achieve independently, and that speaking with one EU voice not only increases the chances of success but also improves the legitimacy and credibility of the EU as an important international actor in the emerging interpolar world, without it losing its identity of course."
"I voted in favour of this report because the EU's role in multilateralism will need to be further reinforced in the years to come."
"This is also in accordance with the Treaty of Lisbon."
"By giving the European Union legal personality, the Treaty increased the possibilities for it to join the various international and regional organisations and groups of states."
"These relations will help resolve economic and commercial issues, as well as those regarding the environment."
"The contribution of the European Union must also have an added value in multilateral organisations or summits where not all of its members are represented."
"Unfortunately, recent, and also current, political and humanitarian crises in the world, have called for prompt, decisive action by the EU."
"It is often not easy, but countries affected by such crises expect rapid action from the EU not only through its foreign policy but also in the form of prompt aid in emergencies."
"The European Union's commitment to effective multilateralism is particularly important."
"The Union must take into account its own consolidated representation and that of Member States in multilateral organisations."
"The current rapid increase in the number of political and humanitarian crises is worrying, which is an indication of the need to implement such a strategy for the EU."
"At the moment, the Union is not fulfilling its role properly as a global actor."
"I think that the enhancement and importance of its role in multilateral organisations mark real progress in terms of establishing its global significance."
"in writing. - I voted against paragraph 20 because I do not believe that the time is yet ripe for the EU to have a single seat on the United Nations Security Council."
"The external dimension of the European Union needs to be enhanced, since Article 21 of the Treaty on European Union promotes an international system based on stronger multilateral cooperation in which the Member States guarantee that the Union can assert their interests and values on the international scene."
"New permanent structures for the EU's external representation have been established under the Treaty of Lisbon, but this new dimension does not yet allow the Union to participate as a single entity in its own right in the work of many international bodies."
"This is liable to harm the EU's commitment to effective multilateralism, limiting its decisiveness and undermining its credibility."
"Given the increase in political and humanitarian crises in the world, the EU needs to make the best possible use of its foreign policy instruments so as to ensure better use of its leverage in multilateral organisations and its ability to take the lead in addressing current and future international crises."
"The promotion of democracy and human rights, specifically women's and children's rights, freedom of expression and the rule of law, should be at the heart of all EU external action."
"Each Member State is entitled to express its own views within international bodies."
"Governments are elected, unlike Baroness Ashton, the European Commission and the European Central Bank, yet this text seeks to make the latter our sole representatives."
"I voted against this attempt to give the kiss of death to State sovereignty on the international arena."
"The EU cannot forget its role as a leading actor on the world stage in every respect."
"As such, it needs to strengthen its role in all multilateral organisations, in particular, the United Nations (UN), where its role must be increasingly active now that the European External Action Service (EEAS) is operational."
"Nations are powerless to act alone in the face of the major challenges of our times."
"Multilateral action is the only way that States can get to grips with the challenges facing our world."
"The economic, financial and food crises, climate change and conflicts have made us realise that we urgently need to create a form of global governance, or what Jacques Attali calls a 'world State'."
"Naturally, Europe has a role to play in this new global political arena as a soft world power based on standards, rules and leading by example."
"Under the Treaty of Lisbon, Europe has the foundation it requires in order to assert itself politically as well as economically."
"The European Parliament has adopted a resolution on the role that the European Union should play in multilateral organisations."
"As a general principle, the strengthening of the EU's role in multilateral frameworks has been approved."
"Thanks to the agreement which has been reached and the joint measures taken, the European Union is becoming a model for the functioning of a world order based on international law."
"This is why emphasis has been placed on the need for the EU to cooperate with leading regions, and to participate actively in creating an international community."
"Other requirements include cooperation between the Member States and the drafting of a common position, inter alia, on the issue of savings and budgetary cuts."
"The EU and the Member States need to take steps to increase the EU's role and strengthen its position within the UN (changes to support for the UN, in particular, with regard to humanitarian policies and aid and the issue of conflict resolution)."
"Within the framework of cooperation with international financial institutions, the EU must find a solution to the problem of external economic and financial representation, which limits the EU's influence."
"As far as the EU's role in multilateral security organisations is concerned, it has been said that the regulations which make it possible for the European Union to benefit from NATO funding should be streamlined."
"Thought should be given to whether the EU should take on greater responsibility and play a more effective role in achieving joint objectives (engaging in joint dialogue, deciding on and coordinating joint measures, etc.) under the agreement between the EU and the OSCE."
"This report on 'The EU as a global actor: its role in multilateral organisations' presents an overview of the role of the EU."
"I voted in favour of this report as I agree with its vision and ambition for an EU that has a strong presence on the international stage."
"Apart from the value of each Member State per se, the EU, as an organisation, can contribute its organisational experience to the international community."
"Indeed, the EU's mechanisms for building consensus and taking concerted action make it a model for a rules-based international order."
"In view of this, cooperation with the leading regional powers should be encouraged, so that the EU can actively participate in the building and improvement of an international environment that enables the EU to promote its values and interests, as required by the Treaty."
"With regard to the EU's aspiration to be a global player, it is therefore essential to strengthen internal coordination in order to speak with one voice."
"This is the only way to achieve multilateral cooperation and address international challenges, namely those arising from the responsibility to protect, and the need to enhance human security as a means of achieving global security."
"In the current context, it is very important that the EU be able to establish itself as a global player, capable of responding effectively to the demanding challenges that are posed at global level."
"As such, it will have to commit to increasing internal coordination so that the EU can talk with one voice, thereby increasing not just the prospects for success of its actions, but also its legitimacy and credibility at international level."
"in writing. - Among other things, this text establishes that Parliament notes that the EU's mechanisms for building consensus and taking concerted action make it a model for a rules-based international order."
"It therefore stresses the need for the EU to cooperate with leading regional powers and actively participate in the building and improvement of an international environment that enables the EU to promote, as required by the Treaty, its values and interests."
"In particular in those fields where it has exclusive or shared competences, it considers essential, with regard to the EU's aspiration and need to be an effective global actor and to safeguard its position, a strengthening of the internal coordination necessary to speak with one voice, the ability to shape multilateral cooperation and lead collective action in addressing international challenges, namely those arising from the responsibility to protect, and the need to enhance human security, as a means of achieving global security."
"The final text of this report emphasises the strategic role that the European Union must play in international organisations."
"To achieve this, there is a need, above all, to promote active, concrete participation so as to strengthen both internal and external cooperation."
"That must be the primary way to increase the legitimacy of the decisions made and also to ensure that responsibilities are fully shared."
"Lastly, the Member States must coordinate their positions in the United Nations Human Rights Council so as to establish clear and strict membership criteria, especially for countries where human rights violations are commonplace."
"in writing. - I support the UK retaining membership of UNSC."
"The European Union is today a true actor on the world stage."
"Its role in international, multilateral organisations is visibly growing, and has been showing itself to be increasingly important."
"The European Union should therefore play a more active and leading role in the reform of global governance."
"I am talking, in particular, about the need to reform the United Nations (UN) system to assign the Union a place and, in particular, about its representation on the UN Security Council."
"That involves a demanding degree of coordination of the Member States' positions, but it would result in the increased coherence, visibility and credibility of EU actions at international level."
"The European Union should take inspiration from the model followed in the World Trade Organisation (WTO)."
"For more consistent and better-integrated cooperation, it should have observer status in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), be more closely coordinated with the Council of Europe, and participate fully in the activities of the G7/G8 and G20."
"This specific resolution strengthens the roles of the EU in the multilateral system."
"To be specific, it clarifies the roles of the EU in international credit institutions, in the UN system, in multilateral security organisations and in other multilateral organisations in general, such as the World Trade Organisation, the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development."
"Finally, the EU's role in summit diplomacy is clarified."
"Bearing in mind that European cooperation is a necessity, not a choice, I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution by the European Parliament on the EU as a global actor."
"Following the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Union's diplomatic activities have been beefed up with a view to raising Europe's profile on the international stage."
"I welcome the adoption of this report, which calls for better representation for the Community institutions in international organisations."
"The Europe of 27 is stronger now."
"The new Member States have increased the Union's economic and demographic strength."
"However, the balance and coordination between Member States has been thrown out of kilter by enlargement."
"The European message has changed: it has become richer and more complex."
"As I see it, if we are to improve the European Union's representation in multilateral organisations, we must first find a consensus."
"I am pleased to see that the Union has supported the United Nations' strategy, particularly in the case of humanitarian policy and conflict resolution."
"Europe and the UN have a wealth of objectives and interests in common, which, in my view, justifies even closer cooperation and resource synergies."
"I would therefore like to see Europe accorded a stronger position within the UN, particularly at the annual General Assembly."
"I have voted in favour of this report."
"The EU must increase its independence and develop its dialogues with third countries."
"It must speak with a more powerful and more unified voice and respond much more quickly, in order to be able to act as a trustworthy and reliable partner."
"The international situation has recently been changing ever more rapidly."
"The rising economic importance of Asia, the revolutionary movements in Africa, the increased terrorist threat, the need to establish joint and sustainable European raw materials strategies and ever more frequent violations of human rights are just a few of the problems with which EU diplomacy has to contend today."
"Experience has taught us that it is powerless in many cases."
"The European Union's foreign policy appears to be poorly thought-out and poorly coordinated."
"Furthermore, the idea of joint and sustainable European policies has lost out on more than one occasion to the interests of the largest countries of the 'old' EU."
"A perfect example of this is the lack of a rule ensuring geographical balance when filling posts in the European External Action Service."
"This system needs to be changed, and it was for this reason that I did not support the Muñiz De Urquiza report."
"I believe that it identifies key conditions which the EU and the Member States should meet in order to be able to perform better the tasks enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon."
"However, we should not endeavour to replace NATO with a new EU army, but instead concentrate on the appropriate division of tasks during international crises."
"The EU's role could lie in the provision of humanitarian aid, while the North Atlantic Alliance would coordinate military aid."
"This distribution of tasks could also make it possible to strengthen cooperation with the EU's most important trade and military partner, namely the United States."

"Statement by the President of the European Parliament's delegation to the Conciliation Committee - Novel foods (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the statement by the President of the European Parliament's delegation to the Conciliation Committee - novel foods."
"Conciliation procedure regarding the amendment of Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008 and the repeal of Regulation (EC) No 258/97 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1852/2001 on novel foods."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are disappointed that it has not been possible to reach agreement on the Novel Foods Regulation and that therefore, it is not possible to guarantee adequate information for consumers on the foods that we eat or to ensure that Europe has clear, strict rules on foods from cloned animals."
"What I have said is not meant to be controversial: it is not Parliament's fault."
"If we have been unable to regulate cloning - one of the main sticking points in these negotiations - it is because the governments have not shown enough willingness."
"However - and I address this point to the governments and the Commission - food safety and information on the products that reach our tables are basic principles of the European Union."
"Everybody says so, but then we have to act accordingly, or else it becomes a slogan that consumers do not believe."
"When these issues are being discussed, Parliament is not prepared to look the other way and content itself with the kind of general reassurances that the Council provided during the negotiations."
"On such a sensitive and serious food safety issue, it is not acceptable just to dab on a touch of face powder to look good to the consumers."
"Parliament was calling for a credible solution: the labelling of all foodstuffs derived from cloned animals and their offspring."
"That really would have been a step in the right direction."
"I would like to make another remark on a more general level: the governments continue to think that it is their prerogative to make all decisions."
"It is still not clear to them that there is an institution - the European Parliament - which codecides."
"We are directly elected by the citizens and we are determined to enforce our rights."
"I invite the governments to read the Treaty of Lisbon carefully, because I am sure they have not paid attention to all parts of it."
"I would like now to appeal to the Commission and to Commissioner Dalli, whose conduct during the negotiations was admirable, although perhaps the Commission did not explain his role in conciliating the positions."
"Commissioner, I invite you to table a proposal on cloning as soon as possible in order to regulate the sector effectively once and for all."
"That is what the people of Europe are calling for and what Parliament is calling for as well."
"I would also like to acknowledge the Hungarian Presidency - which inherited this thorny problem only in the final stage of the procedure - for having made every possible effort to make up for lost time."
"I thank all the Hungarian Presidency representatives for that."
"I know they do not deserve any blame at all, which is due instead to the stalemate that occurred within the Council between the different national government positions."
"Lastly, I would like to thank the rapporteur, who was magnificent: highly passionate, enthusiastic and competent."
"She has followed this dossier with a love that really does credit to her, and I believe all of us owe her a huge vote of thanks, as we also do to the whole delegation from Parliament, all our fellow Members, the chair of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and everyone else."
"We all worked together day and night to achieve a goal."
"We were not successful, but the questions have been raised and I am sure that, if Commissioner Dalli is true to his word, we will be able to find a way again to provide ourselves with good regulations on cloning and novel foods."
"Thank you, Mr Pittella, not least for the enthusiasm with which you made your statement."
"I will now give the floor to Mrs Győri to respond on behalf of the Council, although I understand that you have lost your voice, so a representative will be speaking on your behalf."
"I invite you to take the floor on behalf of the Council."
"Madam President, Commissioner, honourable Members, today's debate is a good occasion for me to present the Presidency's observations on the recently held conciliation on the proposal for a regulation on novel foods."
"It is also an excellent opportunity for the Presidency to learn Parliament's opinion on this important issue."
"Our European institutions have suffered a major collective failure."
"There is no other course but to learn from this experience in a constructive manner based on professional criteria."
"It is in this spirit that I turn to you today."
"I have come not only to speak but also to listen to you."
"I would like to begin by emphasising that the Presidency genuinely regrets that your institution and ours, the Council, were unable to reach agreement."
"This is all the more true because both the Presidency and the Council attributed great importance to this proposal."
"This was an unrivalled opportunity for us to update the European Union regulation in an area which directly affects us all: food."
"There was a real chance for the European Union to show how it contributes in a tangible manner to making the lives of European citizens better."
"The proposed regulation would have been a particularly good means of answering disputed questions on food from cloned animals by tightening the provisions of the 1997 regulation."
"The 1997 regulation provides that such food products can only be marketed after an authorisation procedure."
"In contrast, as a result of the recent conciliation procedure, a clear, albeit temporary, agreement was reached."
"All parties agreed that the marketing of food from cloned animals must be completely prohibited."
"Furthermore, this ban would have come into effect immediately after the regulation entered into force."
"If the conciliation had been successful, we could now be jointly welcoming an imminent ban on the marketing of food from cloned animals."
"This prohibition could have entered into force as early as the end of this month."
"Unfortunately, this was not to be."
"In the light of the failed negotiations, we may be apt to blame each other."
"At the same time, it is our common interest and duty not to give in to this inclination but to seek a solution together."
"Although the conciliation procedure has come to an end, the needs and expectations of European consumers have not altered at all, and therefore I am pleased to note that we have another chance to make progress."
"It is up to us to restart this process as soon and as effectively as possible."
"We must do our utmost especially to ensure that what we have agreed in the negotiations to date is not lost."
"At third reading, we have reached the point where, in principle, we have agreed on an immediate ban on food from cloned animals."
"We must not allow this agreement in principle to be lost."
"Likewise, we must protect the major advance made in relation to engineered nanomaterials and traditional food from third countries as well as similar, important issues."
"I believe that what we eat is important to all of us, and the kind of nourishment our children and grandchildren grow up on is even more important."
"I would like to take this opportunity of thanking the Commissioner and his organisational units for the hard work they have done over the last few months."
"I also welcome the fact that the Commission - as it has unofficially informed us - is working on drafting a new proposal at an accelerated pace, striving to preserve as many elements of the provisional agreement reached during the recent negotiations as possible in the new legislative proposal."
"The Presidency guarantees its support to both the Commission and Parliament, and hopes that an opportunity to adopt this new proposal will arise as soon as possible."
"Madam President, honourable Members, we are aware that the Commission has little room for manoeuvre."
"After all, it is the task of the Council and Parliament as the two colegislators to find a solution which satisfies the needs and expectations of European citizens through joint efforts."
"In the light of all this, I look forward to your views with truly great interest."
"Welcome"
"Before I give you the floor, Commissioner, let me first extend a welcome on behalf of this House to the members of a delegation from the People's Consultative Assembly of the Republic of Indonesia, who have just taken their seats in the official gallery above."
"I would like to extend a very warm and special welcome to all of the delegation headed by His Excellency, Dr Lukman Hakim Saifuddin, the Vice-Chair of the People's Consultative Assembly."
"Indonesia is a key EU partner in South-East Asia."
"Indeed, it is the leading country in the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), with whom the European Union signed a Partnership and Cooperation Agreement in November 2009, and currently holds the chair of ASEAN."
"Our two parliaments have an excellent relationship."
"A delegation from Parliament visited Indonesia just a few months ago."
"It is therefore a great pleasure to be able to welcome our friends and counterparts from the Indonesian Parliament today."
"We hope that your visit will be fruitful and beneficial."
"(Applause)"
"Statement by the President of the European Parliament's delegation to the Conciliation Committee - Novel foods (continuation of debate)"
"We shall now continue the debate on the Statement by the President of the European Parliament's delegation to the Conciliation Committee - Novel foods."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, as I have already had the opportunity to state to both the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I cannot but express my disappointment at the failure of conciliation, notwithstanding our best efforts to find an agreement."
"This situation is unfortunate, since we had made a lot of progress over recent months on the issues in the novel foods proposals."
"Let me recall some of the elements on which there was clear agreement and which, if adopted, would bring many improvements to the legislation currently in place: a centralised procedure for approval of novel foods which streamlines the authorisation process while maintaining food safety; a definition of 'nanomaterials' and the obligation for pre-market approval, and a labelling requirement for all food ingredients containing nanomaterials; a simplified procedure applicable to traditional foods from third countries, to facilitate EU market access for these products; and the need for food business operators to share scientific data, where tests on animals are involved, in order to limit animal testing where possible."
"These improvements will contribute to Europe's innovation drive by facilitating the marketing of novel foods without any compromise on safety."
"This dossier requires our concerted attention in order to put these improvements in place without further delay."
"They will bring huge benefits in terms of both consumer protection and innovation in the food sector."
"It is therefore my hope that we can capture the momentum of negotiations by making a proposal on this issue very shortly."
"The failure to conclude this dossier came despite a number of positive steps achieved on the issue of cloning during the last months and hours of negotiations."
"The Commission remains committed to following up the report of October 2010 which, I recall, proposed the following: a temporary suspension for five years of the use of the cloning technique in the EU, of the import and use of clones for food production, and of food from clones, which would be combined with the introduction of traceability systems for imports of semen and embryos from clones."
"Furthermore, the Commission recognises the progress made during conciliation."
"It is also clear to me that, on the issue of cloning in all its facets, we need to find an agreement that can be implemented and one that is justified and proportionate."
"The Commission is ready to come up with a comprehensive proposal after the necessary impact assessment."
"I welcome the conciliatory tone adopted by Mr Pittella and by the Presidency."
"We need collectively to reflect further on the next steps, and I am ready to discuss with you, and with the Council, possible scenarios to deal with these two important issues and to agree on a process that will guarantee a positive outcome."
"Such a collective reflection should seek to set a course for success on both dossiers so that consumers can reap the benefits."
"Madam President, first of all, I would like to thank Mrs Liotard, the Hungarian Presidency and Commissioner Dalli and his team for their efforts."
"Unfortunately, however, this regulation, which is so important and so necessary, has not reached a satisfactory conclusion because of a labelling requirement that went beyond what was possible in practice."
"This is a subject that inspires passion and attracts media attention, factors that run counter to logic and pragmatism."
"I have to say that we have missed the chance to take a step forward, have condemned the agri-food industry to living with obsolete legislation and have put the brakes on European technological advancement, of which we are so supportive in theory."
"We cannot demand something that involves a level of cost and bureaucracy that cannot be assumed by the food-producing sector, nor can we demand something that we are not capable of imposing upon third parties."
"We cannot legislate on something that later we will not be able to implement because we would be deceiving consumers."
"I repeat, it is a pity that we have not reached agreement because this regulation dealt not only with cloning and with how many generations and which products must be labelled, but also with many other points on which agreement has been reached, such as nanotechnology and foodstuffs coming from third countries, which were very important for consumers and for the agri-food industry, not only from the point of view of the internal market, but also from a health perspective and in terms of innovation."
"Since cloning is too complex a matter to relegate to a few paragraphs in another proposal, I urge the Commission once again to prepare a report and present a separate legislative proposal that regulates every aspect of cloning, based on food security and all scientific data."
"Given that Commissioner Dalli has committed himself on numerous occasions before this House to presenting this proposal, I trust that the Commission will send it to us as soon as possible."
"Madam President, Mrs Győri, Mr Dalli, ladies and gentlemen, I have been involved in many negotiation processes here in Parliament, but the 12 hours of this conciliation procedure, which lasted from 19:00 to 07:00 the next morning, will remain in my memory for a long time."
"This was a very special event."
"Unfortunately, the two sides came from different planets."
"Parliament's approach was clear, which was to focus on the interests of consumers and of the citizens of the EU."
"Others were considering the interests of the meat and agriculture industries."
"Because of these divergent approaches, we were not able to reach an agreement."
"This is a pity, because we now have a gap in the EU food legislation which we need to close very quickly."
"We were all relatively clear about this, including Mr Pittella, who acted as chair, and the rapporteur."
"The entire team was pulling together."
"Now we need to take the next step."
"We must fill this gap."
"Mr Dalli, you must present two proposals: one on novel foods, because we have almost reached a consensus on this with regard to nanomaterials, the centralised approval process and imports from third countries."
"The other proposal concerns cloning."
"You have listened to everything that we have to say on this subject."
"We do not want these products on the European market."
"At the very least, we want them to be labelled, because consumers should have freedom of choice."
"That is your job and Parliament is ready to support you."
"I hope you will be able to submit a proposal very soon."
"Madam President, I would first like to thank Mrs Liotard, Mr Pittella, Mr Leinen, and the entire negotiating team."
"Thanks to them, we have maintained an extremely cohesive position throughout this very lengthy trialogue and I think that the only positive aspect of the dossier is that the European Parliament has been united in defending public health and the interests of consumers."
"That is what we have been elected for and not for anything else."
"While I recognise the need to move forward and not to assign blame, there is no getting away from the facts, and when it came to conducting negotiations in which Parliament had already abandoned a great deal, well, that was too much."
"As if we should even be asking ourselves whether or not to label products sold on the European market when the consumer's freedom of choice is fundamental in European law!"
"What has happened is totally unacceptable and we have been fobbed off with spurious pretexts."
"We have been presented with legal excuses."
"We were not entering into a commercial war; the rules of the WTO were not being violated."
"In legal terms, this was all untrue."
"Not being able to label is an excuse."
"It is technically incorrect."
"It is perfectly possible to label and trace."
"Simply, it was something we were unwilling to do because, as Mr Leinen pointed out just now, we put interests other than those of consumers first."
"So, now, we need to move forward, and we need to move forward quickly."
"The issue of cloning is increasingly being used by all who want to call the European institutions into question."
"It is an argument put forward by those who mistrust our institutions."
"It is an argument put forward by those who mistrust the foods placed on the European market."
"For pity's sake, we urgently need to adopt a clear position on cloning to prevent cloned meat and the offspring of cloned animals being placed on the European market, which is what European consumers and European citizens want!"
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Madam President, after two long years of hard work, the Novel Foods Regulation has collapsed in disarray because a suitable agreement on the cloning issue could not be found."
"Throughout the conciliation proceedings, I had warned that the stubborn refusal to compromise would lead to disaster and eventually it did."
"Now we are back to square one, and we have lost a considerable amount of important and beneficial legislation on novel foods."
"Conciliation proceedings are most certainly a useful mechanism in the legislative process, but they become futile and pointless if participants are not prepared to negotiate and to compromise."
"If the Parliament had not been so inflexible, then we would have a much needed update of the rules."
"Now we have to fall back on the 1997 Novel Foods Regulation, which is completely outdated."
"If the European Parliament is trying to show that it is a powerful, responsible legislative body which is proud to have achieved the Lisbon Treaty, I think it flunked its first test."
"The Commission now has to move forward and prepare separate legislation to cover cloning."
"I only hope that MEPs will learn from their mistakes and realise that it is the people of Europe who suffer if we cannot agree on these key issues."
"Madam President, I think that Mr Leinen put his finger on it."
"This is a dossier that is finely balanced between the interests of the meat processing industry and the agricultural industry and those of the consumer."
"I think that is the crux of the problem."
"I think that we, as Parliament, have done important work here, along with the rapporteur, who I would like to congratulate for all her efforts."
"We have worked hard and we have also shown ourselves to be flexible."
"We were prepared, at any given point, to make a number of concessions, but it was never enough."
"I do have reservations about the insufficiently flexible approach taken by the Commission to these concessions, but I am also not particularly satisfied with the Commission's stance - not with your position, directly, Mr Dalli, but at one point, one of your fellow Commissioners, the Belgian Commissioner, Mr De Gucht, went behind the backs of the conciliation committee to appear before this Parliament's Committee on International Trade, where he proceeded to present a whole series of sophisms."
"The grounds cited were connected with the WTO, and we all know - Mrs Lepage was quite right to say this - that such grounds are out of the question here."
"I think that the rapporteur will be coming back to this issue shortly."
"What needs to happen now?"
"Certainly, we have lost some time."
"I believe that we do now have to ask the Commission to bring forward a new proposal in respect of novel foods quickly - we know that that may be possible, as something approaching an agreement was reached."
"A proposal also needs to be brought forward about how we are going to deal with cloned food, meat from cloned animals and their offspring, and so on."
"I have a warning to give, Commissioner: I want to see this happen on schedule."
"I do not want to see this dossier kicked into the long grass and for us to then have it put before us at the end of our term or for it to be held over into the next parliamentary term."
"This is the Parliament that debated this dossier at first and second reading and in conciliation."
"It must therefore also be this Parliament that concludes it."
"Madam President, I would like to begin by expressing my sincere thanks to my fellow Members in this House and in the delegation for the universal support I received in the negotiations, right until the end."
"I am also full of admiration for the Hungarian ambassador, who really did all she could, as did Mr Dalli, in fact."
"It is a real pity that we were unable to reach agreement in relation to clones."
"Consumers can still find cloned products on their dinner tables, unsolicited and unlabelled, even though 77% of European citizens are opposed to this."
"I would say to the Council that banning clones alone is the politics of symbolism."
"The real key here is the banning of offspring."
"The clones themselves are so expensive that you would not make a hamburger out of them."
"We were thus unable to reach a compromise on this issue."
"The Council and the Commission both kept reiterating that a ban on offspring would be in contravention of World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules."
"Mr De Gucht then went further by coming to Parliament and saying that it would lead to a trade war."
"You can imagine, then, how surprised I was to read, clearly set out in a secret internal Council document that I got hold of - it is a document from the Legal Service of the Council of Ministers - that a ban on cloning offspring is actually perfectly justifiable under WTO rules."
"The document clearly stated that"
"'The bans [on] food from cloned animals and [...] food from offspring of clones could be justified on the basis of the consumers' ethical considerations'."
"(NL) I would like the Council to tell me whether all the Member States knew about this document."
"If so, why the constant use of the argument about global trade wars so that no compromise could be reached with Parliament?"
"I am now really curious to know what the real underlying reasons were."
"If the Member States' negotiators were not aware of this document, that is a scandal as far as I am concerned."
"If they were aware of it, then disingenuous arguments were used."
"Mr Dalli, the citizens await your next move."
"In my view, regulation must be brought forward very quickly now."
"You know that I am still prepared to collaborate and I am certain that we can find a solution."
"I will hand over the document to the Council."
"(FR) Madam President, what Mrs Liotard has just said is absolutely incredible."
"I would therefore like to press for an answer to the question she has just asked."
"I am utterly amazed and would like to ask the Commission if it was also in possession of this note."
"It is, in fact, unacceptable that, for weeks and weeks, we were being told that we would be engaging in open warfare with the WTO, that Mr De Gucht told us we would no longer be able to sell planes, that we would no longer be able to sell anything if we took that decision, when there was a legal note stating the exact opposite."
"I think this is a crucial issue from a political standpoint."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I think the Council has really outdone itself."
"It should be remembered that the persons who represent Europe's citizens are the ones democratically elected by them."
"Therefore, if Parliament has continually insisted in committee and in this Chamber that cloned meat is not acceptable to our people, the Council ought to have taken notice."
"Responsibility for this decision, which is very bad for business, lies wholly with the Council."
"Except for the part dealing with cloned meat and a few other foodstuffs, the text would have been adopted by a very large majority."
"The Council did not want it."
"It is the same Council that, on the one hand, declares itself in favour of the liberalisation of everything and, on the other, forces the removal of the 'Made in' wording on textiles because it does not want to give consumers the correct information, and is giving us a hard time over labelling because it does not want labels to indicate the place of origin or provenance of the food on our people's tables."
"That is the Council's position."
"Mr Pittella - and I thank him - did well to uphold the honour and the views of almost all Members of this House by rejecting the blackmailing proposal that the Council wanted to force on us."
"I therefore thank Mr Pittella, the rapporteur and all those Members who had the courage not to give an inch on what we considered truly useful for our people."
"(DE) Madam President, Mrs Győri, Mr Dalli, ladies and gentlemen, we are all disappointed and that is obvious, but I do not think that the responsibility lies with the European Parliament's negotiating delegation."
"In my opinion, the Commissioner and the Minister who are present are not responsible either."
"On the contrary, it was other representatives of the Council and the Commission who rushed to do their duty and identify problems in third countries which were not fully discussed."
"Mr De Gucht and representatives of the finance ministries, for example, from Germany, which is my home country, painted horrific pictures of trade wars on a larger scale than the banana war and a number of other issues."
"I do not believe that any of this had a basis in fact."
"Yesterday, I had the great pleasure of meeting with representatives of the American embassy from my country, who had come especially to Strasbourg and even spoke German with me, to discuss issues relating to food policy."
"The arguments of the American diplomats were not sufficiently convincing to prevent us from being able to find a solution."
"I asked them what their opinion on the subject was and I did not get the impression that it would have been impossible for us to come to an agreement with the Americans if we had wanted to."
"What particularly surprised me was that the Americans gave me this document describing origin labelling in the USA."
"For example, minced meat must be labelled in the USA."
"It must be clearly stated on a pack of hamburgers where the meat comes from."
"How can we talk about a trade war if, at the same time, we want to label cloned meat and the meat from descendants of cloned animals?"
"We should have made more effort in this area and not said immediately, as soon as the Americans expressed their doubts, that we could not do this."
"I am calling on the Commission to see this as an argument for producing a new proposal."
"We must be more self-confident if we want to implement this in the face of opposition from third countries."
"Madam President, the President-in-Office of the Council spoke about the need not to point a finger of blame, but I think it is time for some intellectual honesty."
"We all agree, yes, that we should not eat clones, but we all know that nobody is going to eat clones."
"Another big sticking point in the negotiations was the Council's failure to act on the import of embryos and semen into the EU, which allows farmers to breed offspring of clones."
"Those offspring are bred from clones who have suffered to be born."
"Commissioner, is it not true that we have, or soon will have, EU laws which prohibit the placing on the market of products from seals, of dog and cat fur, and of cosmetics which are tested on animals?"
"We have those laws, so why can we not have a law which prohibits the placing on the EU market of products which result from the cruel practice of cloning?"
"I agree with Ms Liotard."
"This is not a matter for the World Trade Organisation: it is a matter of political will, and we can show that, and that is what will satisfy this Parliament, and that is the basis for agreement."
"(DA) Madam President, a huge amount of work has gone into this regulation, both by Mrs Liotard and by the shadow rapporteurs."
"Many thanks for that."
"Unfortunately, it all ended, as we know, in disagreements about food from cloned animals."
"I come from a country where food from cloned animals is prohibited."
"However, cloning is nevertheless coming in through the back door."
"The subject is often brought up in guarded secrecy outside the debate."
"I find it strange that we want total transparency in everything from socks and television to medicines and banks, but when it comes to food, the situation is completely different."
"Colourants, gases to increase shelf life, growth hormones, antibiotics, GMOs and much more besides are used - preferably without consumers being able to read about it on the packaging."
"Why is no one interested in ensuring that foodstuffs are as natural as possible?"
"Why do we not pay more attention to our own health and welfare and that of our productive livestock?"
"I cannot understand why so little responsibility is shown for the health of children and adults in certain European circles."
"(FI) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it really is regrettable that this draft law was overturned, and I agree with my fellow Members who say that it was due to the fact that the Commission and the Council decided to give priority to the interests of the foreign meat industry."
"Their interests are the desire to do business by cloning animals, at the cost of animal suffering."
"Parliament, meanwhile, listened to European consumers, the overwhelming majority of whom do not want the use of cloning in meat or milk production, the overwhelming majority of whom want to reduce animal suffering, not increase it."
"Parliament has not actually been inflexible."
"It made huge concessions, and was ready to withdraw the ban on labelling."
"The Council did not even agree to this, and, as we have now heard from Mrs Liotard and Mr Liese, for example, the arguments put forward by the Council and the Commission were completely mendacious and were most likely even knowingly false."
"It is quite clear that no lasting solution to this problem will be found unless we take it as given that we should respect the will of European consumers to reduce animal suffering instead of increasing it."
"(FR) Madam President, I would first like to make a general observation."
"When we talk of consumers' lack of confidence in the institutions, I believe that is not the issue."
"It is often individuals who create such mistrust and who derive a personal interest from doing so."
"I will now get back to the substance."
"It is true that, at the end of a long night of negotiations, which lasted from 19:00 to 07:00, there was huge disappointment."
"It is true that the European Commission now has a huge task ahead of it, because it must submit new proposals and because developments in technology now make the revision of this legislation essential."
"When we think, for example, of nanomaterials, that appears very urgent."
"It is completely unacceptable that there is no control over cloning techniques or over the food resulting from these techniques, which could be intended for human consumption."
"There are clear principles and I believe that all of us in this Parliament are entirely in agreement."
"Consumers must be informed of the origin of food derived from cloned animals and their offspring."
"We must demand two things: traceability and labelling."
"I am in no doubt about the will of Commissioner Dalli to clarify this matter and to find the right solutions to the countless issues that remain unresolved."
"Traceability is essential."
"European consumers must be able to make an informed choice."
"As European legislators, we cannot afford to say to the public: 'Europe is doing nothing because we have not succeeded in reaching an agreement'."
"Commissioner, I know that you are endeavouring to overcome the institutional stalemates we are witnessing in order to give a firmer guarantee not only to consumers but also to food business operators."
"There is no time to spare and we must act quickly to find a way forward."
"Madam President, I am afraid I will be less diplomatic."
"I have to say to the Commissioner and the representative of the Council: you are again proposing a ban on food from cloned animals but nobody can buy food from cloned animals."
"Cloned animals are very expensive to use for food."
"It will be their descendants that are used for food."
"That is why we want a ban on their descendants, and why we want clear labelling of the descendants."
"I am afraid that your role in the negotiations was not productive."
"You were fighting against this labelling on descendants, which was a minimum common denominator with the Council."
"This was our chance to have an agreement."
"Please learn the lessons, listen to what this institution has to say on the issue, and come back to us with a decent proposal."
"(DE) Madam President, Mr Dalli, ladies and gentlemen, I also very much regret the fact that the negotiations have failed, in particular, because we will now have to wait for years until we have rules governing, for example, nanotechnology in foods and products from third countries which are currently unknown in Europe."
"It seems that by including cloned animals in this legislation, we have fallen into a trap."
"I must say that the way we have debated this issue has not been dignified."
"The discussions went on all night with each side going to and fro and neither wanting to give in."
"Then, in the end, the negotiations failed, which is very unfortunate."
"I would like to make one point."
"We are talking here about a number of subjects and about legislation."
"We used the same strategy for genetic engineering."
"We did not want genetic engineering and we significantly raised the limits and the requirements."
"What was the end result?"
"The technology developed to such an extent that it was even able to meet these high standards."
"We are currently discussing the fact that we do not want cloned animals because the animal welfare requirements are not being fulfilled, which gives rise to risks."
"I have spoken to the scientists and I predict that the technology will develop to such an extent that it will no longer be possible to apply a general ban on cloning animals."
"However, I believe that these scientific developments are highly questionable."
"We must look more closely at the basic principles that we need to lay down in order to put in place proper regulations."
"We should not attempt to slow down or even prevent certain developments by means of legislation."
"(RO) Madam President, I would like to begin by saying how disappointed I am in the failure of conciliation."
"Although whole months, and even years of work have been spent on this, the outcome is disappointing, especially at a time when agreement was possible on many items in this dossier."
"However, the rapporteur deserves all our appreciation for her efforts."
"On the issue of food from cloned animals and their offspring, Parliament was right when it maintained its point of view based on principle."
"We are aware that we are representing the will of European citizens when we oppose the presence of cloned animals and their offspring in the food chain."
"During the negotiations, the Council ignored these legitimate concerns, which is extremely regrettable."
"If we had accepted the Council's final proposal, we could not have claimed that we defended the wishes of ordinary citizens not to have cloned meat on their table."
"We were not prepared to approve laws which would have allowed food from the offspring of cloned animals to enter the market without it being labelled as such."
"As for the future, I would like to remind the Commission of the commitments which it made in October 2010, mainly, to ban cloning techniques for producing food in the European Union."
"Another commitment was to set up traceability systems for reproductive material originating from cloned animals outside the EU."
"These commitments were made on several occasions and must feature in the new proposals."
"I am confident that Member States will focus greater attention on the legitimate concerns of the European Union's citizens."
"(IT) Madam President, I agree with everything that the Members who have spoken before me have said."
"I, too, was a member of the delegation to the Conciliation Committee."
"As the negotiations went on, there were feelings of hope, disappointment and even rage, if I may say so, because we were there representing over 500 million people, the vast majority of whom - according to all the surveys and research - keep crying out that they do not want food from cloned animals or their offspring on their tables."
"Labelling and traceability were really the minimum on which we had taken a stand."
"Had we accepted the compromise, we would have found it empty."
"Mr Pittella is right: a dab of powder, a touch of rouge, perhaps a little wool pulled over the eyes, but nothing more than an empty shell."
"Let us not fool ourselves: nobody pays EUR 100 000 for a bull only to put it through the mincer and sell it as hamburgers."
"For all the rest, there was no regulation; we would have been accepting deregulation, and we cannot do that."
"Today, however, we are still here defending certain decisions and maintaining that it was a collective failure."
"It was not a collective failure, though, because there was agreement on practically everything, even though it failed miserably giving people the impression that big business and trade rules prevail over the European citizenry, whom we are here to represent and defend."
"I therefore call on absolutely everyone to start again with a fresh mind and a fresh outlook, because I hope and pray that the expectations and the will of the people will be respected next time."
"(LT) Madam President, probably everyone would agree that information is one of the main driving forces in the modern world."
"This rule also applies when talking about food safety."
"We are still considering and, hopefully, will adopt new rules on the provision of general information on foods to consumers, as well as different issues, such as fruit juice and derived products."
"Unfortunately, it was not possible to reach a compromise with the Council on novel foods and we have taken a step backwards."
"The majority of consumers do not want food products from cloned animals, but the reality is that they exist."
"It is therefore essential to ensure that the public is made aware."
"However, arguing that it could cause difficulties for business and producers, representatives of the Member States did not endorse the requirement for labelling or traceability, in other words, the minimum requirements for being able to ensure consumer awareness."
"Thus, consumers still have no way of knowing, whether, for example, the milk they are drinking comes from cloned animals."
"However, this is just one side of the coin."
"Now we have prevented new technologies, research and the use of results in the food industry."
"With such disagreement, we ourselves have postponed the solution of these problems indefinitely."
"We all expect emergency proposals from the European Commission that will help us to eliminate this legal impasse."
"Madam President, are we really surprised that we did not reach agreement?"
"Certainly, my view from the outside was that there were too many differences around the table, and I am not sure that starting at 7 p.m. a meeting which was doomed to fail at 7 a.m. was such a great idea, but we still have to resolve this particular problem and perhaps dividing the legislation into two parts might achieve it."
"The issue of cloning is a very sensitive issue, and there are animal welfare concerns which others have spoken about, but the issue of reproductive material needs to be addressed."
"We need clarity as to how this can be addressed within the WTO rules, because farmers in Europe want access to the best technologies available to them to be more productive."
"So, within that framework, we do have issues to resolve here in this House, and I hope that they can be resolved satisfactorily."
"Finally, on the issue of Europe's standards versus the rest of the world, we import meat products into the European Union."
"Are we as clear about what we are importing as we are demanding about what is produced within the EU itself?"
"This is also an issue which needs to be addressed."
"(DE) Madam President, Mr Dalli, firstly, I would like to thank Mr Dalli for his efforts in the area of prevention."
"I hoped and expected that we would see this level of commitment from him with regard to cloned materials."
"We have had several hours of intensive discussions and I see myself as a representative of the people of Europe who clearly support the position that Parliament has taken and want to see progress in this area."
"Together with 500 million Europeans, we want clear labelling as the minimum solution."
"In reality, we would like a ban on cloned animals and on products from cloned animals, regardless of which generation they come from."
"We hoped for your support, Mr Dalli."
"We did not understand why the Council was not on our side, because the Council is made up of elected representatives of the Member States."
"However, they were obviously serving the needs of the market and not those of the people."
"We hope that in future, you will put the people at the centre of your decision-making processes and not the market."
"(DE) Madam President, consumer protection policy is a central element of overall European policy."
"If we do not manage to provide consistent protection for consumers, then we will have totally failed in this respect."
"It is important to explain that it is not just the majority of consumers who do not want cloning, it is also the majority of farmers."
"I believe that some Member States have deliberately sabotaged the negotiations."
"They have decided to protect the agriculture industry and defend its interests."
"All the talk of an imminent trade war, which has been mentioned several times today, was simply a pretext."
"For reasons of European animal welfare policy alone, we should be taking measures against cloning, Mr Dalli, and we hope that you will draw up a regulation as quickly as possible."
"There is a need for action."
"We are calling on you not to wait for months, but to come to grips with this issue straight away."
"The ban on cloning is simply one step in the process."
"We must insist on a regulation being introduced which covers the descendants of cloned animals, otherwise the whole thing will be fundamentally ineffective."
"(SK) Madam President, I do not want to point fingers, but I think that the failure of the conciliation procedure is a setback and we have thrown out the baby with the bathwater."
"Cloning is not just a complex, but also a sensitive topic."
"Dolly the sheep was neither the first nor the last cloned animal."
"Tens of thousands of other attempts end in failure."
"Deformed foetuses with excessively large organs die in the wombs of experimental animals, others are born dead and others perish just a few days after birth."
"Cloning is a worse tyranny for animals than small cages or being transported in lorries without water."
"It is therefore right that the regulation on new foodstuffs includes a ban on the sale of cloned animals and their offspring."
"I do not believe it is highly complex to deal with the cloning issue now."
"We must now give a clear signal to food producers that products from animals that are suffering have no place on the European market."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, novel foods are food products or ingredients that undergo production processes and involve a change in nutritional value."
"I have a number of doubts about the new Novel Food Regulation."
"What relation will it bear to the regulation on genetically modified organisms (GMOs), since cloning is an aspect of genetic engineering and, as with GMOs, it involves actual genetic manipulation?"
"How will the movement of these foods between European countries be regulated?"
"How will the scientific tests needed to test the safety of these novel foods be carried out?"
"What will the criteria be for defining these products and, most of all, how will consumers be informed of the characteristics and nutritional properties of the novel foods they purchase?"
"My central concerns are consumer protection, food safety in the use of these novel products, and correct information."
"I therefore believe there must be total traceability for consumers, especially for natural products, for which we already find it difficult to guarantee traceability."
"(EL) Madam President, I believe that this entire issue has arisen due to a lack of information for consumers and the public."
"Where there is no transparency in information for the citizens of Europe and the world as a whole, impasses are created and we get nowhere."
"What I want to emphasise is that, when there is a strong reaction to such products, we and the decision makers and legislators need to toe the line demanded by public opinion."
"We therefore need information and transparency in everything we do if we are to finish what we have started."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I have taken careful note of the opinions expressed during the course of this debate."
"I would like to thank honourable Members for their views and assure them once again that the Commission will continue to work with Parliament, Member States and stakeholders from all sectors in pursuit of the common aim of moving forward as fast as possible with both proposals on novel food and cloning."
"I must stress that the position taken by the Commission during the conciliation - and we were advancing various proposals in this regard - was that, as I said before, any solution or any compromise that could be reached had to be implementable."
"It would be possible to implement, and it would be justified and proportionate."
"Whatever all of us would like to have - and as Commissioner responsible for consumers, I am all for information to consumers - this must, however, be evidence-based and we must have an impact assessment."
"That was our position."
"The Commission has never put forward a position against any type of labelling, but we were saying that every decision we take has to be assessed to ensure the impact it is going to have on our citizens at large, be they producers or be they consumers, and that is the position that I still hold."
"I can assure you that the Commission services and I will pursue this challenge with all determination and energy, and I also assure you, especially Mr Staes, that I do not put off decisions that need to be taken."
"Madam President, Commissioner, honourable Members, on behalf of the Presidency and the Council, thank you for the debate."
"I would like to express my special thanks for the speeches which acknowledged the efforts of the Hungarian Presidency and which recognised these efforts."
"We also welcome the fact that the arguments put forward during the conciliation procedure have been presented here."
"At the same time, we wish to repudiate statements or suggestions alleging that either the Council or the Hungarian Presidency acted dishonestly or in bad faith, or was under the influence of interest groups."
"The best aspect of the Treaty of Lisbon is that it increased our joint responsibility."
"We have tried and are trying to act in this spirit."
"We have been unable to agree, so now in this respect, any product may be served at our tables without restriction."
"This is worse than the Council's last offer would have been."
"Precisely what was that?"
"It was a ban on cloned animals and products derived from them, and the monitoring and labelling of first progeny, naturally within reasonable limits."
"One only has to think, for example, of the very many ingredients salami has."
"Reasonableness and pricing will set the limit."
"We wish to say specifically to Mrs Liotard that, as regards the internal Council document you quoted, the Member States were aware of it and naturally the Council was aware of it, and even discussed it."
"It helped in establishing our position."
"You cited a sentence taken in isolation from this document while failing to mention that the document states in its conclusions precisely that there are risks from the aspect of WTO compatibility, as well as that these conclusions also mention that the most acceptable solution is labelling, which, I repeat, was included in the Council's last offer."
"However, I agree with you all that we should move on as soon as possible."
"We hope that before long, we will know more about aspects of food safety due to scientific research and progress."
"I am pleased that Commissioner Dalli promised that there will be a new, separate draft on cloning and the subject of cloned products soon."
"Madam President, all the speeches made by the Members who have spoken before me - whom I thank, starting with the rapporteur - as well as the documentation presented by the rapporteur herself, which underlines the fact that our proposals, had they been accepted, would not have unleashed a trade war, have shown that there was no collective failure, and I repeat this to the Hungarian Presidency without wishing to be polemical."
"There certainly was a failure, but it was in an area for which the governments were clearly responsible."
"Let nobody tell me that merely labelling beef from cloned animals or their offspring could be considered an honourable and satisfactory agreement for Parliament, because this was little more than no agreement at all."
"Let us now draw a veil over all that and look to the future."
"It is, first of all, the Council's job to get the governments to agree once they know what Parliament's positions are, which are the positions of the people of Europe."
"Labelling of products from cloned animals and their offspring is the minimum we will settle for. Work is needed within and between governments to accept this minimum."
"I therefore call on Commissioner Dalli - who I know is very willing - to table a Commission proposal incorporating our positions as soon as possible, so as to allow this House to approve the regulation on cloning."
"We must also go ahead on nanomaterials, and now that the cloning part has been removed, we can move quickly on these."
"I have one final comment: you have all noticed how united Parliament is."
"This is substantial, 360 degree unity."
"You may perhaps have made a mistake during the negotiations, thinking that there was no cohesion in the European Parliament."
"Please do not make that mistake again, because on sensitive issues relating to people's health, we are and will remain united."
"(NL) Madam President, this is actually a point of order."
"Several times in the debate, the position of Commissioner De Gucht has been mentioned."
"Mrs Lepage asked Commissioner Dalli whether he was aware of the Council's legal advice."
"I heard Mr Dalli give many answers to our questions, but I did not hear an answer to that question, even though it is a crucial one."
"Is this perhaps a matter of a lack of consensus within the Commission, as Mr Dalli is in the Commission as the Commissioner for Health and Consumer Policy, while Mr De Gucht, by all accounts, came out with false arguments that were invalidated by a Council document."
"I would like to hear from the Commissioner what his view on this is."
"The debate is closed."
"Small Business Act review (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on"
"the oral question to the Council on the Small Business Act (SBA) review by Bendt Bendtsen, on behalf of the PPE Group, Edit Herczog, on behalf of the S&D Group, Fiona Hall, on behalf of the ALDE Group, Reinhard Bütikofer, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, Giles Chichester, on behalf of the ECR Group, and Niki Tzavela, on behalf of the EFD Group - B7-0301/2011),"
"the oral question to the Commission on the Small Business Act (SBA) review by Bendt Bendtsen, on behalf of the PPE Group, Edit Herczog, on behalf of the S&D Group, Fiona Hall, on behalf of the ALDE Group, Reinhard Bütikofer, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, Giles Chichester, on behalf of the ECR Group, and Niki Tzavela, on behalf of the EFD Group - B7-0302/2011)."
"Mr President, the economic crisis has had an effect on Europe's small and medium-sized enterprises."
"In addition, there are the new Basel rules that are now to be implemented in the forthcoming Capital Requirements Directive."
"This will probably make it even more difficult for small and medium-sized enterprises to obtain capital for the growth that Europe needs."
"In this resolution, the European Parliament is sending a clear signal to the Commission that it is now that the necessary decisions need to be taken to benefit our small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Now it is true that politicians should not be running businesses, but they should be involved in creating the fertile soil in which Europe's businesses can grow."
"I am pleased that we will now have a revision of the Small Business Act."
"We must take relevant action instead of merely toasting our European enterprises."
"There is an urgent need for better access to financing for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"There is also a need for enhanced market access, including the modernisation of the standardisation system within the EU, and for better access for small and medium-sized enterprises to public procurement opportunities."
"Finally, I would like to mention that we need to reduce our enterprises' administrative burden, in connection with reporting, for example."
"Why should small business owners have to submit a report more than once?"
"Once should be enough."
"The public authorities should deal with the further distribution of the information themselves."
"We must consider the fact that, when we produce new legislation in the EU and get it implemented in the Member States, we often impose even more burdens on our small and medium-sized enterprises."
"It is therefore not enough simply to reduce the number. We must also ensure, every time we produce legislation, that we do not create additional burdens for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Overall, we need to make it easier for businesses to operate in Europe and we need to act now."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I beg your pardon."
"I glanced up at the public gallery for an instant as I have the good fortune that a visiting group from Hungary also happens to be present right now."
"The Small Business Act has become incorporated into European thinking in recent times."
"Based on the practical experience of the last two years, now is the time to review, update and strengthen the Small Business Act."
"We, the posers of the question, have summarised the most important issues in 34 points in the proposal for a decision."
"I would like to mention a few of these."
"Implementation is very important."
"The Member States have done their work with different degrees of efficiency and commitment with consequent success."
"We would like a single database and results table to measure success and excesses."
"Commissioner, in our view, the aim is not to infringe employees' rights in any way but to create jobs."
"Reducing administration is not the same as infringing upon employees' rights, but rather the opportunity must be created for micro and small enterprises to cooperate."
"As regards access to financial resources, it is very important that the use of funds available at European Union level be more efficient."
"We have achieved 75% efficiency until now and roughly 50 000 SMEs have received funds in this way."
"At the same time, approximately 300 000 SMEs have managed to access funding under the competitiveness and innovation programme."
"We must definitely strengthen and preserve this."
"It is very important that the institutional network helps small and medium-sized enterprises."
"For this reason, the European Enterprise Network must be strengthened."
"We would very much like to find a solution that allows the Erasmus programme for young entrepreneurs to continue."
"We would like all the 23 million small and medium-sized enterprises to be able to hire at least one more employee."
"In this way, we could make a significant contribution to improving the labour market situation."
"However, it is highly important that the labour force working for small and medium-sized enterprises be better qualified than at present."
"It is especially important that they can take part in the implementation of the Green Economy programme and obtain digital skills."
"The most important thing for us is that young entrepreneurs with small and medium-sized businesses should not regard different forms of enterprise as losers but as winners."
"author. - Mr President, the Small Business Act was given a warm welcome by SMEs, but that was two years ago."
"It is really important that we now show small businesses that this was not just a piece of paper."
"On the issue of administrative burden, the target should not be a once-off which we reach and then abandon."
"It is something we have to keep working on. I am particularly concerned about the situation that micro-businesses find themselves in."
"It is all right - or it is relatively all right - for a small business of 249 employees that has specialist administrative staff but, for a micro-business with one or two staff, over-regulation can actually make trading impossible."
"We should not forget that micro-businesses of less than 10 employees actually make up over 90% of all EU businesses."
"Micro-businesses really need to be treated like family units and, in particular, the EU and its Member States need to work together to look at how small businesses can be given upfront support for energy efficiency improvements."
"Indeed, the broader question of finance for SMEs is vital."
"Just before Easter, a number of MEPs from the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy went to California to see how investment works in Silicon Valley."
"What we discovered was that venture capital was much more available than in Europe, and that those who provided it were much more risk-taking in their approach."
"Californian venture capitalists expect nine out of ten investments to fail."
"The one in ten which succeeds pays for all the rest, but the motto is 'fail fast'."
"There is much we can learn about how we could better support our own innovative small businesses in Europe."
"Perhaps not least, we should not stigmatise failure but rather use it as a step to success."
"author. - Mr President, there is a fundamental paradox in EU policy on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)."
"On the one hand, there is almost unanimous support for their importance to the economy, to employment, wealth creation, innovation and flexibility, and their overall sheer size within the economy."
"If positive rhetoric could be converted into orders and cash in the bank, then the Union's SMEs would be in great shape."
"However, the big challenge - which is addressed in this resolution - is how to convert warm words into useful deeds without just throwing money at SMEs - money that is not available in today's economy."
"On the other hand, the EU combines this positive sentiment with plenty of legislation on employment protection and environmental requirements: legislation which is well-intentioned but all of which bears most heavily on SMEs, increasing the administrative burden on small business when we should be reducing it."
"There are many constructive suggestions in this resolution."
"I particularly like the proposal for combating the practice known in my country as 'gold plating', whereby national authorities add layers of regulation to European measures."
"My personal view, as one who worked in a small business for 25 years, is that actually, while it would be nice to reduce this burden of administration, the best we can do for small businesses is to improve access to information and to finance."
"Mr President, it does not happen every day in Parliament that Members of six different political groups table a joint question which leads to a debate."
"Today, we have a case of this kind and it is no coincidence that it concerns the role of small and medium-sized businesses."
"This is a commonly held and broad-based concern."
"One of the questions we are asking is: What is the Commission doing to further strengthen the particularly successful financial instruments in future for small and medium-sized companies?"
"One of these successful instruments is the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP)."
"What will happen to CIP when the common strategic framework for research and innovation is developed?"
"What opportunities will there be for small and medium-sized enterprises in this context?"
"It will definitely not be possible to make the concept of innovation so broad and far-reaching that it covers all the relevant activities and all small and medium-sized businesses."
"However, we must not make the mistake of only promoting the competitiveness of those small and medium-sized firms which have been identified as being particularly innovative."
"Therefore, I believe that it is very important for the right decisions to be made in the common strategic framework."
"I would also like to mention specifically that this also concerns the issue of the criteria on which simplification and the reduction of red tape are based."
"CIP is already much less bureaucratic than the Seventh Framework Programme."
"It would not be sensible to apply the standards of the Seventh Framework Programme in the case of small and medium-sized companies."
"We need to find a practical way of continuing the measures which have been good for small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular, in programmes such as CIP, so that these activities do not fall by the wayside during the course of a reorganisation."
"author. - Mr President, I would like to congratulate my colleagues on their contribution to this very useful resolution and to state that I agree with all that has been said so far."
"Nevertheless, I have made some amendments on a couple of issues which I feel could be constructive and useful contributions to the final text."
"Firstly, there is no mention in the text of the effects of illegal trade on small businesses."
"Unfortunately, in this day and age, illegal trade is a reality and a phenomenon which is growing in all Member States."
"To put it simply, illegal trade is one of the biggest obstacles to the emergence and growth of Europe's small businesses."
"My second comment concerns the Commission's 'second chance' initiative for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)."
"In these times of economic difficulty especially, it is important to support SMEs and help them to develop."
"This leads me to my last point."
"I think it is regrettable that few of our innovative SMEs grow into larger companies and that there are fewer young, R&D-intensive, innovative firms in the EU than in the USA."
"Significant shortages in innovation-related skills prevent SMEs from adopting innovative smart business models and new technologies."
"This is an issue we must address, and we must cultivate in Europe the risk-taking spirit that exists in the USA among the young generation of Americans."
"Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, I am grateful to Parliament for the interest shown in the Small Business Act and the opportunity afforded by this especially to discuss what action we should take with regard to the different initiatives mentioned in relation to the review of the Small Business Act."
"The Small Business Act is a very important tool which helps us create a more favourable business environment for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Small and medium-sized enterprises make a major contribution to the European economy as the vast majority of companies belong to this category and they provide jobs for over 90 million people throughout Europe."
"For this reason, the full implementation of the policy for small and medium-sized enterprises and, in particular, the Small Business Act, is a high priority task for the Hungarian Presidency."
"The success of our competitiveness strategy depends on how our policy initiatives affect small and medium-sized enterprises."
"One of the keys to future growth is that highly competitive and innovative small and medium-sized enterprises should operate in Europe."
"Accordingly, the Council welcomes with great pleasure the Commission's communication on the review of the Small Business Act, which was published on 23 February 2011."
"In the communication, the Commission suggests various new initiatives in several priority areas for further action to be taken."
"These initiatives were created as the result of wide-ranging consultations with associations of small and medium-sized enterprises and the relevant authorities."
"Thus, they duly bear in mind the interests of both the enterprises themselves and other stakeholders."
"The Commission's communication was discussed at the informal meeting of competitiveness ministers in Gödöllő in Hungary on 13 April 2011."
"At these talks, the ministers fully supported the Presidency's opinion that the four main issues to be handled as priorities are smart regulation, financing, internationalisation and governance."
"More work is needed to enable us to make progress in these issues."
"At the same time, it is the Presidency's firm intention to maintain the impetus of the process at the meeting of the Competitiveness Council to be held on 31 May 2011, which will also consider the mid-term review of the Small Business Act."
"At the aforementioned meeting, the Presidency would like the Council to adopt conclusions in which the 'think small first' principle is applied in particular, that is to say, the principle which the Commission's communication is based on."
"As regards the status of the European private company, the European Commission first made a recommendation on the subject in a Council draft regulation in 2008."
"The idea behind the proposal was to make it easier for small and medium-sized enterprises to do business in the single market, and this must result in reducing costs and increased economic growth."
"Some concerns arose in the Council about certain aspects and parts of the proposal."
"Despite the commendable efforts of the Swedish and Belgian presidencies, the Member States have not managed to reach agreement to this day."
"I can assure the honourable Members that the Hungarian Presidency is striving to find the way to progress with regard to the particularly problematic issues of this proposal and will continue to do all it can to bring the matter to a successful conclusion."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, many thanks to the honourable Members for this important oral question and your debate."
"I will respond to the question on behalf of my colleague, Vice-President Antonio Tajani."
"In fact, small and medium-sized enterprises account for 99% of all European enterprises and generate most of the value-added of the real economy and create two-thirds of the jobs in the private sector."
"The EU is relying on SMEs and is creating the conditions under which they can develop and grow in order to create jobs in competitive markets."
"SMEs need less red tape, easier access to finance green markets and skills that match the needs of the real economy."
"These are the principles behind our SME policy as presented in the review of the Small Business Act for Europe."
"I will outline five avenues of work in the frame of your five questions in the oral question in my response on behalf of the Commission."
"In the review, the Commission invites the Member States to systematically assess the impact of the legislation on SMEs by using the SME test."
"The European Parliament and the Commission are working together on a study of the application of the SME test in the Member States and at European level."
"The Commission will use this test as a basis for planning additional measures to support implementation and the exchange of best practice."
"We are also currently completing a study on the problems associated with licensing and official authorisation, company transfer and bankruptcy procedures in the Member States."
"The study will enable the Commission and, in particular, the Member States, to plan appropriate measures for applying the 'think small first' principle to administrative services."
"This will be made possible in particular by expanding online administration and the one-stop shop in line with the recommendations made in the review."
"Secondly, a new system of governance will be introduced."
"The Commission has invited the Member States to appoint a SME representative - 'Ms or Mr SME' - to monitor the implementation of the SBA at national level."
"The national representatives will be members of a consultative group for the SBA which will help to assess and disseminate information concerning the measures taken to support SMEs."
"They will meet for the first time at the SBA Conference in Budapest on 24 and 25 May this year."
"Thirdly, SMEs are intended to be the main beneficiaries of the European programme to reduce the administrative burden."
"The Commission has submitted to the Council and the EP proposals for reducing administrative costs very substantially - by up to over 30% when they are implemented - while the proposals already adopted will reduce administrative costs by 22%."
"The Commission is relying on the Parliament to ensure that our proposals are adopted as soon as possible."
"Certain proposals, such as the review of the Fourth Accounting Directive, will benefit SMEs in particular."
"When it has been adopted by the Council and Parliament, the review of the Fourth Accounting Directive will enable Member States to exempt very small enterprises from certain accounting obligations."
"Fourthly, the SBA has also created a framework to enable SMEs to take up the challenge of energy efficiency by improving their energy management and seizing the opportunities presented by the environmental market."
"The action plan to encourage eco-innovation will also be implemented, paying particular attention to SMEs by promoting networking, low carbon technologies and efficient management of the use of resources."
"We will also continue developing action specifically devoted to environment and energy experts within the Enterprise Europe network."
"Finally, as part of the flagship initiative on the Agenda for new skills and jobs, the Commission will assess future skills needs in micro- and craft-type enterprises."
"An initial study on identification of future skills requirements in micro- and craft-type enterprises up to 2020 has just been published."
"It identifies the actions which need to be taken to meet future skills requirements, promote them more effectively and include them more systematically in training programmes for both micro-enterprises and craft-type enterprises."
"Mr President, Mrs Győri, Commissioner, today, we find ourselves discussing in this House a joint proposal for a resolution on the revision of the Small Business Act, which the Commission submitted in February."
"The relationship between small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and the economy can be defined in many ways, but in a sense, they are the axis around which any economic system revolves, in this case, the European economies."
"If they are strong, the economy will do well; if they are weak, the economy will do badly."
"SMEs generate jobs, growth and, accordingly, prosperity for society."
"I shall refer to three factors that seem to me to be fundamental to achieving a strong network of enterprises."
"First, the adoption of information and communication technology and the development of technologies such as online administration or cloud computing, which save money, reduce costs and effort and, therefore, improve the competitiveness of SMEs."
"Second, innovation, which is equally fundamental in this sector."
"Accordingly, up-and-coming enterprises in the small and medium-sized business sector must be strongly incentivised."
"Third, SMEs must be able to participate fully in the internal market, both in terms of cross-border public tendering and as regards all other features of the internal market, which are capable of providing extraordinary benefits to SMEs in terms of their competitiveness but are currently failing to do so."
"Finally, after all this comes the value of entrepreneurship, a social value which must be strong since, if it is not, the whole network will be weak."
"In this area, both governments and the European Union have much to do, principally through education."
"Mr President, certainly, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have the advantage of being flexible and agile and close to the customer, which enables them to make decisions much more quickly."
"These are very important characteristics in times of crisis, when the ability to respond quickly is vital."
"Moreover, as we well know, they make up more than 90% of the fabric of our business sector and they are a valuable model that we must maintain, because the effects of a large business failing or relocating are much more devastating, above all, in employment terms."
"For that reason, we, and governments in particular, cannot afford to throw a spanner in the works of these businesses."
"For that reason, we approved the Small Business Act and, for that reason also, exercises such as this one are vital to the continuing progress of Member States in applying the political and legislative measures that we have agreed."
"Ladies and gentlemen, European SMEs urgently need the firm political will to improve their access to public tenders that is contained in the Small Business Act to be converted into real, tangible, operative measures."
"We applaud the measures that some Member States have taken, such as dividing tenders into lots and improving electronic access to information from centralised websites and interactive web pages, but we do not think that this is sufficient."
"From this House, we must insist that those responsible for public procurement within the various administrative bodies incorporate terms into their tender specifications that facilitate positive discrimination in favour of SMEs and remove contractual provisions that hinder their participation."
"Mr President, Mr Rehn, the joint question on the review of the Small Business Act shows that there is still a great deal to be done to ensure that medium-sized companies in Europe have freedom to act, particularly on a national level."
"However, I am pleased that in recent years, we have succeeded in implementing almost all the provisions of the Small Business Act in the European Union."
"Most recently, a new directive on combating late payment in commercial transactions came into force in March, which will make an important contribution to improving payment practice in Europe."
"Now the Member States have two years to implement the new directive."
"I would like to call for this timeframe to be shortened, in particular, in the Member States where this would not present a significant problem."
"Instead of delaying implementation for two years, it could be completed, where possible, within one year."
"The Member States have not yet been able to agree on the statute for a European private company."
"Therefore, I very much welcome the fact that the Hungarian Presidency is following up this issue and making it one of the focal points of its work."
"This form of company in particular could enable small and medium-sized enterprises to save a great deal of money."
"I am thinking, in particular, of accounting, establishing a company and ongoing legal advice."
"Therefore, I would like to say again how pleased I am that the Hungarian Presidency is focusing on this area."
"The issue just mentioned by Mrs Riera Madurell is also important, and that is public procurement."
"Here, we can still achieve a great deal for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"There are many bureaucratic regulations in this area and it is often particularly difficult for small and medium-sized businesses to take part in the public procurement process."
"We need greater transparency and we must also try to make the most of the opportunities presented by the modern media and, in particular, the Internet."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, the Small Business Act is precisely what we, as politicians and legislators, should be focusing on as we look for ways of fostering new growth and re-energising our economies."
"SMEs make up more than 98% of the businesses in my rural constituency of Wales."
"As public sector jobs in the UK as a whole are becoming less certain, and more of my constituents are, I hope, going to be either setting up or working for small businesses, I fully support and endorse the ambitious targets for reducing the administrative burden on SMEs, and goals such as the SME test for all legislation."
"Coupled with the 'one in, one out' policy for regulation that my own government is operating, these measures should begin to achieve our objective."
"But now is the time to be bold, to be more ambitious and to achieve more."
"I have seen so much creativity in Wales, as it develops into a hub of activity for new businesses in the highly profitable global gaming world and a centre for cultural excellence with regard to film and programme production, yet I find myself asking questions about how to foster and encourage this development."
"Big projects like the European patent and the Digital Agenda need to deliver for these small businesses, providing jobs and a future for people in Wales and the whole of the EU."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr President, this review's 10 principles include helping SMEs to benefit from opportunities of the single market, but the eurozone is collapsing, so how can it provide more opportunities?"
"It also wants SMEs to benefit from the growth in markets."
"What growth?"
"In September 2009, I asked Commissioner Andor what specific measures he would introduce to assist SMEs, following my similar request of him when he spoke to the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on taking up the portfolio."
"I got no answers then, but now it seems I have some."
"The review's five guidelines to reduce pressure on SMEs include simplifying the rules on VAT and reducing the rates, and a directive on late payments, but that is just tinkering with existing rules and regulations."
"The first principle of the review - creating a right environment - should not mean proposing new rules such as European private companies and state aids."
"It should mean ripping rules out by the hundred."
"After all, Commission President Barroso said in this House in July last year: 'red tape is strangling SMEs'."
"(PL) Mr President, legislation which is too complex or unintelligible, which is too strict, or which does not keep up with the latest changes, is obviously not conducive to development or progress."
"As coordinator of the Committee on Legal Affairs, I would therefore like to draw particular attention to the importance, during the legislative procedure, of observing the principle of including small and medium-sized enterprises in ex ante and post ante impact assessments."
"This would make it possible, as early as during the law making process, to identify and eliminate obstacles which may be posed by new regulations for a sector which, after all, is the flywheel of the European economy."
"Similarly, complying with the principles of 'think small first' and 'only once', and limiting the excessively strict transposition of the requirements of EU directives into national regulations, by bodies in the Member States naturally, will result in a noticeable reduction in the administrative burden on the SME sector."
"Both the Stoiber working group and the review of the Small Business Act presented by the European Commission have confirmed that administrative obstacles and excessive burdens relating to control measures often cause delays, and sometimes even prevent the further expansion of small companies which have the potential to generate new jobs."
"I therefore also regard it as legitimate to ask whether the analysis promised by the European Commission, concerning a reduction of the administrative burden to 25% of its current level, is available yet."
"I also agree with the proposals to the effect that both the EU institutions and the Member States should be guided by these principles when creating new legislation or revising existing legislation."
"It is alarming to learn that implementation of the Small Business Act is coming up against many obstacles in the Member States, although the examples of several countries show that following these principles yields good results."
"Finally, I should also like to draw your attention to the significance of the ongoing work on European contract law, and the work on the establishment of a European patent protection system which has begun in the Committee on Legal Affairs."
"There can be no doubt that good regulations in this area will give a direct boost to the development of innovation, particularly as regards the activities and growth of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"(RO) Mr President, at the end of March 2011, the European Union had an unemployment rate of 9.5%, with a rate of 9.9% in the euro area."
"What is of even greater concern is that the youth unemployment rate is almost double the unemployment rate for the whole population."
"Improving the business environment and access to funding, as well as facilitating SMEs' access to the Structural Funds, will foster the development of an entrepreneurial spirit."
"SMEs need legislative and fiscal stability."
"Repeated amendments to tax legislation or changes to the conditions for accessing the various types of funds make it difficult for them to do business."
"Another issue, especially during times of crisis, is that SMEs are affected by the delay from public institutions in settling their invoices."
"All these factors affect SMEs' forecasts for achieving their business plans, as well as their business and, most of all, their innovative capacity."
"Between 2006 and 2008, SMEs managed to win just 33% of the total value of public procurement contracts."
"Given that public procurement contracts account for 17% of the European Union's GDP, we think that SMEs need to increase their involvement in the public procurement market."
"This is why we call on the Commission and Member States to take the necessary measures by 2015 to ensure that at least 50% of public procurement transactions are carried out electronically, in keeping with the commitment made by Member State governments in Manchester in 2005."
"I should point out that the single market is not in operation yet in the services sector, which is having an adverse impact on SMEs' business activities in the European Union."
"In 2008, the Commission presented, as part of the European Economic Recovery Plan, the programme which involved the European Investment Bank offering a global package of EUR 30 billion in loans earmarked for SMEs."
"The EIB intended to supplement the loans for medium-sized businesses with EUR 1 billion a year."
"I would like to ask the Commission at what stage of implementation this programme is at, whether it intends to top up the funding, and whether these funds are distributed equally to all Member States."
"(IT) Mr President, three million jobs have been lost in comparison with several million euro invested in support policies."
"That is the disastrous outcome, in terms of impact on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), first of the triumphal Lisbon project, and then of the 'photocopy' Europe 2020 strategy, on which we are even deciding to focus resources from the next multiannual financial framework for 2014-2020."
"I therefore cannot but stress what thousands of European citizens and taxpayers are wondering: what use is Europe if it cannot solve the economic problems of the continent, if it cannot speak with a single voice on matters of foreign policy, and if it squanders money?"
"I hope that what Commissioner Tajani has said on several occasions comes true."
"I hope that the review of the SME code really is able to simplify red tape, ensure access to and recovery of credit, and facilitate internalisation."
"With the Late Payments Directive, we have reached a real, concrete goal, but as a result of political will and not Europropaganda."
"If the costs of the umpteenth strategy will still only finance talk, I call on the European institutions to make amends to the dozens of small entrepreneurs in my region, Veneto, who have taken their lives rather than see their small businesses fail."
"(LV) Mr President, Commissioner, parents very often pay attention to the child that cries the loudest, although in truth, attention ought to be paid to another child entirely."
"Similarly, politicians and the press pay attention most often to large companies, which have a lot of money, which have a big voice, although attention ought rather to be paid to others, that is to say, small enterprises."
"For us in Europe, large enterprises are like large trees, but these large trees do not make up the whole enterprise wood."
"A few figures."
"Over 90% of enterprises in the whole of Europe are small and medium-sized, not large."
"Approximately three quarters of all those in employment work in small and medium-sized enterprises, which produce the same proportion of Europe's gross domestic product."
"The time has come for us to switch our attention from large enterprises, which are loud, I should not like to say - like children - but they are loud, and pay attention to the quieter ones, most of whom work after all with the small ones."
"In this context, then, Commissioner, I call upon you to pay greater attention to your own Commission's commitment to reduce the administrative burden for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"You can do this by evaluating your legislation, and not by introducing regulations that make the administrative burden more costly."
"By supporting small and medium-sized enterprises, we shall be acting more swiftly to encourage economic growth throughout the European Union. Thank you for your attention."
"(DE) Mr President, I wanted to ask Mr Balčytis what he thinks of the Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs programme, because he has mentioned that the financial situation in this area has become highly precarious as a result of the crisis."
"I have heard that the Commission intends to limit the scope of this programme."
"Do you not believe that it would be more sensible in the light of the financial crisis to ensure that the owners of small and medium-sized companies have the opportunity to find out about new areas of business?"
"(LT) Thank you very much for this question."
"How we plan to restructure our society, and who, in future, will have to deal with the main issues, not just for small business, but big business as well - this really is a priority issue of our future."
"The Erasmus programme you mentioned is also very important and I believe that in future, the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament should all increase their efforts to ensure that such programmes do not suffer, and that henceforth we have people, better prepared people, to implement many of the theoretical wishes that we have expressed here today."
"After all, someone has to put theory into practice."
"I agree with you entirely that Parliament should not consent to reducing such programmes in the future."
"(PL) Mr President, the work currently being carried out on the review of the Small Business Act should concentrate, in particular, on establishing a European Private Company Statute, thus facilitating the cross-border operations of economic entities in the EU market."
"Although the time taken to set up a company has dropped in recent months, an analysis carried out by the European Commission has showed that over half of Member States still do not meet the requirement for it to be possible to do so in three days."
"Furthermore, the majority of Member States are still not carrying out assessments of the impact of future legislative and administrative initiatives on SMEs, and the 'only once' principle is also not being applied in full."
"Over the past two years, the list of countries in which it has been possible to close down a business entirely within a year has remained the same."
"I would therefore suggest that the European Commission should become even more involved in efforts to ensure that the Member States implement these provisions."
"In addition, I believe that further measures under the Small Business Act should also cover improved availability of funding, access to risk capital markets and the development of points of single contact in the Member States to facilitate administrative procedures."
"It is worth pointing out that in order to achieve our objective of an employment level of 75%, as enshrined in the Europe 2020 strategy, it is imperative to support SMEs."
"As a result of the economic crisis, these SMEs are feeling the strain of a series of additional expenses, instead of generating jobs."
"(RO) Mr President, the Small Business Act needs to be brought into line with the Europe 2020 strategy priorities to improve the regulatory environment to meet the needs of SMEs."
"This means that the measures presented need to be implemented quickly, in their entirety, especially the 'think small first' principle."
"I think that particular attention must be focused on supporting large-scale funding for innovative companies."
"According to the Commission's assessment, Romania is a model of good practice in applying the principle of 'promoting entrepreneurship through the Start business programme'."
"The programme has a budget of EUR 21.2 million and is aimed at developing management skills among young people."
"I have also noted progress in the implementation of the principle of 'accessing funding for SMEs'."
"The government is supporting the set-up and development of at least 1 100 SMEs for young people."
"(RO) Mr President, I want to start by welcoming the European Commission's proposals for reviewing the Small Business Act for Europe."
"In practical terms, the European Commission notes in its communication of 23 February 2011 the quite significant progress which has been made since the Small Business Act was adopted in June 2008, but warns about the challenges remaining."
"Therefore, SMEs still have problems in expanding their activities, improving their innovative capacity, accessing markets and obtaining funding, and face excessive red tape."
"In most cases, when it comes to transposing the directives into national legislation, the bureaucratic requirements laid down by the European Union are actually exceeded."
"In order to ensure greater transparency, each Member State should produce tables comparing national bureaucratic measures with those required by EU directives."
"An assessment also needs to be made of the impact which the new EU legislative proposals could have on SMEs."
"(SK) Mr President, more than two years have passed since the adoption of the Small Business Act initiative, and it is therefore right and proper that in February, the Commission issued a notification of the review of this initiative."
"It seems that our efforts to promote a more favourable legislative environment for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have so far failed to make a sufficient impression in the business sector itself."
"On the basis of discussions with representatives of organisations representing SMEs, the Commission has therefore prepared further measures through which we can help to improve their situation."
"In my opinion, we must, above all, focus more on implementing the new rules in national legislation."
"The experience from my own country shows me that national bureaucracies are unbelievably obstructive, and stubbornly resist all changes that would limit their ability to victimise small businesses."
"I therefore believe we must persevere with the simplification of rules for SMEs patiently and rigorously, and trust that our efforts will somehow bring the expected result."
"(DE) Mr President, one particularly positive feature of the Small Business Act is the provision which makes it easier to establish companies in terms of both time and cost."
"I also welcome the obligation on the public sector to pay invoices within 30 days."
"However, some bureaucratic obstacles remain in place, for example, as far as cash flow is concerned."
"We need to evaluate to what extent the Basel criteria could cause a serious credit crunch for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"As far as the cross-border area is concerned, we should finally get the European private company under way."
"From the perspective of the cost-benefit factor, this form of company could, in future, be more important than the European company."
"I am thinking in this respect of subsidiaries and transfers of registered offices throughout Europe."
"Finally, I would just like to say that we need to follow up on the measures to give small and medium-sized businesses access to China and other markets in Asia."
"(HU) Mr President, I agree with the statement in the review that further measures are needed."
"I believe it is important for the European Union to have a better overview of how the governments of the Member States implement the Small Business Act."
"The mid-term review is also important because the problems of small and medium-sized enterprises - the difficulties of obtaining funding, the size of administrative burdens, overregulation and market access problems - appear to be becoming permanent."
"I think it is a good idea as well to enable small enterprises to register themselves as European private companies, thereby reducing the administrative burdens and, at the same time, realising smart regulation is an extremely timely issue."
"A high priority in this is spreading the 'only once' principle across Europe and examining whether the regulatory framework of certain policy areas is as it should be and, if it is not, what changes are required."
"Mr President, it is a fact that, if every SME created one extra job, unemployment would finish in Europe."
"That is not actually an impossible task."
"Instead, however, many of them are shedding jobs, partly due to the recession, but also due to a preponderance of regulation and red tape."
"This certainly needs to be tackled urgently."
"I am pleased to say that our new government yesterday announced measures to help SMEs which were broadly welcomed by the business community today - measures relating to VAT, PRSI, travel tax and internships."
"At European level, it is essential that we tackle fraud in particular."
"The black market economy is thriving and needs to be tackled on a European-wide basis."
"We also need to encourage businesses to avail themselves of the opportunities in e-commerce and establish a European-wide patent."
"If we do this, we can actually end unemployment and also help the creation of many new businesses."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Small Business Act review is a great opportunity if it is based on an understanding of how precious our small and medium-sized enterprises are."
"In the economic fabric of Italy, small and medium-sized enterprises represent a major and essential part of the production market."
"They are even more important in southern Italy, where I come from, because the whole productive fabric is organised around small and medium-sized enterprises."
"In the past, entire industrial areas were teeming with small businesses that guaranteed thousands of jobs."
"Today, many of those businesses have gone bankrupt or closed, not least because of unfair competition, as the students from Barletta who are here today are well aware."
"Europe therefore needs to send out a strong, effective signal to guarantee less red tape, lower costs, greater transparency and shorter delays in payments, and to ensure the stability that small and medium-sized enterprises demand and need so much."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, many thanks to the honourable Members for a very serious and substantive discussion."
"The Commission is aware that more needs to be done; this has been underlined by several Members, and I fully agree that the well-being of small and medium-sized enterprises is crucial for Europe's recovery, for growth and for employment."
"When our SMEs do well, the European economy does well."
"I can assure you that the implementation of the 'think small first' principle and the actions proposed in the Small Business Act are a foremost priority for the Commission."
"I want to thank you for your support in this regard."
"The Commission is looking forward to working closely with all relevant players, especially the European Parliament, to ensure effective implementation of the Small Business Act at European level and at national level, in the Member States."
"The European SME Week in October will be a good opportunity to work together to raise awareness of SME policy and the needs of SMEs everywhere in the European Union."
"We are organising this event together with the Parliament and the Commission."
"Mr President, 'Action here and now!'"
"Mr Bendtsen said, and I strongly agree with his standpoint."
"We have heard that small and medium-sized enterprises are also major employers in the European Union and, after the economic crisis, examining and reviewing how we may be able to help them recover is especially important."
"The Hungarian Presidency believes in a work-based economy and society, and regards small and medium-sized enterprises to be among its key partners in this."
"The economic environment has changed dramatically since 2008; hence, a review really is needed."
"For our part, too, we welcome the six-party agreement which Mr Bütikofer mentioned, and we are also grateful that several speakers acknowledged the Hungarian Presidency's endeavours and that the Hungarian Presidency is handling this issue truly as a priority."
"Allow me to draw your attention to a few specific matters."
"After listening attentively to the Members, we are pleased to say that there is indeed complete agreement on the principles."
"The small and medium-sized enterprises are the backbone of European economic growth and employment."
"Therefore, improving the competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises is a priority for the Council as well."
"To this end, and to reflect this, the Competitiveness Council is preparing to adopt the Council's conclusions at its previously mentioned meeting on 30-31 May 2011, about which the Presidency is submitting a draft to the Council."
"The main elements of this intend to give answers to the problems identified as the result of the review of the Small Business Act."
"What are these?"
"These are better access to loans and market access, both in European and global terms, as well as enhancing the conditions of market access and alleviating administrative burdens."
"The Council believes that the transposition as soon as possible of the Late Payments Directive - which, as you are aware, has been adopted - is important, and this we note with pleasure."
"The Council is striving to achieve this and is encouraging Member States to do so because it would be a great weight off the shoulders of small and medium-sized enterprises and would greatly improve their liquidity."
"It is also a pleasure for me to announce that the Council is close to reaching an agreement on the Commission's aims to reduce the costs of establishing a business."
"The essence of this is to be able to start up an enterprise in at most three days, for the cost of at most EUR 100, and for licences to be obtainable in under a month."
"There are two other specific matters I wish to mention."
"One is the issue of the European patent."
"23 Member States have already joined the enhanced cooperation and the Council is discussing the basic regulation now."
"We regard this as a major breakthrough from the aspect of EU competitiveness and, in particular, the competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Mr Creutzmann wished to know about the matter of the European private limited company and asked it to be handled as a priority."
"We have made significant progress."
"Now only a very small group of Member States have not joined the consensus."
"The adoption of this would truly be a turning point for small and medium-sized enterprises, thus we are working on it very hard and also trust that Members will be able to exercise some sort of political pressure and motivate through their own channels in order to generate the necessary majority."
"We have talked about this to the eminent representatives of the Committee on Legal Affairs as allies on several occasions."
"Lastly, allow me to mention the connection with the Europe 2020 strategy."
"Here, we believe that it is important to convert the objectives stated in the strategy into laws, actions and measures which improve the position of small and medium-sized enterprises, but, of course, the Member States must also do their own homework."
"The European framework in itself is not enough; thus, for example, we believe that tax systems need to be simplified and to be made friendlier for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Several Member States are acting in this spirit. Among them is Hungary, currently holding the Presidency."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 12 May 2011."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"I welcome the Commission communication on the SBA review as it deals, to a large extent, with the problems which SMEs are faced with and for which European and national policies will have to come up with a solution."
"The Single Market Act has placed a strong emphasis on supporting SMEs."
"A large number of the measures proposed, such as the review of the accounting directives, cutting red tape, improving access to the capital and public procurement markets, etc. feature in this communication."
"One of the major problems facing SMEs is the lack of access to funding, which not only hampers innovation but also the growth of these businesses."
"Innovative SMEs in particular need broader access to informal funding and to funding based on venture capital holdings as well, which is the main source of funding for new businesses."
"SMEs can also be supported by domestic tax incentive measures, especially during the first few months of business."
"Finally, I think that the Late Payments Directive has to be implemented fairly for SMEs."
"Furthermore, with the aim of helping SMEs expand their cross-border activities, the process of recovering cross-border debts will need to be facilitated and the European Private Company Statute adopted without delay."
", in writing. - The Irish Government's Jobs Initiative has correctly concentrated on the jobs-rich sector of tourism; while the EU's Small Business Act has the potential to complement this in the area of SMEs over the coming years."
"The purpose of the SBA has been to reduce the administrative burden of doing business and improve access to finance for SMEs."
"Commissioner Rehn reported this evening that it has succeeded in reducing the cost of doing business by 22% in some areas and will continue to concentrate on this initiative."
"The principal message of the Small Business Act is to 'think small first' - to concentrate business legislation across the EU on small and medium-sized enterprises - and the EU has committed tonight to continue the focus on this area."
"To this end, it is important that entrepreneurs in Ireland are fully informed on how to make best use of the Small Business Act."
"Micro, small and medium-sized enterprises play a central and key role in the growth of the European economy; they are the main source of employment and have a fundamental impact on the development of European competitiveness and innovation."
"We can therefore say in good faith that we will not succeed in achieving the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy unless we support small and medium-sized enterprises and unless we make it easier for them to make full use of the single market."
"The solutions provided for in the Small Business Act, including fewer bureaucratic obstacles, improved access to sources of funding, and easier access to the market, are particularly significant and, in my opinion, effective measures aimed at putting in place the best possible conditions for the development of SMEs."
"However, problems arising from the implementation of these solutions at Member State level may pose a threat to their effectiveness."
"I am therefore also hoping that the Member States which have not yet fully implemented these measures will make every effort to ensure that this process is completed as soon as possible."
"SMEs encounter difficulties in obtaining access to funding and the market."
"The future MFF must provide measures for overcoming these difficulties."
"Increased support is needed for financial programmes and instruments which are already operating successfully, but have turned out to be inadequate, such as the competitiveness and innovation programme."
"Access to financial support must be improved for new innovative businesses in the form of start-up funds."
"Setting up a European capital risk fund and expanding the permanent risk-sharing products offered by the European Investment Bank through the Risk Sharing Financial Facility will also benefit SMEs."
"On the issue of SMEs having access to the market, I call on the Commission to propose a plan for introducing and selling innovative products on the market."
"Furthermore, a set of measures is required to support SMEs in implementing the new energy efficiency plan."
"I welcome this initiative by Parliament because the broad consent between the political groups to initiate a debate on small and medium-sized enterprises illustrates their crucial role as a driving force for growth in the EU."
"The recession is making it even more difficult for small and medium-sized enterprises to raise capital."
"Their access to the markets, to financing and to information urgently needs to be improved."
"We need to limit the administrative burden by simplifying the regulatory environment."
"At European level, it is important to combat the black market economy and to give small and medium-sized enterprises incentives."
"The Commission recently announced 12 actions for 2012 to stimulate the single market, including measures for funding for SMEs and worker mobility, measures which I believe are a move in the right direction By making integrated use of the single market and exploiting the advantages which it offers, we can strengthen growth and prosperity at European level and give new momentum to enterprise."
"Measures such as a European patent and the European professional identity card must be strengthened and applied widely in order to strengthen competitiveness and employment."
"Developments in the ongoing debt crisis and the EU response (debate)"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on developments in the ongoing debt crisis and the EU response."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, I fully understand the significant interest in this Parliament in the actions being undertaken within the Union and beyond to tackle the challenges which some Member States are facing in relation to their public finances."
"The global financial crisis has had a significant impact on both revenues and expenditure in all our countries, even if the extent and nature of that impact is not the same in all cases and the capacity of individual Member States to handle the consequences is also very different."
"The first thing I would like to stress is that it is the Member States themselves which are, first and foremost, responsible for ensuring that their public finances are sustainable and on a sound footing."
"Similarly, it is for each one of them to ensure that their economies are competitive, flexible and resilient."
"Of course, that does not mean that public finances and economic performance are not also a matter of collective interest."
"We are part of a Union, and our economies are interlinked in a number of ways: through the single market and, in many cases, through the sharing of the common currency and the deeper economic integration which that implies."
"More generally, we all have a commitment of solidarity towards each other, based on a desire to protect and promote the wider European interest."
"What that means is that we all want to see a stable and strong economy across the EU as a whole and, within it, of the euro area in particular."
"Where necessary, this has to involve taking steps to ensure the stability of individual Member States."
"We have a number of tools at our disposal to do this."
"We have the coordination mechanism that seeks to ensure that appropriate economic and budgetary policies are pursued by each and every Member State."
"These are being updated and reinforced, and I am pleased that negotiations between the Council and Parliament are advancing well."
"We also have access to the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism, which can offer support at EU level to any Member State, whether inside or outside the eurozone."
"In addition, and for the eurozone countries specifically, further instruments have been set up and are continuing to be developed."
"Greece has received a package of coordinated bilateral loans from Member States as well as a loan from the IMF."
"Ireland has received a package consisting of bilateral loans, a loan from the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and also a loan from the IMF."
"The support package for Portugal, which will also draw on both European and IMF support, is also being prepared."
"Ministers of the eurozone Member States are also finalising the technical details of the European Stability Mechanism, which is due to take effect from 2013 as a permanent financial support mechanism to replace the European Financial Stability Facility."
"Non-eurozone Member States are also participating in this process."
"I would now like to turn briefly to the situation in the three eurozone countries to which I have already referred."
"I should, however, mention that, from the outset, many of the issues in relation to these Member States are discussed outside the regular Ecofin format, reflecting their specific characteristics as members of the eurozone."
"The chair of the Euro Group would be better able than I to give you further details on many of these points."
"First, Ireland."
"Following the agreement last December of an overall EUR 85 billion assistance programme for Ireland, the Irish authorities have undertaken a great deal of work to implement the adjustment programme to which the financial support was attached."
"This programme has been kept under constant review by the new government."
"The Ecofin Council will review compliance with the programme for the first quarter at its meeting on 17 May, next Tuesday."
"I cannot say much in advance about that discussion, but the overall assessment is likely to be that Ireland's performance is in line with expectations."
"However, some specific challenges remain."
"Ireland will, in particular, need to stick to the powerful fiscal adjustment as well as ensure that its financial sector is on a stable footing for the future."
"Second, Greece."
"Greece has come a long way since the very difficult situation last year, and its efforts should be commended."
"It has been faced with a daunting challenge and has demonstrated unwavering commitment and clarity of purpose."
"The adjustment programme is broadly on track."
"The latest implementation report, drafted jointly by the Commission, the IMF and the ECB in March, concluded that the programme has made further progress towards its objectives."
"Some of the reforms needed to deliver the programme's medium-term objectives are being put in place."
"The report also identifies further areas where reforms are required in order to build the critical mass necessary to ensure fiscal sustainability and economic recovery."
"The Commission, the ECB and the IMF continue to monitor progress on the implementation of the adjustment programme closely."
"The next review is scheduled for this month."
"The Member States participating in the bilateral loan agreed in March to reduce the interest rate by 1% and to extent the maturity of the loan."
"This is also a positive development."
"The technical details of the implementation of this agreement are currently under discussion."
"Finally, Portugal."
"On 6 April, the Portuguese caretaker government announced its intention to seek financial assistance from the European Union."
"This followed a period of intense pressure from the financial markets."
"However, Portugal was also going through a period of political uncertainty which, as we know, led to the resignation of the government on 24 March."
"The Portuguese Parliament had previously rejected the new fiscal conciliation package proposed by the government."
"Negotiations between the Troika and the Portuguese authorities have now been finalised and the memorandum of understanding on the policy conditions attached to the financial assistance is being agreed."
"The financial envelope will be around EUR 78 billion covering a three-year period."
"In line with recommendations by the Ecofin Ministers at the informal Ecofin in Budapest in April, the programme covers reform in a number of areas, including public finance, labour and product markets and the financial sector."
"We consider that such measures are essential for growth potential and increased economic stability."
"Endorsement of the final financial package is also expected at next week's Ecofin Council."
"This is only a brief overview of the measures being taken to address the impact of the global financial crisis on the EU and on three Member States in particular."
"As I said at the outset, the Hungarian Presidency is not directly involved in all of the detailed negotiations, some of which were more specifically within the remit of the Euro Group."
"The Presidency is, however, committed to doing its part to assist in ensuring that all necessary measures are in place in order to address the current problems."
"We consider that this is essential if we are to boost Europe's competitiveness in the longer term and, in so doing, deliver the strong role which Europe as a whole needs."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, Europe's economic outlook today is quite dualistic."
"On the one hand, the recovery in the real economy has taken hold and is becoming more solid and self-sustaining."
"On the other hand, it is uneven and we still face turbulence in the financial markets, especially in the sovereign debt markets."
"Thus, the key task of the EU's economic policy now is to contain the sovereign debt crisis and thus protect the ongoing recovery in the real economy of Europe."
"Now, with the EU-IMF programme of Portugal waiting for its adoption next Monday in the Eurogroup Ecofin meeting, we are beginning another chapter in this necessary endeavour."
"Last week, the Portuguese Government presented an economic reform programme following our productive negotiations with the government, the opposition, civil society, social partners and the academic world."
"These talks are reflected in the programme."
"It is a Portuguese programme that deserves the support of the European Union and of the International Monetary Fund."
"Our joint assistance of EUR 78 billion shows the strong commitment to help Portugal and safeguard the financial stability of Europe."
"It is a demanding but fair and necessary programme of adjustment. It will require major efforts on the part of the Portuguese people."
"Great attention has been paid in its preparation to social fairness and protecting the vulnerable."
"Europe stands by Portugal for the sake of the country and for the sake of economic stability in Europe."
"Considering recent developments, it would be wrong to say that the debt crisis is no longer a burden for the European economy, yet it would be equally wrong to claim that the EU has not responded to the crisis."
"Consider this: only a year ago, the euro area Member States agreed on a conditional loan package to Greece in order to prevent a meltdown of our financial system."
"Within this one year, from last May until today, we have created effective stability mechanisms which were at first temporary and which will then become permanent as of 2013."
"We are implementing a very systematic programme of fiscal consolidation in all Member States, and they are committed to bold structural reforms to boost growth and job creation."
"We are, with your active support, addressing the systemic weaknesses in EU economic governance in order to prepare for a profound change in the policy making landscape of the European Union."
"We are, again with your support, addressing the shortcomings of our integrated financial market by toughening financial regulation and implementing the new supervisory architecture."
"At the present juncture, financial stability is being safeguarded by the EU-IMF stability mechanisms and especially by the actions that the Member States - especially the vulnerable Member States - are themselves taking."
"Still some people argue that the crisis management strategy, especially with regard to Greece, is failing."
"I disagree with this view."
"The first - and the primary - objective of our strategy has been to prevent another cardiac arrest of the kind that followed the failure of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 and subsequently led to the financial crisis and economic recession worldwide."
"We have done that and thus protected the ongoing recovery in the real economy in Europe."
"Secondly, we have been able largely to contain the distress in the sovereign debt markets to the three countries in the programme."
"As seen in the bond spreads, Spain is decoupling from these countries thanks to its determined action on the fiscal, financial and structural fronts."
"Thirdly, the programmes in both Greece and Ireland are still in the relatively early stages."
"The Greek programme has been running for one year and its counterpart in Ireland for about five months of the three years of the programme."
"Both countries are pursuing very ambitious programmes of fiscal consolidation, structural reform and financial repair."
"Our review mission is currently in Athens with the ECB and the IMF to assess the implementation of the programme and to prepare an updated analysis of the debt sustainability of Greece."
"The work will be concluded in the coming weeks, which will facilitate well-informed decisions."
"In any event, while the fiscal effort of the past year is unprecedented - over 7% of GDP, or EUR 20 billion - it is clear that Greece has to seriously reinforce the implementation of the economic reforms, achieve a breakthrough in the privatisation programme, and then ensure its full implementation."
"It is absolutely necessary and urgent that the domestic disputes are put aside and cross-party support achieved for the recovery of Greece."
"It is an illusion to think that there were any real alternatives to the economic reform programme."
"This is, therefore, a real test of the credibility of the Greek political forces, both government and opposition, and ultimately, of the will of the Greek people."
"The present stage of the crisis is a closely intertwined combination of sovereign debt crisis and banking sector fragilities."
"We cannot solve one without solving the other; we must resolve both in parallel."
"Therefore, the banking sector repair must be completed to safeguard the provision of credit to the real economy, to enterprises, households, individual citizens."
"A new round of bank stress tests is being conducted."
"The results will guide the necessary restructuring and recapitalisation of the banking sector."
"Ahead of the publication of the results, the Member States will need to release their strategies for possible restructuring or recapitalisation of their vulnerable institutions."
"Such plans should be ready as soon as possible and should include a detailed timeline."
"In conclusion, the fundamental reforms of financial regulation and economic governance in the European Union are profoundly changing the economic and financial architecture of Europe."
"In the near future, a whole new set of rules will provide the basis for stable, sustainable growth and job creation."
"In the meantime, we must continue our work to safeguard financial stability and thus protect economic recovery in Europe, which is the key for sustainable growth and improving employment."
"This continues to call for very difficult decisions at European and national levels."
"I trust we all have the wisdom and courage to take such decisions."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the minister, Mr Kármán, and Commissioner Rehn for their explanation, given what we have seen over recent weeks."
"If confidence in the market is weak, every trace of doubt has direct consequences for those countries that already find themselves in difficult circumstances and thus, for the euro as a whole."
"Unfortunately, that became apparent last weekend and then it was denied in the press that any secret meeting was taking place, which then has a double whammy effect on the already fragile confidence."
"I hope that the parties in question learn very quickly from this."
"Mr President, easy choices and pain-free solutions have been out of the question for quite some time."
"The support measures for Greece, Ireland and Portugal need to be robust in order to restore financial and economic stability."
"The package must pave the way for sustainable public finances and economic growth."
"I therefore want to call on the Council and the Commission to look deeper than the funding needs of these countries over the coming year in order to avoid us facing the same problems in a year's time."
"Mr President, it is important that decisions be taken in June on an ambitious package of legislation aimed at strengthening economic governance in Europe in order to win back the confidence of the markets and also in order to ensure growth and jobs on behalf of all our citizens and to increase the cohesion of our economies."
"I therefore want to call on the Council to give its backing to Parliament's ambition to provide greater accountability and more public debate in this House, greater involvement of the national parliaments, and to put an end to horse-trading in the Council when the Commission's view is not to its liking."
"This package must include a strong monetary arm alongside a strong economic arm, including the Europe 2020 strategy to secure the tenability of our social market economy for all 27 Member States."
"I am thus calling on you to show resolve in the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (Ecofin) next week."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(NL) Mr President, I have a question for Mrs Wortmann-Kool."
"How can it be that you, as a Dutch parliamentarian, do not even mention the scandal that the Dutch Finance Minister was not invited to the summit last week?"
"How can it be that you, as a Dutch parliamentarian, do not even mention the fact that the Netherlands is paying so much, and how can it be that you completely betray the interests of Dutch taxpayers by pouring billions' worth of taxpayers' money into a bottomless pit?"
"(NL) Mr President, I have clearly stated what is necessary to restore confidence."
"Mr Madlener's simplistic solutions would worsen - rather than improve - the position not only of Dutch citizens, but also of the citizens of all our Member States."
"I find it quite worrying that Mr Madlener still fails to grasp that fact."
"Mr President, Commissioner, given that it will shortly be one year since the Greek reform programme was agreed, and the fact that the programme for Portugal was announced just yesterday, I think that it is important for us to evaluate where we stand today, what has been done correctly, and where we made mistakes and missed the mark."
"One year on, therefore, in addition to Greece, another two countries in the euro area, Ireland and Portugal, have taken recourse to the support mechanism, as they are unable to secure the necessary financing on the markets."
"The peculiarities and different problems of each country are reflected, without doubt, in the different reform programmes which, nonetheless, are underpinned by a basic philosophy: the absolute emphasis on rapid budgetary reform."
"However, in the case of Greece, Commissioner, despite what has been achieved, as you have repeatedly emphasised, with the 7-point reduction in the primary deficit and a 5% reduction in the overall deficit, the fact that the recession was deeper than forecast in 2010 has resulted in less revenue for the State."
"So this is a first data point for evaluation, provided that we agree that the target of the programmes is to overcome the budgetary and economic crisis and not to create a culture of punishment leading to euro-scepticism in Europe."
"The second data point for evaluation is that, despite the efforts being made, the markets are not responding."
"However, the decisions by the European Union have not only failed to convince the markets; in some cases, they have exacerbated the situation, such as the famous Deauville decision on the involvement of private individuals in the permanent support mechanism to be created in 2013."
"The conclusion is that any success the budgetary reform programmes may have risks being wiped out by the fear which the markets and rating agencies are still stirring up, even today."
"We have reached the point over the past few days, with scenarios about restructuring and even bankruptcy and/or the exit of a country from the euro area still doing the rounds, that we are debating things which we would have considered inconceivable until just recently."
"Commissioner, knowing your attachment to Europe, I believe that you will agree with me that the solutions we are debating today, the way in which we shall manage this crisis, will no doubt be a major chapter in European history."
"Today, we are creating the conditions in which the epilogue will be written."
"I believe and hope that we all feel that these are historic times and that the epilogue will not be written in black colours for the future of the European Union and EMU, but will mark a brave and decisive step which will make Europe more cohesive, more united and even stronger."
"Mr President, my fellow Member just said that a year is a good time to look back over and I can bring news from Finland where it will hopefully be announced this evening that the Finnish Parliament will support the financial rescue package for Portugal."
"This will hopefully be the case, but we should not start applauding yet."
"We can hope that it will be the case, and my party certainly supports this move."
"I will briefly look at why we in Finland are hesitating right now with regard to whether or not we should support Portugal."
"One of the reasons is - and I turn here to the Council, and even though I know that the Hungarian Presidency is perhaps not the one to blame, you will have to be the messenger - that difficult decisions are constantly being taken in the form of small partial decisions because we cannot manage to resolve this problem all in one go. It is perhaps not so easy to do this either, and I understand that there is no simple and absolute solution, but the fact that we are constantly forced to take small and difficult partial decisions means that the political patience and the political will in Finland's Parliament, for example, is beginning to wear thin."
"Unfortunately, this seems to be the case in other national parliaments, too."
"This is worrying in view of the fact that we probably have several difficult decisions ahead of us, including with regard to the situation in Greece, and there is a risk that at some stage, we will find ourselves up against a wall."
"Therefore, the Council probably needs to consider a more ambitious strategy than this partial strategy that you are currently applying."
"If you do not do so, we will not get ourselves out of this situation."
"You need a new strategy because the current strategy is not working. Thank you."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, the sovereign debt crisis will not be solved until the banks are sorted out, and you cannot sort out the banks if regulators' stress tests refuse to admit that the sovereign debt crisis exists."
"There is also a public confidence crisis."
"Some countries bailed out their own banks at huge cost to the taxpayers, without any handouts from the EU."
"I understand why the same public is now asking why they should fund bail-outs in other countries."
"Last week's proposals for reform in Portugal had some positive recommendations for improving competitiveness, but the situation in Greece seems dire."
"Eurozone leaders tell us that there is no Greek debt restructuring, but since when is a delay of a repayment date not a restructuring?"
"If public lenders extend their maturities, that is not just a shuffling of deckchairs on the Titanic: it is taking the public lenders below decks to sink in the ship while the private loan holders are helped away to the lifeboats."
"Mr President, Mr Rehn, first of all, I would like to say that the situation is indeed getting worse, as you have described."
"In the euro area, the divide between the countries which are showing signs of recovery and those which are in a more precarious position is widening."
"Also, the cost of supporting the weaker countries is constantly rising."
"Given this situation, I have some questions for you in your role as Commissioner responsible for economic and monetary affairs."
"Liabilities between the central banks amounting to more than EUR 400 billion have accumulated in the TARGET2 accounts of the European Central Bank system."
"This is due to the fact that the banks are still not being adequately financed by the capital market."
"What is your view of these unplanned liabilities within the euro system?"
"The major problem which is preventing us from making progress with debt restructuring is that the banking system, as Mrs Ford has also said, has not been properly reformed."
"The proposal for a European restructuring system has been delayed."
"When will the Commission submit this proposal?"
"As Commissioner responsible for economic and monetary affairs, what is your view of this delay?"
"What are you doing to speed things up?"
"It has also become clear, as we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance have been predicting for a long time, that the measures put in place to support Greece and Portugal will not take effect until the macro-economic conditions in the euro area improve."
"These countries are still subject to a growing burden of interest."
"The export and outflow of capital in some of these countries is increasing."
"There is still a lack of demand among some of the European partners of these countries and among the strong countries in the euro area in particular."
"Resource and food prices are also rising, at least if you disregard the most recent ups and downs."
"In addition to the bail-out of these countries, and in addition to the financial aid, I would like to know which measures are being taken to relieve the burden of taxes, external demand and interest on these countries from a macro-economic perspective."
"How is this being achieved?"
"I would therefore like to encourage you to put forward a strong package which will improve the macro-economic conditions in these countries in the euro area."
"Finally, the measures, which, in my view, run contrary to the spirit of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU, have hit the weakest countries, including Greece, Portugal and Spain, while the stronger, wealthier countries have not yet taken on their share of the burden."
"Which measures will you be taking to encourage the wealthy countries to contribute to the costs of this crisis?"
"Mr President, I should like to express my deep indignation here and give voice to the protests being heard in Portugal against the policies that have led us to the crisis we are experiencing, in particular, the veritable submission and aggression pact imposed on the Portuguese people by what are known as the 'troika': the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the European Central Bank (ECB) and the European Commission."
"These bodies have been charged with implementing a shameful act of outside intervention that does not even respect the rights and exclusive competences of the Portuguese Parliament, or take into account that we are in the run-up to parliamentary elections."
"These are antisocial, regressive policies that abandon development and condemn the Portuguese workers and people to unemployment, poverty, underdevelopment and extreme dependence, turning Portugal into a mere protectorate or colony of the powers of the European Union."
"All this is happening, moreover, when it is already known that such measures do not solve the problem, as demonstrated by the Greek example."
"Even if the real responsibilities of EU policy - and we are talking about the irrational criteria of the Stability and Growth Pact, of the policy of the strong euro, and of the ECB guidelines and statutes, which do not respect the particularities of the weaker economies - in relation to the current situation are covered up, nothing justifies applying a package to Portugal that punishes the Portuguese people in return for a loan which needs to be paid back at interest rates higher than those normally charged by the ECB."
"Contrary to all the proclamations of solidarity at election propaganda time, what we have is a policy of social regression and of prolonged economic recession."
"They are intending to do all of this just to favour the international banks, along with a handful of big companies and financial institutions in Portugal, and a few of their lackeys."
"That is why we are saying here that the euro area itself is under threat; that the future of the European Union could be its implosion, and that a change of policy is needed ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mrs Figueiredo, I am afraid I have cut off your microphone."
"I apologise for this but you went quite over time."
"You do have a chance, however, for another 30 seconds if you agree to answer a blue card question by Mr van Dalen."
"(NL) Mr President, I wanted to ask Mrs Figueiredo, if what your country has agreed is as bad as all that, and if it is so bad to find yourselves under a real regime whereby you even have to restructure your whole economy, why not leave the euro area?"
"The euro is a strong currency and there have to be prerequisites for that."
"If that troubles you, you should just leave!"
"(PT) Mr President, what is unacceptable is that a question like this can be asked when Europe's leaders were unable to admit in time that their policies were responsible for exacerbating the situation of Portugal, which, as is well-known, had a fragile economy and had to be subjected to the policy of the strong euro, which serves the interests of Germany, France and others, but does not serve the interests of Portugal or of other countries with weaker economies."
"That is why the Portuguese people are fighting this policy, as are the Greek people and workers across Europe."
"What we need is another policy here in Europe too."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr President, I am a baby boomer."
"I was born just after the war."
"From that time, we have probably had the longest period of peace and prosperity globally."
"I have put a little bit of modest money away so that I can hand something down to my family when I pass on - largely because I have never spent more money than I have earned."
"I have been prudent and I have worked moderately hard."
"It always seems to me to come as a complete surprise to politicians how countries get in debt."
"Let me explain, because I do not think you really understand."
"It is because politicians consistently spend more money than they raise in taxation - more money than they can possibly raise in taxation -, most of which, in point of fact, they actually waste."
"The reason we are talking about countries which are broke - and they are broke - is because their ridiculous, ineffective, ignorant politicians consistently spend more money than they can raise."
"Then they borrow, and they borrow, and - worse - they then print money, because politicians and their central banks have a machine which prints money. If you do that as a private citizen, it is a criminal offence."
"You would go to prison for that, yet politicians and their central banks do it all the time."
"Let me explain to you that these countries are broke."
"They are broke because of their own stupid leadership and politicians."
"It is immoral - immoral! - to ask ordinary taxpayers of any country to pick up the tab for failed politicians and failed banks."
"They have defaulted."
"They are broke."
"For God's sake, let us all admit it."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(FR) Mr President, I would like to know if Mr Bloom is aware that Spain is less indebted than the United Kingdom, that Ireland was well below 60% before the banking crisis, and that Ireland, by getting into debt to save its banks, essentially saved the money of the British banks."
"Absolutely right."
"I was not suggesting my politicians were any less stupid than anybody else."
"It is an absolute disgrace, and there was not even a debate in our national parliament on actually rescuing these bust banks."
"If you want to invest in bust banks, do so with your own money, not money from my old age pensioners in Yorkshire on GBP 98 a week, you scoundrels!"
"(FR) Mr President, on 9 May 2010, the EU-ECB-IMF troika triumphantly announced that it had saved Greece from total bankruptcy by lending it EUR 110 billion."
"A year later, Greece plunged into recession."
"Public debt soared to 150% of GDP and two-year interest rates have reached more than 25% per annum."
"If, today, Greece is out of breath, it is because the method used to save it is not the right one."
"While the Greek economy now needs a weak currency to get out of the depression, the troika is going to impose a new, even more drastic, fiscal austerity package."
"This remedy will be no more effective tomorrow than it was yesterday."
"The currently punitive interest rates to which Greece is subject are, in fact, preventing its private economy from undertaking any investments, whether it be in the production process or in real estate."
"Greece is becoming a third-world country, ruining all hopes of reimbursement."
"The new draft rescue package of EUR 60 billion envisaged last Friday demonstrates that the EUR 110 billion loan already granted a year ago must be considered a gift."
"For how long and to what extent will European taxpayers be pouring money into the Danaides' cistern?"
"Pursuing this path is suicidal and will lead to the fragmentation of Europe."
"There are two possible solutions: Greek debt restructuring accompanied by the restructuring of the public debt of failing States leading, ultimately, to the collapse of our banking system, or a concerted, rational and pragmatic exit from the euro area enabling Greece to catch its breath."
"Europe is at a crossroads."
"Is saving the euro worth the sacrifice being made by the people of Europe?"
"(PT) Mr President, the sovereign debt crisis requires a European response: a response that looks at each specific situation, that defends the euro to make it strong, and that defends the Member States."
"That is why the series of proposals on economic governance currently being debated in the European Parliament are particularly important."
"Parliament has been helping to ensure that positive steps towards intelligent debt management are taken."
"It has been advocating a reasonable transition period; arguing that the necessary reduction in debt should not be made year on year but using a three-year average; advocating the need for budgetary discipline; arguing for the need for growth and increased transparency in European policy through debates in the European Parliament; and advocating the necessary solidarity."
"This solidarity is what has just happened with Portugal."
"I should like to say something to you as a Portuguese."
"Portugal has a 900-year history."
"Portugal is capable."
"Portugal is capable of putting its public accounts in order with discipline."
"Portugal is capable of reforming its banking system; it is capable of reforming its labour market; it is capable of making its tax system more competitive; and it is capable of using innovative measures to reform its health and justice systems."
"Portugal is capable of having a civil service that is more efficient and controlled."
"Portugal is capable of having a liberalised economy that is successful and more competitive."
"Fundamentally, however, Portugal is capable of participating in the European project; of participating and of helping to resolve whatever challenges there will be in the future."
"For this very reason, we are very happy in the Union and want to help it become progressively stronger."
"(FR) Mr President, in the face of crazy rumours and speculative attacks against a number of Member States, let me remind you of a few facts."
"The euro is a strong currency."
"In 10 years, the euro has established itself as the second most widely used currency in the world."
"Thirty per cent of international monetary reserves are denominated in euro."
"More than a third of international private borrowing is carried out in euro."
"The euro has a purchasing power 40% higher than that of the dollar, which means that euro area Member States pay less for their raw materials, particularly oil."
"The euro is here for the long haul in all euro area Member States."
"With all due respect to Mrs Le Pen, leaving the euro is simply not an option."
"Any Member State leaving the euro - which is what Mrs Le Pen wants for France - would see its new currency dramatically devalued."
"In the wake of the crisis in Iceland, the value of the Icelandic currency has been halved."
"This 50% devaluation of the Icelandic currency has caused the rate of inflation in Iceland to leap from 5% to 14%."
"The only way to restore calm in the markets is to allow Greece, Ireland, Portugal and others to restructure their debt through the issue of Eurobonds guaranteed by the Union at reasonable rates."
"I am talking here about the Tremonti-Juncker initiative."
"In fact, Eurobonds already exist."
"The European Investment Bank (EIB) borrows under the guarantee of the 27 Member States."
"Last year, the EIB raised EUR 80 billion at average rates of between 3% and 3.5%."
"It is rates like those that would enable Member States under pressure to overcome the crisis and to return to the path of financial stability."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"Mr President, the previous speaker said that if Greece were to leave the eurozone, its currency would collapse, but in that case, it would default."
"However, we know perfectly well that it is going to default anyway, so it has a choice of defaulting within the euro which merely kicks the problem down the road and it will return to bite us, or it can default outside the euro, in which case it can solve its problem."
"So his solution will not work."
"(FR) Mr President, I did not get a question but a circular argument from Mr Helmer, and Mr Helmer is simply wrong."
"Once again, any Member State leaving the euro would see its new currency dramatically devalued."
"I repeat my example of Iceland, which is not in the euro but which has been through all that."
"(SV) Mr President, Mr Rehn, the work you are doing is absolutely excellent."
"During this year, you have come up with a series of different proposals that have improved the situation, and that is something that we should all acknowledge."
"I am surprised listening to this debate."
"I thought this was a House for Europe, not a House for 27 different Member States."
"There is a spirit of nationalism here that is frightening and that will not help to solve our problems."
"It is a question of solidarity."
"(The speaker speaks in English)"
"(Speaking to Mr Helmer, who had expressed his disagreement) You may laugh, but you are wrong."
"You are definitely wrong, Mr Helmer, because it is about solidarity."
"Europe is about solidarity and we all are linked together: even the pound sterling reflects on the euro."
"I am astonished."
"(SV) In Sweden, we have experienced what it means to be in serious debt."
"We were a country in debt, people were in debt, but we succeeded in dealing with it."
"Why should our friends in Greece, Portugal and Ireland not manage to deal with it?"
"Are we special up in the Nordic countries?"
"Of course we are not."
"However, right now, these countries need our help and assistance."
"If we do not give them this help and assistance, it will also be our downfall."
"(The speaker speaks in English)"
"Europe is a common destiny for us all, and we have to realise that - even you, Mr Helmer."
"You are a part of Europe and you can do more."
"(Interjection from Mr Helmer: 'Absolutely no!)"
"Mr President, currently we are celebrating the first anniversary of the Greek bail-out, but there is nothing to celebrate."
"One year later, we are back at square one."
"Instead of lengthening the pain and piling even more burdens on the Greek economy, it would be far better to accept the inevitable and the judgment of the markets."
"There is no way to avoid default."
"An orderly default has at least five advantages."
"It would share the loss more fairly between Greek taxpayers and external creditors; stop the replacement of private debt by an ever-growing proportion of official debt coming from other countries; offer Greece more growth opportunities by alleviating debt service; make it much easier for Mrs Merkel to 'sell' the default to the Bundestag, because it would mean supporting German banks rather than Greece; and, finally, isolate the debt crisis from the competitiveness crisis and save the eurozone from contagion."
"Do it!"
"Do not throw good money after bad."
"(FR) Mr President, Mr Bokros, since you have raised the issue, I am going to continue."
"I believe, Mr Rehn, that we should listen to what is being said."
"I believe that, when the figures are placed alongside each other, the only conclusion is that debt restructuring in Greece, and probably in Ireland, is inevitable."
"I think that everyone realises that."
"It seems so obvious that one might well ask how it is possible that the European Central Bank, the Commission and the Council cannot see it."
"Unless you refuse to see it?"
"In other words, the first option is that you decide, for ideological reasons, to say that default is out of the question, in which case that would be to deny reality."
"On the other hand, you could perhaps say that it would be better to play for time, in which case I would really appeal to you because the more that time goes by, the more painful and the more costly restructuring will be."
"It will, in particular, be more costly for taxpayers because the more that time goes by, the more of a burden the Greek public debt will become on public or quasi-public entities - I am thinking of the European Central Bank, I am thinking of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) - and it is increasingly the taxpayer who is going to be asked to pay up."
"You know, Mr Rehn, there has been a great deal of talk about stress tests and resistance tests in recent days."
"They are mentioned in relation to nuclear power stations; they are mentioned in relation to banks."
"Yet those whose resistance is being severely tested every day are our citizens, especially the most disadvantaged among them, who perhaps bear a disproportionately high share of the burden of the response to this crisis."
"Clearly, one cannot therefore say that the crisis is simply the responsibility of the banks, of enterprises, or of politicians, as some would simplistically have us believe."
"I believe that this is a collective responsibility and that it would therefore be healthy if everyone contributed their fair share towards tackling the crisis."
"I would like to end by stressing that, even though I might often disagree with you, we should honour the work you have been doing lately."
"I am sure that your nights are not very long and I promise that, on the day you return to a more decent life, I will gladly invite you to dinner."
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, I would have expected you to reply with honesty that the austerity programme, the memorandum being applied with religious devotion in Greece, has been a total failure."
"The deficit is bigger than forecast, the debt has increased, unemployment has increased, there is even greater austerity and, in the midst of this, you, Commissioner, see in these facts the recovery of the economy and the avoidance of a heart attack, while your representative sees targets and successes."
"At the same time, the aim is to apply this recipe to Ireland and Portugal."
"These recipes have been a total failure."
"At the same time, recent data in Europe illustrate that the German economy is growing and that its export figures are higher than at any time since the 1950s."
"I think that this combination of facts, this inequality and the disparities which are appearing and operating within the European Union are the problem and one of the causes of the problem."
"This being so, what are you waiting for in order to change policy?"
"Tell us what you talk about at your secret meetings, because a lot of rumours are flying around."
"Will you eventually change tack in order to address the problems?"
"(NL) Mr President, first of all, I have a question for Commissioner Rehn."
"How can it be, Mr Rehn, that the Eurogroup, chaired by Mr Juncker, could hold a summit without the Dutch Finance Minister present?"
"How can that be?"
"It is an outright scandal that the Netherlands, as one of the biggest contributors to all the rescue packages, was not even invited to the meeting I refer to."
"Mr Rehn, could you give me an assurance at this point that you will ensure that this never happens again?"
"I have to tell the House that Greece will either have to leave the euro or restructure its debts."
"That is an inevitable reality - the question is 'when?'"
"I believe, and I fear that that will happen when all the guarantees and all the money has been paid out to Greece."
"This is the swindle of the century!"
"Mr Rehn, can you give me a guarantee now that the scenario whereby Greece first refinances its debts to the maximum degree with Dutch taxpayers' money and then leaves the euro and cancels its debts is a scenario that will not occur?"
"We cannot trust these Greeks, the Greek politicians who, together with the European Commission, swindled their way into the euro with inaccurate figures and who now seem to be primarily occupied with increasing their own salaries."
"These are politicians that we can never trust, so, Mr Rehn, how are you going to guarantee that Dutch taxpayers are not going to be terribly swindled once again?"
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(FR) Mr President, for the last time, is Mr Madlener aware, when he argues against European solidarity and against Greece, that, after Germany, the Netherlands is the second largest beneficiary of the European internal market and that practically one out of every two jobs in the Netherlands is linked to activities relating to the export of goods and services to the European Union?"
"Is he not therefore arguing against jobs in the Netherlands?"
"(NL) Mr President, Mr Goebbels, you must know that the Netherlands has hard work and keeping on top of its finances to thank for its strong position."
"Did you know that the Netherlands has been the biggest net contributor to the European Union for years now and that the Greeks have been the biggest recipients of Dutch money for years?"
"What has been the outcome of that?"
"The outcome was crisis in Greece!"
"This is mismanagement of Dutch taxpayers' money."
"It is a disgrace that you have not grasped that fact."
"Mr President, our duty is to look for the best solutions to cope with the crisis, to which end the learning process is of great value."
"My feeling is that we have learned why things went wrong and how we got ourselves into the difficult situation we are in today, but my feeling is also that now we are less open to drawing lessons from the evolving reality."
"In this context, I would like to raise two issues."
"First, we can see great similarities between Member States with regard to public debts and deficit ratios, while, at the same time, for the same Member States, there are substantial differences between the risk premiums paid on their sovereign debt."
"In my view, this is clear proof that factors other than sovereign debt enter into the picture and influence markets."
"Among other things, it is foreign debt or excessive external imbalances on which markets have focused, and this clearly means that in responding to the situation, we must go beyond fiscal adjustment."
"The second issue is related to the fact that those economies that are the most strongly affected by the crisis have to cope with a combination of high risk premiums and severe austerity measures."
"This double challenge makes achieving debt sustainability practically impossible."
"If we reject debt restructuring, then we need a better balance between punishment and assistance and the design of response packages which would make it possible to avoid pushing countries further into a debt trap."
"(PT) Mr President, Europe is mired in an unprecedented crisis that could threaten the euro area and the European project."
"It is a crisis of the euro area, of which Greece, Ireland and Portugal are the first victims."
"The attacks on these countries' sovereign debt aim to weaken the single currency."
"Those thinking that this is a problem for the Greeks, the Irish and the Portuguese are fooling themselves: it is not."
"If there is not a robust response from the European Union that calms the markets, this pressure will spread to other Member States."
"Portugal does not have a problem regarding the sustainability of its public accounts or the insolvency of its national banks."
"Portugal needs to continue with the structural reforms already started, to increase productivity, and to promote economic growth."
"As in the past, the Portuguese people will overcome this challenge, too, and make the necessary sacrifices, but not more than the necessary sacrifices."
"We cannot understand why the European Union is going to charge Portugal higher interest rates than the International Monetary Fund."
"Portugal will pay the European Union around EUR 3 billion in interest per year."
"There is no need for the Mr Blooms and Mr Madleners in this Chamber, and outside it, to worry: the taxpayer will not suffer."
"What is at issue is a loan, not a gift."
"This is a loan that will be paid back in full, and at interest rates similar to the market rates Portugal was paying around a month ago."
"In a globalised world, no country can solve all its problems on its own."
"The financial crisis has already shown that something that happens on the other side of the world can hit all of us at home with devastating force."
"That is why we need more and better Europe: a more united and ambitious Europe."
"We are all in the same boat: if the boat sinks, no one will be saved."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(FI) Mr President, I have good news for the Portuguese."
"According to information I have just received, an agreement has been reached in Finland and the Commission's proposal concerning loans to Portugal has been accepted, so Finland is no longer an obstacle."
"As it is also my role to ask questions, I would like to ask my colleague the following: do you believe that the belttightening taking place in Portugal will allow you to achieve the kind of economic growth that will enable the loans to be repaid?"
"(PT) Mr President, I should like to thank the Finnish people and the Finnish Parliament for making that decision, which is very much in the spirit of community and solidarity that prevailed at the founding of the European Community."
"Regarding your question, I was saying to you that these austerity measures will be observed by the Portuguese people and that, although it is a tough, onerous package, we will do everything to increase economic growth, create more employment and escape these difficulties."
"(FR) Mr President, the debt problem is of a magnitude that far exceeds the purely budgetary dimension."
"In fact, it is policy as a whole that is being affected by the public debt crisis - the budgetary, economic, social, European, and national dimensions."
"First and foremost, however, we have a political crisis on our hands."
"In Finland, a party for which dissociating itself from Portugal has become a hobbyhorse illustrates the extent to which the debt problem is worrying the public."
"However, it should be recalled that the rhetoric of the party of the true Finns, which advocated against coming to the rescue of Portugal, could not be more similar to that used by Germany's main political leaders a year ago shortly before aid was granted to Greece."
"The populist slogans contributing to significant electoral success, today in Finland, tomorrow in a different country, are, in fact, simply repeating the words previously articulated by very respectable political leaders."
"The political centre is where the ideas tearing economic and monetary union apart are generated."
"I firmly believe that the difficulties can only be surmounted if senior politicians understand that their role is, first and foremost, to calm tensions rather than fan the flames."
"(EL) Mr President, it is a rotten lie that the economic crisis is a crisis caused by debt."
"It is a crisis caused by the over-accumulation of capital, a crisis of the capitalist system which illustrates that it is an out-dated system that has been overtaken by events."
"The capitalist crisis in Greece, Ireland and Portugal is getting worse and will continue."
"The debt and deficit in these countries are not national peculiarities; they are the effect, not the cause."
"They stem from an extensive reliance on big business: subsidies and tax relief for the monopolies, NATO spending, the destruction of industrial production and the mining, manufacturing, textile and ship-building and repair industries, the severe undermining of agricultural production and the billions of euro for large business groups."
"The basic reason for this attack by the European Union, the bourgeois governments and capital on the income and rights of the working classes, the main weapon in which is in the agreement on the euro and the European stability - for which read controlled bankruptcy - mechanism, goes beyond capitalist management of the crisis and the debt."
"The strategic objective of the European Union, of the bourgeois governments and of capital is not only to shift the burden of the crisis on to the workers, but to pare the workforce down to a minimum, in order to safeguard the profit margins of the monopoly groups."
"Today's awe-inspiring general strike in Greece will send a strong fighting message ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(NL) Mr President, you have my sincere thanks for your helpfulness and your tolerance."
"I have a question for Mr Toussas."
"He knows precisely how to explain all the things that are wrong, what is not right in this system, and all the things that are utterly wrong in what is happening in Europe and the Member States."
"My question is, what is the alternative?"
"Do you want a return to the Communist utopia, as in North Korea, in Cuba and other dictatorships?"
"Is that the solution that we need to turn back to?"
"Is that what you want?"
"(EL) I understand that you are unable to present proposals to resolve the acute problems faced by the workers both in your country and in the other 26 Member States of the European Union."
"May I inform you that, before Greece acceded to the European Union, the Greek Communist Party voiced its opposition and informed the Greek people of the consequences."
"Thirty years after the accession of Greece to the European Union or, if you like, even since 1957, when it was founded and converted from the European Coal and Steel Community to the EEC, what we have seen is this: profits for capital, hardships for the workers."
"The people will fight to resolve this contradiction."
"Mr President, the eurozone imposes a single currency value and standardised interest rates on 17 different economies."
"If the failing countries had remained outside the eurozone, their currencies would have fallen in value, leading to export-led expansions facilitated by low interest rates that would be set by their central banks."
"The excessive currency value, and now rising interest rates, have aggravated stagnation, which has brought about falling tax revenues, cuts in services and rising government debts."
"It would be in their interest to leave the zone, but the fall in the value of their currencies would then increase their debt burden."
"Britain, being outside the eurozone, should be unaffected by these debts, but our previous government underwrote GBP 10 billion worth of debts under the exceptional occurrences clause of the Lisbon Treaty and the present government will continue to supply loans directly and indirectly."
"Greece and Ireland will eventually default on their debts, and we will all be shown to have thrown good money after bad."
"(PT) Mr President, I should like to start by saying that I, naturally, believe that the agreement reached for Portugal is a balanced one."
"It is a very tough agreement for the people, but it essentially emphasises structural reforms to increase growth and competitiveness."
"I think that is very positive."
"I am not taking the same attitude as others here who believe that countries like Greece, Ireland and Portugal did everything right: that they made no mistakes and did not go too far; that they did everything right and it was only the international crisis that caused problems."
"No, our governments made mistakes and had the wrong policies, but that does not mean there is not now an opportunity, in the context of the Union, to get back on track and head in the right direction again."
"It is therefore important to remember that it is, in fact, necessary to say to those bodies of public opinion against supporting countries in difficulties that they are not giving money to those countries: they are lending money to those countries."
"Moreover, they are lending it at very high interest rates, so they are actually doing a deal that is positive for their budgets and their people."
"However, I would also say here that it is perhaps time to have a general European response by accepting Eurobonds and accepting the possibility of selling them on the primary market, to respond to the international markets."
"Perhaps it is time for the Commission itself, the European Financial Stability Facility and the International Monetary Fund to review the interest rates so that they can make it possible for there to be sustained growth in these countries that are currently in difficulties, by lowering these rates."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"Mr President, firstly, I would like to say to that I feel ashamed by the amount of nationalism and short-sightedness which has been expressed in this debate."
"Mr Rangel, I have a question for you."
"Do you feel that the interest rate which you will have to pay under the future programme should be lowered?"
"Would lowering these interest rates help your country?"
"(PT) Mr President, I believe that the rate should be lower not just for Portugal, but also for Ireland and Greece."
"I think that it will be extremely difficult to achieve the goals without lower interest rates, as we are seeing at the moment in the Greek case, in fact."
"However, whatever the case, I think that there is a possibility and a door open here."
"If Portugal is able to comply rigorously with the results of the agreement in the first few months, I think that it will be in a position to go to the European Financial Stability Facility and the International Monetary Fund and ask for a review of the rates within six to nine months."
"I think that would be good news for the Portuguese people and I think it would be good news for the European Union."
"Mr President, just to add an Irish voice to this debate: I, too, share the disillusionment with the extent of nationalism across this floor."
"I am disappointed that the Chamber is half empty for what is the most important debate for Europe in this session."
"On interest rates: let us be very clear that countries should not be charged penal interest rates."
"They do not help them to recover, and they do not help debt sustainability."
"In my last 30 seconds, could I ask the Commission to address the issue of debt sustainability, for Ireland and our colleagues who are in difficulty?"
"Could I also ask a question about the political capacity of the European Union?"
"On Monday in our Parliament in Dublin, I spoke about a sundering of solidarity in the European Union."
"I do not say that with any delight."
"I have said it privately to the Commissioner."
"It is a real and serious problem."
"I rue the day when we might be ruled by the extreme right or the extreme left."
"For God's sake, let the centre unite."
"(FI) Mr President, this debate has been useful."
"This is a very serious situation for those countries in crisis, but it is just as serious for Germany, Austria and Finland, because taxpayers in these countries have suffered budget cuts and been through serious crises."
"The questions have been justified, and that is why it is very important that the Portuguese issue should be made a model example of how a crisis can be held in check, dealt with, and prevented from spreading."
"I think that Portugal must now first ensure that it repays the loans by selling its assets, as has been said."
"It must also negotiate with its individual lenders to establish concrete proposals and ideas about how this crisis can be beaten."
"Voters in Germany, Austria and Finland will not stand for it if, for example, there should be new bailouts for Greece or if this case should fail."
"(SK) Mr President, Portugal is another country in need of financial assistance from the Eurobond, but us be honest and admit that the labelling of this crisis as a 'debt' crisis or a 'euro' crisis is highly misleading."
"It gives the impression that the euro is in crisis because certain Member States are incapable of running their affairs sensibly and have taken on too much debt."
"Ireland and Portugal, however, ran their affairs in a disciplined way, and got into a crisis that was not of their own making."
"It is the poorly regulated banks that were irresponsible."
"It was the cost of protecting these banks that got some euro area states into financial problems."
"The actual crisis is therefore rather a crisis of the European banking sector."
"If we are honest, the Eurobond, or rather the new form it will take after 2013, will surely not be enough."
"The cost of protecting the euro must be reduced in such a way that we force the commercial banks to acknowledge their losses."
"The next step should then be effective regulation of the financial sector."
"(NL) Mr President, the current approach to the debt crisis exacerbates the problems."
"Yes, Greece, Portugal and Ireland are being offered a debt settlement, but their debts are being increased, not reduced."
"This approach is a disaster - it is solving a debt problem by taking on more debt."
"Mr President, Europe needs to move on from its taboo on writing off debt."
"We can move forward by restructuring public debt with a partial writing off of debts in combination with enforcing the requirements of a tightened-up Stability and Growth Pact, including automatic penalties."
"Obviously, this is a tough approach designed to bring about a 'shake-out' amongst the banks, some pensions institutions and bondholders, but we need to get through this."
"It is a question of no pain, no gain."
"Writing off public debts in combination with enforcing strict requirements paves the way for a new future."
"If we do not do that, there is only one future, which is weak countries leaving the euro area."
"(PT) Mr President, Commissioner Rehn, last month, the President of the Portuguese Republic asked the Commission to be 'imaginative', and your reply to the President of my country, with the arrogance of a colonial governor, was 'we have been imaginative with Portugal'."
"That is why I want to reply to you now."
"The European Commission has been imaginative in imposing a three-year government programme and a preferred government on a country three weeks before an election."
"The European Commission has been imaginative in demanding an interest rate of 6% from that same country, and in plunging Portugal into recession for the next two years."
"The only place the European Commission has not been imaginative is where it needed to be, because we all need to restructure the debt, to renegotiate the debt, and to involve creditors in the solution."
"Please, Commissioner, search your conscience: resign, and Europe will thank you for it."
"(DE) Mr President, in contrast to my fellow Members who have overrun their time, in a similar way to the budget overrun, I will attempt to be brief."
"Among the many clever analyses and responses, there is one question which has not been asked."
"That is the question of what the citizens of the net contributors would say."
"Tax rates of 50% with a high standard of living and high levels of social services are not a coincidence."
"This means that the citizens are working hard and earning a great deal."
"Solidarity, which has often been referred to today, also involves solidarity with the citizens in our own home countries."
"The case of Sweden has been mentioned."
"The EU did not intervene here with financial aid."
"Instead, restructuring has taken place, cuts have been made in social services and public services have been reduced."
"In other words, a strict fiscal policy has been introduced."
"We must explain this to the countries which are obviously the subject of today's debate."
"Without a strict fiscal policy and major efforts on their own part, this will not work."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I will focus on one issue only because I need my five minutes for that."
"In recent weeks, and today in this House, many voices have spoken in favour of debt restructuring in Greece."
"It sounds very easy and neat."
"However, I must say that the proponents of sovereign debt restructuring seem to ignore the potentially devastating implications for financial stability in the country itself and in the euro area as a whole, and the consequences and ramifications for economic growth and employment."
"Let us think about what the consequences of debt restructuring could be."
"Of course, we are talking about a counterfactual situation, as are the proponents of debt restructuring, but we have enough understanding of the channels of impact on financial stability and economic activity to make a likely and most possible scenario."
"This is how it could very likely turn out."
"Bondholders would take a big hit - i.e. households through their savings instruments like pension savings, as well as institutional investors such as pension funds and insurance companies."
"Banks would also bear the cost."
"From last year's bank stress test exercise, we know that the Greek banks hold EUR 48 billion of government securities, Greek Government bonds."
"What would happen?"
"A restructuring of sovereign securities would seriously erode their capital base."
"For instance, even a 30% haircut would mean that a large part of the banking system would end up under-capitalised, while a 50% haircut, which many have advocated, would imply that a large part of the Greek banking system would simply become insolvent."
"Thus, a debt restructuring in Greece would have major consequences on the soundness of the banking sector in Greece, as well as on any banks having exposure to Greek securities."
"Now, I do not love banks, nor do I do my job in the first place in order to save them, but it is a fact that such a major banking crisis would lead to a massive credit crunch."
"It is not a kind of theoretical virtuality."
"It is a very likely result."
"A massive credit crunch."
"Moreover, through rating actions, the collateral pool at the disposal of the Greek banks would most likely be wiped out."
"It would melt down."
"A massive credit crunch, possible bank runs, a deposit freeze and/or capital controls could well be part of the consequences."
"What is absolutely sure is that the contraction of the economy would be unprecedented in Greece."
"Let me recall that Argentinian GDP collapsed by almost half over five years."
"Would that help Greece or Europe?"
"I doubt it."
"Even such a severe haircut as 50% would not reduce the debt ratio below 100% of GDP, assuming that the international creditors, like the euro area Member States or the IMF, were excluded from this haircut."
"Greece still has a large fiscal deficit which it has to finance."
"Who would be ready to lend to Greece the morning after it wiped out 70% or 50% or 30% of previous investors' financial wealth?"
"Who would be ready to lend to Greece the morning after?"
"Debt restructuring would cut Greece's access to financial markets for a very long time, and the goal of the EU/IMF programme is indeed a relatively rapid return to the markets to finance the Greek sovereign debt so that European taxpayers do not have to guarantee loans to do that."
"That is the goal of this exercise."
"Let us recall that in the final analysis, fiscal solvency requires stabilising and then reducing the government debt ratio - i.e. achieving a primary structural surplus and achieving a debt-stabilising level."
"Greece is still living beyond its means, and the key is that Greece has to start earning more than it consumes and also be able to pay the interest rates on its debt burden."
"That is the primary structural surplus that Greece needs, and debt restructuring would not solve this very fundamental fact."
"Therefore, at the end of the day, the main determinants over the solvency of Greece are of a political and social nature - the consistent rigour to keep the primary surplus stable at a high level of around 5% of GDP for a long period of time."
"We have examples of this."
"Belgium successfully did so in the 1990s for almost a decade."
"Moreover, six EU Member States have been able to maintain a primary surplus of over 4% for at least four years, so it is not impossible."
"It is certainly very challenging, but it has been done before and it is doable also for Greece if there is the political will and unity in the country."
"This is the only way for Greece to avoid much worse alternatives."
"We really are at a critical juncture concerning the future of Europe."
"This debate is about the sovereign debt crisis."
"It has implications for the euro, for the future of Europe."
"You know this very well."
"I must say that I am extremely concerned about the divergence in the national political debates we have heard recently, which have also been reflected in this House."
"There is political fatigue in central and northern Europe about supporting the countries in trouble; there is reform fatigue in southern Europe about carrying out the necessary reforms."
"We need to find the energy together to beat this fatigue."
"We need to build bridges over these divergences in order to save Europe, and we need to make the necessary decisions to avoid another, even worse crisis, and to enable the whole of Europe to recover from this extremely serious financial crisis that we have experienced in the last years."
"Mr President, honourable Members, I would like to reflect briefly on two trains of thought."
"Although, undoubtedly, the crisis of the banking system contributed considerably to our current economic problems, it would be a mistake to conceal that most of the problems arose prior to the crisis from a lack of fiscal discipline in numerous countries, from economic policy that did not strengthen competitiveness, and from the absence of coordination in European economic policy."
"It is therefore clear that a comprehensive European answer is needed and two important elements of this, which are also top priorities for the Hungarian Presidency, are the European semester and implementing the reform of economic governance."
"Implementing both priorities has reached an important, critical stage."
"As regards the European semester, we are committed to successfully concluding this on time."
"The Member States' stability and convergence programmes, as well as the national reform programmes, are planned to be discussed at the Ecofin meeting in June, and I hope that at last, these programmes will mean a real breakthrough in each Member State's fiscal and economic policy."
"Intensive work on the package of six proposals is going on in the trialogue."
"In connection with this, the Hungarian Presidency will announce the most important points of Parliament's proposals at next week's meeting of finance ministers, and at this discussion we will ask for a mandate from the Council to reach a successful and speediest possible agreement still in June regarding the six legislative proposals."
"A responsible and flexible attitude is required of both the Council and Parliament, and I firmly believe that in today's situation, the agreement would send a remarkably positive message to the markets as well."
"Furthermore, it would reflect the ability of the European institutions to cooperate responsibly and without delay when Europe is in huge need of this."
"Concerning the Portuguese programme and the three adjustment programmes in general, first, I would like to welcome the parliamentary agreement on financial policy."
"We all know that this is extremely important from the aspect of the functioning of the European Financial Stability Facility."
"At the same time, I wish to point out that it is also clear in the economic policy programme compiled by the Troika in relation to Portugal that the programmes devised for Greece, Ireland and Portugal alike adapt to the characteristics of each country and are not formulaic in any way."
"For Greece, the stress is on putting the budget in order."
"For Ireland, the consolidation of the banking system can be regarded as the key element."
"Now for Portugal, the most crucial parts are perhaps structural reforms, and labour market and commodity market reforms."
"As we are all aware, in the case of Portugal, it is extremely important to put the economy on a higher growth path in the medium term and to strengthen competitiveness."
"I believe that, although implementing economic policy programmes related to credit agreements means serious efforts for the Member States, at the same time, this is also an opportunity to face up to long-standing structural problems and to find solutions and answers to these within a short period, which, in the medium term, could lead to sustainable and higher growth in these countries."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"The euro is experiencing depreciation at a time when there is talk about Greece needing to receive a second loan from the European Union."
"We must ask ourselves whether the situation in Greece and in other European states in difficulty is not a result of the actions taken by financial speculators, based on the tactics of 'divide and conquer'."
"Just recently, Portugal became the third state which needed to ask the European Union for loans."
"The financial speculators have forgotten the problem of the banks which were difficult to save and are focusing their attention on European states in difficulty."
"The low public debt credit rating has made it impossible, therefore, to obtain loans to pay back the debt."
"I think that a European credit rating agency is required, which will move away from financial speculation."
"On the other hand, it is imperative that Eurobonds are issued to demonstrate the willingness to save the euro."
"Owing to its scale and the associated constraints, the debt issue is more than just a real problem for countries like Portugal: it constitutes a central element of the violent social, economic, political and ideological offensive under way, the true causes of which are obscured."
"The most recent expression of this offensive is the unlawful intervention in Portugal by the 'troika' of the International Monetary Fund, the European Commission and the European Central Bank."
"This is an intolerable extortion of national resources from the Portuguese workers and people into the pockets of financial capital."
"The EU - thereby revealing its nature and true objectives - mediates this extortion process, whilst creating the institutional conditions for it to be implemented and deepened."
"The process of foreign intervention under way is very revealing of this."
"It incorporates the fundamentals of the antisocial measures implemented in other countries, like Greece and Ireland, as well as those included in the 'Euro Plus Pact' imposed by the European powers."
"When it comes into effect, it will exacerbate the national situation, worsening the economic recession, unemployment, poverty, social inequality and national dependence."
"When it is implemented, this veritable submission programme will, as demonstrated by the situation in other countries, exacerbate the conditions that supposedly motivated this intervention: in other words, the difficulties in tackling the unbearable and growing costs of the public debt."
"The cause of the sovereign debt crisis is speculation on the indebtedness of Member States that have come to the rescue of the banking sector, which is directly responsible for the profound crisis we are experiencing."
"The banking sector has shirked all its responsibilities, especially its financial responsibilities, and is making record profits, while European taxpayers and workers are being asked to tighten their belts."
"As for the sacrosanct markets, they are now setting the tone."
"Commission and governments have just one obsession: to reassure them."
"The whole of last weekend was filled with misinformation on debt restructuring and Greece's exit from the euro: rumours spread by those who have wagered billions on a default they are trying to create in the first place."
"Debt restructuring would, it appear, be a catastrophe - for private investors."
"At the same time, it was announced that the Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP), for example, would lose much less than the EUR 6 billion in profits expected this year and that, without the exorbitant rates of interest, Greece's deficit would be 1.5% of GDP and not 8%."
"The speculators are stuffing themselves on taxpayers' money and are clearly set to bleed them dry."
"It is time we stopped this unhealthy circus."
"One thing is clear to all of us."
"The effects of the economic and financial crisis can still be felt everywhere and it involves numerous issues."
"It goes without saying that the EU must respond to the crisis."
"I have a few thoughts on the stress tests which were carried out on the banks."
"A total of 91 major European banks were tested and 7 failed."
"I have one major criticism in this area, which is that the consequences of a country going bankrupt were not evaluated and this remains a possibility when we look at Greece, Ireland and Portugal."
"The most recent stress tests focused on the hard capital ratios, but the liquidity criteria should also have been included."
"It is obvious that these results must be published in order to achieve the required level of transparency."
"Efficiency of the European agencies linked to employment, working conditions and training (debate)"
"Τhe next item is the Commission statement on the efficiency of the European agencies linked to employment, working conditions and training."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I wish to thank this House for putting the issue of European agencies on the agenda."
"The Commission attaches great importance to the European Union agencies' efficient functioning."
"Part of this is related to the governance arrangements which apply to all of them."
"As you are aware, the agencies' functioning and governance are currently being discussed within the interinstitutional working group involving the Commission, Parliament and the Council, on the basis, inter alia, of a multi-agency evaluation carried out for the Commission in 2009."
"Indeed, the time has come to shape a new overall approach to EU agencies, improving their overall coherence, effectiveness, accountability and transparency."
"The ultimate aim of the interinstitutional working group is, through a step-by-step approach, to develop a general agreement between the three EU institutions on the various issues at hand."
"We hope this can be achieved by the end of this year or the beginning of next year."
"Cooperation with Parliament has been very positive so far, and we trust that we can count on Parliament's support for the next steps."
"As you know, EU agencies are legally autonomous bodies whose governance rules are laid down in the funding regulations."
"In general, agencies are overseen by a governing board whose membership may vary according to the nature of the agency."
"Three of the agencies in the field of employment and education for example - Eurofund, OSHA and Cedefop - have tripartite governing bodies with representatives of both sides of industry, the Member States and also the Commission."
"I wish to reassure you that this House has access to a lot of information, either because this information is in the public domain or because Parliament, as part of the budgetary authority, holds hearings with the directors of agencies, on the annual work programmes and on budgetary discharge, in the Employment and Social Affairs Committee."
"Each of the agencies - Eurofund, OSHA, the European Training Foundation and Cedefop - has a specific role to play."
"For example, the European Training Foundation and Cedefop, although both working on vocational education and training, have different geographical scope."
"The former works outside the EU, the latter inside the EU, and they have different objectives."
"The European Training Foundation assists essentially the neighbourhood countries with reforms of education and training systems, while Cedefop promotes information gathering and research on the vocational training policies of the Member States."
"The Commission is keen to ensure synergies between the two agencies, notably through exchanges of information, joint work programmes, the joint organisation of conferences and seminars, and joint projects."
"Mr President, Mr Andor, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to extend a warm welcome to the members of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) group from the Wesel district assembly who are in the gallery."
"I would like to say to Mr Andor that we are pleased to hear him thanking us for our cooperation on the issue of agencies."
"However, it is both sad and regrettable that the Council representative has once again left the Chamber, because the fact that we have made so little progress in the interinstitutional working group on agencies is primarily the fault of the Council, which is holding back from working with us to introduce improvements in this area."
"Therefore, the Commission should be aware that we are on its side."
"We must exert greater pressure with regard to the agencies."
"We are currently looking at four agencies which reflect the fundamental problems of all the agencies, in other words, the overlap of responsibilities, for example, between the European Agency for Safety and Health (OSHA) and the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound) and between OSHA and the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA), the European Railway Agency (ERA) and the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA)."
"There is also a significant overlap between the European Training Foundation (ETF) and the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (Cedefop)."
"Given Europe's financial problems, why is it that we cannot bring ourselves to take some fundamental measures in this area and to combine those agencies whose responsibilities are very similar, such as the agency responsible for vocational training within Europe and the agency for vocational training outside Europe?"
"There are a number of good arguments for doing so."
"We have problems with the size of the agencies and, therefore, with their efficiency."
"We have supervisory bodies with more members than the agencies have employees."
"These are all things which damage the reputation of the European Union every day, because everyone who looks at the situation puts their head in their hands and says: 'You cannot seriously mean this'."
"Most importantly, some agencies have not reached the critical mass to enable them to work efficiently."
"Also, this House has provided too much money and too many staff members."
"In some agencies, such as OSHA, we have seen a budget increase of 105% and a staff increase of 69% over 10 years."
"Eurofound had a budget increase of 39% and a staff increase of 46%."
"This is why I am calling urgently on my fellow Members to introduce changes during the next budget debate."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(EL) Mr President, the previous speaker spoke about overlaps in the competences and remits of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions in Dublin and the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training in Thessaloniki, in Greece."
"If I remember correctly, both organisations were founded in 1975."
"I wonder: is it possible that two organisations were founded at the same time for the same purpose?"
"(DE) Mr President, Mrs Rapti, yes, that is possible, because, of course, an overlap has emerged in the meantime between the actual areas of work."
"By the way, I did not make this up myself."
"It was brought to light in the Commission study, which refers to the overlaps."
"In addition, surveys of all of those who make use of the agency's work also contain many references to the overlaps."
"This is where the information comes from."
"I will be happy to make these documents available to you."
"Mr President, Commissioner, in the last few years, I have been following the work of our agencies, particularly that of Bilbao and Dublin, and I believe that they are doing work that is both very worthy and, in terms of cost benefits, also extremely efficient."
"At the same time, we benefit from enormous transparency, and there is no doubt that they are working closely with Parliament."
"Therefore, I am surprised that shadows of doubt have been cast about their existence and about their work and I am shocked that, as always, some of its members, instead of having a political vision, have a vision that is accounts and nothing but accounts."
"It is true that accounts are very important: it is very important to know what the costs are, but we also need to know the benefits, the cost of preventing accidents at work, but also the costs of failure to prevent accidents at work."
"We need to know the costs of training, but also the costs of failing to train or failing to anticipate the changes that our workers and industries need to make."
"Commissioner, I believe that rather than problems with the agencies, some of your Members have problems with Europe."
"You, like Ulysses returning to Ithaca, must not listen to the songs of the sirens, because they want to lure the ship on to the rocks and for the ship of Europe to sink."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, we in the ECR Group want to see more effective control of the EU budget."
"On behalf of taxpayers, we demand real added value for money spent at EU level."
"Especially in these times of economic stringency, we want a tougher attitude towards spending in general: not more spending, but better spending."
"Applying this logic in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I am questioning the efficiency of the four agencies which we have been discussing: Eurofund, ETF, OSHA and the improbably named Cedefop."
"I recently myself visited ETF in Turin and also heard a presentation from Cedefop while I was there."
"There is indeed, as earlier speakers have said, considerable overlap between their programmes, and I believe that their management and administration, at least, could usefully be merged."
"I am therefore asking the following questions."
"Does the Commission apply efficiency and performance criteria to these agencies?"
"If so, may we see the criteria?"
"Secondly, how do the agencies perform against the criteria?"
"Can the Commission show Parliament an analysis of the agencies' performance?"
"Thirdly, given the considerable functional overlap, has the Commission considered merging them?"
"We have heard about synergies; we want to see them."
"Who sets the objectives and strategy of the agencies?"
"May we see them?"
"More generally, there seems to be considerable overlap between reports on employment matters produced on these agencies by the Commission and by the Policy Department of the European Parliament."
"We ask: is this duplication worthwhile?"
"(DE) Mr President, the EU has four agencies in the field of employment, working conditions and vocational training; namely, the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound), the European Training Foundation (ETF), the European Agency for Safety and Health (OSHA) and the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (Cedefop), with an annual budget of around EUR 15 million to EUR 20 million."
"I have looked at the websites of these four agencies."
"The focus is on activities such as a photo competition on the subject of risk prevention, a competition for practical solutions, whatever they might be, and the joint organisation of the European Day of Solidarity between Generations."
"These are all earthshaking activities, none of which seem to have any concrete output."
"The areas covered by the agencies overlap."
"There are overlaps between the agencies and also with the Directorates-General of the Commission, with departments in Parliament and with national bodies."
"Obviously, this situation cannot continue."
"We must prevent duplication of effort by merging the agencies."
"Inefficient agencies must be closed, because the taxpayers will definitely not understand why millions of euro are being wasted on photo competitions within this proliferation of agencies."
"(FR) Mr President, the synergies existing between these four agencies require us to take a closer look at their objectives."
"While their objectives have been established on paper, the discharge procedure leaves us less satisfied as to their effectiveness."
"The external auditor has pointed the finger at weak budgetary planning, the lack of a clear link between objectives and budgetary resources, as well as carry-overs and cancellations of significant appropriations."
"To take the example of Eurofound, the Court of Auditors notes in its 2009 report that the Foundation has not established in its budget a specific heading for the different programmes financed by assigned revenue."
"For me, the problem is that we are no longer sure how EU contributions are used before the agency's balance sheet is examined two years later."
"These weaknesses in budgetary planning do not therefore give us the guarantee of specific value for these four agencies."
"In response to this situation, we can think about coordinating their work better."
"For example, why not form a single governing board for these four agencies?"
"The interinstitutional working group has been working on these problems for a number of years."
"What response can it give us?"
"(EL) Mr President, the question pleases me, because I like evaluation, I like control."
"I also like studies that provide data which can help us do our job more efficiently in the European institutions for the benefit of European citizens."
"Why, when the European institutions call for an impact assessment before saying hello, do we have a problem with these two organisations that have been working since 1975, carrying out research and studies into work, education and training?"
"A good question."
"Except that its purpose is not economic or financial, it is political."
"It is a question that comes back time and again in different ways and for different reasons, and the fact that it has come back now, when Europe is in crisis, when the workers are suffering, when education is suffering, shows that it has a different purpose."
"We have found out how to smack and we are slapping everyone we can. Is Greece suffering?"
"Let us attack the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training, because it is in Thessaloniki, even if it was founded in 1975."
"What I am trying to say is this: overlaps between competences are one thing and cooperation is another thing, especially the cooperation needed to get things right in Europe."
"(DA) Mr President, I know these four agencies very well and I have been following their work for many years."
"I think that we should be very open in the way that we approach this issue."
"It is not simply a question of overlapping tasks; there would clearly be synergies and the opportunity to produce better quality work if we allowed them to work more closely together."
"My fellow Member from Greece, Mrs Rapti, mentioned that there were political undertones behind the desire to amalgamate agencies, and she said that we must not interfere with agencies in Greece."
"However, the fact that our agencies are spread out geographically and located in different places in Europe must not be a barrier to us having an efficient system."
"What is most important is that the agencies deliver, that the tasks we need them to do are accomplished and that they are accomplished as cheaply and as efficiently as possible."
"That is what you should work to achieve, Mr Andor."
"Therefore, be open in your thinking on this matter."
"(PL) Mr President, agencies dealing with employment issues play a particularly important role in view of the economic crisis currently affecting Europe."
"It is therefore worth examining in more detail the effectiveness of the measures they carry out."
"There is no doubt that these agencies should help Europeans to acquire skills that they will be able to use on a rapidly changing and ever more competitive labour market."
"We should therefore implement measures which will, firstly, result in greater flexibility in the European labour market, for example, mutual recognition of workers' qualifications by Member States."
"Secondly, the agencies should play an active role in creating programmes which take into account the economic and social challenges facing the European Union, including the demographic challenge and the overburdening of the pensions system."
"Finally, we should carry out research to identify the real problems in the European labour market."
"To sum up, the measures taken by the agencies dealing with employment issues should be targeted, above all, at helping EU citizens in the face of not only the economic, but also the demographic crisis."
"(DE) Mr President, it is very significant that the Member who asked the question has left the room during the discussion."
"The arguments and questions put by some of the previous speakers once again demonstrate a highly revealing populist mindset."
"We are in the midst of a crisis and, as usual, savings are being made in areas which affect the workers."
"I think that this is a very one-sided approach."
"I would like to look briefly at the European Training Foundation (ETF)."
"It is important because of its cooperation with the International Labour Organisation (ILO) in the EU's partner countries."
"It enables the European social model to be exported to acceding countries and provides help with developing education, vocational training and further education programmes and with creating secure jobs."
"Two weeks ago, I was in Belgrade and, in meetings with education and training providers, I was once again assured of the importance of the agency."
"The same thing happened in meetings in Turkey."
"The ETF plays a very important role in helping the acceding countries to enter the EU labour market."
"If we take a more far-sighted approach, the Arab spring is also very important."
"We do not want large numbers of refugees to come to Europe, so we must offer people support in their home countries."
"We must provide education and help the countries to develop training programmes and facilities."
"(PL) Mr President, as shadow rapporteur for the report on cooperation in the field of vocational education and training, I have followed the activities of the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training with particular interest."
"Matching vocational training to the needs of citizens and the labour market is one of the key factors in increasing employment levels and the competitiveness of the European Union."
"We cannot therefore underestimate the role played by Cedefop."
"The report for 2010 confirmed my beliefs regarding Cedefop's effectiveness."
"Evidence of this can be seen, inter alia, in the steady rise in the number of people using its publications and the Europass portal."
"However, I believe that it is vital to increase Cedefop's involvement in structural measures aimed at vocational training, including the introduction of a system for assessing the effectiveness of training."
"I also believe that the agency has superb potential to draft an attractive proposal in this respect."
"(PT) Mr President, I am not seeking to call into question the work and efforts of the workers, experts and specialists of the four existing European agencies responsible for employment, working conditions and training."
"Nevertheless, greater coordination and synergy in the work carried out is certainly necessary and possible to make its benefits clearer."
"They carry out some important studies giving us greater insight into problems regarding working conditions, training, the actual quality of jobs, and even the lack of democracy in workplaces."
"However, there is a need for the European Commission to then take specific actions to respond positively to these problems."
"That, Commissioner, is the challenge we are setting for the European Commission."
"(EL) Mr President, I asked for the floor, because I can see that I am not taking up anyone else's speaking time, in order to raise three issues, which I think will help the debate."
"Firstly, in order to ask if a study has been carried out into the money we would save if these four organisations were closed down."
"The question is not, of course, addressed to the Commission; it is addressed to the absent member who asked the question, who is no longer here, who would appear not to want an answer."
"The second is that the International Labour Organisation (ILO) uses the data provided by these organisations to saturation point and the third and final issue is to remind the House that discharge for all four organisations was approved just yesterday."
"However, no discharge was approved for the Police College based in Britain."
"Now as it appears, Ms Rapti, the fact that I made this exception made other Members of the House want to take the floor as well."
"We are already over time."
"If you really want the floor, I will now have to give it to you but please do not just ask for the floor just to express some kind of disagreement with the process."
"Ms Gräßle, you want the floor for one minute?"
"If you want to speak to make a point of substance, go ahead."
"(DE) Mr President, if you had explained when Mrs Rapti took the floor what the consequences would be, we could have made more progress."
"Mrs Rapti, this approach has brought about exactly the situation that we now find ourselves in and the problem of the agencies working inefficiently, which we urgently need to resolve."
"If we want to retain the agencies, we need to change them."
"I can only ask you to join us in our efforts."
"We cannot simply leave things as they are because the agencies are so inefficient and because they are wasting money rather than making money every day."
"I would like to mention once again that the funding for the four agencies we are talking about amounts to EUR 90 million."
"That is a lot of money."
"I am not sure whether the services that the agencies provide are really worth EUR 90 million."
"That is the point I would like to emphasise."
"We owe this to our citizens and our taxpayers."
"I have to justify myself every day to German taxpayers and explain that we are getting value for money."
"I believe that there is plenty of room for improvement."
"(DE) Mr President, when we look at the development of agencies in Europe, it gradually becomes clear that we are suffering from 'agencyitis'."
"There are no other areas where four agencies are working in parallel."
"Elsewhere, the job is done by one agency."
"When we consider the situation as a whole, it seems as if each country essentially wants its own agency."
"If you will pardon me for saying so, we cannot allow this to happen."
"We should not only be discussing whether a merger should take place."
"We should also be considering which tasks the Commission itself can take responsibility for and whether an agency is needed at all."
"This means that we should gradually move to thinking about which agencies we can close down."
"I would like to ask the previous speaker, who took the floor twice: Where are the specific efficiency measurements?"
"How many jobs have the agencies actually created?"
"Where is the turnover which justifies ongoing funding of EUR 90 million per year?"
"When I have the answers to these questions, I will be able to support the continuing existence of these agencies."
"Otherwise, I would like to see them closed."
"(PL) Mr President, I believe that it is extremely important for us to have agencies carrying out effective measures relating to the labour market and employment and, of course, agencies need to be held accountable for their results."
"Let us not forget that every third European Union citizen has no professional qualifications."
"Matters relating to monitoring of the employment sector, labour market potential and vocational training generate an enormous amount of data, which it is no longer possible for any one Member State to evaluate on its own."
"We should therefore hold agencies accountable for the effectiveness of their work, but we should remember that the results of this work may now have an incredible impact on the labour market, by linking all vocational training to jobs and professions which are already showing signs of being in short supply in the future European Union."
"Today, we have to import a large number of workers from other countries for jobs which require a narrow specialisation, such as doctors and nurses."
"These are the problems the European Union is facing, and we should therefore appreciate how effective these agencies' measures are."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I believe that we need to discuss all issues like this without any taboos."
"If we find weaknesses or waste, we have to address them."
"However, it is also very important that we do not misrepresent reality and we do not overstate the weaknesses we find just so as to make a strong point."
"I regret that some of the colleagues who spoke have actually left, but I would like to answer them very specifically."
"For example, I very strongly reject the notion that some of these agencies just do PR and work of a very superficial nature."
"They actually do very concrete analytical and policy work, including the exchange of experience, and help deliver European policies, in these particular instances, in the area of employment and social issues."
"I think these agencies are instrumental in delivering the Europe 2020 strategy and progress towards the headline targets we have agreed."
"I very much agree that developing skills and vocational training is one of the key challenges we are facing, as was stressed in the discussion."
"This is one of the key structural causes of unemployment in the European Union, and we need the contribution of these agencies more than ever."
"It is true, however, that we have to see whether the costs are justified or not, and we need to approach this on a very concrete basis."
"In principle, the efficiency and performance criteria of an agency are set out in its annual work programme, together with an indication of the ways in which such criteria are to be addressed."
"An agency's annual work programme has to be approved by its governing board, and is presented to the relevant European Parliament committee."
"The Commission representatives on the governing boards of agencies take the need for quantitative and qualitative performance criteria very seriously and make every effort to ensure that they are applied."
"On the question of how the agencies perform against the criteria that are set, I have to say that it is the role of the governing board of each agency to assess its performance against those criteria."
"As a rule, agencies carry out external evaluations of their work programmes at regular intervals, and these take such performance indicators into account."
"Agencies usually report on the results of external evaluations in the director's annual activity report, which is submitted to the budgetary authority."
"As part of the budgetary authority, Parliament may also request agencies to justify their performance."
"Agencies are also subject to evaluation by the Court of Auditors in connection with the annual discharge procedure, the results of which are discussed in the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"Commission representatives on the governing boards of agencies make every effort to ensure that the recommendations stemming from external evaluations, and those from the Court of Auditors and the Commission's internal audit service, are followed up appropriately."
"I addressed the question of the functional overlap between two agencies - the ETF and Cedefop - in my introductory speech, but I would like to stress again that the contribution of these agencies can be crucial, especially in the context of increasing employment in line with the 2020 objectives."
"The ETF, particularly in the light of the recent changes in the Mediterranean area, can play a very strong role in bringing prosperity to the regions neighbouring the European Union."
"I have one more point to make concerning Parliament's capacity to see the development of strategies."
"The objectives of the agencies are defined in the Financial Regulation which, as you know, is published in the Official Journal."
"An agency's strategy is usually set by the director in agreement with the governing board, and these strategies are presented to Parliament each year and are reflected in the annual work programme."
"The four agencies concerned presented their annual work programmes to Parliament's Committee on Employment and Social Affairs at the end of January this year."
"Finally, I would like to say that I also believe it would be useful to involve the Council Presidency in such discussions."
"I can assure you I will follow this up with them, and I am sure I will find a common language with the Presidency on this issue as well."
"The debate is closed."
"(The sitting was suspended at 19:25 and resumed at 21:00)"
"Innovation Union: transforming Europe for a post-crisis world (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Merkies, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on Innovation Union: transforming Europe for a post-crisis world."
"Mr President, Commissioner, you are an innovator, I am an innovator, we are innovators, we can all be innovators."
"How can we be?"
"The answer is as researchers, scientists, policy makers, workers on the shop floor, consumers and citizens."
"It is the citizens who are key to innovation - they make or break it."
"Yet what can we, as policy makers, as politicians, do to accelerate that innovation?"
"Innovation is the only way out of the financial and economic crisis, as innovation will provide the solution to the problems that affect us all - such as the ageing of the population, climate change and the scarcity of raw materials - and will also put an immediate end to the financial and economic crisis."
"Through innovation, we hope to be able to link all these things together, give the economy a vigorous boost and, at the same time, move towards a sustainable society."
"This will not happen on its own, of course."
"A change of mindset is required - a changing of the concept of society and of how we need to get to work in politics and in business and industry."
"So, what are the specific measures that we could take?"
"We need more focus and less fragmentation."
"We need to do away with our narrow-mindedness when it comes to innovation and in policy."
"What do we want to achieve?"
"Innovation is not just a question of one building, one ministry, one programme."
"Innovation needs to be something that runs through every area of policy."
"That therefore has to be the political mindset, too."
"Preferably, we need a holistic approach."
"Why do we have so many programmes already?"
"Bring these together wherever possible and actually start to simplify things, for once."
"That is the mission for us, as politicians."
"Cut the red tape."
"As politicians, we have a constant tendency, if we want to achieve something, to throw a new layer on top, additional regulation, an additional programme, an additional funding option."
"Maybe the solution is not the 'additional' in this case; maybe it is just 'less' or 'instead'."
"We thus need less control-freakery in funding applications and - something that is very important - to offer service to those who come to us for funding and promotion, to provide a one-stop shop for applicants, new business founders, SME operators and, where appropriate, for regions and research bodies."
"This means not merely checking funding applications but, where appropriate, also seeking out suitable partners or networks for collaboration."
"There needs to be a great deal more venture capital and, in that regard, instead of EUR 1 billion in the next funding period, we really need to aim for EUR 5 billion, as that will provide the banks with just the little bit of support they need in order to grant loans to SMEs."
"We need a cheap and simple patent and workable rules to protect intellectual property."
"We need a true European internal market where innovations are better able to succeed through access to a market of 500 million citizens."
"At the moment, that market is much too compartmentalised."
"Up to now, innovation has predominantly been seen as a high-tech product."
"That is not necessarily the case - it can also relate to social innovation."
"Europe has been struggling for years against an innovation brain drain - creative people who would rather head to the United States because they believe that it is easier there."
"If we are honest, the truth is that that is sometimes the case."
"Inflexible personal liability rules, the lack of financial support and high thresholds in order to enter the European market are all barriers that ensure that innovation has not, hitherto, seen great success in Europe."
"The EU must dare to reward - not punish - courage, entrepreneurship, curiosity and creativity."
"We need European versions of Steve Jobs."
"Let us merge where we are strong; let us in Europe bring together the spirit of research, Einstein and Steve Jobs."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur, Ms Merkies, for this excellent report."
"I want to thank the shadow rapporteurs on the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE), as well as the members of the seven committees that delivered their opinions to ITRE."
"Their support for all the various aspects of Innovation Union will be crucial to its success."
"Innovation has been placed at the heart of the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth."
"I would like to take this opportunity to illustrate in concrete terms what Innovation Union will mean for different people."
"We will encourage and support better collaboration between business and academia through the creation of knowledge alliances to develop new curricula that address innovation skills gaps."
"For Europe's researchers, we will take measures to boost cross-border cooperation and remove obstacles to research and mobility, completing the European Research Area by 2014."
"Ultimately, as Ms Merkies put it, we have to merge Albert Einstein and Steve Jobs and keep him or her in Europe: we must be seen to be attractive and dynamic, and unfettered by unnecessary red tape."
"For our small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and entrepreneurs, Innovation Union is working to create conditions on intellectual property rights (IPR), standard setting and access to finance that will be much more conducive to innovation."
"On 13 April 2011, we presented two legislative proposals on IPR, under enhanced cooperation, which will reduce the cost of patents by up to 80%."
"A single European patent will be valid in 25 Member States and, if you want to build a start-up or you need access to finance, the Commission will ensure by 2012 that venture capital funds established in any Member State can function and invest freely elsewhere in the EU."
"Innovation Union will also champion the best examples of public sector innovation, and the private and public sectors can learn from each other's best practice."
"Public procurement represents 17% of the EU's GDP, an enormous potential market for innovation."
"So we encourage Member States and regions to set aside budgets for public procurement of innovative products and services."
"Finally, what about the average taxpayer?"
"Well, Innovation Union will make the best use of public money."
"This means prioritising smart fiscal consolidation, despite severe budget constraints."
"Investment in education, research and innovation has the potential to create more wealth and jobs than it costs, and investment in innovation will help us tackle the great challenges that society faces."
"That brings me to the partnerships which will provide a framework for aligning instruments and resources, bringing all the key actors together."
"They aim to cover the whole innovation chain, from supporting excellent R&D to making sure that we have the conditions in place to bring the results of that R&D to the market successfully."
"We are delighted that Parliament gave such strong support on 11 November 2010 to the concept of the innovation partnerships."
"Parliament's President has been invited to nominate four members to the steering board, and we look forward to that."
"Last but not least, Ms Merkies mentioned social innovation, which has been discussed by ITRE."
"The Commission is committed to launching a European social innovation pilot that will provide expertise and a networked virtual hub for social entrepreneurs and for the public and third sectors."
"Let me stop there, because I think tonight is all about hearing what the Members of Parliament have to say, so that after the debate, when we go away with the report, we will be able to respond to those comments."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the financial crisis has particularly emphasised the necessity of innovation in the economy of the European Union and therefore, the Commission's proposals for the 'Innovation Union' are particularly welcome."
"A successful innovation policy must rest on three pillars: political support, finance and orderly legislation."
"As we emphasise in the opinion of the Committee on International Trade, the overarching objective of the 'Innovation Union' must be long-term development and competitiveness based on technology, knowledge and the development of education."
"In increasing investment in research and development to 3% of gross domestic product, we must carry out structural reforms to secure its effective application and accessibility for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"An important aspect is entrepreneurs' understanding of innovations."
"These do not only include high technology and discoveries, but also social, business, management, marketing and other innovations, which demand ever more effective application of knowledge, and more active collaboration with universities and research centres."
"It is important to identify the strong aspects of research, while avoiding excessive prioritisation, where everyone is researching one and the same thing."
"European patents currently cost 15 times more than US patents, hence the reason why we must develop the European patent more quickly and reduce its cost."
"Valuable inventions are being made in many of the new Member States but due to lack of funding, the researchers are forced to sell them to other countries and companies for a few thousands, whereas their real worth can be measured in millions."
"As regards patents obtained with public funds, it is important that universities and private persons be able to share in intellectual property created in this way."
"The European Union must reinforce protection of intellectual property in order to safeguard our technology and know-how from piracy and fraud, especially by concluding agreements with third countries."
"For their part, governments must draw up programmes for developing innovation."
"We may not be able to overtake China and India in the quantity of research, but we can definitely offer quality and better conditions for implementing ideas. Thank you."
"Mr President, we on the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs have argued that innovations are absolutely crucial to economic development and improved employment, now that Europe is looking for a way out of the economic crisis."
"R&D investment tends to drop in periods of economic crisis, even though it has been proved that those companies and Member States that invest the most during those periods are the ones that gain the greatest comparative market advantage."
"They are also the ones to recover fastest from recession."
"That is why it is extremely important for the Member States to meet the Europe 2020 target and invest at least 3% of GDP into research and development."
"The Committee on Employment stresses the importance of innovation policy being viewed broadly, not merely in the form of technical innovation, but also - more than has previously been the case - in the form of social and servicerelated innovation that helps resolve challenges facing society, such as ageing, healthcare, and changes in the environment, climate and energy efficiency."
"A good example of this is the pilot project known as the European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing."
"Information and communications technology (ICT) is important in all innovative activity."
"ICT skills depend on improvements in the quality of training, support for lifelong learning, and the opportunity for those already in employment to update their own knowledge and skills continuously."
"Most of the initiatives that will make innovation possible come from the business sector, and so closer cooperation with universities and research centres is essential."
"On the other hand, the commercial exploitation in the EU of research findings in universities is inadequate or too slow."
"That is why we need business incubators linking the business world and universities, whose task it would be to promote the commercial exploitation of research findings."
"The Committee on Employment considers it absolutely essential that a European research area be created, with obstacles to the mobility of researchers being eliminated, and advanced European research infrastructure being created."
"We should therefore prevent the brain drain from Europe to other places - if anything, Europe should be an area that attracts researchers from elsewhere."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the possibility of strongly stimulating the economic and social development that is so necessary in our times is, in fact, integral to innovation."
"We can go even further and say that innovation constitutes a necessary means of helping respond to many of the problems and challenges facing humankind today."
"As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I sought to uphold this idea by drawing attention to some of the main challenges we are facing in the following areas, to cite but a few examples: the scarcity and efficient use of resources, waste recovery and treatment, food quality and security, demographic change, new epidemics, and conservation of nature and biodiversity."
"I sought to uphold the fact that innovation should be guided, above all, by the criteria of defending the public interest, improving people's quality of life, promoting social welfare, and preserving the environment and the balance of nature."
"It should be a key element of public policy in such areas as the environment, water, energy, transport, telecommunications, health and education."
"I drew attention to the fact, acknowledged by the 2009 European Innovation Panel, that the economic and financial crisis is having a disproportionate impact on a number of countries and regions, thereby undermining the objective of convergence."
"The constraints currently imposed on the Member States could result in increased restrictions on investment in science, technology and innovation, particularly in the most vulnerable countries."
"Instead of the announced 'Innovation Union', the result could be a veritable innovation divide between the countries and regions that innovate most and the rest."
"Unfortunately, the first draft opinion that I tabled ended up being diluted by amendments adopted in committee."
"Where there was - and should be - public interest, development, cohesion, progress and social welfare, what has ended up predominating are so-called business opportunities, competition, and the harnessing of innovation for business purposes."
"While that is also the dominant vision in the Commission communication, it is not our vision."
"This is not the vision of the future that we need."
"Mr President, the key point, in the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, is the creation of an Innovation Union with an enhanced social profile predicated on job creation."
"Innovative goods and services need to be adopted, which will target both the private and the public sector, so as to facilitate the implementation of administrative procedures, strengthen the public administration and reduce bureaucracy and the inflexibility of the public sector."
"Furthermore, the adoption of innovative solutions is closely bound up with pre-commercial procurement, which resolves issues which the market cannot cover or where the solutions proposed are uneconomic."
"In the private sector, we must encourage small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as micro-enterprises, which are having particular difficulty adapting to the market, to increase the use of innovative products, on the one hand, and create innovative solutions, on the other."
"Special mention also needs to be made of micro-enterprises in regional and rural areas, which are struggling to survive due to the lack of funding, so that we can find ways of encouraging the use of innovative solutions, thereby improving their viability."
"At the same time, environmental innovation programmes need to be encouraged, so as to plug the gaps which exist in efforts to deal with climate change and promote environmentally-friendly solutions."
"In addition to strengthening innovation, we need to look at how it can directly benefit the citizens of the European Union."
"The use of innovative solutions should result in lower costs for enterprises and should enable consumers to enjoy cheaper and better products."
"rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development. - Mr President, I would say to the Commissioner that, in recent years, innovation has become a symbol of a policy instrument that can fix all our problems."
"This means that there are huge expectations and that we must deliver."
"Of course, for a successful implementation of ideas, governance matters very strongly and a governance framework for innovation must be based today on pragmatism and must be delivered with a sense of urgency, and also must be at the service of the policy content."
"Europe, we all agree, has to innovate or it will lose out to competitors."
"Every link in the European innovation chain must be strengthened and innovation policy must be focused towards challenges."
"That is what I understand the Innovation Union is offering."
"Today, we run the risk that, not only companies, but also governments might decrease investment in innovation."
"That is the logic of the crisis and the logic of national budget cuts."
"EU policy responses and EU budgetary instruments must move firmly against that logic."
"In Europe, innovation is not just a concept that can be limited to specific innovation centres."
"It needs to be applied across the entire European territory."
"Europe is simply too small to afford an innovation deficit anywhere on its territory."
"Research and innovation are clearly not the same thing and we agree with you very clearly."
"Governance for innovation should therefore do more than just support research and development policy."
"Promoting innovation-led growth is not about increasing excellence in R&D infrastructure."
"Important as they are, it is, first and foremost, about mobilising talents and mobilising new ideas."
"Governance for innovation must mean establishing new partnerships enabling efficient innovation systems that mobilise intellectual and entrepreneurial capacities, detecting also sleeping innovators - of which we have many in Europe - through a business environment that is conducive to innovation, and particularly for SMEs, covering all sectors of the economy."
"To conclude, let me say that we do not yet have a fully-fledged European model for innovation, but what is clear is that it must be rooted in a well-orchestrated, concrete, strong and joint public/private effort."
"I trust that the Innovation Union will take us all the way forward towards such a model."
"Mr President, the report by Mrs Merkies - whom I thank for the work she has done - is Parliament's first important contribution to the Commission proposal on the Innovation Union initiative."
"In recent years, major countries around the world have tenaciously pursued the objective of concentrating their competition policies on certain key sectors, which have generated growth and development by aiming at innovation."
"The high-tech sector is a good example."
"Europe, too, recognises the need to pursue projects aiming at economic and industrial growth, by focusing resources and investment on innovative policies, without abandoning the path it has followed in recent decades of playing a leading and guiding role in economic and social development."
"The main thrust of this report shows the need for a cross-cutting approach, promoting innovation in all areas of business, the economy and society in general."
"Small and medium-sized enterprises - the mainstay of Europe's economic performance even in difficult crisis situations - are picked out as places where innovation occurs every day."
"Today, these abilities should be recognised, rewarded and put at the service of the growth and development of the whole continent."
"It is also made clear that innovation and research are two sides of the same coin."
"Innovation may derive from research, but it can also be a wide-ranging ability to change things for the better in all areas of daily life."
"Succeeding in this will be a challenge for Europe."
"We may not manage to create a Silicon Valley straight away, but perhaps we can establish a Stanford University."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Merkies, on her excellent work, because she has unpicked the content of the report and concentrated on the more relevant aspects for our group, such as social innovation - understood as innovation by workers and the public - the incentive provided by the public procurement of innovative and green products and services, and the need to improve the access to finance on the part of SMEs."
"This allows me to concentrate and comment on a specific aspect of the report: the need to develop indicators."
"Ladies and gentlemen, if we understand innovation simply in terms of new products, processes and services that result in an increase in economic activity, it is essential that we equip ourselves with the instruments to measure our innovation capacity precisely in economic terms and that we do so on the basis of parameters, such as private investment and R&D, employment or the number of innovative companies."
"We have to establish indicators that reflect the capacity of innovation to generate growth, employment and an increase in GDP, and which allow us to compare our situation, in terms of intensity, with the economies of our competitor countries."
"I would like to end with a few words as a member of a delegation that opposed the launch of enhanced cooperation on the unitary Community patent and to say that we opposed it, because we believe that the enhanced cooperation instrument may directly affect the internal market, territorial cohesion and the right of citizens of all Member States to have maximum legal security."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (BG) Mr President, Europe is currently faced with a comparatively new but very serious danger of lagging behind or even of a decline in terms of global competition in the field of science and technology."
"Such a development would put our prosperity, economic progress and social status under serious pressure."
"Put in simpler terms, Europe is under threat of turning into a mediocre actor on the global scientific and economic stage."
"Europe urgently needs innovation now."
"I congratulate Mrs Merkies on her fine report."
"I am also delighted with the excellent ideas from Commissioner Geoghegan-Quinn."
"This guarantees success because the Innovation Union is primarily a strategy for the European Union's economic development."
"We require the following for us to succeed in this."
"Firstly, we need to have better access to credit and financial support; we need more investment in scientific research and development; clear rules offering long-term prospects in terms of innovation; simplified procedures for accessing European and national support programmes; and cheap, simple European patents."
"Mr President, today, we are discussing innovation strategy in plenary for the second time."
"In many of our debates on the standing of European countries on world markets, we regularly remark on the importance of boosting the competitiveness of the European economy."
"The EU's position on world markets will, in future, be greatly influenced by the success of innovations and the speed of innovation cycles."
"European states clearly operate at a very high level in research projects."
"The long-term problem, however, is the slow implementation of this knowledge in practice, due to complex bureaucracy."
"The fund for science and research is one of the largest EU funds."
"It must therefore be our aim to simplify the bureaucracy involved in the transfer of research results as much as possible, and thus to provide maximum assistance to innovation, thereby strengthening the competitiveness of the EU."
"We must think how to deal with the commercial exploitation of the results of research projects within the framework of innovation measures."
"If we complicate the implementation of European research in the commercial sphere, we will find it hard to speed up the innovation cycle."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, research and innovation policy is one of the three main pillars of the polices of the European Union."
"I would also say that it will increasingly become a strategic tool that is absolutely essential for our future."
"Why?"
"Because we have the good fortune, or the challenge, of living at the dawn of a change of civilisation."
"Think about this."
"We need to ensure the conditions of a decent existence for all, not only here and now, but elsewhere, too, and for future generations."
"This, in itself, is already a major challenge."
"On top of this, however, for the first time in the history of mankind, we need to do this within the physical limits of the planet."
"This, of course, radically transforms the context."
"Our conviction is that Europe can be a world leader in this profound transformation, not only of our infrastructure and organisations, but also, and more importantly, of our way of producing, consuming and living."
"For us, it is by being right up there among the leaders that we will best ensure the competitiveness of the European Union."
"This gives me the opportunity to say that competitiveness is not an objective in itself."
"Our objective is to be in a position to meet the challenges which, let us not forget, threaten the very existence of mankind on this planet."
"If we are among the best, our competitiveness will, however, be assured."
"A great many things have been said with which we agree."
"There are just two points I would like to raise."
"Firstly, we need to maximise the impact of each euro spent."
"This requires better alignment between the different EU policies and between what is done at the level of the European Union and what is done at the level of the Member States."
"This means that we need to progress from a logic where the general rule is subsidy and exemption, lending and risk sharing, to a logic where catalysing private investment by using public funds is a major objective."
"The best way of doing that is not always by contributing non-repayable money."
"Finally, we must have the courage to put an end to a number of huge white elephants, such as the ITER project which, in fact, gobbles up a substantial amount of European research money - EUR 7 billion out of EUR 60 billion - just imagine!"
"We need to put an end to that."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr President, I would like to thank Ms Merkies for all her efforts and her coordination during the period in which this report was being negotiated among the political groups."
"I believe that she has done a very good job."
"I have three points to make."
"I am happy to see that the rapporteur has taken on board the role of broadband."
"The digital world and information and communication technologies are engines of innovation, and high-speed broadband should be an essential precondition for all European innovation partnerships."
"Secondly, in the run-up to the FP8, we should further strengthen the monitoring and ex-post evaluation of results of EU-funded research and innovation activities."
"Thus, we see that Ms Merkies has quite correctly included in her report a paragraph calling on the Commission to develop an integrated indicator system that would allow better monitoring and assessment of progress and the measurable impact of innovation policies and programmes in the EU."
"In conclusion, a few days ago, the President of the European Council, Mr Van Rompuy, stated that Europeans are not innovative because they are depressed."
"That is, indeed, an innovative assumption, but I think it is a matter of character."
"We need to encourage a culture of learning, curiosity and risk-taking."
"(DE) Mr President, we are facing major societal challenges: the economic crisis, the ageing population, the scarcity of resources and the need to maintain our international competitiveness."
"This makes it all the more important for us to promote innovation, which can counteract these problems by providing creative ideas and solutions."
"This is not just about introducing technical innovations, but also socio-political innovations."
"For example, in order to deal with the problem of the ageing population, we need so-called classic innovations, on the one hand, such as new drugs, and, on the other, we should be thinking about innovative models for society, pensions and healthcare systems."
"We need to create an environment today which promotes the innovations of tomorrow, including investment in research and development, protection for intellectual property, in particular, using patent legislation, and the encouragement of creative skills, starting in school classrooms."
"Finally, I would like to mention a particular problem relating to the use of resources."
"Innovations should ultimately ensure that products last longer."
"This will be of benefit to consumers and the environment."
"Unfortunately, there are also innovations which have the opposite effect."
"Products are developed with deliberate weak points which shorten their useful life and increase consumption, such as laptops and smart phones."
"The Innovation Union must help to combat this."
"(DE) Mr President, Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to give my sincere thanks to Mrs Merkies for her hard work."
"I would also like to thank the many Members who were involved and the Commission for its support."
"We are largely in agreement on this issue."
"Over the years, we have adopted a large number of programmes and papers here, from the Lisbon strategy to Europe 2020, and many more."
"We have constantly said that the future of Europe will depend on whether we succeed in resolving the question of innovation."
"We all agree that this involves all aspects of education, training and research, and that the entrepreneurial side is also important."
"Nevertheless, it is true, as a previous speaker has just said, that other regions of the world are obviously able to mobilise talent and ideas more effectively than we can."
"Therefore, we need to stop for at least a second or two to think about the reasons for this."
"Is it because we are providing too little funding or because we cannot find the right way of exploiting the potential that is there?"
"This is what Mrs Merkies referred to in her speech."
"I would like to mention briefly one other issue."
"I was part of a delegation to California and one evening, we met with young entrepreneurs and people who wanted to start new companies."
"I will never forget that evening."
"Those young people's eyes were shining, they were full of enthusiasm and they and others believed that they were capable of achieving something."
"They only asked for one thing."
"They wanted help for everyone who aimed to start up a business, so that they were given a chance, had the freedom to act, and did not spend all their time grappling with red tape."
"I will not forget this, because it was a very, very important signal for me."
"How can we increase the effectiveness of our investments in research?"
"I believe that the contributions made by the European Research Council (ERC) and the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) in the area of research are interesting and exciting and could produce good results."
"The questions concerning venture capital and people can probably best be answered if we as politicians do not attempt to evaluate all the questions, to come to a decision and to draw up guidelines."
"Perhaps only a few regulations are needed."
"As Mrs Merkies has said, less is often more."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"Mr President, Mr Reul, thank you for your speech."
"How do you think that we can incorporate these ambitions within the framework of the Innovation Union into all the work that we do in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, into all the other documents that are still to come, into the common strategy framework, into all the research funding and into future programmes?"
"How can the Commission ensure that, ultimately, a single thread runs through all these policy elements so that we actually attain the objectives set in this Innovation Union?"
"(DE) Mr President, I still believe in the things that are good and positive."
"In the spirit of the young people we met in California, I would like to say that we can achieve this."
"However, perhaps we do not need to impose regulations covering every detail."
"(DA) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on this report."
"It is a very fine result."
"In the 2020 strategy, we acknowledged the fact that, if we are to maintain our level of prosperity in Europe, we need to increase our productivity."
"We therefore need to focus on innovation."
"However, it is important that we do not restrict innovation to research and technology."
"If we take innovation seriously, we must, first and foremost, invest in the human element."
"Innovation involves creative processes that can be taught and that should be included in the teaching methods used in the Member States, because we need workers with good suggestions for improvements to the job and solution models to tackle the new tasks."
"However, this means that we need to educate and provide further training for our workforce."
"We are also faced with the huge task of teaching businesses how they can best utilise the innovation potential of their workers."
"Worker-driven innovation is not only good for businesses, it is also good for job satisfaction, and it can help to reduce stress."
"I would like to call on the Commission to enter into talks with the two sides of industry to discuss how we can best promote worker-driven innovation in Europe."
"(PL) Mr President, of course we are all in favour of innovation, particularly when it comes to science and industry - and I say this not only as a politician, but also as someone who once worked at a university, since I was a lecturer before I became a politician."
"In reality, however - and a few speakers have already mentioned this - we are losing the race for innovation against countries such as the United States and the Middle Eastern countries."
"This is why we are calling for our cooperation on innovation to be extended to include non-EU countries as well."
"I am very pleased by the adoption of the amendment I tabled, which has been included as paragraph 167 and which calls for cooperation with the countries participating in the Eastern Partnership, and I hope that paragraph 71 will be similarly amended."
"This paragraph does admittedly refer to the Mediterranean countries, but it should be extended to include all countries involved in the European Neighbourhood Policy."
"(EL) Mr President, Mrs Merkies has produced an excellent report and I congratulate her."
"Of course, we also have the EU 2020 strategy, we have numerous efforts and numerous reports on innovation and youth employment on paper, which we need to put into practice."
"Young people in Europe are unemployed at a rate of 9.6% in terms of general unemployment, but this rate exceeds 20.2% for young people aged 19-27 and, of course, these people are in despair."
"Work is not just a livelihood; we have to understand that and we have to give young people the opportunity to work because, in doing so, we give them their self-esteem."
"Every citizen must have the opportunity, of course, to develop innovative action, by taking part in the innovation programme, and to change Europe."
"Commissioner, the Commission communication refers to partnerships in the innovation sector."
"How does the Commission intend to promote closer participation by the regions, what means will be used, and what funding will be provided?"
"(DE) Mr President, the major challenges faced by the Innovation Union include the ageing population and maintaining healthcare systems."
"In order to ensure that the systems are sustainable and stable, they must be considered and discussed in their full context."
"It will only be possible to find successful solutions by looking at the interrelationships between the systems."
"By 2050, the ratio of EU citizens of working age to those over the age of 65 will fall from 4:1 to 2:1."
"As a result, spending on pensions and healthcare is certain to rise."
"However, focusing only on pension legislation and increasing patients' contributions will not allow us to achieve our objectives."
"Successful solutions will also have to consider the failings of our education and labour market policies."
"It will be essential to invest in training and to change the direction of our training policy in order to counteract a situation in which a growing number of jobs in highly specialised industries cannot be filled, while an equivalent number of low-skilled people of working age are relying on benefits."
"As part of our labour market policy, we will have to coordinate our family and equality policies, instead of seeing them as contradictory."
"(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on her excellent work."
"Europe needs a sustainable and competitive economic model that responds to the major social challenges of today, and that ensures more and better jobs."
"The 'Innovation Union' initiative introduces a strategic European innovation policy that is integrated and oriented towards companies and people."
"The concept of innovation must go further than technological innovation: it must be associated with products, but also with processes, services, movements, systems and organisational structures."
"In particular, social innovation aims to find new and effective solutions for pressing social needs."
"In addition, young people are the engine of innovation: we therefore need to implement policies that promote young people's access to the labour market."
"It is also essential to create proper support mechanisms for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"The success of innovation policy depends on the existence of a simple, efficient, unbureaucratic system for science and higher education."
"The proper financing of these two areas is a necessary condition for developing innovation."
"Therefore, given the target of 3% of gross domestic product for technological research and development, I call on the Commission to consider the possibility of establishing an effective EU-wide system for governing this target, in the light of what is happening with economic governance."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when we set ourselves the objective of strengthening our capacity for innovation and investment or the competitive advantage to be found with the United States and China, we speak of economic development, certainly, but specifically, we also speak of creating jobs."
"For that reason, we must give ourselves the means to strengthen innovation."
"I would like to congratulate Mrs Merkies on the one-stop shop, the funding strategy, and the recognition of necessary risk-taking by researchers."
"Her report points in the right direction and proposes a context that is favourable to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which are essential to the success of the European Union."
"Innovation means attractiveness and competitiveness of the territories, and the involvement of the regional and local authorities is essential in terms of committing appropriations, reducing disparities and enhancing the active role that citizens must play."
"It is directly on the ground that the measure proposed in this report will contribute effectively to the achievement of the Europe 2020 strategy objectives."
"(CS) Mr President, Europe and innovation."
"I would like to say a little here about what my colleagues, Mr Migalski and Mr Tošenovský, were just talking about."
"Where are we, essentially?"
"The US is ahead of us, Japan is ahead of us, and Brazil, India and China are hot on our heels."
"I see the Innovation Union programme as a programme coming at one minute to midnight."
"In all likelihood, this is the last opportunity we will have to get a grip in the area of innovation, and to prevent those countries from catching up with us."
"Any failure in this area by Europe as a continent will have fatal consequences - as all the other Members have said - for the competitiveness of Europe, for the quality of life of its inhabitants and, ultimately, also for the values which Europe represents for the world."
"I am therefore pleased that the European Parliament has managed to initiate specific legislative measures, such as greater cooperation over the introduction of a European patent."
"I also consider the area of standardisation very important in relation to the introduction of innovations into practice, as well as their application by small and medium-sized enterprises."
"(PL) Mr President, in the speech I made here in Strasbourg last November, I highlighted the significant differences that exist between the old and the new European Union Member States when it comes to financial support for the research and development sector."
"In the long term, this will result in substantial imbalances in the development of the individual European Union Member States, and in the phenomenon given the ugly name of 'brain drain' by journalists, which is mistakenly referred to as intellectual mobility in the report."
"In order to guarantee sustainable development in Europe - and I would emphasise the word sustainable - the EU must earmark more funding for the development of innovation and research projects in the new EU Member States, under the heading of sustainable development."
"It is also worth encouraging the individual governments to increase the sums allocated from the budget each year to research, and also to set a minimum percentage of the budget which must be used for projects of this kind. A further key issue is the funding of innovation in the SME sector, upon which we should place much more emphasis."
"(NL) Mr President, Commissioner, the main challenge is to do things differently - in a much less fragmented way, to have much less parallel activity from the Member States and the European Union - and also to invest in a better-targeted way."
"I believe that businesses and the citizens are watching on."
"The report, and your proposal for the Innovation Union, generate expectations."
"Indeed, we should also expect a lot from it, but I still want to highlight a couple of points on the instrumental side, in particular, including those of the European Union."
"First of all, we need to ensure that funding is made easier and there need to be more subsidies and incentives for venture capital."
"Secondly, we already have the funds, but they are ring-fenced and separately governed: the regional funds, the agricultural funds and so on."
"We need to move to a multi-fund approach."
"Will you agree with this in the forthcoming regulations?"
"What kinds of proposals will this be covered by?"
"My next point is that we have just seen that investment in research and development largely ends up in the twelve 'old' Member States, so further distribution is required."
"A re-balancing is needed."
"How can you support businesses and citizens in the 'new' Member States in this regard?"
"Finally, I wanted to say that this is a process that we would like to help you consider."
"How will you now conduct the dialogue?"
"It says in your communication that, at the end of 2011, you will hold a convention and take some other action."
"I have already had the opportunity to speak with you a couple of times, including in the form of a dialogue, at the knowledge for innovation summits in this House."
"How will you organise that from here on in?"
"We want to see more of you."
"In fact, I have a lot of faith in that."
"You currently coordinate such things in the Commission and that did not happen in the past."
"Along with Mrs Merkies, we will keep a close eye on you."
"(RO) Mr President, I congratulate Mrs Merkies for the excellently drafted report."
"To ensure that the Innovation Union initiative contributes to sustainable development, the education system needs to be modernised, the rules on accessing existing funds need to be simplified and converged, forecasts need to be made about the skills required, partnerships between universities and businesses need to be encouraged, along with standardisation, and intellectual property needs to be protected."
"However, broadband access is an absolute prerequisite for Innovation Union, given that it improves the level of citizens' involvement."
"We call for more funds for innovation, but I think that, for consistency's sake, as we have also done in other cases, we must avoid prejudicing through this report the future of the cohesion policy, the common agricultural policy and the multiannual financial framework."
"I hope that this amendment will receive majority support tomorrow."
"Finally, we call on the Commission to transpose the Union's innovation policy into an action plan with specific objectives and measurable targets."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate Mrs Merkies on her excellent work."
"I believe we have to invest more in innovation, research and knowledge, and we have to do so more boldly."
"Innovation must not be swallowed up by research."
"Innovation and research are not the same thing, and I welcome the fact that the report points out this strategic distinction."
"The report sets some important objectives: it targets ordinary people and workers through social innovation; it introduces measures to facilitate access to credit and finance for small and medium-sized enterprises; and, above all, it establishes an increasingly close and direct relationship linking together businesses, research centres and our universities."
"Facilitating and simplifying life for small and medium-sized enterprises through a one-stop shop and focusing on talent, creativity and innovative ideas are essential conditions for growth and development."
"Europe must take innovation policies seriously if we want to find a way out of the crisis and build a better future for our younger generations."
"(RO) Mr President, at the moment, research and innovation are the privilege of the most developed Member States, which is detrimental to the European Union."
"The European Union must take this factor into account and foster the balance of potential innovative capabilities throughout the whole EU."
"Support must be given to new Member States to develop their research infrastructure by allocating additional resources, as Commissioner Quinn promised not so long ago."
"This is the only way we can be sure of preventing the gap between the east and west of the European Union from widening in terms of research and innovation, thereby enabling us to achieve our aim of creating a proper Innovation Union."
"An idea is being promoted for structural or agricultural funds for financing innovation and research."
"I think that this notion is neither feasible nor fair."
"A realistic solution is to create specific instruments which will be earmarked only for research and innovation."
"(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Merkies, this strategy is important to all European countries, especially those whose economies are not competitive enough."
"It is essential to the creation of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Jobs are being created more actively today."
"It is essential to universities and laboratories, whose survival depends, in part, on their relationship with productive sectors."
"It is essential to the financial system, which will find a new market in innovation as the classic manufacturing model becomes exhausted."
"Innovation is top of the European agenda and, as it is a pillar of the Europe 2020 strategy, it will have to be served by new financial instruments so that it does not succumb to budgetary constraints in the current situation."
"Finally, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Merkies, on her important contribution to a more innovative Europe with a more knowledge-based economy."
"(LT) Mr President, I would like to add to the many congratulations my group colleague has already received for drafting an excellent report."
"The European Union is at a difficult crossroads."
"On the one hand, we urgently need to address problems caused by the crisis while, on the other, we need to adopt measures now, so that we can find an adequate response and implement the long-term commitments we have made to counter challenges like climate change, energy security, food security, our ageing society, and so on."
"In today's global context, innovation policy has a huge impact on all areas of life and, in future, it will become the main pillar of economic, cultural and social development in the European Union."
"Hitherto, this policy has been fragmented and more oriented towards academic and scientific research, rather than transforming innovative ideas into real or adapted products or services that would stimulate growth and job creation."
"I support the comprehensive approach to innovation policy and believe that together, we must establish a strategic and integrated European Union innovation policy that is geared to practical adaptation."
"(SK) Mr President, innovation is one of the main driving forces of European competitiveness, without which it would be impossible to achieve our set strategic objectives."
"For example, there is a pressing need for innovation in the areas of public health and environmental protection."
"The Union and the Member States must therefore provide financial or tax incentives to businesses and individuals, in order to focus on scientific and technical research and development in areas that are less lucrative but highly beneficial to the public."
"In my opinion, we are still allocating relatively small amounts of the budget to research and I would therefore also like to emphasise the need for financing instruments in this area in future EU budgets."
"The area of European research would also be supported by the introduction of a single European patent which, besides protecting the intellectual property of innovators, would also have the potential to reduce lengthy and costly bureaucratic processes, and avoid repeat applications from one entity in all Member States."
"(RO) Madam President, achieving the Europe 2020 strategy target of increasing research and development investment to up to 3% of GDP could create 3.7 million jobs and boost annual GDP by up to EUR 795 billion by 2025."
"To achieve this, however, we will need 1 million additional researchers at a time when many of them are attracted at the moment by non-European countries where there are mechanisms to remove the bottlenecks preventing ideas from reaching the market."
"The fragmentation of research systems and markets, the underuse of public procurement to stimulate innovation, the precarious nature of funding and the slow standardisation process are the problems which European Union countries are still faced with."
"However, we hope that they will be taken seriously if we want the Innovation Union programme to be one of the successes of the Europe 2020 strategy."
"This is the only way we will be able to achieve sustainable growth in Europe and resist the ever-growing pressure of globalisation."
"(RO) Madam President, the Innovative Union initiative promotes a strategic European policy geared towards business."
"Particular attention must be focused on the objectives set in the Europe 2020 strategy."
"Innovation must be guided by public interest, improving quality of life and promoting social well-being."
"This means that globalisation and research are key factors in external competitiveness and economic growth."
"Additional factors include active commitment from SMEs and the involvement of European citizens."
"The Commission should focus on technologies which underpin smarter, sustainable systems."
"All the strategies linked to adapting the EU to post-crisis conditions must be aimed at creating sustainable jobs."
"In this respect, Member States must promote stable economic models based on creativity."
"(RO) Madam President, in a Europe without borders, and with an ongoing globalisation process, innovation can and must play an important role in enhancing social cohesion by improving the quality of services provided, no matter which sector they are from."
"However, better services also require an improvement in vocational training."
"Therefore, I feel it is beneficial to initiate specific vocational training programmes, with a focus on innovation and encouraging creativity, aspects which can be nurtured, taught and enhanced at different stages of the training process."
"The European Commission must encourage and support Member States so that they include, to a larger extent, as part of the components making up national education systems, elements such as innovation and creativity, and encourage improvement in cooperation between education systems and the business world by developing new curricula and doctoral programmes, including at cross-border level."
"(GA) Madam President, thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak on this topic."
"Madam President, it is incumbent on us to sell the message to third-level educational institutions, research organisations and, indeed, private sector companies concerning the opportunities that are available under the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) for Research and Development."
"We must, at all times, highlight the benefits that can accrue to small and medium-sized companies under what is the largest publicly funded research programme in the world."
"Support for research and innovation is vital for peripheral regions within the Union if they are to stay competitive in an increasingly globalised world."
"From an Irish perspective, the FP7 is helping to develop research that is, in turn, creating jobs and delivering new goods and services for our people."
"EUR 270 million has already been drawn down by Irish organisations in the agriculture, food, fisheries, health, energy, transport and ICT sectors."
"In conclusion, I say that this is vitally important, particularly during these very difficult economic times, both in Ireland and throughout the Union."
"(PT) Madam President, at a time of serious economic and social crisis, like that currently being experienced in a number of European Union Member States, a debate on innovation in all fields of knowledge and in all economic and social areas is welcome."
"However, it is necessary for this innovation to be guided by criteria of defending the public interest, improving people's quality of life, promoting social welfare, and preserving the environment and the balance of nature."
"In this context, it is essential not to forget unemployment, which already affects around a quarter of young people, many of whom have been through higher education; not to forget that jobs are increasingly insecure, especially for women and young people; and not to forget the growth of poverty and social exclusion."
"It is therefore time to go from words to actions, and to demand the necessary budget and policies that recognise the true value of people, their creativity and their capacity for innovation, and that respect workers' dignity."
"Madam President, a recent GE survey established that 85% of key people believe that innovation is the way to future prosperity for the European Union."
"It is one thing to establish it, but another thing to make it a reality."
"That is the challenge facing us."
"I had the privilege of drawing up the draft opinion for the Committee on Culture and Education on the Innovation Union and I emphasised a number of points."
"One was the need to avoid duplication."
"This was prompted by an answer given by the Commissioner in her hearing, when she pointed out that one particular strain of salmonella was being researched by 40 different institutes - a clear case of a lack of joined-up thinking, and a waste of money."
"We also need productive cooperation between the various stakeholders."
"I saw a very good example of that at Santiago de Compostela University, which tracked research all the way until a new company was founded."
"Thirdly, we need to develop the European patent."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I would like to thank all the Members who took part in the debate."
"I think everybody here agrees that we need to improve the conditions for innovation."
"Most of the speakers talked about jobs."
"That is what Innovation Union is all about."
"It is about taking the very basic blue-sky research that we do so well in the European Union, and translating it all the way to the marketplace so that we provide the jobs here, and they are not provided abroad."
"A number of speakers raised the role of the regions."
"This is really important and we need to develop synergies between research and innovation funding, on the one hand, and structural funds, on the other."
"Indeed, Ms Merkies underlines that point in her report."
"All the regions of Europe should play to their strengths."
"I will go in a couple of weeks' time to Debrecen, in Hungary, to the 'Week of innovative regions of Europe' conference, where all the regions will come together to talk about the concept of smart specialisation."
"Some of the less advanced regions can obviously gain from the networking and know-how that is fostered by research and innovation programmes while, of course, using structural funds to build up the research infrastructure facilities that they require."
"Mr van Nistelrooij raised the matter of the Innovation Convention, and I would like to say that this is well advanced."
"As part of the preparation, we have invited Mr Reul, the Chair of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, to talk about the committee's representation at the heart of the Innovation Convention."
"Obviously, we have also invited representatives of the Member State governments, business leaders, stakeholders of all kinds, policy makers and so on."
"We think this is very important because one of the things I consider essential in relation to innovation is that we should have a 'living document': in other words, that we will have the opportunity on a regular basis - in Parliament, internationally at the Innovation Convention, and also at Heads of State or Government level - to monitor progress and to insist, where the progress is slow, on speeding it up."
"That is very important if this initiative is going to be successful, to create the kind of jobs we want and to deliver what we expect it to deliver at the end of the day."
"rapporteur. - Madam President, I would like to thank colleagues and innovative citizens for all their very valuable contributions."
"It was a very inclusive process."
"We are in unison here: we want to boost economic growth and move towards a different, sustainable social model."
"We want to stimulate SMEs and start-ups; we want to update our skills in lifelong learning; we want social innovation."
"We want the money actually to be spent on research and development, not to be kept in the pocket."
"We agree that research is not a synonym for innovation; innovation stands on its own, though it might derive from research."
"Both are extremely important, but innovation needs to get an extra push."
"To clear up the issue of funding coming from the agricultural funds or the structural funds: the intention is not that we move funding from the CAP or the structural funds to the innovation funds, but that we pay attention to the horizontal aspect of innovation."
"We need innovation in agriculture and in regional policy too: we need it everywhere."
"So where do we go from here?"
"Let us not end with this one report."
"We cannot let it end here."
"Let us take this onwards, together with the Member States."
"Let us really try to get a different mindset."
"Let us spend the money, but let us change the policy."
"Let us change our economic model, move towards a sustainable model and create jobs."
"The report said that innovation is not only a product, process or service, but also a movement."
"So let us be innovators here today."
"Let us start a movement: a movement for innovation."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Innovation means the successful implementation of ideas in practice."
"We must not allow the Innovation Union to remain merely an exciting idea, a political objective."
"In the Committee on Budgets, we are working on firmly implanting the Europe 2020 flagship in the European Union's strategy through an independent financial framework."
"The Innovation Union is able to play a role in transforming the crisis-laden economy of Europe, which will be guided by sustainable job creation."
"If 3% of the EU's GDP can really be earmarked for research and development by 2020, 3.7 million new jobs will be created, which would increase annual GDP by some EUR 800 million by 2025."
"We must treat it as a fact that the key to and, at the same time, the only effective tool for the European Union's economic recovery is research and innovation."
"This is why we must unanimously support Member States devoting 1% of their gross domestic product to research and technological development."
"Willingness to take risks is a prerequisite for successful innovation, but this does not mean a risky investment for Member States now."
"The return is guaranteed."
"In order to maintain European competitiveness, a change of approach is needed, the key drivers of which are enhancing innovation potential and encouraging more people in Europe to become entrepreneurs."
"This is why we revised the Small Business Act, making it consistent with the Single Market Act, which is able to show synergy with the Innovation Union as well."
"Our measures must be harmonised, because this way, efficiency is also increased many fold."
"Innovation, competitiveness, sustainable development, creativity, efficiency - these are all fine words which fit in very well with current political, economic and labour market trends, but are there any concrete measures or real projects behind these words?"
"Those who hear them will certainly react positively to their use, and they will help to promote the ideals they represent, and to gain support for them."
"Let us not forget, however, that these slogans must be backed up by practical measures, and that the appropriate legislative decisions must be taken and laws implemented which will contribute to the achievement of the objectives which have been mentioned, namely, the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy."
"Europe and Europeans hold enormous potential; our task is to put in place the appropriate conditions for this potential to be exploited fully."
"As a member of the Committee on Culture and Education, I support the 'Innovation Union' initiative."
"I would stress the role played by education, vocational training and social research (into the fight against poverty and social exclusion) within the framework of this initiative."
"It is important to simplify the administrative procedures involved in submitting applications for EU programmes in the field of scientific research and innovation in such a way as to make it possible for more enterprises and scientific institutions to take part in them."
"Simplified procedures will also ensure that public funds are used more effectively and efficiently, and that the administrative burden is reduced."
"Innovation policy should go hand-in-hand with policy in the field of vocational training and the labour market."
"New products and services are intended to help increase employment levels and promote the forecasting of future trends and the qualifications needed on the labour market."
"In view of the fact that women account for only 30% of European researchers and only 13% of directors of European research institutions, I would highlight the need for the 'Innovation Union' initiative to take account of future guidelines as regards a more balanced representation of women and men in scientific disciplines."
"I would also call for such guidelines to be implemented effectively by the Member States."
"ILO Convention supplemented by a recommendation on domestic workers (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on the ILO Convention supplemented by a recommendation on domestic workers, by Pervenche Berès, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs - B7-0305/2011)."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I am delighted that, in advance of the next General Assembly of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), we can debate this welcome initiative of the ILO proposing to the Member States of this organisation a convention supplemented by a recommendation on domestic workers."
"Commissioner, on behalf of the entire Parliament, I would like to thank you for agreeing to conduct this debate in the run-up to this conference."
"We believe this is best practice."
"As we know, domestic work officially accounts for between 5 and 9% of all employment in the European Union."
"Looking at what we have collectively endorsed with the Europe 2020 strategy, it is clear that what are termed local jobs, namely, those that enable us to take care of our elderly citizens and those that enable women with young children to get back into work, correspond to situations that enable this domestic work to develop."
"I believe that, within the European Union, it is essential that we support this welcome initiative of the ILO, since the development of our societies is fraught with tendencies - we know what they are."
"Global demand for domestic services will go on increasing, but we cannot, on the one hand, welcome the adoption of a decent work agenda by the ILO and, on the other, leave an entire section of the labour market totally unregulated and unprotected by any legislation."
"The European Union must set an example."
"I know that, at times, we have a tendency to think that the conventions of the ILO are perhaps not for us."
"No."
"We, too, must lead the way on this point."
"In the area of domestic work, I believe that the ILO offers us an excellent opportunity for shedding light on the operation of some of our labour markets, since domestic work is too often precarious work, undervalued and undeclared."
"I will tell you quite simply."
"I understand that some of you have expressed concern about the recognition or regularisation of illegal migrants, but I am also concerned with the battle we have to fight in each Member State against undeclared work."
"In the area of domestic work, we know how these practices have, unfortunately, developed."
"We hope that, next June, on the basis of a tripartite negotiation, the 100th session of the International Labour conference will set this convention and this recommendation in motion."
"We believe that they are essential for transforming what is too often a relationship of exploitation into a legal relationship."
"We hope that the legal recognition of domestic work can be achieved."
"Those who work with our elderly citizens and children must enjoy the freedom to associate and rest time and must not be victims of harassment and arbitrariness."
"We must also ensure that this tool, which we are proposing to the ILO, will enable us to define, in this area, what we mean by the notion of decent work, whether with regard to the question of working hours, the question of paid leave, or the question of housing conditions."
"I would like to know how the European Commission intends to approach these negotiations and this draft convention, and on the basis of what mandate it will act on behalf of all of us, so that tomorrow, in the area of domestic work, the European Union can set an example and that we, too, can give expression to the values of the European Union."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I welcome today's discussion on a new ILO instrument for domestic workers."
"It is an important contribution to the second round of discussions on the new international standards which will probably be adopted in a few weeks' time at the 100th session of the International Labour conference."
"As you know, the European Commission is a firm supporter of the ILO's decent work agenda."
"The Commission closely monitors and facilitates coordination among the Member States and has worked for the speedy ratification of a number of important instruments adopted in the last decade."
"There are many reasons for developing new standards in the area of domestic work."
"For instance, there are a large number of domestic workers across the world, many of them belonging to vulnerable groups."
"Their precarious status and the fact that they often fall within the informal sector are also very important issues."
"In the European Union, employment in this sector is very likely to expand, given population change and higher female participation in the labour market."
"That is why it is crucial to raise domestic workers' professional profile and improve their image."
"Let me now look at the practical issues raised by the question and first explain the Commission's role in the ILO negotiations on a new convention and recommendation on decent work."
"The institutional context needs to be borne in mind."
"The new instrument will be an international agreement."
"The Commission will therefore fulfil the role conferred on it by the Treaty with due regard for the special features of the ILO, where the European Union has observer status only - unlike the Member States which are members."
"That is why the Union cannot ratify ILO conventions itself."
"The Commission followed the discussions actively and facilitated coordination among the experts of the Member States during the first round of discussions at the ILO in 2010."
"It has analysed the instruments as they developed during the negotiations in the light of EU legislation."
"The Commission was attentive, in particular, to any sections of the draft convention that could affect freedom of movement for workers."
"As the new ILO Convention will comprise matters of EU competence, the Member States need to comply with the EU acquis."
"In the next and final round of discussions in June, the Commission will continue to play an active coordination and facilitation role by working with Member State experts."
"My departments have been in contact with the social partners and a number of NGOs that have approached the Commission, and have had exchanges with the rapporteur for the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee on the professionalisation of domestic work."
"Secondly, there is the question of the role of Europe 2020 in ensuring that precarious domestic jobs are transformed into decent sustainable jobs."
"We need to bear in mind the sector's potential in terms of job creation and reconciling work and family responsibilities, and thus its role in meeting the objectives of the employment strategy."
"However, we must not forget the need to ensure that domestic jobs - not all of which should be regarded as precarious and undervalued or underpaid - are indeed decent jobs."
"What is more, the fight against undeclared work, which is widespread in the domestic work sector, is an integral part of the Europe 2020 strategy as the first annual growth survey has confirmed."
"Ways of moving from informal or undeclared work to regular employment will be covered by the guiding principles on enabling conditions for job creation which the Commission announced in the communication on the Europe 2020 flagship initiative, 'An agenda for new skills and jobs'."
"We will be putting forward those guiding principles next year."
"A number of Member States have useful experience in working to reduce the informal sector and precarious employment, for example, by introducing service voucher systems."
"Thirdly, there is the question of amending the current framework legislation on health and safety at work - Directive 89/391/EEC - and on combating discrimination - Directive 2000/78/EC."
"It is worth pointing out that the definition of domestic workers in the draft ILO Convention is very wide."
"It not only covers persons working in private households, but also for them, as well as persons employed by employment agencies."
"Domestic servants are excluded from the definition of workers in the framework directive on health and safety at work."
"However, the EU legislator seems to have intended that the concept of domestic servants be interpreted narrowly, so not all domestic servants under the Convention are excluded from the scope of the EU health and safety at work acquis."
"Lastly, EU occupational and safety and health legislation provides minimum requirements and does not, therefore, prevent any Member State from introducing more stringent measures at national level."
"Consequently, the Member States are free to include domestic servants within the scope of their national legislation."
"For the time being, the Commission has no plans to amend the framework directive on occupational safety and health."
"Nevertheless, the Commission considers that the current ILO initiative is a good opportunity to reflect on the situation of domestic servants in Europe."
"I would add that Directive 2000/78/EC establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation does not exclude domestic workers, so no amendment is needed for the ratification of the ILO Convention."
"The Commission issued a report on the application of the directive in 2008 and will continue to follow its implementation in the Member States closely."
"The fourth point concerns ways of informing domestic workers of, and strengthening, their rights."
"Although not all domestic workers are low-skilled and do not all work in precarious conditions, they are a vulnerable category and the Commission encourages the Member States to ensure they are properly protected by developing and enforcing their labour rights."
"The Commission expects the problem of undeclared work by non-EU nationals to be dealt with in part by the Employers' Sanctions Directive 2009/52/EC, which the Member States have to transpose into national legislation by 20 July this year."
"The directive will help to end the exploitation of illegally staying third-country nationals by some employers who pay them inadequate salaries and impose unsatisfactory working conditions."
"One step forward would be agreement on the proposal for a directive on a single permit which provides for a common set of rights for third country workers residing legally in a Member State."
"Let me now turn to the fifth and last point regarding the Commission's role in promoting exchanges of best practice involving policy on domestic workers."
"In this connection, I want to mention a private project which the Commission is currently implementing at the request of this House, and which seeks to encourage the conversion of precarious work into work associated with rights."
"Following a call for proposals issued under the pilot project in 2010, the Commission is co-funding a project that focuses on the consequences of the economic and financial crisis for precarious domestic, migrant and young workers, and on Member State measures to improve their rights."
"The project encourages exchanges of best practice, in particular, involving precarious workers' collective representation."
"A second call for proposals, to be issued this year, will relate more specifically to action to improve the rights of the poorest workers, including domestic workers."
"The pilot project will also involve a study to gain a better understanding of precarious work in 12 Member States, and to promote its conversion into employment relationships carrying more social rights, in particular, by looking at what the Member States can do in practical terms to encourage this transformation and identify a core of basic social rights."
"A case study of the situation of migrant domestic workers in Italy was carried out recently in connection with a project on decent work and industrial relations cofinanced by the Commission."
"Lastly, the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work and the Senior Labour Inspectors Committee have called for sector-wide information and awareness-raising campaigns on the protection of workers' health and safety."
"Madam President, the European People's Party is very pleased by today's debate."
"I believe thanks are due to Mrs Berès for initiating it, enabling us to join the ILO initiative, on the one hand, and, on the other, making us think about all that needs to be done for a category of workers whose conditions we often do not know about and, when we do know something, it tends to be depressing."
"We also believe that the draft decision which has been published deserves support, and we think that those elements are particularly good which underscore and highlight that the aim here is to create decent working conditions and regulated employment in a field where, indeed, mainly migrant workers are concerned, particularly in certain countries, in a totally unregulated and uncontrolled manner, and very often in the form of a kind of modern slavery."
"We have already mentioned that there are black holes in labour law regulation."
"This was discussed in connection with atypical contracts."
"Obviously, this could be a subsequent step towards being able to guarantee minimum working conditions and other rights linked to employment, and I agree with the Commissioner that of course, we ought to put our own house in order first."
"While welcoming the ILO initiative, what we ourselves can do is to call on the Member States of the European Union to do all they possibly can in their own labour law regulations in order to expose this black hole and regulate it accordingly."
"Madam President, Commissioner, the first thing that I wish to say is that all the socialist delegates subscribe to the words uttered by Pervenche Berès, Chair of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and we are very pleased about the position just taken by the Commissioner on this initiative of the International Labour Organisation (ILO)."
"The socialist delegates appreciate enormously the work that the ILO has been doing since it started."
"We believe that it has made an invaluable contribution to the history of humanity and also of Europe."
"There is, too, no doubt that this new initiative on domestic work is very important, because there is a very large number of people who do this type of work and because it also very much affects women and immigrants."
"We, the socialist delegates, believe that it would be very good if, at the next meeting in June, this draft convention and recommendation were to be approved and if Parliament, the Commission and the Council were to be active - not just passive but active - so that Europe measures up to what it says and its actions reflect its words."
"If we do this, we will be helping - at least - to extend the Decent Work programme."
"We will be helping the world and many people, but primarily we will also be helping ourselves to be decent and to respect each other as an institution and as Europeans, but also so that our continent maintains its social model, which is impossible to maintain if we are an island of protection and rights within a world of misery and lack of protection."
"Perhaps, Commissioner, it is also time for the Commission, the Council and for all of us to reflect on Europe because not everything is resolved here, either."
"In Europe, there are contractual forms that affect immigrants and women in this area of domestic service which are very precarious and contain major loopholes."
"I would be pleased if, in the heat of this debate and deliberation, we were to understand that there are certain loopholes that must be closed in legislation in the EU and also in many Member States."
"We have problems regarding the health and safety of these workers."
"We have problems in many countries regarding the legal forms according to which the work is developing."
"Furthermore, we also have a major problem in the fight against abuse and discrimination against immigrants, many of whom work in European families."
"We have many initiatives in hand at the moment."
"Commissioner, now would be the time to enhance our ethical commitment to assist the ILO, to help ourselves, and to perform work which is worthy for the future of humanity."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, I think it is important for us to have this discussion in the light of the upcoming adoption of an ILO Convention on Domestic Workers."
"I believe that we in this House should commend the ILO for its excellent work."
"Domestic work - family caring, for example - takes place exclusively in the family home."
"Traditionally, of course, in the EU, it was women's work, although that is changing."
"Migrants and people from more marginalised communities are also more likely to work in a domestic situation."
"The value of domestic work is not included in our GDP calculations and, for that reason among others, domestic work is very often invisible and is certainly undervalued."
"Without any doubt, this leaves domestic workers in a precarious position, and very often they have to rely on the goodwill of employers."
"This is simply not acceptable."
"As we say in the resolution, it leaves domestic workers more likely to face discrimination and, indeed, multiple forms of discrimination."
"The importance of this ILO Convention is that it will provide legal recognition of domestic work as work."
"Following on from that, domestic workers should be in a stronger position to exercise their rights."
"I think it is crucial that domestic workers have a right to core labour standards."
"That, of course, includes access to social security, health and safety protection and maternity protection, as well as provisions on working and rest time."
"Because domestic work takes place largely within the family home, there can be issues of privacy involved."
"We need to find innovative and workable solutions to ensuring the health and safety of domestic workers and, in the overall context, to ensure that their rights are fully respected."
"One solution might be the use of model contracts."
"In the canton of Geneva, for example, there is a model contract which is automatically entered into by all employers and employees: it deals, inter alia, with issues such as the minimum wage, family allowances and holidays."
"I believe that contracts of a similar type operate in Belgium."
"They give greater security to domestic workers, simplify matters for employers and eliminate grey areas and ambiguities."
"I also want to say that I am very happy to support the amendments from the Green Group where they talk about the inclusion of au pairs and undeclared work, but come forward with practical suggestions to ensure we are proactive in ensuring access to the open labour market for domestic workers."
"Finally, I want to support the author of the resolution, Ms Berès, when she says that the European Union should lead the way on improving conditions for domestic workers."
"Commissioner, I was interested in your words on occupational health and safety and, even though you do not foresee extending the directive, I think your comments leave some scope for flexibility in ensuring better health and safety conditions for domestic workers."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, I, too, would like to congratulate Ms Berès for taking the initiative on this oral question and resolution."
"I would also like to thank the Commissioner for his answer."
"It is all too rare that we get a very specific response from Commissioners to questions in an oral question."
"My group very much welcomes the proposal from the ILO for the Convention and the recommendation on domestic workers."
"We are aware that at least 20 of our own Member States have already commented on the draft and been actively involved in this."
"We look forward to early ratification by those Member States and, indeed, some interesting implementation."
"People have talked very much about how this group of workers is particularly vulnerable."
"A lot of the work is done behind closed doors; it is invisible."
"Often, the workers themselves are isolated, and access to trade unions is often very difficult in this situation."
"Quite often, if you are taken on as a live-in employee, you can be seen as being on call 24/7."
"We know in this House that on-call working is a very controversial issue and something that we do not particularly welcome."
"As has been said, domestic work is often undervalued, or seen as traditional women's work that 'anybody can do', but we have also made the point that a lot of it is actually quite skilled."
"It can quite often involve nursing care and various aspects of child development."
"Domestic workers often occupy a real position of trust."
"While many employers value that, there are only too many who do not."
"For example, in the UK we have seen a recent case of somebody actually ending up with a prison sentence on a charge of trafficking for domestic servitude."
"The young woman involved lost four years of her life to her employer, who received a nine-month sentence."
"So we need to look at how we identify that form of trafficking."
"Migrant female workers are very vulnerable indeed."
"We have come across cases, for example, of workers entering the country with diplomats and having their passport taken away; people in that situation have virtually no freedom, have no access to assistance and do not know about their rights."
"I want to raise one issue concerning Article 17 in the proposed Convention, which is about the role of agencies."
"I think this is something that we really should be looking at at European level because, increasingly, it is being seen as a weak link in many of the issues that we are facing."
"Madam President, Mr Andor, ladies and gentlemen, I understand from what you have said, Mr Andor, that the European Commission is obviously taking notice of this subject."
"I also conclude that it is being handled with too much restraint."
"It is not the case, as Mr Őry emphasised previously in this discussion, that we know too little about what domestic workers in Europe do."
"On the contrary, we know so much that there is an urgent need for regulation."
"Between 5% and 9% of all employees work in private households."
"This is the worst paid group of employees in Europe, with the fewest rights and the largest proportion of illegal workers."
"Action is urgently needed in this area and this includes the European Commission."
"The situation we currently find ourselves in will not be improved by the free movement of workers."
"For this reason, the initiative in this International Labour Organisation (ILO) Convention is very welcome and deserves our support."
"I would like to comment on four points."
"Firstly, there are gaps in the definitions in the ILO Convention."
"If domestic workers cannot work occasionally, sporadically or not on an occupational basis in this sector, then the opportunities for circumventing the legislation are already in place."
"Secondly, there is an urgent need for mandatory employment contracts in this area."
"Thirdly, we must have not only sensible, generally binding minimum wage regulations, but also equal employment rights."
"Fourthly, these workers must be covered by a statutory social security obligation, in particular, given that this is a minimum wage sector."
"I am pleased that Mrs Berès has called in her statement for a campaign to introduce standard working conditions."
"This is a good thing."
"We must ensure in future that work which does not pay a living wage is outlawed by society and is no longer tolerated."
"Madam President, according to a report from the International Labour Organisation, domestic work represents around 5% of the total number of jobs."
"It is a kind of invisible form of employment, which is not carried out in factories, shops or offices, but in the homes of private individuals."
"Women account for 90% of the workers, and do not work in a collective, but alone, in houses."
"The aim of their work is not to produce added value, but to provide care or services similar to the tasks which women usually carry out free of charge in their own homes."
"The work is therefore financially undervalued and is often not considered to be normal employment under labour law, as a result of which workers are exposed to unauthorised and unfair treatment."
"The work is very often undeclared, and workers who come from rural areas or from abroad have low qualifications, do not know their rights, and become vulnerable individuals."
"Undeclared work deprives workers of social protection and deprives society of social security contributions."
"If we do not want domestic work to remain undeclared, we should turn this work into a proper profession and overcome the usual stereotypes, which often present such work to us as valueless."
"We should therefore professionalise it."
"For that, however, we need to introduce new measures into the employment systems of individual Member States, including specific regulations in the area of tax, social security, and employment and civil rights which take into account the specific nature of work performed in this way."
"There are generally financial reasons behind the current tendency to provide and perform undeclared domestic work, because undeclared work is more advantageous to both parties than officially registered work which, besides tax and deductions, burdens both parties with extensive bureaucratic demands."
"The aim of Member State measures should therefore be to amend or even eliminate the advantages of undeclared work, so that domestic work becomes a specific form of dignified employment."
"(FR) Madam President, I would first of all like to thank Mrs Berès, Chair of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, for allowing us to have this debate in the run-up to the conference of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), and Commissioner Andor for agreeing to conduct this debate between Parliament and the Commission."
"I would first like to highlight an initial point."
"Many have discussed our knowledge, or our lack of knowledge, of this world of domestic work."
"Simply, when we say, with some hesitation, that domestic workers account for between 5% and 9% of all workers, that means that we do not know the world of domestic work."
"The ratio is 1:2."
"I therefore call for our provisions to enable us, at European level, to gain a better understanding of the world of domestic work so that we can guarantee it better."
"The second point I would like to make is that, while we have established the Europe 2020 strategy and we know that, in this Europe 2020, low-level jobs will be particularly under threat, we have to do everything here, in this world of domestic work, to ensure that specialisations are absolutely recognised."
"Mrs Lambert said just now that a lot of domestic work is quite skilled, and we must identify such work and promote it and promote the skills involved."
"The third point is that Europe cannot be founded on values of human rights and social rights and develop the relevant EU acquis without also developing the protection of wages, the protection of working hours, the protection of health, knowledge of the demands of domestic work, and without providing domestic workers with a certain number of guarantees."
"I wish to sound a word of warning, which is that this should not lead to the integration of workers that are in a totally illegal situation."
"We also need to know how to prevent the values we defend from being hijacked."
"(PT) Madam President, I am in full agreement with what has been said by my colleagues from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament who spoke before me."
"I should like to congratulate the Chair of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, Mrs Berès, on this initiative which enables us to debate a very important subject."
"I would also thank you for your involvement, Commissioner, and for the sensitivity you have demonstrated."
"Domestic work is economically and socially important, but it is work that is poorly paid, routine and undervalued by society."
"It has already been said that domestic work is mainly carried out by women, who are subjected to all kinds of discrimination."
"In fact, on the subject of discrimination, I should like to mention that, in my report on the revision of the Maternity Leave Directive, I advocate the inclusion of domestic workers within the scope of the directive."
"Domestic workers are currently excluded from the Maternity Leave Directive and from any European legislation guaranteeing the right to maternity protection, and they are not even covered by the Health and Safety Framework Directive."
"This is unacceptable discrimination that must be put right."
"This International Labour Organisation Convention is therefore welcome and should be supported, in order to dignify domestic work and give these women the rights that other women have."
"(EL) Madam President, a series of studies being carried out by the Member States illustrates that domestic workers face various problems, including low wages, discrimination, a heavy workload, conduct unbecoming on the part of employers and even sexual harassment."
"These problems are compounded by the fact that they are not treated as employees and therefore have no protection under international conventions or EU case-law."
"The term 'domestic worker' therefore urgently needs to be changed to 'domestic employee' and the question of contracts and terms of employment urgently needs to be regulated."
"Approval of an ILO Convention on domestic workers would be a first step in plugging the existing gap, by safeguarding rights in connection with their employment, pay rises, the adoption of criteria for employers or even by clarifying that domestic employees need not necessarily stay in the employer's home."
"As part of this endeavour, the European Union, in cooperation with the Member States, should seek to amend existing legislation, so as to cover domestic employees and, most importantly, to encourage cooperation between the Member States and exchanges of best practices."
"(DE) Madam President, Mr Andor, ladies and gentlemen, in Germany, domestic workers are not covered by employment protection legislation."
"They are also not included in the European framework directive."
"The reason for this is that the state is not allowed to monitor compliance with regulations in private residences."
"There are similar obstacles in other Member States."
"A total of 15 of them have not included domestic workers in their employment protection laws."
"However, these workers do deserve special protection."
"I am therefore in favour of adopting the International Labour Organisation (ILO) Convention, but I do not think it would be sensible to incorporate large parts of the convention into EU law."
"This would prevent the national parliaments from making independent decisions on the ratification of individual ILO conventions."
"Nevertheless, I would like to thank the ILO working groups for their excellent work."
"There are still a few problems, for example, in the definitions."
"Article 1 should cover not only domestic work, but also household services."
"The article concerning rest periods is also problematic."
"Every employee must be given one rest day per week, but this does not have to be in the same week."
"The Member States must come to individual agreements on the time periods, because a certain amount of flexibility is needed."
"The ban on payments in kind which are directly related to work, such as uniforms, tools or protective equipment, seems to me to be incomprehensible."
"I suspect that what is meant is that they must not be deducted from pay."
"In other words, we need a ban on deducting payments in kind from wages."
"Once these inconsistencies have been resolved, I believe that we should sign the ILO Convention on domestic workers."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Berès, for your initiative, and thanks to all of those who have said that they want to attempt to make progress on behalf of people who, as we all know, deserve protection."
"(RO) Madam President, I welcome the initiative to adopt a supplement to the International Labour Organisation Convention through the recommendation on domestic workers."
"I should mention that they account for 9% of the total workforce, but do not enjoy the same social guarantees."
"Failure to declare these activities is detrimental to both the workers and the state, which cannot levy taxes on them."
"I think that this category of worker is particularly vulnerable to abuse from employers."
"In many cases, domestic workers are immigrants without papers, which prevents them from contacting the authorities whenever they are exploited."
"I call on the Commission to adopt as urgently as possible a package of measures intended to protect and provide them with information."
"Close cooperation is required between national authorities and European institutions, with the aim of improving working conditions for this category of worker."
"(RO) Madam President, the ageing population is increasing the demand for domestic care services."
"As a result of the economic crisis, the unemployment rate has risen to roughly 10%, with the youth unemployment rate even reaching 20%."
"In many Member States, economic recovery programmes have entailed a reduction in health budgets, which has also lead to many employees being made redundant in this sector."
"Failure to declare domestic care or cleaning services deprives these workers of the chance of a decent living and, especially, a decent pension."
"Given that the workers in these sectors are mainly women who are generally responsible for their own family, both in terms of raising children and looking after elderly relatives, I would like to ask the Commission whether any statistics are available on domestic workers at EU level and the level of each Member State."
"I would also like to ask what measures the Commission is intending to take to ensure not only the necessary flexibility but also the respect for the rights of these workers."
"(PT) Madam President, I consider the debate we are having here important, as well as the initiative from our Chair of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on the need to acknowledge the value of domestic workers, the majority of whom are women providing domestic help, cleaning and catering services, and who are commonly victims of serious exploitation and discrimination, which is even worse when they are also immigrants."
"It is, therefore, of the greatest importance to tackle this problem."
"I also believe that a new International Labour Organisation convention and recommendation could be of significant help and should be adopted, if possible, at the 100th International Labour conference."
"There can, therefore, be no doubt that the Commission's role - your role, Commissioner - in encouraging the Member States, and also in drawing greater attention to the exact content of the convention, could be very important."
"However, I also challenge you to give your full attention to Union legislation to guarantee labour, salary, maternity and illness protection, and social security rights for domestic workers, both male and female."
"(DE) Madam President, I would like to refer once again to Mr Andor's speech."
"He asked very cautiously whether the European Commission has powers and responsibilities in this area."
"I believe that it has more responsibility, in particular, with regard to freedom of movement."
"Posted workers immediately come to mind."
"One example of this is Berlin, where the unions have set up an advisory centre for posted workers."
"The largest group of workers who contact this centre, not only from Berlin but from throughout Germany, are nurses who are employed as domestic workers, sometimes in appalling and highly precarious working conditions."
"This is one way of circumventing minimum working conditions."
"Some of these people even have bogus self-employed status."
"This is why we have tabled this amendment."
"The majority of these people are workers from other EU Member States and from third countries."
"This demonstrates that the Commission certainly does have a responsibility to take action and to introduce minimum standards in this area."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, this discussion highlights the pivotal role of the ILO in the world of labour."
"I believe that we have to continue our close cooperation with the ILO because its work in this field, and in others of course, applies very much to the European context."
"But the discussion also showed that many of the employment and social policies we are dealing with apply to domestic workers, although they are regarded as constituting a separate group."
"Skills development, health and safety, decent wages and social security, the development of contractual arrangements - and I could continue this list, of course - are all aspects which have to be covered in the context of domestic work, and indeed the European Union must be a leader globally as well."
"We need to work very closely with Member States, because many possibilities for action can be found at Member State level, and we continue with the exchange of best practices in this area."
"As I mentioned in my introductory statement, we are currently implementing a pilot project, at the request of Parliament, to convert precarious work into decent employment, and two calls for proposals have been launched already."
"The second, issued earlier this year, is specifically a call for action to strengthen the rights of poorest workers, and there will be a study to better understand the phenomenon of precarious work as well."
"Concerning the question on health and safety legislation and how it applies to domestic workers, the Commission at this moment does not plan to extend the scope of the Health and Safety Directive but we now have an opportunity to think about new rules on domestic workers as a group."
"It is important to note that Member States can, of course, introduce more stringent national rules."
"They can, for example, include domestic workers in national rules and go beyond the minimum requirements."
"To conclude the debate, I have received one motion for a resolution."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 12 May, at noon."
"Antibiotic resistance (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on antibiotic resistance, by Paolo De Castro, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development - B7-0304/2011)."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we have an important chance to tackle the growing problem of antibiotic resistance in animals responsibly and with commitment."
"This is a strategic issue for the agriculture sector and, in particular, for the future of the European animal husbandry system."
"The data show that around 50% of the antibiotics in Europe are prescribed for animal use."
"If used properly, antibiotics are a useful tool that helps farmers keep their livestock healthy and productive and safeguard its welfare."
"Therefore, we are not here to demonise antibiotic use in animal husbandry, but we want to ask the Commission to provide a concrete response for the more efficient and effective use of antibiotics, in order to reduce resistance in animals."
"In our resolution of 5 May 2010 on the EU Action Plan for Animal Welfare, this House underlined the link between animal welfare, animal health and public health, and urged the Commission and the Member States to address the difficult problem of antibiotic resistance in animals in a responsible manner."
"In particular, we called on the Commission to collect and analyse data on the use of all animal health products, including antibiotics, with a view to ensuring the effective use of such products."
"A year later, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which I have the honour to chair, is here to ask the Commission to implement all relevant initiatives to resolve this long-standing problem, which can also have consequences for human health."
"What is needed, Madam President and Commissioner, is a tangible commitment from the Commission that it will use the data collected to put the results obtained into practice, not only encouraging research and monitoring activities, but also ensuring more effective use of antibiotics as an important tool for fighting animal diseases."
"On that front, I would point out that some studies show that low-energy animal feed could lead to a higher incidence of diseases and, hence, more antibiotic use."
"It would therefore be desirable to review the ban on the use of animal meal for non-ruminants, in line with the opinion of the European Scientific Veterinary Committee."
"These are the requests made in the resolution adopted in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on 12 April this year and which will be put to the vote in this Chamber tomorrow."
"It has been hard work for the last few months, and for that reason I would like to personally thank Mrs Paulsen, the shadow rapporteurs and all the parliamentary groups for their invaluable contributions to establishing a common text on this issue."
"The future competitiveness of European animal husbandry may depend on how this problem is managed, and its cross-cutting nature calls for commitment and responsibility, through a coordinated approach and a shared political will."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, first, I would like to emphasise that the Commission is fully aware of, and correspondingly concerned by, the threat to public health posed by antimicrobial resistance (AMR)."
"In reply to the first question, in 2009, the Commission asked the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to take a lead in collecting comparable data on the use of antimicrobials in animals."
"The project, the European Surveillance of Veterinary Antimicrobial Consumption (ESVAC), started in the third quarter of 2009."
"The EMA has worked together with the Member States, EU agencies and relevant stakeholders to develop the system."
"Findings from the data available from 10 Member States will be published as soon as possible."
"Twelve additional Member States are voluntarily starting to collect these data."
"The aim is to broaden the system to cover all EU Member States."
"A further aim is to have data on a more detailed level - at animal species level, for example."
"Why do we need these data?"
"We need them in order to adopt a science-based approach: only on the basis of this type of data can scientists properly assess the true risk of AMR attributed to the use of antimicrobials in animals."
"Turning to the second question, I can assure the honourable Members that the Commission is aware that the control of AMR requires a multi-disciplinary approach."
"Therefore, the Commission consults its own services, Member States' relevant agencies and other stakeholders on an ongoing basis, for example, through meetings and public consultations."
"The Commission is working on AMR in close collaboration with its relevant agencies, in particular, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the European Food Safety Authority, the EMA and the European Union Reference Laboratory for AMR."
"In reply to the third and last question, I would like to announce that the Commission is developing a five-year strategy on AMR."
"This strategy will adopt a holistic approach and will contain concrete proposals for further action to address the issue of AMR in relation to public and animal health."
"The strategy will be based on the Council conclusions and recommendations on AMR and on the outcome of the consultations I have already mentioned."
"Work on the revision of EU rules on veterinary medicinal products and medicated feeding stuffs is ongoing."
"New tools and instruments to tackle AMR are being considered, for example, as options in the impact assessment."
"Based on the evidence gathered, the Commission will decide the details of its legal proposal."
"Our objective is to present this Commission strategy on 18 November 2011, which will be European Antibiotic Awareness Day."
"Madam President, Mr Andor, firstly, I would like to thank the chair of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr De Castro, for his initiative and for the question to the Commission on this important issue."
"Mr Andor, after listening to your speech, I would first of all like to ask you to move from theory to practice, because we need to take concrete action."
"Antibiotic resistance is a subject which we must take seriously and which, hitherto, has had too little attention paid to it in the context of animal husbandry."
"Antimicrobial agents are undoubtedly very useful when properly used."
"They help farmers to keep their animals healthy and productive and also ensure high levels of animal welfare."
"In order to make sure that antibiotics remain effective in combating disease in animals and in humans, we must take a coordinated approach at an EU level."
"In recent weeks, we have held intensive discussions on this subject in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and we have considered it in detail."
"The joint resolution was adopted by the committee on 12 April with a large majority: 34 votes in favour and 2 against."
"The excellent cooperation with all the shadow rapporteurs from the different groups has resulted in a very balanced and well thought-out text, which we must adhere to, and I would ask you to do so, during the vote in plenary tomorrow."
"The report is balanced because it focuses on animal welfare, the problems of antibiotic resistance and cost-effectiveness as far as the farms are concerned."
"Therefore, I would once again like to thank everyone involved in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and also Mrs Paulsen for the fruitful cooperation."
"I would now like to see the Commission take action."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the consequences of using antibiotics to treat animal diseases are well known and increasingly worrying."
"It is an area that is already subject to fairly demanding standards, to which the European Parliament has also been dedicating attention, and on which many positive initiatives are being realised, such as the network for collecting data on antibiotic resistance."
"However, these initiatives are still not enough."
"I therefore call on the Commission not just to improve the monitoring mechanisms, but also to adopt the measures necessary for wider-ranging data collection, and for the series of incentives encouraging best practices in this area to be included in the common agricultural policy legislative package that is being drawn up."
"The text of the resolution tabled by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, whose most important recommendations received broad support, as my colleague, Mrs Jeggle, has just confirmed, deserves detailed analysis by the Commission."
"Above all, the recommendations need to be translated into concrete measures to better defend public health and the image of the quality of European products of animal origin."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that we have done a fantastic job in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"It is rare for a politically mixed gathering to be as much in agreement as we were this time."
"Antibiotic resistance is, in fact, the biggest threat to both animal and human health that we face."
"At one time, infectious diseases were the most common cause of death in children, young people and young animals."
"In this regard, do not forget that both animals and people are mammals."
"We have the same immune defences and we have the same sensitivity to stress, which means that if we do not feel well, our immune defences are impaired and we need antibiotics because we will be more susceptible to serious infections."
"We considered this with regard to human medicine."
"We took measures, we tried to tighten up our use of antibiotics and to understand what could happen."
"Do not forget that if we lose antibiotics as a weapon, we will be back to the time of our great grandmothers when what we currently think of as trivial infectious diseases, such as a small child's ear inflammation, could once again become fatal diseases."
"This is not something that is particularly easy to deal with in this respect and we should be taking it seriously."
"As I said, I am extremely pleased."
"There are, of course, some details of this resolution that I would have liked to have more of or that I would have liked to be different, but the main thing is not that all of the commas are in place; what is important is our collective will to start the process."
"That is what I hope the Commission will take on board, because I believe that we will get an almost unanimous 'yes' tomorrow."
"I hope so, and I hope that this will be a strong signal that makes you sit up and listen. Thank you."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Madam President, I would like to thank the Chair of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for bringing this issue up."
"I share his concerns at the level of antibiotic resistance being found in bacterial infections of livestock."
"I agree with him that there should be growing concern that there is evidence of overspill to the human population, where we are finding that the efficacy of many once-reliable antibiotics has declined significantly, thereby putting human health at risk."
"So I support the intent of the debate."
"I also agree that the important first step must be to work closely with the various agencies and the pharmaceutical industry in order to monitor and assess the problem."
"I want to state, however, that, contrary to popular opinion, this is not exclusively a problem brought about by intensive agriculture."
"The random use of antibiotics in agriculture is - or has been - common to all farming, be it large or small."
"Indeed, I would go further and say that large-scale producers today are usually vertically integrated under contractual terms with the processing sector, and that the prophylactic use of antibiotics is usually prohibited or restricted under quality assurance schemes."
"However, it is clear that there must be some measure of control, and I look forward to hearing details of the Commissioner's strategy in due course."
"There are three points that I want to make."
"Firstly, any measures taken must be based on sound scientific evidence; secondly, they must be proportionate; and, thirdly, they should not place a further burden of regulation, and thereby cost, on the agricultural and veterinary industries."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is a very serious issue."
"It is of great importance not only for animal husbandry in future, but also primarily for human health."
"We must not forget this."
"This is ultimately not a problem for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"However, as has once again become clear, we do not have enough data."
"Only 10 Member States have provided information and that is too few."
"We need to deal with this subject rather more quickly and we need accurate controls."
"We are paying too little attention to one factor in this context and that is intensive farming, both in large-scale buildings and in certain regions."
"We need to look at this and we can do something to prevent it."
"By restructuring our agricultural policy, we can make sure that the focus is on good animal welfare, that animals live in conditions suitable for their species, and that the animals are strong and robust, on the principle that prevention is better than cure."
"What we also need, and this is a job for the Commission, is a long-term plan to reduce the use of antibiotics in agriculture."
"The main impact of antibiotic resistance is on workers in the agriculture industry, in other words, farmers and their employees."
"These people already have huge problems in this area."
"Another cause for concern is the suspicion that antibiotic resistance is being transferred directly via foodstuffs."
"We need to look carefully at this in the interests of the health of the European population."
"There is an urgent need for action here."
"It is important to make it clear that 50% of all antibiotics are used in animal husbandry, which is far too much."
"Therefore, we must ensure that this figure is reduced in the long-term interests of agriculture and of public health."
"(RO) Madam President, World Health Day, celebrated on 7 April, had as its theme this year antibiotic resistance, regarded as a global threat to public health."
"Every year, 25 000 people die across Europe from causes associated with antimicrobial resistance."
"Animals and food of animal origin could play a role in the development of antimicrobial resistance in people."
"This is why the resolution being debated today is an important document."
"The most important word in any discussion on this subject is 'caution'."
"It is not antibiotics which are bad, but their uncalculated and immoderate use is dangerous."
"Antibiotics must not be demonised, but used with caution in both people and animals."
"The measures proposed by this resolution on providing more information to vets and farmers must therefore be implemented as vigorously as possible."
"With regard to imposing a ban on the use of antibiotics as additives in animal feed, this must be subject without fail to international agreement."
"A recent study highlights that in the United States, almost half of the samples of meat tested in stores contained Staphylococcus aureus, half of which were resistant to at least three classes of antibiotics."
"This demonstrates the widespread use of antibiotics in animal husbandry, and I must say that European farmers have had enough of being the only ones to adopt and comply with the rules at the risk of a drop in their incomes."
"(DE) Madam President, Mr Andor, ladies and gentlemen, we must do everything we can to counteract the spread of antibiotic resistance."
"We are in complete agreement on this."
"This involves the responsible use of antibiotics in human medicine and in animal husbandry."
"The European Union must take determined action."
"We must not allow 25 000 people to go on dying from infections caused by resistant bacteria every year in the European Union alone."
"Antibiotics must not be used routinely or preventively."
"We must ensure that antibiotics are used responsibly in all the Member States."
"It is of the utmost importance that every possible effort is made to keep livestock healthy from the rearing stage onwards, until they are fully grown."
"Ensuring that animals are healthy is the best means of avoiding infection and the use of antibiotics."
"The way the animals are fed is decisive in this respect, but the husbandry is also important."
"We should also be open to the use of alternative methods, such as homeopathy and phytotherapy, in livestock husbandry."
"We need more research and more information in Europe about these alternative approaches."
"(NL) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my home country, the Netherlands, is champion of the world."
"Not at football, alas - we just missed out on that last year - but in the use of antibiotics in cattle breeding."
"No other country in the world uses as many antibiotics in cattle breeding as the Netherlands."
"There are very serious consequences to this, and they are not limited to this usage in the Netherlands; 25 000 people die as a result of bacterial infections in Europe every year, as other Members have said."
"They reach people via meat."
"90% of the chicken meat in the Netherlands contains resistant ESBL bacteria, and last month, it even came to light that resistant bacteria had been found in vegetables after being passed on via manure and the soil."
"Madam President, this really has to change."
"A country like Denmark has shown that things can change and that, with sound, strict measures, you can maintain a strong and healthy cattle-breeding sector whilst using far fewer antibiotics."
"The Commission has stated previously, and again this evening, that it will put forward more far-reaching measures in November."
"They will then be fleshed out in 2012."
"I want to urge the Commission to really give this a high priority and not allow it to depend on the Member States, which are too slow to put the right measures in place."
"Madam President, it is very clear that there is cross-party agreement on concern around antibiotic resistance."
"However, given what the Commission has just said - that we have data from 10 Member States and that it is not yet available to us - we really are talking about concerns about which we do not have detailed facts."
"We need that information."
"I would like to see a league table of Member States' usage of drugs per head of animal population, so that we can actually look at countries which adopt best practice and benchmark them against others that are not."
"I do not mean to point the finger, but rather to allow those Member States who might be overusing antibiotics to improve their animal husbandry practices."
"It is also right to say that farmers do not use antibiotics willy-nilly; they use them when animals are sick."
"Antibiotics are costly and therefore, farmers do not just use them as they would give an animal a drink of water."
"We need to be a bit balanced in this debate."
"Let us get the information."
"We look forward to the strategy in November to help us avoid this growing problem for the European Union and its animal and human population."
"(DE) Madam President, I am very grateful to the author of the question, the chair of our committee, for putting this subject on the agenda."
"The use of antibiotics in animals involves closely linked advantages and disadvantages."
"The medicines which help animals to remain healthy can, if used improperly, represent a major risk for people."
"Therefore, we need to take a coordinated, integrated and, above all, scientific approach, because we will have to continue using antibiotics to treat animals in future."
"At the same time, we must also reduce the risks for people."
"This report meets precisely these requirements."
"I hope that the Commission will take up Parliament's suggestions, wishes and demands."
"Most importantly, as many previous speakers have said, we need an analysis of the current situation by all the Member States in the interest of animals, of European agriculture and, in particular, of the citizens of the European Union."
"(SK) Madam President, I would like to point out one fact which links veterinary medicine to human medicine."
"All other European congresses of microbiologists, when they spoke of resistance to antibiotics in humans, spoke of the so-called methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus."
"This is a scourge for which those of us in human medicine no longer have an effective antibiotic: we do not know how to cure it."
"Up to 25 000 people die from it every year."
"Do you know how it came into being?"
"Simply through the irresponsible use of antibiotics in veterinary medicine."
"Tonnes of antibiotics are literally stuffed into animals."
"In the case of animals that are dosed preventively, it is added to their food, and it thus also weakens man and his ability to combat the infections he gets, despite being in hospital, through hospital strains."
"I would like to urge the Commission to speed up the gathering of research from all Member States, but also to support new research into antibiotics that would be effective for humans and would save lives."
"(SK) Madam President, the penetration of the food chain by products from the chemical and pharmaceutical industry is an inevitable consequence of the intensification of agricultural output."
"The human organism thus becomes the natural victim of the efforts of food producers to produce as much food as possible, as cheaply and as efficiently as possible."
"We must therefore start to monitor the use of modern chemicals and pharmaceuticals in agriculture very closely and, in the interests of protecting the health of our citizens, also assess very purposefully, systematically and permanently the consequences of using these substances."
"Only the high quality permanent monitoring of food products will enable us to recognise early on the risks or threats which new technologies pose to the current population."
"We may be talking today more about antibiotics and the growing resistance to them, but we must take note of the issue and assess it more comprehensively."
"I also hope that the Commission will regard concern for food safety as a coherent strategy."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, the Commission strategy on antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which we plan to present in November, will provide further ideas on how the Commission, together with the Member States and stakeholders, could tackle AMR in all sectors involved."
"Some of these actions may require changes in legislation."
"Others may not."
"The key is to select the right tools for the task in hand."
"I fully agree with you that this is not only, or chiefly, an animal farming issue."
"This is why our aim is to reduce the development of antimicrobial resistance attributed to the use of antimicrobials in animals."
"There are various tools here: education, awareness-raising campaigns and so on."
"By the same token, we believe that data has to be collected to promote better understanding of the problem."
"The Member States do actually show interest in providing data, which is encouraging."
"And yes, we do have a timetable for action."
"Preparatory work is ongoing, including impact assessment, the revision of rules on veterinary medical products and so on."
"Legislative proposals, as I already mentioned, will follow in 2012."
"The Commission very much welcomes the valuable input of Parliament and looks forward to continued collaboration with Parliament, Member States and stakeholders from all sectors, with the common aim of protecting the health of citizens throughout the European Union."
"To conclude the debate, I have received one motion for a resolution."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 12 May, at noon."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Antibiotic resistance in livestock and domestic animals has become a problem in recent years."
"In order to tackle this growing problem, I call for increased research and better controls on its effects in the food chain."
"If used correctly, antibiotics are an effective tool, but I call on the Commission to introduce concrete measures to make their use more efficient so as to reduce animals' resistance to antibiotics, as this is a problem that impacts on the entire food chain."
"It particularly affects levels of antibiotic resistance and so has human health repercussions."
"To achieve this, the budget for the Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) must include the funds required to increase field work and to effectively monitor this problem."
"Finally, given the importance of this problem, I call on the Commission to draw up a plan for tackling it at EU level that takes into account the full extent of this problem of combating antibiotic resistance, above all, the link between animal health and antibiotic use, and the link between animal and human health."
"We are absorbing antibiotics in our food, which is resulting in increased resistance."
"This is one area of medical progress which is gradually being ruined and we have known about this for a long time."
"Mr De Castro referred to the measures that have already been taken."
"I support the proposals made in the resolution."
"There are two aspects of this which I would like to focus on."
"Regulations alone are not enough."
"In the dioxin scandal, we have seen how easily they can be undermined, if individual 'black sheep' behave in a very negligent way."
"Of course, we must have regulations and we need to introduce monitoring systems, but that is not the entire solution."
"In the medium and long term, the solution is to make the use of antibiotics largely superfluous."
"We can achieve this firstly by investing in research and networking expert knowledge, secondly, by passing this knowledge on to farmers and vets and thirdly, by providing information to consumers."
"We must make clever use of market forces, because it is consumers who decide in the long term how their food is produced."
"According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, there are 400 000 patients in Europe infected with multi-resistant strains of bacteria."
"I therefore welcome the resolution of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, in which I support, above all, the demand for the proper collection and analysis of comparable data on the sale of preparations for veterinary use, and the subsequent use of these preparations on animals."
"The collection of this data should be mandatory for all EU Member States."
"If the EU adopts strict measures on the use of antibiotics with agricultural animals, we can also expect changes to legislation in third countries, particularly because of the financial losses that would be caused by a restriction on meat exports to Europe."
"For example, 74% of all antibiotics used in the US are applied in animal husbandry, for preventing diseases or boosting the growth of healthy animals."
"Half of all meat products inspected in shops in the US contain dangerous bacteria (MRSA)."
"This problem has been known in the US since 2008, and there has been no fundamental solution to date."
"Non-pathogenic multi-resistant strains of bacteria also represent a risk in view of the possibility of transgenic transfers and, according to the latest research, shared resistance."
"The emergence of new, multi-resistant strains of bacteria may deprive future generations of the possibility of making effective use of antibiotics."
"A scenario such as this could have catastrophic consequences for human health."
"Resistance to antibiotics represents an enormously serious problem which must be resolved immediately and effectively."

"Report: Zver - Youth on the Move: - a framework for improving Europe's education and training systems - Report: Honeyball - Early years learning - Report: Schaake - Cultural dimensions of EU external actions - Report: Sanchez-Schmid - Unlocking the potential of cultural and creative industries - Sarajevo as a European Capital of Culture in 2014 (debate)"
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"the report by Mr Zver, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on Youth on the Move - a framework for improving Europe's education and training systems,"
"the report by Mrs Honeyball, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on Early Years Learning in the European Union,"
"the report by Mrs Schaake, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on the cultural dimensions of the EU's external actions,"
"the report by Mrs Sanchez-Schmid, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on unlocking the potential of cultural and creative industries, and"
"the oral question to the Commission on Sarajevo as a European Capital of Culture in 2014 by Mrs Pack, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education - B7-0215/2011)."
"Mr President, first of all, may I say that, during the sitting this morning, we will see real evidence of the work of our Committee on Culture, Education and Young People."
"I am rapporteur for a dossier, a very important report on Youth on the Move, which is based on a communication from the European Commission."
"At this point, I would like to thank my colleagues for giving me the opportunity to prepare this report and I would also like to thank the European Commission, which has prepared this report and which has included the problems faced by young people amongst the fundamental priorities of the EU's 10-year development plan."
"When drawing up this report, I worked with many stakeholders, especially representatives of young people, both from Member States and the rest of Europe, for example, with the European Youth Forum."
"We have had quite a few meetings and conferences."
"I also worked with the Committee on the Regions and the Committee on Economic and Social Affairs, so the report is a product of many exchanges of opinion during the period of its preparation."
"I would also point out that, at the time when this report was being adopted, my fellow Members from other political groups showed quite a constructive stance."
"In that respect, I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, in particular, who have done a good job and, as a result, we have before us today the report in its present form."
"I would like to point out that, according to various studies, young people who avail themselves of the opportunity to study or work abroad perform better in school, they are more successful and more competitive in terms of job hunting, and, moreover, in terms of their integration into society."
"However, politics alone cannot guarantee good schools, good education or good jobs for young people. What it can do, though, is create favourable conditions to help young people achieve these things."
"Those conditions are most certainly linked to the modernisation of school education systems."
"Europe, and Member States in particular, are facing the major challenge of improving, during this decade, vocational education and training, for example, and making it more attractive and improving its quality."
"The European economy very much needs vocational qualifications in the next decade."
"By as early as 2020, I estimate that as many as 50% of all jobs will require education and training of this kind."
"Therefore, vocational education and training remains one of the priorities of our policy, as well as of the policies of Member States."
"However, continuing the reform of the Bologna Process is even more important."
"European universities should be even more in touch with the economy and society at large."
"European universities will become more competitive when they pay even greater attention to the needs of the market, the economy, and when they also manage to find additional sources of funding."
"It is a fact that, in Europe, we have too little funding for higher education."
"The European countries, Member States of the European Union, are underinvesting in students, and this is quite a big problem."
"Obviously, as part of this priority, the European Union has also set other targets which must be achieved: to reduce the dropout rate, which, at 16%, is unreasonably high, so we need to reduce it to 10%."
"Similarly, we will need a more highly-educated labour force in this decade if Europe is to retain its competitive edge over other parts of the world."
"Since my time is up, I will take two more minutes later, after the debate, to provide further information."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, I am very pleased indeed to have the opportunity to present my report on early years learning in the European Union, which is an extremely important aspect of education that we have not really given much attention to before now."
"I would particularly like to thank Commissioner Vassiliou and her cabinet with whom we have worked very closely on this, and also the Hungarian Presidency, which had early years learning as one of its priorities."
"This has been a very fruitful partnership all round and has allowed us to do the work reflected in this report."
"I would also like to thank all the shadows from the other political groups."
"We have worked extremely well, as Mr Zver said, on his report, and we adopted the early years learning report in committee unanimously, which just goes to show that there is support across the political spectrum for this."
"We know why really: one of the main reasons is that early years are so important."
"Early years intervention can make all the difference to children's life chances, not only as they go through the educational system, but also later on in life."
"The research which has been done, most of which I am afraid is not within the EU, shows that, if you give children support and what they need when they are young, it helps them in later life: it cuts down on crime, improves health and cuts down on unemployment, therefore benefiting all of us."
"The children themselves will, in most instances, achieve better at school, they will get better grades, they will have high employment levels and better employment and their family relationships will be better - as will their health."
"So we have everything to do on this and it is all beneficial."
"Within the EU, there are a variety of types of provision for early years and in my report, we have said that we want to respect and maintain that."
"Each Member State does it differently, because early years has grown up within their own systems."
"It is made even more complicated by the fact that the age when school children start statutory education also varies from Member State to Member State."
"So we have not been looking at a 'one size fits all' solution, but we have looked to establish values and principles and guidelines for Member States to develop a European framework of shared goals and shared values and shared entitlements."
"So that is what this report is about: it is actually about setting the framework."
"In order to do that, we have, of course, started with the child."
"We have advocated a very child-centred approach to early years education and care, with the best interests of the child at the heart of this."
"We have drawn on research from around the world, and my report looks at the following issues: engagement with parents, which is very important for early years for young children; staff and the quality of services and qualifications required; and integrating early years services with the rest of the education systems in Member States."
"So we have covered these key areas, and these are what we should be focusing on in future."
"Staff qualifications are extremely important and they are very lacking in this area."
"There seems to be a view that anyone can look after little children, while that is actually not the case."
"We need to think hard about qualifications, and qualifications which can be transferred and recognised across the EU."
"We also need to look at access, so that all of those who need early years education services can get hold of them."
"I have finished my four minutes and I want to keep some time for the end of this debate, so I would just like to end by saying that in this time of austerity and times of economic difficulties, we must make sure that early years is still on the agenda and we still do what needs to be done in this important area."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, before highlighting a few elements of this elaborate report on the role of culture in the EU's external actions, I want to sincerely thank my colleagues from the Committee on Culture and Education for their constructive collaboration and for unanimously adopting our joint work in the committee vote."
"Of course, civil society and other stakeholders have also provided very helpful input."
"Culture has intrinsic value in our liberal democracies."
"It enriches peoples' lives."
"The EU is well known for its cultural diversity and, at the same time, it is a community of values which apply equally to each citizen."
"These European values, such as respect for human rights, democracy and fundamental freedoms, are also represented by our cultural products."
"Cultural identity, values and the EU's position on the global stage are intertwined."
"European interests are served when cultural aspects are strategically devised through cooperation and partnership, both through cultural programmes and when cultural aspects form an integral part of economic, foreign and security and development policies."
"Through the sharing of literature, film, music and heritage, doors of understanding are opened and bridges between people are built."
"The EU also has important experiences to share when it comes to overcoming conflict and building stability through shared interests and mutual understanding."
"In the development of the External Action Service it is important to mainstream and streamline the role culture has, and should have, in the EU's external actions."
"It should be a vital and horizontally integrated element among the broad spectrum of external policies which make up the EU's foreign policy, from trade relations to its enlargement and neighbourhood policy, and its development cooperation and common foreign and security policy."
"Culture also has economic value."
"Europe's cultural industries contribute to European entrepreneurship, innovation and business, and the EU's diverse cultural landscape makes it the most attractive tourist destination in the world."
"Knowledge and international skills are crucial to education and employment, as indicated in the EU 2020 strategy, but culture can also be considered as a vehicle which helps to foster democratisation, freedom of expression, inclusion, development, education, reconciliation and much else."
"This very wide variety of aspects of cultural relations vis-à-vis third countries has led to a fragmentation of policies, which needs to change to a more coordinated and coherent EU strategy."
"We have chosen to emphasise the organisational and policy frameworks that are needed for the optimal coordination of culture in the EU's external actions."
"The filling in of such content should not be governed and regulated to too great an extent 'from the top down'."
"European citizens are best able to benefit if the EU acts as a global player on the world stage."
"This requires funds to be used more efficiently, and we have to be aware of Europe's competitive position and the struggle to attract tourists, talent, artists, business and students."
"We must speak with one voice and be aware of the competition from cultural programmes by China and the United States, to name just two."
"But there is no need to reinvent the wheel."
"The EU has a number of best practices from the Member States, as well as from different cultural institutions such as the Alliance française and the British Council."
"Another aspect that is very prominent in our 21st century is the ever-larger role played by the new technologies, both in culture and in international relations."
"People depend increasingly on the Internet for access to information and can only express themselves freely when this information, and their communications, are not censored."
"The right to cultural development and other fundamental rights is increasingly facilitated by these technologies."
"Access to cultural content happens through new media as well, and the opportunities for global connectivity around European cultural goods and content should be celebrated and facilitated, for example, through Europeana or websites of museums and festivals."
"It is important that the EU develop a strategy for Internet freedom."
"I will come back to some of the concrete recommendations of this report in the last part of my intervention."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, following on from Mrs Schaake, I would like to begin with a few words about the important report that she has drawn up."
"The cultural dimension of the EU's external policy cannot be overestimated."
"We therefore need - as she has already said - a coherent EU strategy for culture within EU external policy."
"Cultural diplomacy has an important role to play when it comes to building successful relations with third countries and, in many countries, there is a network of national institutes for culture, EUNIC, that we can make use of."
"There are many, many people who have linked in to the network and stand ready to help."
"I am now pleased to turn to today's second subject, which has also already been addressed by Mr Zver, namely, the subject of Youth on the Move, which, of course, is a flagship initiative of the Europe 2020 strategy."
"This flagship initiative is designed to encourage actors in the field of training and education to give more attention to these policy areas."
"We need better-qualified people."
"We need people who have experienced Europe thanks to improved mobility opportunities."
"We need to unlock the potential of our young people with the aid of our successful programmes."
"All of this has a major role to play in the competitiveness of a knowledge-based society."
"When it comes to lifelong learning, our existing Comenius, Erasmus, Leonardo and Grundtvig programmes have given many people wonderful opportunities to discover Europe in its diversity, gain experience for themselves and improve their language skills."
"Moreover, in this context, the significance of the Youth in Action programme and of the European Voluntary Service should not be underestimated."
"Today's debate must also send a signal to the Commission that we must continue these popularly well-received programmes and opportunities in the next generation of education and youth programmes, too, and that they must be well funded in keeping with their significance."
"Every euro that we spend in this area repays the whole of society not that many years later."
"I will now turn to another subject, namely Sarajevo."
"Sarajevo has a special place in European history and culture."
"By naming the city a European Capital of Culture in 2014, we could send an important signal for the multi-ethnic character of the city and the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which could also give the political class in that country cause to rethink their ideas."
"What is more, this is a city that makes it abundantly clear how badly Europe failed and how important it is to act together."
"There would be significant symbolism in such a step, as Sarajevo was the scene of the assassination that brought about the outbreak of the First World War in 1914."
"That is the reason for the date of 2014 - one hundred years after that historic event."
"During the Bosnian war, between 1992 and 1996, Sarajevo suffered the longest siege of a capital city in modern warfare history."
"Allow me to remind you of one day in Sarajevo, 28 May 1992."
"The cellist, Vedran Smajovic, clad in black, was playing Tomaso Albinoni's Adagio."
"His stage was the ruins of the devastated national library in Sarajevo; his audience consisted of a small group of people who had remained, despite the siege of the city, and who were listening to his music."
"For 22 days, he played in various locations in the ruins of Sarajevo."
"It was a requiem for the people who had been killed in those dark days."
"I was moved, and I was full of admiration for the brave and heartening behaviour of the cellist and his audience."
"What these people expressed through their behaviour, in the face of the horror and the loss, connected me forever with the city of Sarajevo."
"The cultural life of the city has never stopped."
"The winter festival took place even under the most adverse of circumstances."
"People of all nationalities head there each year."
"Every year, there is a winter festival, a kids' festival and a film festival."
"From Korea to Australia, Bulgaria to Sweden, film makers head to Sarajevo; co-productions take place."
"The city has retained an intercultural character, to which it tends - even as the political surroundings harden more and more into ethnic trenches."
"For that alone, this city deserves the chance to demonstrate its immense intercultural potential."
"Sarajevo wants to apply for this title in connection with a derogation, and has already undertaken extensive preparations."
"We all know well that, if we adopt our proposal today, we will be asking for a derogation from the decision of the European Parliament and the Council."
"However, if this House were to demonstrate its backing for the candidacy of Sarajevo today, I would put my trust in the judiciousness and far-sightedness of the Council, as our arguments are actually irrefutable."
"Particularly at this point, Bosnia and Herzegovina and the city of Sarajevo need a sign that all is not lost and that Europe also supports their efforts."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in our debate this morning, the issue is not simply about an economic model or a legal system."
"We are talking here about culture and civilisation."
"What place does Europe want to give to culture?"
"What influence do we want for our works and our creation?"
"The digital revolution, linked to globalisation and growing trade, compels us to rethink our cultural and economic model."
"With the Internet and digital media, what do we want Europe to be moving towards?"
"Politics is the art of anticipating, preparing what we would like so that we do not have to put up with what we do not want."
"The American film maker James Cameron spent on his film 'Avatar' the equivalent of the European Union's 'culture' programme for the 2007-2013 period."
"Will we be the consumers of cultural products that do not belong to us anymore, dependent on multinational oligopolies such as Google, iTunes, Amazon or Hollywood, without being able to defend our assets?"
"This morning, we are thinking about the challenges faced by culture in the globalised world of the 21st century."
"The European Commission, with the publication of its Green Paper last year, has at last taken stock of the potential of our creative and cultural industries."
"The European Union has a cultural heritage and cultural assets, as well as an extremely dynamic and lively film industry."
"The MEDIA programme is celebrating 20 years at the Cannes Festival this year and is supporting 20 of the competing films as well as festivals, performing arts and large exhibitions, which are taking place throughout the year and across Europe."
"Furthermore, despite the recession, the sector of creative and cultural industries has been consistently making progress in the last decade."
"The figures speak for themselves."
"In 2003, this sector generated a turnover of EUR 654 billion."
"It contributed 2.6% of Community GDP and accounted for 3.1% of all jobs within the European Union, or 5.8 million people."
"In 2008, it already represented EUR 860 billion, 14 million jobs and nearly 7% of GDP."
"That is more than the automotive industry and the agri-food industry put together."
"The dual nature of these industries, which are, at the same time, economic and cultural, makes them important levers for sustainable, intelligent and inclusive growth for Europe - in short, the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy."
"As well as being economic assets, they sustain and enrich cultural diversity."
"They contribute to social cohesion, to making regions attractive and to the European Union's influence in the world."
"It is time to give impetus, at Community level, to a real momentum that would unlock their potential and stimulate their development."
"Thus, I wanted to explore many lines of action to support the growth of these industries."
"These measures have several strands."
"Firstly, putting education and training at the heart of our strategy."
"On the one hand, Europe must encourage creative talents from a very young age, raise young people's awareness of culture, and develop partnerships between universities and companies."
"On the other hand, it should enable those in the culture sector to be trained with regard to new technologies, entrepreneurship, and should stimulate the exchange of best practices and the transmission of know-how."
"Secondly, it is essential that we adapt copyright to the digital era."
"Indeed, the current procedure for acquiring copyright is too fragmented, too complicated."
"The third vital component of our strategy should be the protection of creativeness."
"Intellectual property is a precious asset."
"Creativeness that is undermined is creativeness that is doomed to disappear."
"Creators' mobility must be encouraged."
"The European Union must work to introduce a European status so that they can enjoy fair working conditions and social protection."
"It must facilitate the purchase, distribution and circulation of works, adapt taxation, for instance, with reduced VAT for cultural goods, and lastly, help with funding."
"Private investors are too often reluctant when it comes to funding SMEs."
"The opportunities offered by public funding, particularly the Structural Funds, are not fully exploited."
"Creativity and culture must be considered as crucial aspects in our policy and, in this respect, Europe owes it to itself to promote them."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, of course, you understand that I will take a bit longer than five minutes to reply to the five reports."
"I would like to thank Mr Zver for his report on Youth on the Move."
"We really appreciate his efforts, as well as those of his co-rapporteurs, in dealing with this very important topic."
"As the report makes clear, the key objective of Youth on the Move is to help young people in Europe to gain the skills and experience they need to succeed in today's increasingly internationalised knowledge-based economy."
"Our goal is very much to create an environment in which every young person will be able to realise their potential."
"This is why the Commission has launched actions to support Member States in improving the quality and relevance of education and training from early childhood through to higher education."
"This is why we have set out measures to strengthen further the mobility opportunities available to young people and it is why my Commission colleague László Andor and I have placed so much emphasis on improving conditions for young people moving into the labour market."
"To achieve this, as Mr Zver's report makes so clear, sustained investment in education and training at all levels is necessary and, of course, Europe must play its part."
"That is why I am arguing so strongly for increased resources for the new generation of education, training and youth programmes for the period after 2013."
"I want to take this opportunity to respond directly to two points in the report."
"Firstly, I would like to reassure you on our approach to improving the transparency of higher education systems."
"As the report argues, our ultimate goal is to improve the information available to prospective students and others on various aspects of institutions' activities and performance."
"We want to develop a tool to overcome the shortcomings of existing university rankings by including a wider range of factors."
"We have no intention of publishing league tables of universities."
"Secondly, in the light of the call in the report for steps to remove barriers to mobility, I would highlight the fact that a Council recommendation designed to encourage Member States to do precisely this is due to be adopted by the Council in the coming days."
"It will mark a further step in our ambition to extend mobility opportunities."
"In conclusion on Youth on the Move, I would like to thank the rapporteur and the honourable Members once again for their support."
"On the subject of early years learning, I would like to thank Ms Honeyball for her report and for the constructive approach she has taken to the issue of early childhood education and care."
"Education and care for young children, which are widely accessible, inclusive and of high quality, help first of all to reconcile family and working life."
"Secondly, they are the foundation for lifelong learning, social integration, personal development and employability later in life."
"Investing early is much more effective than intervening later."
"The Commission therefore very much appreciates Parliament's approach, focusing on the long-term benefit of investing in early years learning."
"The Commission shares the view expressed by Parliament that a more child-centred approach is needed."
"Besides the number of places available, we must also address the question of quality at European and national level."
"I am thinking, for example, of staffing and staff quality, the integration of care and education, and active engagement with parents, who are the first educators of their children."
"The Commission welcomes the call for more European research in the field and for more efficient use of the existing financial tools, such as the structural funds and the lifelong learning programmes."
"We also welcome the strong emphasis on the need to identify and exchange good practices at European level."
"Turning to the Schaake report on the cultural dimensions of the EU's external actions, I congratulate Ms Schaake for this excellent own-initiative document."
"It rightly underlines the role of culture not only as a bridge between peoples but also as a fundamental element in promoting our values in the world."
"At the same time, it calls for a more strategic approach to cultural cooperation between the EU and third countries."
"The report also makes interesting suggestions on how the European External Action Service could take up the challenge of developing truly European cultural diplomacy."
"In this regard, Ms Schaake, I would mention two particular points in your report."
"Firstly, let me underline the relevance of your recommendation on a coherent and comprehensive strategy for cultural diplomacy at the level of the EU institutions."
"Secondly, let me refer to the idea of providing the European External Action Service with a real cultural diplomacy dimension."
"One of the aspects of this effort would be the establishment of cultural attachés in major capitals around the globe."
"The creation of such postings would allow increased coordination both between the present cultural attachés of Member States' embassies and between those national institutes of culture with a local presence, particularly via the European Union National Institutes for Culture (EUNICs) network."
"I had the pleasure of meeting EUNICs in both China and Brazil recently and I heard from them how much they need cooperation and coordination in order to promote our culture in the countries where they serve."
"As regards our emerging strategic partners around the globe, we have witnessed recently how culture can become an integral part of our external relations."
"I am more committed than ever to advancing further this very important dimension of our European agenda for culture."
"I now come to the Sanchez-Schmid report on unlocking the potential of cultural and creative industries."
"I would like to thank Parliament and, in particular, Ms Sanchez-Schmid, for this very good report."
"I am pleased to see that there is a strong convergence of views between your report and our analysis."
"We agree that the cultural and creative industries are a powerful motor not only for jobs, growth and export earnings, but also for social inclusion and cultural and linguistic diversity, as well as intercultural dialogue within the European Union and beyond."
"As you rightly say in the report, these industries have a vital contribution to make to the Europe 2020 strategy and must be given a more prominent place in the EU for the years to come."
"We also share the view that their potential is not fully developed."
"If we want these industries to develop fully, we have to make progress on various fronts: skills adaptation and capacity building, access to funding, improving the business environment, support for cross-border circulation and new distribution models, maximising these industries' potential for regional and local development, promoting their spillover effects in terms of innovation, and promoting a creative Europe on the world stage."
"This conclusion also emerges from the consultation launched by our Green Paper, which prompted reactions from 350 public authorities, the general public, civil society bodies and companies active in the field of culture across Europe."
"I am pleased to see that our Green Paper has sparked, in Europe and within the European institutions, a very rich debate on the right environment to put in place to meet the specific needs of creating entrepreneurship in order to seize the new opportunities offered by globalisation, digitisation and cultural diversity."
"I am firmly convinced that our joint efforts will help to create a better environment in which these vital industries can play an important role in the discussions on EU funding mechanisms post-2013 and implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy."
"Finally, I am very happy to see Parliament's enthusiasm - and, in particular, that of my good friend Doris Pack - for the European capitals of culture and Sarajevo's interest in holding the title."
"The Commission, of course, shares your view of the historic and cultural importance of Sarajevo."
"The city symbolises some of the darkest episodes in recent European history but also carries our hopes for a better future."
"In the face of repeated conflicts, Sarajevo has retained its multicultural spirit."
"Let me say a few words about the rules governing the European capitals of culture."
"In 2006, Parliament and the Council adopted the decision on which the initiative is based."
"This legal text lays down all the rules concerning the selection of the cities, and you know better than I do that a decision of this nature can be changed only through a new initiative following the ordinary legislative procedure."
"The decision states that the initiative is open exclusively to the 27 Member States of the European Union."
"As an integral part of the decision, a chronological list indicates, for every year until 2019, the two Member States which are entitled to hold the title."
"Two cities have already been selected for 2014, and the Council is about to confirm the two cities for 2015."
"The decision lays down the procedure for awarding the European capital of culture title, and the rules leave no scope for the Council to designate a city outside these procedures."
"The Commission is fully and solely responsible for implementing the decisions adopted by Parliament and Council."
"A derogation from the decision on the European capitals of culture in relation to a matter as fundamental as its geographical scope would simply break the rules that we have been asked to follow."
"I believe it would be particularly difficult to justify an exception so soon after we have all agreed the rules of the initiative."
"Parliament and the Council adopted the current decision less than five years ago."
"That was the moment, surely, to make the case for the participation of non-Member States or to make provisions for exceptional cases."
"However, at that point, it was decided that the participation of non-Member States would not continue beyond 2010."
"Looking to the future of the European capitals of culture, the Commission is currently working on renewal of the initiative beyond 2019."
"We launched a public consultation and are conducting an evaluation of the current scheme."
"We will then prepare a proposal, which we expect to adopt at the beginning of 2012."
"As part of our preparatory work, the Commission is exploring the idea of candidate countries joining the initiative after 2019."
"I would also inform you that a number of cities in other third countries have already shown an interest."
"Allow me to finish by underlining once again how much I appreciate Sarajevo's place in European history and its cultural significance."
"While the capitals of culture action is not available, the EU can offer other types of support for Sarajevo, in 2014 and beyond, through our cultural programme."
"rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on International Trade. - Mr President, I have abandoned my prepared text because I have to say something about the proposal to have EU cultural attachés."
"I could not believe I was hearing it: I have to say that this proposal from the Commission is one of the most bizarre and ludicrous ever to come out of a body which is celebrated for its bizarre and ludicrous proposals."
"EU cultural attachés will simply mean more highly paid non-jobs for favoured EU civil servants paid for by the contributing countries."
"I have to also say that it is grossly insensitive of the Commission to make this ludicrous and expensive proposal for unnecessary cultural attachés at a time of universal economic hardship."
"Perhaps, for once, you will forget your own gold-plated salaries and gold-plated pensions and think of the reality of what these initiatives cost."
"Mr President, let us get back on topic."
"As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I would like to thank everyone who worked on this report."
"In the committee, all the groups pursued the unanimous objective of making education and training possible for every young person in Europe and supporting their entry into a career, while no young person should fall by the wayside."
"I did not base my opinion for the committee on the Commission report, as I found it too unspecific."
"It was important to me for very specific tasks, too, to be listed in the report."
"In some cases, I was unable to support the positions taken in the report."
"In the view of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, one important aspect is the transition from school to career."
"It is a core interface."
"This transition must take place without time spent waiting around."
"We also found it important that young people's entry into their careers should not be associated with social dumping and that it must not take place under conditions of dumping."
"We felt that the role of traineeships was important."
"They are important and they are necessary, but their abuse must be avoided and forbidden."
"We would like to see an initiative for a European qualifications framework laying down minimum standards for traineeships."
"I will close with a request of Parliament and the Commission to ensure that the Youth in Action programme does not suffer financial cuts or even abolition in favour of the Youth on the Move programme."
"The work of youth associations is important for social engagement and helps young people progress, both in terms of substance and personally."
"That is also a major advantage for later working life."
"Mr President, first of all, I shall deal with the cultural and creative industries."
"As rapporteur for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I wish to highlight the important role that culture and creativity play in the European economy and in reaching the targets of the Europe 2020 strategy, for a society based on knowledge and innovation, as well as the potential new jobs they represent."
"In this report, particular attention is paid to the working conditions in the sector, in particular, irregular income and insecure working relations, which call for an in-depth debate in order to take account of specific aspects, for instance, by fighting against discrimination in terms of remuneration, and to improve the match between job held and level of qualification."
"We want to make it easier for young people and the most vulnerable to access culture and creative content, and we want to encourage mobility and promote cultural diversity as well as the use and spread of free software and open standards."
"Finally, we wish to stress the role of lifelong training in this sector, which is experiencing rapid changes."
"I now turn to the 'Youth on the Move' scheme."
"Things are tough for young Europeans: whether accessing employment, education, accommodation, social services, they undergo what is tantamount to the ordeals of a social initiation ceremony."
"We need to restore their confidence in the future by providing adapted and ambitious answers."
"I welcome the fact that this text does not consider the inclusion of young people only through the lens of employment, but also through the lens of education and training."
"In this respect, I should like to stress the request, which I support, put to the European Commission, for a Green Paper on youth participation."
"Our report also highlights the idea of mobility, which should be accessible to all, and I welcome that."
"Today, mobility essentially concerns students, but it should be encouraged for everyone, young workers and young people who are doing vocational training."
"It would be regrettable to categorise young Europeans as either an educated elite, multilingual and confident in the future, or as young people left behind on the grounds that they do not have a Masters degree or because they are only doing manual work."
"I am especially delighted that in this text, we called for abolition of the discriminations linked to age, regarding access to the social protection scheme."
"I am asking for it here and, of course, I think that the minimum income scheme is a key element in guaranteeing young people's autonomy."
"Our report insists on the main desire of young people to be autonomous, to have access to healthcare in particular, and to have decent accommodation at a reasonable price."
"We all know that the young person who has no option but to work as well as study is heading towards failure in his/her studies."
"Finally, I am delighted that, in this House, it has been recognised that work placements should no longer be jobs in disguise, fully-fledged jobs."
"Work placements must attract sufficient remuneration and social protection."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe all of us are aware that we are facing very turbulent times in Europe, both economically and politically."
"Our solidarity is being threatened, as nationalist and populist movements are in the ascendant, as demonstrated by one of our British colleagues a moment ago, a member of the nobility, at that."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the current trends pose a threat to the future of the EU and to the prosperity and well-being of Europeans."
"We have been elected to provide an answer to that."
"Commissioner, where necessary, that answer can and must also come from the cultural sector."
"We must definitely invest a lot more in the creation of a common European public space."
"Education, as has already been pointed out in this debate, could make a very important, if not crucial, contribution to that end."
"We firmly believe that we can make much better use of the cooperation between entrepreneurs in the cultural sector, on the one hand, and academia, both higher education - universities and higher education colleges - and secondary education, on the other, and that they offer a lot more opportunities than we are currently utilising."
"Commissioner, you have just said it yourself: this is a sector with a major potential for our economy and employment, which is why we must take specific, stimulating measures, such as reducing the tax on online projects, because the current system, certainly the VAT rate, is out of step with the times and is absolutely unfair."
"Furthermore, entrepreneurs, managers of small and medium-sized enterprises in the creative sector, need better access to financing opportunities, because we currently have too little know-how and too little access to bank finance."
"This report puts forward very specific proposals in that respect and, Commissioner, we are counting on both the Commission and the competent national and regional authorities to pick up the gauntlet and start implementing this proposal."
"Mr President, the position of the cultural and creative industry forms part of the European strategy for innovation and the EU 2020 strategy, and is closely connected with measures aimed at the more effective use of monuments, museums and gallery collections, or urban and rural units in tourism and related activities."
"The digitisation of historical and cultural content represents the main opportunity in this regard."
"Digitisation should increase the access of the general public to materials that are essential for study, cognition and education, and strengthening cultural identity."
"Investment in these areas brings an almost guaranteed return, not only in the area of tourism, which is surely a significant component of many regional economies, but also in foreign policy."
"It pays to develop awareness of the deep cultural traditions of European countries and, at the same time, to promote individual villages, towns, regions, Member States and the EU itself in a global context."
"In the new programming period after 2013, we should therefore continue the funding of cultural projects from the European structural funds, strengthen the twinning programme for cooperation between local authorities and retain the independence of the community programme for projects in this area with the title of 'Culture'."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Sanchez-Schmid, for her excellent work on this report."
"I am very pleased and very proud of the fact that the Committee on Legal Affairs submitted our opinion on which we were in total agreement and I find it gratifying that the majority of our views are included in your report."
"We look forward to broad support in this Chamber."
"We are at a point in time when digital technology and the Internet are creating both huge opportunities and enormous challenges for Europe's cultural and creative sectors."
"We must hold on to the foundation for defending intellectual property and, at the same time, take the necessary steps to be able to release the potential and creativity in modern technology."
"Europe's cultural practitioners, technical innovators and, above all, Europe's citizens deserve a well-functioning internal market, where creative content can flow freely and generously across our borders and where cultural practitioners are secure in the knowledge that they will receive remuneration for their work."
"I would also like to thank the rapporteurs for including the proposal put forward by the Committee on Legal Affairs to provide increased access to books for those who are blind or sight-impaired."
"I hope that this will be able to help these people to an even greater degree to experience the pleasure and strength that literature provides."
"The freedom of speech must be available for everyone. Thank you."
"This brings us to the end of the round of speakers on behalf of the committees concerned, and I cannot resist the temptation to point something out."
"In speeches such as these, delivered on behalf of the individual committees, it is my belief that the speaker must make an effort to represent the committee on behalf of which he or she is speaking."
"There have been speeches in this debate which would have been perfectly legitimate if they had reflected the views of individuals, but which are totally inadequate when they are delivered on behalf of a committee which I am quite convinced has not felt represented by the words we have heard."
"I believe this matter should be taken into consideration at least by Parliament's Bureau, because we cannot allow some of the things we have heard here today to be said on behalf of committees representing so many members of Parliament."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to thank, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), all the rapporteurs who presented reports this morning, as I believe that these reports allow us to lay the foundations for the Europe of the future."
"This morning, we are working on future generations, from children to our young people, whom we must guide into the world of work by means of the important flagship initiative entitled Youth on the Move."
"This morning, we are discussing expanding the Union towards the Balkans through culture, as well as developing cultural and creative industries."
"At a time of great economic crisis, it is important to emphasise that the only sector not making a loss - in fact, its turnover is actually increasing - is the cultural sector."
"We would like culture to play a part in the external actions of the European Union, and not only, Lord Dartmouth and Mr Kuhn, through well paid officials, but rather by constructing a better process for peace, stability and understanding between different cultures."
"Today, though, we must also seek to strengthen our programmes for culture, education and young people."
"For millions of Europeans, programmes such as Erasmus, Lifelong Learning, Comenius, Leonardo, Youth in Action, and many others besides, are not just labels but a symbol of the European Union's existence."
"For many people, they mark the beginning of a European spirit, the first time they came into contact with colleagues and people their own age, really helping to strengthen the Union, and even more so given the new responsibilities for sport that the Union has assumed following the Treaty of Lisbon."
"We need to invest in all these programmes but, above all, we need to believe in them."
"Nobody is denying the importance of milk quotas, investment in industry and protecting the environment; but it is culture that will allow us to build Europe, and we will have to do this not with words, but with programmes and actions that we are able and willing to put into practice."
"Mrs Vassiliou, the chords played by that violin in Sarajevo, the one Mrs Pack told us about, resonate more with our Europe than with a multitude of regulations."
"This is how Europe will be built, and at times it may even be necessary to bend those regulations a little."
"Mr President, I am delighted that the European Parliament has finally devoted one entire morning of its plenary session to culture and education."
"Education is one of the key issues in a time of crisis, and we must not forget that educated young people are our future."
"I welcome the Commission's Youth on the Move initiative and the fact that it has not forgotten about young people."
"Investing in education is the solution to the perennial problems of the EU, even in a time of belt-tightening."
"I would like to congratulate the European Parliament rapporteur for Youth on the Move, Mr Zver."
"I think his report is extremely good, particularly as it is the work of an entire committee sharing the common objective of benefiting young people."
"The mobility of young people in the EU, and particularly the facilitation of this mobility, is important for European identity and European citizenship activities."
"As you all know, however, I was very critical of the original Commission initiative, and I would therefore like to emphasise several points which we have managed to include in this report."
"It is surely important for us not to stop investing in mobility and youth programmes, such as the current Erasmus and Leonardo programmes, and the Youth in Action activities."
"This is surely one of the ways in which we can achieve the objectives we have set in our Europe 2020 strategy."
"I also consider it very important to support lifelong learning and activities that are not just for young people."
"I would definitely like to emphasise equal opportunities for all, not only in terms of gender equality, but also for disabled or otherwise disadvantaged people."
"It is surely important to recognise informal education as another very important means for improving skills which young people can use in their future lives."
"The dialogue between Member States and between regions is also very important, and I am delighted that we have managed to include a number of comments from the Committee of the Regions as well as other organisations, such as the European Youth Forum, for example."
"There are so many of these that I could carry on speaking not just for two minutes but for 10 minutes, but I would like to end with one sentence."
"I would also be delighted to support - as one of the original authors - the initiative on Sarajevo, as it is very important for us to show the people of this region that the EU is here for them."
"Mr President, I am pleased that this morning's plenary is devoted to cultural matters: it is very important to speak about them, not just on one morning but more broadly."
"Nevertheless, it is good that we are dealing with these issues."
"It is something of a challenge to bundle all these reports together and give evaluations of them, but perhaps I can express a few views on them."
"Concerning Mr Zver's Youth on the Move initiative, it is very probably true that this mobility programme has proven to be a success story, and his report, to its credit, goes a lot deeper into the matter."
"I believe that it could lead to many success stories being documented in European history and on the subject of youth in the future."
"It is important to ensure that we have Europewide educational programmes in which young people can participate, and that multiculturalism can be strengthened as a result."
"It is also very important to consider what Mrs Honeyball says in her report on early childhood education and care (ECEC)."
"I would prefer to speak of early education and care rather than early years learning, as a person's growth process is important."
"People must be allowed to grow, and education is just one part of that process."
"If we can bring our children and young people up to be good human beings and wellbalanced members of society, that is a huge challenge."
"Obviously, the home has a crucial role here, but, as the report points out so well, it is also vital to ensure that those working in the ECEC field have a role to play and that there is a process of mediation, something which children and young people particularly need today."
"Regarding Mrs Schaake's report on the EU's external actions, I think that we need a greater understanding of culture when we are laying down foreign policy."
"That is very important."
"There are many unfortunate examples of situations where ignorance of cultural backgrounds and the cultural context has led to failures in foreign policy, and that is why it is very important to make culture an integral part of the European External Action Service."
"I would like to finish by saying that my opinion regarding the Sarajevo initiative, which Mrs Pack brought up today, is that it is quite true that five years ago decisions were taken on capitals of culture, but, as in science, a paradigm always has to be challenged anew."
"Now perhaps is the time to do so regarding this particular issue, to some extent at least, and try to find a solution where a change might be made with respect to Sarajevo."
"I believe that it could produce added value for the European Capital of Culture programme and the European Union as a whole."
"To sum up, we should look at the bigger picture regarding cultural policy and try to understand its importance for the whole of the European Union."
"The internal market and foreign and security policy will not endure if there is no strong cultural base to support them."
"Culture is the basis of everything, the basis of the future for the European Union as a whole, and that is why it is important to ensure that it is acknowledged, not just in the light of GDP, but as a value in itself, both for people and societies, and, ultimately, for the entire European Union."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, in recent years, academic and political focus on culture and education has increased dramatically, with analysis consistently highlighting these areas to be crucial not only in encouraging economic growth and social cohesion, but also in facilitating mobility for young people across Europe."
"Unfortunately, in the current economic climate, with many Member States adopting austerity measures and budget reductions necessary to reduce deficits, these areas can often appear neglected and I wish this were not the case."
"Investment in education and culture helps Member States to compete globally, equipping our young people for the challenges of tomorrow, and encourages creativity, innovation and mutual understanding."
"However, it is precisely in these areas where the Member States, rather than the EU as a whole, can act, and where they know how best to respond to the educational challenges they face."
"I am concerned with a number of aspects of the reports we have discussed this morning, especially regarding the intrusion on Member States' subsidiarity in terms of educational targets and social policy."
"It is beyond the competence of the EU to dictate educational reforms to Member States, and we must ensure that this is respected."
"In terms of culture, the EU can assist Member States in getting the best out of their policy priorities through exchanges of best practice and highlighting areas of importance, such as early years learning, the reduction of early school leaving and the promotion of vocational training."
"Another key to helping our young people secure opportunities is to allow flexibility in labour markets so that people can learn on the job."
"However, the arbitrary creation of new projects and organisations to facilitate these goals runs counter to the budgetary realities evident across the EU."
"We must be mindful of this sad fact and try to deliver what we can for the real world that we face."
"Nonetheless, I am a great believer in the power of culture to ensure mutual understanding and to spur innovation and economic growth."
"We have a wealth of culture and creativity in Europe which needs to be fostered and developed."
"The creative industries add greatly to the EU's economy and our cultural experiences."
"We need to give them the tools to continue their development and gain the rewards they deserve."
"It goes without saying that, the more we educate our young people across Europe, the more the future begins to look brighter in a challenging global environment."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as shadow rapporteur of the Youth on the Move report, and in view of the various amendments that have been tabled to the reports on the cultural and creative industries and on early years learning, I should like to share the following thought."
"The economic crisis is being particularly harsh on young people."
"In many regions of the European Union, youth unemployment is above 40%."
"This is what makes an in-depth review of policies to get young people into work, such as the Youth on the Move report, so necessary."
"I will focus on four - in my view - key aspects of the report."
"Firstly, I believe it is of the utmost importance to promote mobility."
"It is an extremely valuable means of informal learning that favours cultural exchange and gives young people the tools they need to develop within a global professional environment."
"Secondly, and in close relation to mobility, it is crucial that young people learn other European languages, for two purposes: to interact fluently in the European environment and to be fully integrated members of the communities where they live and work, or, in other words, for social cohesion."
"Thirdly, I should like to stress the importance of policies to stimulate entrepreneurship."
"Indeed, it is essential to foster entrepreneurship programmes for university students."
"This will involve promoting forums where financial players and students with innovative ideas can interact."
"Lastly, I believe it is vital to promote equal opportunities in access to university so that no fraction of European talent is wasted."
"We need young people to take an active part in the economy."
"We need young people to develop their full potential because they, too, have an essential role to play if we are to emerge from the crisis."
"Mr President, with only two minutes to talk about five reports and an oral question, I will restrict myself to two reports: the report by Mrs Sanchez-Schmid on creative industries, and the report by my colleague, Mrs Schaake, on the cultural dimensions of the EU's external actions."
"I am doing this because, together, they give us the micro vision and the macro vision of what Europe needs in order to be able to turn this crisis around, with the help of the talent and imagination of Europeans."
"In the case of the creative industries, I believe that it is very clear that Europe has probably the highest concentration of potential for the creative industries."
"This is true from the outset for our urban areas, our cities, which have, on the one hand, very good connectivity and, on the other, very strong and varied cultural personalities, with a great deal of diversity."
"Some of our urban macro-regions also have elements that the creative industries need to be sustainable on their own: that is, intensive capital, a concentration of talent and knowledge, and a vast array of already established companies."
"We can see this, for example, in the region between Paris, London and Antwerp."
"However, this is not true of the whole of Europe."
"In other words, in some peripheral regions of Europe, there is talent, there is history, and there are cities that could play a major role in relaunching the European economy, but they cannot get there without aid, whether at Union level or at Member State level."
"Therefore, we cannot delude ourselves about this: until Europe puts its economic house in order, for example, by issuing bonds, nothing can be done."
"We are here in Parliament with very good ideas and, at the same time, the governments are tearing the euro to shreds and making recovery impossible."
"As regards external action policy, and since I am already almost out of time, I should like to say that the European Union has a unique opportunity to develop a completely different type of foreign policy from those of the Member States."
"Moreover, culturally, this has nothing to do with creating a potential European identity and an illusory European identity, and subsequently exporting it or selling it overseas."
"Europe could, instead, position itself very well to use culture in external action as a two-way street, whereby we teach but also learn, and whereby we maintain fruitful dialogue with other great regional blocs such as Mercosur or the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)."
"That is how best to benefit the rest of the world with the example of European democracy, but it also benefits the European Union, because we will be able to learn from others."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to offer my contribution by stating the need for a new methodological approach, particularly in the heritage and cultural heritage sector, linked to the intelligent use of new technology."
"An awareness of the massive potential for improvement that new technologies can offer us, both in terms of efficiency and effectiveness, necessarily involves abandoning the ways we worked in the past."
"New technologies mean new working methods."
"I myself have witnessed that by using technology intelligently in the monument protection sector, it is possible to obtain significant results, in terms of both the planning and restoration works."
"Additionally, as a simultaneous by-product, and without incurring additional costs, we can obtain highly accurate geometrical databases that can be used to monitor and manage the artefact in the event of natural disasters, as well as products for scientific education and for promoting the artefact on a global scale, fulfilling criteria for cultural understanding and exchange"
"What I think matters most is that we contribute to a plan of action, whose aim is to help us reach a new awareness of technology, so that new economic opportunities may be created for Europe."
"I believe especially in the need to train new people and in professional, young and highly qualified individuals, who are able to rise to the challenges posed by the new global market."
"(BG) Mr President, I will restrict what I have to say to the 'Youth on the Move' report."
"I would like to congratulate the rapporteur because the report has managed to cover absolutely every aspect of this issue and this European policy."
"More specifically, I will restrict my speech to three issues."
"Firstly, with regard to points 24 and 25 in the report concerning children staying at school and increasing their attendance at school, I would like to ask the following question."
"Incidentally, I also submitted a question to the Commission quite recently for a written reply."
"I am still waiting for this reply, but I am taking this opportunity to mention this problem which I have been raising for a long time."
"Many of the Eastern European countries from the last enlargement round face the problem that certain minority groups already follow a practice, which has almost turned into a tradition, where they stop their children going to school, who are then exploited by their parents."
"When measures are taken to change this process, these measures are usually described as discriminatory."
"This is why I am asking the question: whom are we discriminating against to be more precise?"
"I wonder whether it is the parents, who are exploiting their children, or the children, who are losing, as a result, any opportunity to become integrated because they do not have any education, although, as you know, economic integration through work and resources provides a basis for any other integration."
"Regarding point 27 of the report, this point again makes a very precise reference to a real problem."
"A leading university lecturer recently shared his view with me that, in actual fact, Bulgarian universities are not aware that there is also an Erasmus programme for teachers."
"Further measures need to be taken in this area."
"Finally, on the subject of youth unemployment, which is mentioned under letters F and G of the report, this is also a significant problem."
"The problem to which I am referring is that when young people apply for a job, they already need to have had a traineeship."
"However, when someone has just left school or university, they cannot have already gained such work experience."
"Such a requirement is ridiculous and discriminatory and must be looked at closely."
"This is the procedure in both the public and private sectors."
"For that matter, one measure which can be taken in the public sector in particular is to impose strict rules for people to retire who have reached retirement age so as to free up jobs for young people."
"(HU) Mr President, Commissioner, we have to thank Mrs Sanchez-Schmid for the report."
"EU institutions have set themselves the goal to take advantage more effectively of existing opportunities that lie within cultural and creative industries."
"This is an important task, because better industry terms would allow the EU to become a global market leader in this area."
"Culture contributes to the fight against poverty and marginalisation, and plays a part in strengthening and preserving the common European spirit and heritage."
"By creating a clear path for creative thinking and the resulting ideas, we can all gain intellectual and economic advantages."
"Cultural and creative industries are already important motivators and influencers of the economy, even though their situation is not always favourable."
"While it is not possible to restrict creativity, it is possible to negatively influence people's willingness to create."
"An uncertain entrepreneurial environment and an unfavourable legislative framework can dampen citizens' creative spirit."
"We can rightly expect from a European strategy to help creative groups, which have been restricted until now, to express themselves on a European level."
"At the same time, it may promote a certain degree of opportunity balance amongst Member States, allowing us to experience the presence of an industry with five million workers, as well as the growth of their numbers in every Member State."
"In this area, we intend to assign an important role to small and medium-sized enterprises as well."
"Central Europe has a considerable number of bright citizens with a desire to create."
"The question is whether we can already provide everyone with the proper background today."
"Unfortunately, the answer is no, but an increasing number of targeted programmes have been set up to improve the situation, including, for instance, the Danube strategy."
"This morning's discussion also concerns youth."
"It is vital for future generations to receive from Europe full support in the areas of cultural learning, further education and artistic creation."
"We must find solutions that make artistic creation attractive within the European Union and, at the same time, secure a playing field in international competition."
"In summary, it is of vital importance that we concern ourselves with cultural and creative industries, which is why we must create as soon as possible - for artists and creative minds alike - adequate conditions that take into consideration unique characteristics, in the areas of mobility, intellectual property rights and social protection."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, through its report on the cultural dimensions of the EU's external actions, Parliament clarifies its aspiration to also put our own stamps on this developing policy field."
"The fact - and I want to put this carefully - that I do not see a representative of the External Action Service here today shows how necessary this report is."
"The report quite rightly urges that, in future, cultural aspects should play a more significant role in external policy, into which they should be more systematically incorporated."
"For my group, it was important to call for a coherent strategy that more effectively coordinates existing EU external policy programmes with cultural components, thereby taking account of cultural diversity in the EU."
"Mrs Pack has already made reference to this, saying that the existing structures in the Member States and between them, such as the EUNIC network of national institutes for culture, must be incorporated and that civil society must be seen as part of European external cultural policy."
"The EU's motto of 'United in diversity' should also come to bear on the image that the Union projects to the outside world."
"We should also make even better use of the new media as a communications platform to that end."
"As we do all this, we need to make sure that art and culture do not become means to an end in external policy."
"It is our cultural values that characterise our European Community."
"It is therefore important and right that this cultural diversity and identity should also be disseminated outside the Union by its policies."
"I feel sure that we can achieve much more in this way, including in the debate about human rights and democracy, than through many cases of sabre-rattling, sometimes with absolutely nothing to back it up, in this House."
"(DA) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are in the middle of a fight, which is also reflected in the debate here today - a fight between the forces in Europe that want to weaken the European project and those of us who - in the midst of the crisis that we find ourselves in right now - want us to reef the sails and actually strengthen the European project."
"A great deal is currently being said about the economy and about integration and foreign policy, and that is clearly important, too."
"However, there is no doubt in my mind that if we are to preserve the European project and, in particular, if it is to find support among the people of Europe, who are currently sceptical about the whole idea, we need to invest in culture and we need to invest in young people."
"Therefore, I obviously very much welcome the debate here today and also the five reports that we are discussing."
"I was shadow rapporteur for the report on Youth on the Move, and I would like to thank our rapporteur, Mr Zver, for his excellent cooperation."
"As time will not allow me to go into too much detail, I will just concentrate on two aspects. The first is the question of young people being able to move across borders."
"I believe that in this time of crisis, it is necessary for us to really focus, both politically and financially, on actually implementing and supporting this mobility for young people."
"Therefore, I am naturally very pleased that one of the things we are working on is strengthening what we are calling the European Qualifications Framework, in other words, the scheme that allows young people to use the points that they gain across borders."
"This is a small but tangible detail that it is important to promote so that young people do not experience problems in this regard."
"Secondly, I would like to highlight what we are referring to as the Mobility Scoreboard, in which we indicate the barriers to mobility in the Member States."
"This is also something that I strongly support - I think it is a very good idea."
"These are just two specific examples that show that we are making progress and that the devil is in the detail. In specific terms, this is where we need to work to strengthen the opportunities for young people and, in so doing, invest in our young people."
"Finally, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his cooperation and to wish the Commissioner luck with the huge task - as I know - of making the other Commissioners in the Commission College aware of the importance of culture and young people."
"(PL) Mr President, I would like to focus my attention on the cultural dimensions of external actions and the report drafted by Mrs Schaake."
"I would like to say that in several aspects, the report is worthy of support and congratulations."
"In paragraph 17, it condemns totalitarian regimes which use censorship."
"In paragraph 50, it objects to the use of cultural arguments to justify human rights violations, when we have problems with the exploitation of precisely this kind of supposed diversity in contacts with China, for example."
"It encourages the involvement of civil society in paragraph 39, and stresses the importance of democratic freedoms and fundamental human rights."
"In all these areas, the report is worthy of support and praise."
"By the way, during the work of the Committee on Culture and Education, we were able to remove from the report the proposal to appoint a special EU ambassador solely for cultural affairs."
"These are the successes."
"Unfortunately, however, there are also matters which I would call problematic, which means that unfortunately, during the meetings of the Committee on Culture and Education, a change was made to the provision which said that this was about appointing a person who would be responsible only for cultural matters and nothing else."
"This is something to which attention should be called."
"The second thing - the report calls for additional training for European External Action Service staff in the fields of cultural and digital policies."
"In the Committee on Culture and Education, we did not want this provision to increase costs in this area, but unfortunately, that amendment fell."
"This is why my attitude to this report is simply one of ambivalence."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the two reports by Mrs Schaake and Mrs Sanchez-Schmid remind us that culture is not a decoration motif but the fruit of complex interdependencies, showing that cultural questions should be addressed in a transverse manner and integrated into all European policies, internal as well as external, social as well as economic."
"In this respect, I encourage you, Commissioner, to continue in this direction and to develop cooperation with the other committees, with the European Commission's other services, as well as with Baroness Ashton's European External Action Service."
"Furthermore, I would like to come back to a point that has not been expanded on in these reports, concerning the mobility of artists and of professionals in the cultural sector."
"Indeed, this issue is of major importance for the emergence of a European cultural area."
"In this regard, two aspects seem to me to be important; namely, firstly, the dissemination by the European Union and Member States of clear and understandable information on regulations and procedures currently in force."
"Secondly, the removal - as has already been said - of the regulatory and administrative barriers which impede the free movement, within the Schengen area, of those in the cultural sector, in particular, for third-country nationals, by introducing, for instance, common accelerated procedures within the European Union for short and long-term visas, as well as a single procedure for obtaining work permits in the Union."
"I strongly urge the Commission to continue its work in these areas."
"Finally, in the context of a rise in power of a largely American global mainstream as regards cultural leisure, it is urgent to remind the European Union and Member States of the importance of providing themselves with tools enabling them to defend and promote the diversity of European cultures and of third countries."
"Therefore, Europe should reposition itself and not abandon the battle over soft power, since what is at stake here today is respect for cultural diversity as a tool for dialogue and as a guarantee of peace and stability worldwide."
"(FR) Mr President, I would like to make a few general comments on all the debates that are being put to us this morning."
"Unfortunately, issues relating to education and culture are not given enough importance in this Chamber."
"Yet they are vital for our future, the future of Europe, the future of our youth."
"The under 30s account for 20% of the European population, but unemployment of the under 24s has now reached nearly 21%, and almost 15% of 18-24s leave further or higher education before the end of the second cycle and do not follow any additional study or training."
"Worse, nearly 25% of young people under 15 have reading difficulties."
"We cannot accept these figures and, with the recession, they are getting worse in a number of Member States."
"The 'Youth on the Move' report submitted to us is a step in the right direction on certain points and conveys a number of messages to the Commission and to Member States."
"The European Parliament reaffirms its will not to see our youth sacrificed on the altar of austerity policies implemented across Europe."
"Let us hope that these will not be empty words!"
"This report also contains a number of worrying aspects, particularly when it demonstrates the desire to reform higher education curricula solely on the basis of market requirements, without going to the trouble of reaffirming the more general role of higher education with respect to the overall training of tomorrow's citizens."
"We know that the broader young people's training is, the better they can face life's uncertainties, especially those uncertainties relating to work."
"Soon, we will have the opportunity to work on the issues involved in the Bologna process and I welcome that."
"All I would say is that our role is to listen to the growing worries - and the word is weak - in a number of States in relation to the reforms undertaken in the name of the Bologna process."
"We cannot sacrifice our youth; words are not enough in this regard."
"I would like to add a few words to thank Mrs Honeyball for her report and the work we have been able to do on the issues around childcare."
"I fully support the guidelines of this report."
"Conversely, I cannot share the guidelines of Mrs Sanchez-Schmid's report on cultural industries, since these guidelines would introduce a commercial rationale, subject to market forces, to cultural goods."
"Finally, I would like to offer my resolute support to Mrs Pack for choosing Sarajevo as European capital of culture."
"(LT) Mr President, I wanted to say a few words about the Youth on the Move initiative."
"This initiative has a very fine objective - to increase the education and training of youth through mobility and ease the transition of young people from education into the labour market."
"This is particularly important today for young people who are one of the social groups hit hardest by the global financial crisis."
"Young people must be supported to enter the labour market in order to secure their own futures, as well as contribute to economic growth and prosperity."
"It is vital for young people to be able to develop the competences, skills and knowledge that will allow them to actively contribute to the growth and sustainable future of the European Union over the coming years."
"I believe that it is essential to ensure that the education they are receiving is conducive with the needs of the labour market."
"It is also important to ensure that Europe's young people are not deprived of the opportunity to develop themselves and to contribute to the prosperity of the European Union."
"Mobility does cause certain problems."
"Young people who have gained an education in another Member State most often stay and work there."
"Therefore, a country such as Lithuania, which faces a tough economic situation, risks losing, for some time, educated people, who are the basis for the country's growth, and not just in an economic sense."
"True, this is our own internal problem and we will solve it ourselves."
"Generally speaking, it is excellent that we are trying today to address an issue that is very important for young people."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, dear guests from Thuringia in the visitors' gallery,"
"Mr President, to my colleague who is afraid of educated young people moving to another state, I would say that civilisation grows and develops when people move, and we ought not to be afraid of that."
"It happens wherever people from different countries meet and bring together their various experiences: the examples of this in Europe are very numerous and it is good that we have so much to say about mobility."
"This mobility will guarantee continued health and prosperity for Europe."
"Mr Zver's report draws attention to numerous barriers that act as disincentives to mobility in Europe, and I would like to highlight some of them."
"To take up what Mr Løkkegaard briefly mentioned, it is really not acceptable that young people who are studying, training or working abroad should encounter difficulties, when they move, with the most basic tasks such as accessing banking services or renting an apartment."
"What is more, they are penalised by roaming charges when they try to telephone home or access the Internet and search online for basic, necessary information."
"Data roaming is extremely expensive."
"The Commission has proposed introducing a mobility scoreboard as part of the Youth on the Move initiative."
"This will permit systematic monitoring of Member States' progress in dismantling barriers."
"The scoreboard should be comprehensive and straightforward so that it can serve as a real catalyst to Member States' removing those obstacles."
"This would benefit both old and young, students and workers."
"I call on the Commission to present a detailed proposal on how this mobility scoreboard will be operated, and I hope it will do so as soon as possible."
"In conclusion, mobility is a horizontal issue, and I therefore urge my colleagues, on the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, and also on other committees, not to lose sight of the mobility dimension in their work in all areas."
"(IT) Mr President, in an ageing Europe that is struggling to find answers to the global challenges of the future, the European Union and its Member States must seize this strong stimulus from Parliament to demonstrate that they can be more courageous, investing in future generations, in education and in culture."
"With these four reports and the Sarajevo proposal, Parliament calls for these issues to be placed at the heart of the Europe 2020 strategy."
"In particular, the economic advantages, as well as those in employment and innovation, are highlighted by the report on cultural and creative industries, which already account for almost 3% of Europe's gross product and employ 5 million people - a figure which rises to 7% if ancillary industries are taken into account."
"As shadow rapporteur for this measure for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists & Democrats in the European Parliament, I am pleased to see that the rapporteur, Mrs Sanchez-Schmid, has welcomed our amendments."
"What did we propose?"
"First of all, that cultural tourism and fashion should be added to the eight sectors already included."
"We also hope that the Commission - and I am sure that Mrs Vassiliou will take action to ensure this happens - will submit a White Paper on cultural and creative industries as soon as possible in order to strengthen this cross-sectoral strategy throughout Europe and the Member States."
"Cutting funds for culture and education at times of crisis - as my country is doing, on the grounds that culture is not essential to survival - means failing to invest in the future and in smart, inclusive growth; it means failing to understand that culture is essential for life."
"The report states that the European status of artists and of those engaged in creative professions should be officially recognised, and that in cultural industry, small and medium-sized enterprises should be fully recognised as such for the purposes of access to credit and support when starting up, especially for young people under the age of 35."
"It also promises to protect jobs, and to introduce specific training and innovative financial instruments, bearing in mind that capital in the creative sector often consists of values that are intangible but nonetheless crucial for innovation in all sectors."
"The Europe-wide cultural sector must be taken into consideration in the legal framework for international trade, certainly in the European dimension and in cultural diplomacy, in the internal market, in mobility ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, for strategies like Youth on the Move to be effective and deliver measurable results, there must be increased education and business cooperation."
"While I agree with the rapporteur that education should not only ensure employability but also encourage creativity, there is a need for a move towards integrating education and business objectives."
"University programmes must be brought closer to the demands of the labour market."
"Young people should be given the opportunity to acquire, without barriers, the experience, skills, knowledge and know-how to equip themselves for future career paths and entrepreneurship."
"In particular, it is necessary to improve opportunities for young people in vocational education and training to facilitate their mobility in the European Union and allow for apprenticeships abroad, thus expanding their skill set and employability."
"Mobility programmes and the benefits of the experience of working and studying abroad must be accessible to all young people regardless of the type of education they have chosen."
"Youth on the Move has the potential to be successful, but it must also translate into concrete measures that will deliver benefits for our young people."
"Mr President, my own constituency has a long history of combining the promotion of the Welsh language to the young generation with artistic and technical talents to produce animated programmes like Sally Mally, Super Ted and Sam Tân."
"Today, this past has been reinvigorated by new productions such as Dr Who and Torchwood, so that Wales is quickly becoming known as a centre for cultural excellence with regard to film and programme production, as well as being home to newer creative areas, like the hugely profitable gaming industry."
"In order for this to continue, the most important thing we must now do is to provide the support that our creative industries need to continue to grow."
"We must focus on reducing the administrative hurdles that all small businesses face and look at ways to get real added value from the Single Market via cooperation on intellectual property rights, a European patent and realising the full potential of the Digital Agenda and, of course, eliminating inconsistencies in existing EU legislation, such as in the field of VAT."
"Our EU budget should be used productively to develop the huge amount of creative energy around us into true wealth-creating businesses, providing sustainable jobs and a prosperous and rich future for our people in Wales and beyond."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, in reality, we are holding a debate this morning about the significance of culture in the various policy areas - in foreign policy, in economic policy, in education policy and in social policy - and we all know that all of us benefit from culture being taken more seriously."
"The breaking out of democracy in the Arab countries would not be possible without this culturally-based desire for opening up, for cultural diversity, democracy and freedom of the press."
"Creative industries are an important part of economic policy."
"In my home country, Germany, there are more jobs in the creative sector than in the automotive sector."
"That is something we must take note of."
"The result is that this is also an important part of the Europe 2020 strategy."
"The point I want to make, however, is that, if we want to bolster the creative industries, we have work to do, in particular, on digital development."
"We know that it is precisely the producers of creative content that form the base of the value chain for the cultural sector."
"On the one hand, therefore, we have a major interest in cultural diversity, bolstering creative people and easy access to creative content online."
"Yet, at the same time, we want artists to be fairly paid, something that is not always the case in today's digital world."
"We therefore need to amend contract law in order to strengthen the bargaining position of our artists."
"We need to develop new social models in order to find a fair balance between easy access for users and proper payment for those who create new content."
"I have one last point to make."
"It would be of major symbolic value and a major historic success for Europe if Sarajevo were to be a European Capital of Culture for 2014."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, the report on Youth on the Move contains some good ideas, like the demand that the crisis must not be used as an excuse to cut education spending."
"However, the report accepts the Bologna Process, which has increased the stranglehold of big business and furthered the process of commodification of education."
"The rapporteur referred to the fact that universities are underfunded, and therefore called for them to look for more funding from private sources."
"Surely the answer to underfunding is not to invite in the private sector with all the distorting effect that has on education, or to impose fees that block access to hundreds of thousands across Europe, but for state investment to provide free well-funded education at all levels."
"Furthermore, as a result of the brutal austerity, in many countries, it is virtually impossible for young people to get a decent job after finishing education."
"A quarter of young people in Ireland are now unemployed and 1 000 people emigrate every week, so for many Irish families, the very notion of Youth on the Move has a very different meaning."
"This unemployment crisis can only be solved on the basis of massive state investment to create decent jobs."
"Mr President, just when responsible people and governments are watching every penny, the Commission proposes more expense - Youth on the Move card, European skills passport, European Vacancy Monitor - through Europe 2020, all for cultural diplomacy and to get young people to travel when they do that already, backpacking their way round the world on their own initiative."
"What do we need expensive promotions for?"
"As for spreading European culture, well make the most of it, because the way this crazy EU is going, there will be none left, just a meaningless mantra: 'United in Diversity'."
"Do you not understand that Europe is not a single state but a wide and glorious tapestry of attractive, distinctive but matching cultural panels, and to amalgamate them is to reduce them all to a grey amorphous mass, thereby destroying that which you say you admire?"
"Do not push EU culture; make Italian, German, French, Dutch, British and all the other cultures available for all who want to sample them, and the rest will follow."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since the digitisation of cultural and artistic assets, I believe that the question is the following: is Europe destined to become a land of consumption for the United States, and soon for emerging countries, or will it finally wake up and put resources towards developing its informational, cultural but also economic potential?"
"Naturally, I firmly believe in the richness and diversity of European culture, but I am talking today from a perspective of competitiveness to condemn a piece of nonsense and an absurdity."
"The piece of nonsense is free services that some people dream of, access to everything for nothing."
"If we were to go down that road, there would be no more investment in this sector."
"Creators and inventors would not be able to receive fair remuneration and they would gradually disappear."
"Therefore, the economic models that we are going to implement for the online movement of our cultural heritage exclude services that are free of charge."
"The absurdity is the tax applied to dematerialised cultural assets from two aspects."
"First of all, there is a VAT distortion depending on the countries where the activity is based."
"For instance, American platforms have been enjoying a moratorium since 1998, which has led to their extraordinary boom."
"Secondly, there is a discrimination in VAT rates which penalises digital goods in relation to physical goods."
"I think that we need to address these two issues through legislation."
"(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I also welcome the opportunity that the debate we are holding gives us, a debate about four reports that we are going to vote on at the end of this morning's session."
"These are reports that I think deal with issues that are very important to address, to try to provide solutions to the central problems in the European Union; reports that deal with how to address early school leaving, youth unemployment, the economic crisis and migratory movements."
"In this regard, firstly, I would like to make a brief comment about early childhood education."
"As Mrs Honeyball said, I believe it is one of the issues that has not been given the attention it deserves."
"We know - and every day we have more studies that confirm it - that it is during early childhood that the most intense development of our cognitive and emotional abilities takes place."
"For this reason, all the studies say that investing in the first years of life produces much better results than doing it later."
"I believe that it is time, beyond focusing on university studies or on professional training, as we have been doing, for us to concentrate on early childhood learning."
"Another report that seems very important to me is Youth on the Move, one of the main aims of which is to address early school leaving."
"I believe that this issue is absolutely connected to youth unemployment, with the very high percentage of unemployment that we have in our Union."
"We must provide answers for the future of these young people, who are the future of the European Union."
"To conclude, with regard to the report on the cultural dimensions of the EU's external actions, I would like to highlight the importance of culture in our cooperation policies."
"It is important to create a better mutual understanding with third countries and, in these times of great upheaval to the south of our borders, I believe it makes a lot of sense to answer these questions."
"Mr President, 'if you want to know where hell is, ask the artist, and if you cannot find the artist, you know you are in hell'."
"I think this quote, which I found by an anonymous author in Sarajevo, summarises the importance of arts and culture not only for open societies but also for our relations with the rest of the world."
"Bosnia and Herzegovina, with Sarajevo as its capital, belongs to one of the black holes on the European map, and this is due to our history."
"Now, however, we have to look to the future."
"The people of Sarajevo have come close to knowing hell, especially during the siege of that city, and arts and culture have helped people there to survive."
"The orchestra rehearsed while the city was being shelled, and the winter festival full of arts and culture continued."
"Sarajevo deserves a European spring."
"The next generation suffers from the wounds of history, and we have an important responsibility as Europeans to look to the future with them and to include them in the European horizon."
"I fully support Ms Pack's initiative and I want to ask Parliament to support it and to do everything we can to include Sarajevo as a European cultural capital."
"I believe that, if we all want this, it absolutely can be possible, because it would be very disappointing if our ideas and common sense were to be blocked by bureaucracy."
"(PL) Mr President, the parts of Mrs Schaake's report which speak about the need to increase the mobility of young people from European neighbouring countries are very important."
"While, on the one hand, it seems to me that over-involvement of the European Union in cultural activity in the Member States is not necessary, I think, on the other, that in view of what is happening today in Tunisia, but also in view of the events of two months ago in Belarus, it is important that the European Union, with its cultural message and its message about democracy and the rule of law, addresses itself to the young elite of neighbouring countries, and that money is found for youth exchanges, joint courses of study, travel, the establishment of universities and support for teaching programmes."
"Such programmes do exist in the Member States - at the Centre for East European Studies in the University of Warsaw in Poland, for example."
"This should be seen as an example, and it is to be welcomed that Mrs Schaake is pointing us in this direction today."
"Without this, we will not be able to achieve anything."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, visitors in the gallery, it is a great honour for me, perhaps no longer as a youngster, but still as a new Member of this House, to be speaking here for the first time."
"I would like to characterise the flagship Youth on the Move initiative, part of the Europe 2020 programme, as an excellent objective for the greatest possible improvement of the entry of young people into the labour market, with two main emphases."
"As well as early years education, it targets, firstly, the reduction of school drop-out rates and, secondly, increasing the number of graduates."
"As a result, to a not inconsiderable degree, of the setbacks caused by the economic crisis, but also, and above all, as a result of structural deficiencies in many - almost all - Member States in other areas, the Member States of the EU have completely different prerequisites."
"Allow me to cite my own home country as an example: Austria has a school drop-out rate of just 8.7%, as compared to the EU average of around 14%, and it would certainly be worth examining Austria's dual system of vocational training, which is supported by the social partners."
"Germany, too, is very successful in this area."
"Let us take that as the benchmark."
"Austria itself, however, should strive to achieve a benchmark when it comes to the unsatisfactory number of highly qualified graduates there."
"There are considerably higher numbers of qualified academics in other Member States, and we should study their systems."
"There is much that we can learn from each other in these areas."
"The failures demonstrate very clearly that there is a need for action - we need to overcome the gulf between the education system and the labour market quickly and efficiently."
"In closing, however, I would just like to offer my sincere thanks to Mrs Pack and to support her when I say that having Sarajevo as a European Capital of Culture is not a derogation, it is a must!"
"Mr Becker, I did not want to cut you off as I know it is your first speech in this House and I wish to welcome you."
"I hope that in the future, the allotted time can be adhered to but, in any case, I wish you great success in your work as a Member among us."
"(RO) Mr President, there are countries in the European Union which have a national unemployment rate of 20%, but a youth unemployment rate of 40%."
"It is not the case in just one country, but in very many countries, where the average youth unemployment rate is twice the average national level."
"If we are talking about European integration or the future of these programmes and projects which we have in mind here, all these young people must feel European."
"All these young people must also find their future within the European Union's borders."
"This is why I strongly feel that we ought to talk much more about providing young people with access to jobs and about the future these young people have in the European Union when we mention the 'Youth on the Move' programme."
"I believe that the solutions we are providing to these issues are not good enough and that we should focus much greater attention on the way in which Member States implement the projects and programmes which we have in mind here."
"I believe that the European Commission's role is to encourage more Member States to implement these programmes properly and meet young people's needs."
"(SL) Mr President, at a time when cultural differences between nations are leading bureaucrats to close borders - as most recently demonstrated by the Danes - and build high walls, they prefer to leave conflicts to be resolved with arms rather than with understanding and compassion."
"At a time when artistic achievements are becoming single-use goods and a major source of profit, when all-powerful global monopolies are being created, which are dictating trends and values, the report on the cultural dimension of our External Action Service and the cultural dimension of the European Union as a whole is more than just welcome."
"The report talks us through the ways in which our common cultural image and the artistic achievements of small nations and Member States of the European Union in contact with the cultures of other nations can raise the standard of our public debate and even ease our diplomats' and strategists' burden in finding solutions to innumerable crises, at home and around us."
"By refusing to observe borders, new media and new technologies are opening up immense opportunities in the process."
"I would have liked the report to have devoted a word or two to books, to the idea, for example, that books should not be subject to taxation."
"We could speak of cultural management or about giving a new impetus to the one-time idea of Melina Mercouri for a European Capital of Culture."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, let us give Sarajevo a chance!"
"(PL) Mr President, the process of early childhood education is one of the most important duties both of parents and the state."
"In this context, it is important and appropriate that the resolution stresses the significance of the early teaching of regional and minority languages."
"Of particular importance is teaching using the mother tongue as the medium of instruction, because it is known that the language in which children think is also the one in which they more successfully assimilate knowledge."
"Therefore, it is unacceptable that in schools for indigenous national minorities, instruction in a language other than the mother tongue should be introduced from the first and second years, something which was recently decided by the Lithuanian Parliament."
"The compulsory introduction of bilingual instruction is understood unequivocally by the Poles who have lived in Lithuania for over seven centuries as discrimination which should be brought to an end."
"(FR) Mr President, I am very sorry to hear the consequences of the earthquake in your country."
"(SK) I would like to applaud the work of Mary Honeyball on the early years learning report."
"I can sense from the text the effort that has been made to overcome ideological prejudices and find a compromise across the political spectrum."
"This is right and proper, as it involves the family and the well-being of children."
"Parents have the main responsibility for raising and educating their children."
"This is also confirmed by the references made by the rapporteur to the articles of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child."
"The responsibility of parents is also mentioned in the General Declaration of Human Rights - parents have a preferential right to choose the type of education for their children."
"I also share the belief that investment in education and in early years learning will bring a return in future prosperity."
"There is evidence that children already develop the foundations of responsibility, understanding and social behaviour in their early years."
"The report also emphasises that caring for young people is the best way to prevent future juvenile criminality."
"I go into these factors in greater depth in the report prepared on the contribution made to the fight against juvenile criminality by policies on gender equality and parental responsibility."
"Just like the rapporteur, I, too, am opposed to artificially increasing the percentage of women on the labour market at any price."
"Many mothers would prefer to care for their young children rather than have formal employment."
"They do not have the freedom to choose, however, as society places little if any value on the work of women in the home and in caring for children."
"The submitted report contains no proposals for states to place a financial value on the work of mothers in raising and educating children, at least in proportion to the contributions states make to the running of pre-school facilities."
"The report as a whole is a step in the right direction, and future social developments will oblige us to pay more attention to this topic."
"(EL) Mr President, the 'Youth on the Move' initiative focuses on strengthening the mobility of young people, mainly for the purpose of employment."
"However, in times of economic crisis and when values are being questioned, the mobility of young people cannot be linked solely to preventing unemployment."
"With conservative trends threatening the unity of the European Union, and we heard some of them this morning, the mobility of young people can be used as an important instrument for strengthening European cohesion."
"The needs of the market should be taken into account as a secondary factor."
"However, universities should maintain their independence and public character and their courses should retain their academic and research-based orientation."
"Higher education in the European Union should not be confined to reproducing models which created both the crisis and the loss of confidence."
"On the contrary, they should aim to create new standards of social cohesion and collectivity which the humanities and a European system of university classification based on them can develop in the right direction."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, visitors, the cultural diversity of Europe is an important commodity that we need to preserve and even develop in future."
"In order to make that possible, we need to face the challenges of the digital age not only in the information and knowledge society, but also, above all, in the cultural and creative sector."
"Cultural diversity is not just an ideal; it is also a significant economic factor."
"Around five million people in the European Union are employed in the cultural sector."
"That equates to around 2.5% of the total population."
"The cultural sector is a growth sector that is developing faster than many other areas in the economy."
"The development of information and communications technologies is driven just as much by the content offered by the cultural sector as the nature and quality of that content have been changed and developed through technology."
"We therefore need a framework for the cultural and creative sector within which it can develop sustainably in the face of the challenges of the digital age."
"We need a modern, accessible and legally certain system in which everyone can develop on an equal footing."
"The cultural and creative sector is a driver for Europe."
"We therefore need to pay some attention to this area, including when it comes to education and training."
"We need to provide young people with cultural and creative skills - including within the scope of lifelong learning."
"However, we also need to improve the business skills of our creative artists and to give them a sound media grounding in new technologies."
"We need to create a framework within which those engaged in the cultural sector can safeguard their livelihoods."
"We therefore need to work intensively on the issues of copyright, social security and intellectual property, but also on open access to information and content, in order to ensure the continued development of the creative and cultural sector in the future in a digital environment and in order to enable us to retain cultural diversity and the cultural heritage of Europe as a significant distinguishing feature of the European Union."
"Mrs Verheyen, during your speech, the interpreters indicated to me that they could not keep up with you."
"I did not interrupt you as it seemed to me difficult to do so and I apologise to the interpreters for this."
"I want to inform the Members that the system is changing so that instead of lighting the warning signal to the President, it will be lit for each of you when you are speaking."
"In this way, you can directly see that the interpretation teams cannot keep up with you."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, 'Life is beautiful, my love."
"You look out on the world and it is already yours'."
"These first lines of a simple poem show how great life is, and remind us that we are responsible for the world we are building for our children."
"In the report presented, Mrs Honeyball offers a timely reminder that the future of our children is shaped right from the very first years of their life, years in which institutions must take on a key role if our children are to grow up as we wish."
"I agree with all the points made by the report: it is important that the Member States and the Union should shoulder responsibility for measures to support children's early learning, but they must claim a role that cannot be solely delegated to parents, or to those who work in the education sector."
"As I always maintain at meetings of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, parents living in poverty mean children raised in poverty."
"Children have the right to receive help and services from Member States and from the Union."
"If we are to overcome poverty, social exclusion and illiteracy, we must support our children from their first steps."
"To this end, we must invest in care and education from the earliest childhood, and monitor the services provided and the proficiency of providers."
"All children must be able to access education, regardless of social background, and we must ensure that this opportunity is also available to the children of asylum seekers, refugees and all those who have permission, even if only temporary, to reside within the Union."
"Mrs Honeyball emphasises research and the exchange of best practices, the wise use of Structural Funds and programmes such as Comenius, and, finally, the need for the States to reclaim their crucial role in the earliest years of children's education, to ensure that objectives for smart, inclusive and sustainable growth are met."
"(CS) Mr President, the report on early years learning is not and cannot be an attempt at the unified arrangement of this highly individual matter."
"I see it, however, as an important contribution to the debate on common European aims and values in pre-school education."
"The research in this area emphasises the significant role which pre-school care has for the healthy development of children and their further integration into society."
"It seems that pre-school education has a positive effect also on the further education of the child, and that investing in early years learning in the broadest sense of the word is more effective than any later intervention."
"It is therefore in our interest to support this type of education, also with a view to achieving, among other things, the objectives of the EU 2020 strategy and increasing the number of inhabitants with a high quality university education, while at the same time reducing the proportion of people who do not complete their studies."
"High quality pre-school education can bring us much closer to these objectives, perhaps more than we are willing to admit at the moment."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank Mrs Honeyball for the work she has done."
"Ensuring that all children have access to education and support structures in their earliest childhood must become a right both for parents, especially for mothers, but, above all, for children themselves, because it means that they can lay solid foundations for their education, be supported in their social integration and personal development, and have a better chance of finding a job once they become adults."
"More generally - as other fellow Members have reiterated - the Commission's Communication on the EU strategy on the Rights of the Child states that, in 2009, more than 6 million young people dropped out of the school system, having barely completed lower secondary education and, of these, 17.4% did not go beyond primary school."
"These figures are worrying and lead one to think that the school and educational system is often neglected and does not receive the investment it needs."
"Investing in the quality of education, right from the first years of life, represents not only an essential starting point for a child's cognitive, sensory and motor development, but is also a prerequisite for building an inclusive society that offers a wealth of opportunities for future generations."
"In addition, the improvement in the quality and number of nursery schools and structures for early childhood - as provided for in the objectives set out in the conclusions of the European Council meeting in Barcelona - allows working parents to balance home life and work."
"Unfortunately, however, the statistics show that many Member States still have a long way to go before they reach these objectives."
"Mr President, Youth on the Move contains many encouraging initiatives."
"These include, in particular, plans for a European student lending facility, the European Youth Guarantee, to ensure that young people are in either training or employment within four months of leaving school, and the recently announced Youth at Work plan, designed to build contacts between young people and businesses."
"However, I feel obliged to urge a note of caution."
"In 2010, EU countries achieved just one out of five benchmarks set for education, and that does not augur well for Europe 2020."
"If Youth on the Move is to enjoy better success, its implementation and progress will have to be closely monitored on the ground and by Members of this House in our constituencies."
"(PL) Mr President, today's discussion is one of the most important and significant discussions to be held in the European Parliament."
"It concerns the entire culture and education sector, and, therefore, the foundation which permanently underpins our vast European home."
"We must remember this and attach enormous importance to this discussion, bearing in mind that not everything has been given us forever."
"We have to know that this huge European home, if it is to be a strong one, must have a strong foundation and be resistant to further potential crises and perhaps great changes which cannot be ruled out and may be waiting for us."
"So I wanted to thank all the rapporteurs for these very good reports and, in particular, both Mr Zver and Mrs Honeyball, because for the first time, we are taking a comprehensive approach to education."
"We want to give outstanding and wide-ranging abilities to all our children, starting from the earliest years until they are in tertiary education."
"Today, if we want European society to be mobile and young people to be open, sensitive and competent, we should have a responsible approach to the whole area of education, and, after all, the indicators we have at present are alarmingly poor."
"One third of the citizens of Europe do not have any vocational qualifications."
"As for the cultural dimension, I would like to thank the Commissioner for the information that the European External Action Service is going to have ambassadors and cultural attachés in all the countries of the world."
"I would like to thank Mrs Sanchez-Schmid, because support for culture means, above all, support for the business connected with culture, but, in particular, it means support for the inner aspect of culture."
"This is why cultural undertakings must have administrative support and need a reduction of bureaucracy in administrative systems, but they also need support with raising capital, which may also come from Union funds."
"We share this mission together, and this is why, as I close, I would like to ask the Commissioner to relate this serious and important discussion to the Council, which is absent today, so that in the forum of the Council, too, it will be possible to discuss these important tasks for Europe."
"(SK) Mr President, as the shadow rapporteur in the Committee on Regional Development for the report on unlocking the potential of cultural and creative industries, I consider it important that the cultural and creative industries have been recognised as an instrument for local and regional development."
"Plenty of regions are still lagging behind - for reasons that include the financial crisis - and cultural and creative projects will certainly help towards creating jobs and making these regions competitive."
"It is important for Member States, regions and local authorities to make the best possible use of EU programmes supporting culture and creativity, political cohesion, structural policy and others."
"The definition of the funding options is important for the cultural and creative industries."
"Funding is the greatest obstacle to growth for many businesses."
"It is therefore also important for private capital and public/private partnerships to be brought into culture and the creative industries, as the rapporteur requests, and to emphasise the importance of sponsorship."
"I support the motion for a resolution."
"(GA) Mr President, it is great that we are discussing this important matter this morning and it shows how serious we are about cultural and educational matters."
"Culture and education are intrinsically valuable in themselves."
"Both have a huge part to play in creating a united Europe and in the development of our economies as we move forward."
"The initiatives we are discussing here this morning would facilitate that."
"Youth on the Move is a wonderful initiative."
"Many have benefited from it already and will do so into the future, but one thing is vital and that is that there is mutual recognition in all Member States of qualifications and diplomas."
"This would facilitate greater movement, but also raise the standard in each of the institutions."
"I also have to say - mea culpa - that I am a late convert to early childhood education."
"Like many, I thought it was basically a babysitting service, but now I know that it is the best investment and it gives the best return for investment in education at any level."
"Certainly it reflects an old Irish saying, 'well begun is half done', and it can be done at early childhood level."
"I also want to emphasise the importance of intellectual property rights (IPR), in particular, for actors."
"Many of them are living on the breadline and they deserve to benefit from their genius and this certainly can be done by protecting the IPR online and offline environments."
"I also want to put on my sporting hat and say that sport is a very important part of culture and education as well."
"I have called for an indigenous festival of sport in Europe."
"If we do that, then we can contribute greatly to sport as part of our culture."
"There, under the one roof, was a music school which involved production, performance, education, the creation of instruments, etc. This is something that could be emulated in other places."
"(ES) Mr President, allow me to join in the words of support for the residents of Lorca, in Spain, that have been affected by this natural disaster."
"It is a land that has demonstrated its support many times and it will be able to appreciate the support shown by the European Parliament today."
"Commissioner, in 1989, the then President of the Commission, Jacques Delors, stated that education and culture should be the soul of Europe."
"We now know that it is not only the soul, but the heart and muscles of Europe."
"Without equal opportunities, which improve the opportunities of all children and all young Europeans, without social cohesion, which provides education, without the ability to compete, which contributes to the spread of knowledge among all citizens, the European Union will be weak."
"However, with all of that and culture, it will have the place it deserves in the world."
"Mr President, in 2014, it will be 100 years since the murder of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, which triggered the start of the First World War."
"It was also in Bosnia and Herzegovina that we had a bloody war in Europe in the 1990s."
"It is important to mark those tragic events, which led to many deaths, suffering, division and horrors, but it is even more important to mark and celebrate European unity and peace today."
"Sarajevo is a city which, despite everything that happened, has maintained its multicultural spirit and strength."
"In order to recognise this, it would be a strong symbolic gesture to name Sarajevo European Capital of Culture 2014, to reaffirm Europe's message of peace and stability."
"It is a pity to miss out on this historic momentum by turning to the rules."
"It is only when we deal with our past, when we recognise and face history, that we can look openly to the future, so please give Sarajevo this possibility."
"(HU) Mr President, for an ageing Europe, it is vital that all young people make the most of their talents and succeed in the labour market later on This requires an education that, already in early childhood, aims to balance the disparity of opportunities; one that pays special attention to providing education, professional training, and employment advantages to every young person, irrespective of their financial situation, social and ethnic background, and disabilities or perhaps other health problems."
"The 2020 strategy aims to raise the level of tertiary education to 40% and to reduce the share of early school leavers to 10%."
"To achieve this goal, every Member State must aim to go in this direction."
"There are places where nowadays, we see exactly opposing tendencies: a decrease in the age limit for compulsory education and a reduction in the number of state-funded higher education places."
"Europe's future sustainable growth and innovative capacity can be guaranteed only if everyone contributes their own efforts, and if every country travels along the same path."
"(ES) Mr President, I, too, of course, would like to add my support for the residents of Lorca."
"In this debate about education, I want to reiterate an important point: the need to include in secondary school studies a specific subject covering the history, aims and workings of the European Union."
"I have already talked about this issue in the last term, in plenary, after the failure of Constitutional Treaty referenda."
"Fortunately, last year in this House, the Løkkegaard report on journalism and new media, approved in September, supported the introduction of this subject in paragraph 13."
"I myself submitted an amendment in this regard."
"Recently in Spain, the Valencia regional government decided to include a subject for the next academic year."
"It is an initiative that other regions and countries should follow."
"I understand that the Commission, of course, supports and welcomes initiatives of this type."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we only value, we only appreciate ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(PL) Mr President, Youth on the Move is one of the most important initiatives of the Europe 2020 strategy."
"We must promote economic growth based on modern technologies, which can only be created by educated people."
"We must give the right support to children and young people."
"Foreign language instruction, sports and cultural activities, voluntary work and youth exchanges - these are programmes which should be accessible to children and young people in all regions of the European Union."
"We must bring about an improvement in educational standards and reduce disparities - at all levels of education, from nursery to university - in every region of the European Union."
"In the opinion of Professor Jacek Kochanowicz, a lack of the ability to cooperate is one of the greatest problems for the development of Poland and the European Union - we must change this, too."
"Human capital comes from education, and social capital comes from trust between people."
"Investing in educational and cultural programmes ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(PT) Mr President, first of all, we should look at the context in which we are having this debate."
"We need to compare the fine words we are hearing here on the importance of culture and education with the reality."
"The irrefutable reality is of a sharp divestment in these areas; a retreat of the state that threatens its social role and has the result of exacerbating inequalities in access to education, to knowledge and to culture."
"The result is the multiplication and deepening of social inequalities."
"The reality in Member States such as Portugal is the closure of thousands of schools, thousands of teachers being without a job or a secure job, and the chronic underfunding of the state higher-education system and the increased cost of attending it."
"The reality is that budgets for culture are being slashed to penury levels."
"Let us not, therefore, ignore this reality that investment is urgently needed: all the more so if the shameful and obscurantist intervention plan drawn up by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the European Central Bank (ECB) and European Commission is implemented."
"(EL) Mr President, I should like to express my sympathy with your compatriots; we look on Spain as a friend and sympathise whenever anything happens there."
"The 'Youth on the Move' report is one of the most important initiatives included in the EU 2020 strategy for promoting and providing more opportunities for education and training for young people and helping them to make the transition from education to the labour market."
"Education, lifelong learning, innovation and culture certainly lead to progress."
"There is a Greek proverb which says that heads make capital, not the other way round, which is why we must identify, highlight and develop the skills and abilities of our young people, which we can do if we ensure that they can find employment in keeping with their qualifications and skills."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, these reports are at best bestrewn with paradoxes and at worst are full of hypocrisy."
"They talk approvingly of diversity, but welcome the eradication of diversity between nations."
"The diversity that they promote within Member States involves the promotion of the cultures of recent arrivals, which are anything but European."
"As populations change, so will their cultures."
"Indigenous cultures will be displaced and lost."
"They talk about freedom of expression but are only convincing when they express their intolerance of those with whom they disagree."
"They want to promote only cultural values of which they approve; those consistent with so-called 'European' values."
"In the political sphere, we saw on Tuesday this Parliament's attitude to freedom of expression when it voted to hand over a Member of this House for a show trial in France for a thought-crime offence, without even being given the opportunity to defend himself."
"(FR) Mr President, the present situation of young people in Europe is very worrying - as you are aware - since there are five million young people out of work."
"Today, I am delighted with the European Commission's ambition to want to democratise young people's access in Europe."
"However, I believe that we have to go beyond this 'Youth on the Move' programme and, above all, avoid the trap of wanting every young person to go to university."
"We need to be relevant to all groups of young people, including those who are the furthest removed from the European Union and especially, of course, apprentices."
"It is with this in mind, I believe, that we should urgently introduce a genuine mobility programme for these target groups, in addition to the Leonardo programme."
"I think that the Erasmus name, the Erasmus hallmark, should be used for all the programmes and in a variety of forms, in particular, for apprentices, so that we have the necessary ambitions to achieve our aims."
"The second issue is that of funding."
"We must put in the resources because, as many of you have pointed out, youth and education should be the top priority for the Union's future."
"(PT) Mr President, this is an opportunity for an extraordinary commitment to the social mobility of young people and a decisive commitment to training a generation with an open worldview; a generation with skills that, because it has global vision and thinking, is capable of contributing to its regions' development and to Europe's progress."
"This is because, if all young Europeans have the experience of study, of a work placement or of employment in a different country, they will not just acquire more skills, greater independence and better vision, but they will, above all, gain enormous added value from contact with other young Europeans and exchanging experiences with them."
"More than ever, Europe needs a generation of Europeans who know and trust each other, and who know and trust Europe, in order to carry the project forward."
"Therefore, allow everyone from Fajã Grande in the Azores, Europe's westernmost point, to participate."
"We must ensure that no one be left out for financial reasons."
"(SK) Mr President, the report on early years learning includes a mention of the work experience approach to education for children from poorer families."
"Of these, the rapporteur identifies children from Roma families, who have very little access to early years learning, as the most at-risk group."
"It is therefore very important for Member States to create specific conditions for access to early years learning for children whose families do not, for various reasons, provide them with the sort of material and family support that would enable them to take part in the standard education system without major problems."
"Special care for children from the more at-risk groups, however, must be provided in a very sensitive way, in order to avoid stigmatising these children or families, which might increase the risk of their social exclusion."
"We must therefore systematically modify and improve the special care mechanisms for these children, so that we can successfully integrate as many children as possible from at-risk groups into our society."
"(DE) Mr President, the first three years of a child's life are crucial for the development of the brain and for language learning."
"Without a certain level of language acquisition, further learning is scarcely possible, as the language deficits can only be overcome with great difficulty with increasing age."
"The report observes that most immigrant children in the EU are educated without adequate linguistic knowledge."
"At the same time, it declares that migrant families and minorities such as the Roma make much less use of the early years education offered than other families."
"We cannot allow it to be the case that the level of our schools continues to fall and fall because so many children quite simply cannot understand the teaching."
"In other words, every child - migrant or not - must have mastered the national language by the time they enter school to a degree that enables them to follow the teaching taking place there."
"(PL) Mr President, the work on creating a European early years learning framework based on shared goals and values points us in the right direction for the harmonisation of our education systems."
"Stressing the importance of the first years of life in a person's subsequent development and emphasising the potential inherent in early childhood is extremely important in the context of implementation of the 2020 strategy."
"To my mind, the subject we are discussing is exceptionally relevant to the current situation."
"In my country, a new law entered into force last month on forms of care for children up to three years old."
"The new law extends the range of childcare facilities and introduces several new forms of care: children's clubs, day carers, legal nannies and workplace nurseries."
"These changes are meant to create favourable conditions for the proper development of children."
"The variety of educational possibilities allows this development to be assisted and stimulated in all areas while making use of the child's own natural potential."
"Opening workplace nurseries will make it easier for parents to return to the labour market after a longer break."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, when referring to Youth on the Move, we are talking about money, but first of all we are talking about the future."
"Innovation, creativity, employability are topics that are really important for all of us in the European Union."
"It is good that the Commission has focused on this crucial moment of entering into the labour market, which is exactly what I would like to focus on too."
"Young people are confronted with the sad reality, with the bad working conditions of internships today, even with exploitation."
"And, of course, there is the stigma, when entering into the labour market, of wondering 'am I really needed?' when there are such high unemployment rates."
"That really is my huge topic right now, so I urge the Commissioner to please keep on track and focus also on the future, to create something like a statute for internships which establishes rules against exploitation ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to start by expressing the Commission's sympathy for, and solidarity with, the people of Lorca and its neighbourhood."
"As a child, I experienced a very strong earthquake in my home city, and I know how horrible the experience is."
"As Europeans, we should not be satisfied with the situation of the European education system."
"We cannot accept that one in seven of our young people leaves school without the skills and qualifications that he or she needs in order to find employment and have a fulfilling life."
"Nor do I accept that one in five of our young children cannot read properly."
"We have to really give our full attention to our education systems."
"We have to strengthen them by strengthening our mobility programmes, because through mobility, young children, students, workers and volunteers get the transversal skills that they cannot get through formal education."
"I think that cutting our budgets on education is a very short-sighted policy."
"Once again, I plead with the Member States and governments not to do that, especially in times of crisis, because this will have very negative repercussions in the future."
"We must work together to ensure that, in the next multiannual financial framework, the provision for education and mobility is higher than at present, because that is what we need in order to exit the crisis and give meaning to our people."
"One honourable Member made a reference to subsidiarity."
"Let me assure you that all our policies and all our recommendations on education and culture fully recognise, and comply with, subsidiarity rules."
"We do not dictate to Member States."
"We simply make recommendations to Member States."
"We give them the platform to work together to exchange good practices and to learn from each other."
"Cultural and creative industries are important - as many of you have mentioned - as a motor for development and for job creation."
"However, let us also remember that these creative and cultural industries have a value per se."
"Creativity and culture are values of the European Union which we have strengthened and have to maintain."
"After analysing the input that we have received on this topic from all the stakeholders, and following the public consultation with the stakeholders, we are about to put forward recommendations on how we should strengthen and support cultural and creative industries in order to develop and produce the results that we expect them to."
"Regarding the external dimension of culture - culture in our external relations - I think we have a responsibility to do this."
"Let us not forget that we have all signed and adopted the UNESCO Convention on Cultural Diversity."
"We have to work with all the countries which have adopted the convention in order to ensure that it is implemented."
"Let me stress that such cultural exchanges with the outside world will be beneficial not only for them, but also for us, because we are enriching our culture, our knowledge, and our values in the world."
"Finally, I have taken note of the strong support that you all expressed for Sarajevo getting the title for the 2014 Capital of Culture."
"Mr President, thank you for having conducted this debate with as much democracy and generosity as to enable many of my fellow Members to participate."
"The debate has, above all, been a high quality one and it has focused on the following: we want to strengthen and maintain our current mobility programmes which are part of the lifelong learning and Youth on the Move programmes."
"Our message to Member States is that they should pay more attention to, and also invest more money in, youth policies which span several sectors."
"We also want this debate to yield a further benefit; we want Member States to continue reforming their education systems and social policies, as well as their markets and the like."
"I would like to respond to one objection which cropped up during the debate."
"The Youth on the Move dossier does not focus very much on the importance of the market; we actually wanted to avoid that question altogether, but we have emphasised in several places that education systems need to adapt to the needs of society and the economy, and that this large gulf, this large gap, should be reduced as much as possible and that young people should be enabled to enter the labour market with as few obstacles as possible."
"Interestingly, that is precisely what the youth organisations pointed out during the preparation of the report."
"By way of conclusion, I would briefly like to emphasise the following: let us make use of all this positive energy that we have here in the European Parliament, the temple of European democracy, as well as in the European Commission, and let us do everything to ensure this report does not remain merely a dead letter."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, I should like to thank everyone for the helpful and constructive way that we have conducted this debate today."
"The overwhelming majority of you, with only one or two notable exceptions, were very much in favour of my report on early years learning and the other reports we debated today."
"I think we have really put down a marker for the future that education is extremely important."
"It is not only important for children, for the very young children I have been talking about and the young people that my colleague has been talking about, but it is also important for the future of Europe."
"I therefore strongly support what the Commissioner has said, that Member States should now continue to invest in education and should not be using the economic climate to make cuts, because making cuts in education would be the worse possible thing to do."
"Education is about our future, it is about having adults who are employable, who are fit, who are healthy, who are not a drain on our social services."
"We understand that and we have got to convey that message back to our Member States so that they can exercise their subsidiarity to make sure that what we have been talking about here is actually put into practice."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, I am coming back to you with some concrete next steps on the report on the role of culture in the EU's external actions that we talked about this morning."
"I want to start with a quote from a Hungarian diplomat in the United States, Mr Simonyi, who said that 'rock and roll, culturally speaking, was a decisive element in loosening up communist societies and bringing them closer to the world of freedom'."
"When we look, in particular, at today's uprisings of the young generation in North Africa and the Middle East, we can see that, today, an open Internet is that decisive element for moving into the world of freedom."
"We need an Internet freedom strategy to facilitate free expression, press freedom, access to information and access to cultural and educational content."
"This is a priority, but there are many more concrete suggestions in the report, for which the foundations are already laid down in both the Lisbon Treaty and the ratification of the UNESCO conventions."
"They now need practical implementation."
"The External Action Service should coordinate the work of different Directorates-General and create a Directorate-General for cultural and digital diplomacy."
"EEAS staff should be trained, and a cultural attaché is needed in each EU representation."
"There needs to be coordination, streamlining and mainstreaming through an interinstitutional taskforce which should report back to the European Parliament."
"We ask the Commission to adopt a Green Paper in 2011, followed by a communication on a strategy for cultural cooperation in the EU's external actions."
"We also call for capacity-building through the funding of initiatives independent of government, and we want to promote EU cultural activities in the rest of the world on line also."
"Existing programmes, such as the European Neighbourhood Policy and the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights, have cultural components which need to be coordinated and strategically deployed."
"We also need to protect and promote cultural heritage, such as through the Blue Shield programme, and we need to engage in cultural policy dialogues with third countries."
"Human rights should be respected, and cultural arguments can never be used to justify violations of human rights."
"I would recommend that colleagues read the report."
"I think that this debate shows that we need many more discussions on culture in the EU."
"Mr President, Commissioner, after all these speeches, I wish to thank my fellow Members, the shadow rapporteurs as well as the rapporteurs of the committees who produced opinions, who suggested to me many ideas and who have made it possible to improve the text that we are voting on today."
"I would now like to look further down the road with you."
"How are we going to follow up on this report?"
"We are asking the European Commission to draw up a White Paper, following on from its Green Paper, so as to perform a review leading to a genuine strategy for the creative and cultural industries."
"We are also eagerly awaiting legislative proposals on how cultural goods are taxed, on the governance of collective management societies, and on budget allocations for the programmes relating to culture, education and media."
"We must turn our ambitions into specific measures."
"Why not introduce straight away a reduced VAT for all cultural products, whether they use a physical medium or are online?"
"Disparities in taxation produce distortions that, without exception, run counter to the competitiveness of European companies."
"The Americans have had a competitive advantage for a long time thanks to a tax moratorium on these services."
"Will Europe do something about it?"
"Why not also consider a single price for digital books across Europe?"
"French politician, Edouard Herriot, once said: 'Culture is what we are left with when we have forgotten everything'."
"Nevertheless, culture can be quickly forgotten if we do not protect it, if we do not maintain it, if we are not interested in it."
"I hope that Europe will give itself the means to promote its culture, so that its model and heritage can exert influence, so that Europe can defend its identity and is able to grow its economy."
"I have received one motion for a resolutiontabled in accordance with Rule 115(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at noon."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"The future of the European Union rests on its young people, on their potential and ability to embrace the current EU project and take it to a new dimension of inclusion and cooperation between Member States."
"The first condition ensuring that the young people of today become Europe's citizens of tomorrow is for them to get to know one another."
"This means them coming into contact with as many cultures as possible within Europe, moving around freely and studying in as many Member States as possible."
"With this in mind, I think that lifelong learning programmes, such as Erasmus or Leonardo da Vinci, must receive more substantial financial support from the authorities in the coming years."
"Europe needs an ever-growing number of its school pupils and students to come into contact with a new social, educational and cultural model."
"I believe that the mobility programmes aimed at young people will successfully bring about a real change in the attitude of Europe's young people and create a shared vision for them about what Europe stands for, in areas from education, science and research to culture and our common values."
"This report sends a clear message: the European Union must incorporate a consistent and coordinated cultural strategy into its foreign policy."
"The bonds that unite more specifically Europe and the countries south of the Mediterranean are going through deep changes."
"A wind of freedom is blowing on the Arab world."
"Culture is a significant asset."
"It contributes to a living and long-lasting democracy."
"Cultural and educational exchanges encourage the emergence of an organised civil society."
"Cultural cooperation is also one of the keys to the Union's success for the Mediterranean. It leads nations to share and interact with one another, respect and better understand each other every day."
"Ever since the 1990s, the European Union has seen an exponential increase in cultural and creative industries (CCIs), in terms of the number of jobs they have created and their contribution to gross domestic product."
"The nature of these industries is twofold: from an economic perspective, they help generate jobs and growth, and from a cultural perspective, they facilitate the social integration of citizens."
"The Commission's Green Paper officially recognises the economic and social importance of this sector of the economy."
"However, whereas some of our international partners are already making extensive use of the many resources offered by CCIs, the European Union has not yet developed a strategy based on cultural activities."
"In my opinion, the challenges posed by globalisation offer these industries great opportunities for development, which are likely to increase economic and employment growth potential."
"In concrete terms, the ability of CCIs to boost social and territorial cohesion will depend on strategic investment."
"It will also be necessary to cooperate with local bodies, to pass on expertise and to exchange good practices."
"I also believe that the stronger safeguarding of intellectual property rights is an essential condition for protecting cultural diversity in Europe."
"The European Commission communication entitled 'Early Childhood Education and Care' (ECEC) is a welcome initiative, because it examines problems in children's education and aims to establish means of providing children with the best start for the world of tomorrow."
"However, in my opinion, this Commission document lacks analysis of research and data on children's education, care and social protection, taking into account information from all 27 European Union Member States."
"Furthermore, I would like to highlight the close link between socio-economic disadvantage and opportunities to educate and teach children from an early age, because families on low incomes are much less likely to use ECEC services."
"Consequently, later on, some of these young people are neither employed nor in education or training."
"I understand the Commission's efforts to encourage the Member States to exchange examples of good policy and practice, making use of the open method of coordination, but it would be much more useful and effective to draft and adopt common quality criteria."
"This would promote data collection and benchmarking in all European Union Member States, because data collection is particularly important for observing progress and measuring outcomes."
"I would like to point out that there is a particular lack of information on children from families with social problems, on children with special needs and disadvantaged children."
"This own-initiative report is devoted to the issue of the study mobility of young people, which arises from the 2020 strategy."
"It is undoubtedly right to increase the competitiveness of young people by creating conditions within the framework of university education for them to spend at least one year in another Member State."
"Mobility, a system of recognising credits and other measures will limit the growth in unemployment among young people, which stands at an average of 21% in the EU today, which is an alarming figure."
"Personally I very much welcome the appeal to the Commission and the Member States regarding support for voluntary activities, and for measures to be introduced in legislation that would make it possible to recognise voluntary activity by the unemployed as time spent working."
"This measure will lead, particularly with young people, to a strengthening of work habits, to greater competitiveness and to greater motivation in seeking work."
"In my opinion, it is no less important to have a permanent link between the requirements of the labour market and professional education, a link that has to be highly flexible in this regard, so that future graduates can be best placed on the labour market, bringing about a gradual reduction in unemployment among young people."
"I would like to emphasise my strong support for the 'Youth on the Move' framework, aimed at improving education systems and vocational training in Europe."
"I think that this is of paramount importance with a view to developing specific policies supporting youth mobility and facilitating a stable transition for them from the education system to employment."
"An important factor which needs to be considered is that young people are one of the social groups hit hard by the global economic crisis."
"We have a duty to support young people entering the labour market, both for their sakes and to support the European economy."
"Today's young people are the leaders of tomorrow."
"This is why it is vital for them to have the opportunity to develop their skills, abilities and knowledge now so that, in the near future, they can make an active contribution to the European Union's growth and development."
"We must lay the foundations for concrete policies which will support young people and provide them with greater mobility and opportunities to study abroad."
"The role of this mobility is not only to support the economy but, at the same time, to make an extremely important contribution to creating cultural cohesion at European level."
"I consider our discussion devoted to education and culture to be an important one, and would like to add an approach that so far has been missing from numerous important considerations."
"Mutual understanding and respect for one another are fundamental conditions for traditional national communities, minorities and majorities living together harmoniously and prosperously."
"Education plays a vital role here."
"If the history and literature of minority communities were taught in majority schools, and if minority education efforts were to include majority culture, communities living together would get along with each other more harmoniously."
"Language education also has a prominent role in cultural understanding."
"This is true not only in the process of learning world languages, but also in the relationship between majorities and minorities living alongside each other."
"I believe that it is not only minorities who should have to study the language of the majority, but also vice versa."
"Everybody could live a richer life, allowing mutual respect for one another to manifest itself."
"At the same time, in knowing each other's language, generations growing up would develop a much more positive attitude towards each other, allowing them to create relationships with their peers of the same age more easily, which would be decisive with regard to the future of these regions."
"And lastly, I find it important to mention the importance of a deep understanding of cultural heritage, so that communities living together can recognise and respect each other's cultural values."
"I believe that the concrete task of the Commission is to promote all of these issues, while that of Parliament is to strengthen theoretical and political support."
"Young people are the driving force of any society and its future."
"Their education, vocational training, qualifications and integration into the labour market provide the basis for achieving the Europe 2020 objectives aimed at smart, sustainable and inclusive growth."
"This is why I firmly believe that Europe must continue to invest in their development and initiatives like Erasmus, Leonardo and 'Youth on the Move' should be constantly developed further and made popular."
"Improving the quality of education and training, as well as young people's access to it, are important steps on the way to reducing unemployment and developing the European economy."
"Unfortunately, Europe still has regions and social groups where there are limited conditions for this."
"Efforts must be coordinated to resolve this problem."
"It is also important for education and training programmes to be more closely linked to business needs and to stimulate young people's potential and creativity so as to make them more competitive on the labour market."
"I support the efforts to encourage youth mobility, both during their education and in connection with their professional life."
"I think that this is an important condition for developing new skills and their self-awareness of their European identity."
"The cultural dimension of the EU's external actions is one which is important and very much needed."
"Around the world generally, European culture is seen as attractive and desirable."
"It is more difficult to find acceptance for European values."
"Working in the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, I have repeatedly experienced cultural differences and their consequences."
"As Europeans, we try systematically to promote values and principles which, for us, are fundamental and inalienable."
"This quite often meets with a lack of understanding from our partners."
"Some of them see in this nothing less than a kind of cultural imperialism."
"This is precisely why it is so difficult to persuade our partners that the values promoted by the European Union are not an attempt to impose our way of thinking on others."
"The fact that we try to spread our ideals, for example, in the field of human rights, follows simply from a moral imperative."
"We respect difference and diversity, but we cannot give up principles which we consider to be fundamental."
"We will not accept discrimination, and we will not give up the protection of human life and human dignity."
"On this, the Union is united and in full accord."
"I would like to congratulate Mr Honeyball on his excellent work, and for having noticed critical items that may not have received sufficient attention in the past."
"These include, in particular, recognising the connection between poverty, a disadvantaged situation, and poor school performance."
"I would like to remind my fellow Members that there is an additional connection: the disadvantaged situation is particularly pronounced in cases where the child is living with disabilities that the parents, who are inadequately informed, neither understand nor accept."
"I will pay careful attention to this problem in the report I am currently working on."
"The work carried out by Mrs Honeyball and, in particular, the adoption of a child-centred approach, will be an excellent reference base in the future."
"The draft report 'draws attention to the general importance of studies before entering school, with particular emphasis on language learning as well as multilingualism and linguistic diversity', which I support joyfully and enthusiastically."
"I agree that supporting the early development of disabled children and helping them acquire adequate linguistic competence is a basic human resources investment which represents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity."
"It is also important that in order to develop the linguistic competence of deaf children, they must first learn their mother tongue (sign language), which will allow them to become truly multilingual in the future."
"And this is an investment for reaching the EU2020 goals and for raising the level of employment, in order to achieve a more accessible, inclusive and sustainable society."
"Support for youth mobility, especially for young people from the countries of the Eastern Partnership and the Union for the Mediterranean, is particularly important in view of recent events in Belarus and North Africa."
"The processes of democratic transformation which are currently beginning in Egypt and Tunisia can be strengthened thanks to the EU's efforts to educate the citizens of these countries in the spirit of democracy and respect for the rule of law and human rights."
"Educated citizens are the greatest enemy of dictators and totalitarian regimes."
"The experiences of EU Member States can be used when organising such programmes."
"In Poland, for example, there is the Konstanty Kalinowski Scholarship Programme, which is operated, among others, by the Centre for East European Studies in the University of Warsaw - an international study centre which enables students from the East and the Balkans to study in Poland."
"The Union should also intensify efforts to establish a University of the Eastern Partnership, modelled on the Euro-Mediterranean University in Slovenia."
"The EU should support the initiatives of young and talented people to promote particular political strategies."
"A good example of such activity is the website Eastbook.eu, whose founders supply thousands of Internet users every day with information about events in the countries of the Eastern Partnership and the progress of the programme."
"The EU should also give support to young people from Member States for study visits to neighbourhood countries."
"This helps break down cultural barriers."
"Worthy of praise here is the Eurobus initiative - a journey around Ukraine organised every year for young people from the EU's Member States."
"The adoption in June last year of a new EU strategy, Europe 2020, is intended to help bring us out of the economic crisis and contribute to further development of the European Union."
"It is also a significant step in terms of maintaining and even increasing youth mobility."
"One of the priorities of the Europe 2020 strategy is the Youth on the Move initiative, the aim of which is to improve the results of our systems of education and make it easier for young people to enter the labour market."
"This aim is to be achieved, as the name suggests, by developing the idea of youth exchange and helping young people to acquire new skills."
"Statistical data show that currently, as many as 15% of young people end their education early, and in so doing gain qualifications which do not meet the needs of the labour market."
"In addition, only around a third of people have completed tertiary education, and this proportion is significantly lower than in the United States or Japan, for example."
"Therefore, one of the most important challenges facing the European Union is the need to give particular attention and financial support to these two problems."
"However, the situation will not improve if both the Commission and the Member States do not follow the guidelines contained in the Europe 2020 strategy."
"Youth mobility is a key to the further development of Europe, and if we aspire to the status of the world's most innovative economy, we must not neglect to invest in human capital, and particularly in young people."
"In the context of the current economic crisis, the EU needs a global strategy based on innovation and creativity, which will contribute to economic growth and job creation."
"This is precisely why the cultural and creative industries must be encouraged."
"Consequently, I think that we need to ensure at the moment in Europe that there is a greater distribution of creative works and free access is provided to them online without, however, ignoring the fact that the artists and their works must be protected and receive fair remuneration."
"With this in mind, we must set up a legislative framework capable of supporting the development of these industries and of instilling confidence in consumers and those operating in the digital market, as this sector may facilitate the creation of new jobs, thereby capitalising on the European Union's cultural diversity and its innovative potential."
"At the same time, I think that we need new business models which will support these industries, by leveraging the benefits offered by the single digital market."
"In conclusion, I believe that this report marks a first step in the development of this sector."
"However, the Commission and Member States must step up their efforts to turn the cultural and creative industries into a core sector of the European economy."
"I am pleased that, as part of the Europe 2020 strategy, we are focusing particular attention on young people, given the demographic challenges which our continent has to face."
"Against this background, 'Youth on the Move', a flagship initiative from the European Commission, offers concrete measures for raising the level of education and vocational training, including through mobility and facilitating access to employment."
"Apart from reducing the incidence of early school leaving and increasing the proportion of university graduates by 2020, I would like to highlight some aspects which may provide support to young people."
"The first aspect is the importance of devising more flexible educational programmes which will be compatible with holding down a job at the same time."
"The second aspect is the benefit of having a virtual mobility system to supplement geographical mobility."
"Another aspect is to encourage study grants offered to students by private companies."
"Support is also just as important for private youth initiatives, which can lead to job creation and, by extension, social integration."
"Youth unemployment caused by the economic crisis is a considerable challenge across the EU, and so far, neither the EU nor the Member States have handled it properly."
"The employment situation of young people depends on general economic policy;"
"Member States, therefore, should move towards investments and job creation."
"Unfortunately, the austerity measures which are also felt in Hungary and which affect, amongst other things, the education system, as well as the spending cuts affecting job creation, do not really help young people; on the contrary, their sense of isolation from society and the labour market could pose a long-term threat to the economy."
"The economic crisis should not be a reason for education spending cuts, because combating the impacts of the crisis requires that young people receive higher levels of education."
"The success and effectiveness of the 'Youth on the Move' initiative depends, to a large extent, on the attitude and key activities of Member States and the financial support they provide for the implementation of these programmes at a national level, which could contribute to the social integration of young people."
"The role played by local education institutions, as well as local and regional authorities in the area of education and mobility, is also very important, which is why I believe it is important to support the mobility of teachers and youth and education workers, since they are the ones who can motivate youth."
"In order to achieve these EU targets, a partnership approach should be created with local and regional authorities as well."
"I supported this report, which reaffirms our ambitions for young people in Europe."
"The Europe 2020 strategy puts the education of young people at the heart of its objectives and proposes targets for 2020: a reduction of early school leaving from 15% to 10% and an increase in the percentage of those having a higher education qualification from 31% to 40%."
"Nonetheless, I would like to insist on one point: obstacles to young people's mobility."
"Currently, it is estimated that only 4% of European students receive an Erasmus grant during their studies."
"This is still too little when one knows that a CV can be greatly enhanced by a year abroad, in terms of learning - especially with regard to learning foreign languages - open-mindedness and skills."
"Three issues can explain this figure: the fact that many students are not even aware that these opportunities for studying abroad exist, the cost of an Erasmus year for a student's budget and the complexity of recognising achievements."
"In all these areas, Europe and the Member States must commit themselves, so that the Erasmus programme, which is one of the EU's greatest successes, becomes a success for everyone."
"The principal goal of the 'Youth on the Move' initiative is to promote youth mobility and to break down barriers that are still standing in its way."
"However, I do welcome the fact that it also places increased emphasis on harmonising education and labour market needs."
"Perhaps the gravest concern of today's graduate youth in particular is that, following the completion of their studies, they are faced with not being able to capitalise on their knowledge on the labour market."
"The alarming unemployment figures of young people support this; the effects of this phenomenon have a ripple effect towards a decreased willingness to have children and a drastic delay in starting a family, thereby strengthening negative demographic processes."
"The problem, of course, is known both at European Union and Member State level."
"However, the solution is primarily in the hands of the latter, as only they can reorganise and reform the national education systems and adjust them to the new socio-economic realities."
"The task of the EU is to create a framework for the processes and prevent Member States from losing track of the original goal while, at the same time, encouraging and motivating them to implement reforms that are difficult in the short term but certainly profitable in the long run."
"At a time of economic crisis, when some Member States are reducing investment in education and training, I am pleased that Parliament has today adopted the report on Youth on the Move."
"In recent years, it is, in fact, young people who have felt the effects of the crisis most acutely."
"The rate of unemployment among young people in the EU has exceeded 20%, which is twice as high as the rate for adults, and in some Member States, it has reached 40%."
"Budget cuts are having a direct effect on young people's prospects and opportunities for development."
"The knowledge and skills of young people are essential for the achievement of intelligent and sustainable development."
"Youth on the Move, a flagship initiative of the Europe 2020 strategy, should aim to enhance the attractiveness of higher education in Europe, raise the quality of education and increase student and worker mobility."
"This initiative enables young people to acquire knowledge, skills and competences which are essential for work and life."
"These priorities and objectives will not be fully realised and achieved if the EU does not ensure long-term financial support in its budget."
"Therefore, it is so important that this programme be given high subsidies, not forgetting, at the same time, how important it is to continue to promote it and maintain an appropriate information policy."
"This report shone the spotlight on an occupational category that is all too often neglected."
"What would European culture be without creative artists?"
"While developing the creative industries economically, we must not forget those who work in this sector."
"As the shadow rapporteur for my group in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, the social situation and the conditions in which creative artists in Europe live are particularly important."
"Unfortunately, many of the 5 million people who make their livelihoods from the creative sector live in precarious conditions."
"Second and third jobs are not rare, as one job is often not enough to live on."
"A lack of health and pension insurance is on the agenda."
"Contracts are mostly uncertain, and many creative workers are scarcely able to plan more than a couple of months in advance."
"Moreover, a fair level of social security protection, with adequate insurance against unemployment, sickness and for old age, must be standard practice also for those working in the creative sector."
"I am very pleased to see that the rapporteur followed the position of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs in this regard and included it in the report."
"It is now time for the Commission and the Member States to remedy these social deficiencies and to promise the many creative minds of Europe that creative artists in Europe need not live as an underclass."
"I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for his fine work and beneficial cooperation on this report."
"I want to highlight again the great economic and cultural potential, as well as the unique nature of the creative industries."
"They lie in a very delicate area between mainstream business and the creation of cultural products."
"It is gratifying that even in the current circumstances, this sector is one of the most dynamic and innovative in Europe."
"One other point worth mentioning is that it offers potential for growth and provides jobs for around 5 million people in the EU."
"Unfortunately, my suggestion urging the European Commission and Member States to discuss the opportunities for creating specialist European and national funds, which would have provided resources for borrowing under soft terms for these industries, was rejected by a small margin during the vote in the Committee on Culture and Education."
"Nevertheless, I firmly believe that this idea of mine will come to fruition and will be adopted in the near future."
"I think that this is extremely important for the support and development of the cultural and creative industries because, as they are not quite commercial activities, they need soft financing, which banks cannot provide nowadays in the normal way for other industries."
"In the European Parliament, we are calling for specific action - for the European Commission to recognise the creative sector as one of the most productive areas of the Union economy and so to treat its development as an absolute priority."
"To achieve this, we want primarily to increase the possibilities of financing the creative sector, as a pillar of intelligent economic growth, from the Union budget."
"For it is possible to create synergy between Union programmes for the support of culture, such as Culture 2007-2013, for example, with existing Union research programmes (such as the Eighth Framework Programme, which supports the EU's technological development), or to extend the possibilities for spending money from existing funds (such as the European Social Fund, for example)."
"We also recommend supporting the development of new and innovative financial instruments (compilations of bank guarantees, returnable deposits and intelligent loans), thanks to which it would be easier for creators or small and medium-sized businesses from the creative sector to start their enterprises."
"Of course, money is not everything."
"Among other things, we propose strengthening cooperation between the cultural and creative sectors and European universities, increasing the number of specialist training courses for young people, and improving the mobility of all creators and people of culture."
"To this end, we intend to create a multilingual Internet platform which would be used for the exchange of experiences between creators and, as a consequence, for the creation of a still closer network of contacts between all those for whom the development of the creative industry in Europe is important."
"Statement by the President"
"Yesterday afternoon, an earthquake struck the Spanish province of Murcia."
"At least seven people were killed."
"Many were injured."
"Three hours ago, Mr Martínez Martínez made a statement about this."
"On behalf of the European Parliament, I extend condolences to the families of the victims."
"We wish all those who have been injured a rapid return to health."
"We also admire the immediate reaction and effort of the people of the province, who are helping in the rescue operation."
"I am just sending a letter of condolence to the Spanish authorities on this matter."
"(ES) Mr President, thank you very much for your compassionate and supportive words."
"The Lorca tragedy is becoming clear."
"At the moment, we know that eight people have died, among them two pregnant women and a twelve year-old boy, more than 250 have been injured and 80% of houses are affected."
"That is to say, from now on and for the moment, many Lorca citizens will be homeless."
"A large portion of Lorca citizens have also lost their places of work and with them have gone their hopes, expectations and opportunities."
"Lorca is a city of 70 000 inhabitants, of whom 20% are immigrants that the city has received, taken in and been able to give a new life with new meaning."
"I know that together, the old and new residents of Lorca, with help from the institutions and from everybody, will be able to begin a new journey in their lives."
"I also have to say and call on the European Union not to leave anyone behind and to be able to help those affected, recognise their pain and stand by their side, opening their arms and offering opportunities."
"I would like to thank you all very much and to ask for a minute's silence."
"(Applause)"
"I will ask everyone to rise."
"We will now observe a minute's silence."
"Cleanup in Europe and Let's do it World 2012 (written declaration)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, written declaration 0003/2011 submitted by Mrs Jordan Cizelj, Mrs Gomes, Mrs Lepage, Mrs Morkūnaitė-Mikulėnienand Mr Tarand on Cleanup in Europe and Let's do it World 2012 has been signed by the majority of Parliament's component Members."
"In accordance with Rule 123, it will be forwarded to its addressees and published in the Texts Adopted of this sitting, together with the names of the signatories."
"As far as I know, Mrs Jordan Cizelj wanted to say something about this."
"Mrs Jordan Cizelj, you have the floor."
"(SL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I want to thank you for the support you have given to this written declaration."
"With this declaration, we have shown our commitment to a clean environment in this year's European Year of Volunteering."
"However, I would invite you not to stop at just this signature, but to help ensure that next year, in 2012, this action, that is, the one-day action to clean up our environment, becomes a success in as many countries as possible, in even more countries than has been the case so far, and, in that way, to support environmental groups in your countries."
"Mr President, I want to thank everybody for supporting this initiative."
"I will be very brief."
"It has been a pleasure to work under the surveillance of Ms Jordan Cizelj and in cooperation with Ms Gomes, Ms Morkūnaitė-Mikulėnienand Ms Lepage."
"This is a genuine citizen's initiative, and will show how citizens can guide Europe to a better future."
"However, knowing the controversy around written declarations, and the differing opinions about their usefulness, I would like to apologise to those Members who felt offended by our campaign, and to repeat the promise I made to the chair of my subcommittee, Mr Danjean: I promise not to start a written declaration again during this parliamentary term."
"I hope you will help me to keep my promise, and I hope we will all meet again on the Action Day in 2012."

"Explanations of vote"
"We now come to the explanations of vote."
"Oral explanations of vote"
"(IT) Madam President, there is no doubt that this report represents a step forward in the creation of new educational opportunities for young people."
"It advocates more research, more innovation, more EU 2020 strategy in a context that is becoming increasingly relevant."
"We need more education at school level, more training, but also more universities, so that we are working together with young people to ensure that the promotion of culture yields added value."
"Building educational success is the focus of this report, and it is also the reason why we voted in favour."
"Greater mobility for young people, a greater capacity to develop opportunities for work, and a labour market that must take into consideration not only young people working in a given context, but all the sectors that provide opportunities for young people to grow."
"(SK) Madam President, I supported the European initiative Youth on the Move, the aim of which is to reduce the proportion of students leaving education early from 15% to 10% by 2020, and to increase the proportion of people with a university education from 31% to 40%."
"For the purposes of comparison, 40% of the population in the US have a university education, and 50% in Japan."
"At present, 14.4% of young people in Europe aged 18 to 24 years have less than higher secondary level education, and almost 21% of young people are unemployed."
"I also support the fact that the Youth on the Move initiative aims to ensure education that will meet the needs of the labour market."
"It is estimated that by 2020, the proportion of jobs requiring a high qualification will rise from 29% to 35%."
"(PL) Madam President, European programmes which support young people call for unqualified support."
"The people who are the future of our continent are also the most defenceless, are they not?"
"It is we who must ensure that they receive the right education, with access to the benefits of culture and, most of all, the opportunity to learn foreign languages, as well as the opportunity to make a free choice of where they would like to receive their education."
"Not everyone has the money and the opportunity to be able to arrange this for themselves."
"The good results achieved in many programmes for helping young people, such as Erasmus and Leonardo da Vinci, show this to be an effective investment."
"The greatest support is needed by young people living in rural areas, who often do not have the financial means to begin a course of higher education and also do not have the opportunity to find work outside of agriculture in the area where they live."
"(FI) Madam President, I wish to say a few words about Mr Zver's excellent Youth on the Move initiative."
"This is one of the success stories of EU policy."
"Even the Eurosceptics or those who are critical of it are of the opinion that it is because of these youth mobility programmes that a certain added value has been achieved that benefits everyone."
"The Bologna Process, the Copenhagen Process and other such initiatives are good examples of this."
"Mr Zver's report endorses this trend, one that has already been perceived as a welcome one, and which creates new opportunities and prerequisites for young Europeans studying in the different countries of Europe."
"It will be a way for us to be able genuinely to exchange best practices."
"I believe that in the long term, this will constitute one firm basis for economic growth in Europe, but more important than economic growth is to remember that it is via this process that people, young people, can grow as individuals and Europeans."
"Madam President, across Europe, we are condemning generations of young people to emigration and poverty."
"We are condemning generations yet unborn and unbegot to debt - all in order to sustain this conceit of monetary union."
"In Ireland, GDP is down 20% from its peak - an almost incredible figure."
"In Greece, we have riots in protest against the austerity package; and yet we know that it is not going to work."
"When the bail-out was agreed a year ago, the idea was that it would be an immediate stop-gap, that it would be a short-term contingent measure, and that by now, Greece would be borrowing cheaply again as the crisis would have passed."
"We can see that it has failed."
"However, we are continuing with the same policy in Portugal and in Greece again, rather than admit our mistake."
"What a high price we expect our constituents to pay for our conceit!"
"(LT) Madam President, I am pleased that today, we adopted the motion for a resolution entitled Youth on the Move: a framework for improving Europe's education and training systems, because this resolution provides clear recommendations and key orientations that European Union countries could and should follow in order to improve education and training systems."
"Nevertheless, I would like to single out a few aspects: firstly, given that the Youth on the Move initiative aims to achieve the principal goal set in the Europe 2020 strategy of reducing the number of people leaving school without qualifications from 15% to 10%, it lacks measures and recommendations oriented towards raising teacher competences, qualifications or professional prestige."
"We must clearly understand that the teaching profession is the profession that creates the greatest added value for society, and must strive to ensure that teachers in European countries are the best."
"I very much agree with the call in the document for an all-embracing strategy to be submitted to the Commission, aimed at promoting non-formal education, and I would call for this document's key recommendations to be directly linked to the multiannual financial framework."
"(DE) Madam President, today, we have with us the National Executive of the Sudeten German Homeland Association, including the Sudeten German Youth, which is energetically pursuing cross-border collaboration with the Czech Youth."
"In this regard, this report is of truly inestimable significance, as it covers three points: firstly, the networking of the universities, especially in the Euroregions and border regions; secondly, vocational training - as it is not just academic education that we need; and thirdly, and above all, the question of language skills."
"I want to state quite clearly that I love the language of Shakespeare, but I do think it is a pity if our young people converse in but one language."
"It is precisely the learning of the language of our neighbours and the learning of the smaller languages that we ought to be promoting in particular in this framework."
"The truth is that you only really get to know the culture of your neighbours when you start to experience day-to-day life in their language."
"In this connection, we have a lot of work to do, but also major opportunities."
"(PL) Madam President, I am extremely pleased that Youth on the Move is an integral part of the Europe 2020 strategy."
"I am pleased, too, that the report we have voted through today has given attention to the importance of non-formal education, understood as education by participation in youth organisations and non-governmental organisations and by volunteering."
"I am sure that non-formal education helps young people become active citizens, teaches teamwork, helps develop individual interests and gives them better chances of finding work - and that is something which is very important."
"(PL) Madam President, children are our future."
"They will be part of conscious society in Europe in the future, so it is very important to educate children from an early age."
"We must instil positive values and the right moral standards into our children from their earliest years."
"Education should be based on good, solid foundations and be provided by teaching staff with appropriate education and training."
"We must strive to achieve equal opportunities, so that all children, regardless of whether they come from urban or rural areas, or from rich or poor families, have access to early learning."
"In the process of eliminating inequalities, we should pay particular attention to rural communities - where children have much poorer access to educational and cultural facilities."
"(FI) Madam President, it is very important to focus on the early years of childhood and early childhood education and care (ECEC)."
"That is why I warmly welcomed Mrs Honeyball's report, for which I myself was shadow rapporteur."
"With regard to this excellent report, I would like to make it clear that, hopefully, it is the importance of upbringing rather than education that needs to be emphasised when we are talking about small children."
"That is because all the essential ingredients of a person's life are established during the first few years, and so it is probably true that if children have a secure basic upbringing, a secure living environment, they will also have the chance to succeed in the future."
"We should therefore stress the importance of upbringing rather than education."
"There will be a time for education later on, but, as has been said, this report reviews different models that exist in Europe, and the basic premise is that we should ensure that, from early childhood, not one single young person is excluded: everyone should have an opportunity to live a good, full life."
"Madam President, last summer, I had the pleasure of visiting your constituency, and one day I took my children to the beach."
"I remember watching my two little girls building a sand castle, oblivious to the incoming tide, so captivated were they with the shells and twigs with which they were decorating their work."
"I had not the heart to point out to them that the tide was coming in, and today I felt rather the same way as I read through our voting list."
"We have these epochal events - this economic crisis on our border, this collapse in our share of world GDP - and here we are talking about early years learning, about our responsibilities to the International Labour Organisation, and about whether Sarajevo should be a European city of culture."
"Let me give you the raw and scary statistics: in 1974, the nations of Western Europe accounted for 36% of world GDP; today it is 26%; in 2020 it will be 15%."
"While we are worrying about early years learning, putting out all our propaganda about drawing Europe together, and producing The Raspberry Ice Cream War, and while our children are being encouraged to read the unintentionally hilarious 'Captain Euro', our part of the world is being overtaken by more virile countries that have learned the benefits of decentralisation and the dispersal of power."
"Surely the time is coming when all our pomp of yesterday will be one with Nineveh and Tyre?"
"(LT) Madam President, I would like to react to the misinformation provided by Mr Tomaševski during the debate this morning."
"He stated that children from the Polish minority in Lithuania are unable to study in Polish."
"For your information, Lithuania is home to around 200 000 Lithuanian citizens of Polish descent, and there are 62 schools where teaching is only carried out in Polish and 34 schools with Polish classes."
"Meanwhile, in Germany, where there are 2 million people of Polish descent, there is not one state school exclusively for Poles."
"It should be noted that only in Lithuania can citizens of Polish descent obtain an education in Polish from nursery to university."
"This is unique in the world."
"Lithuania is home to a subsidiary of Białystok University, the only department of a Polish university outside Poland."
"In a survey, 42% of representatives of national minorities in Lithuania cited insufficient knowledge of Lithuanian as a disadvantage when competing for jobs."
"It is strange to hear criticisms of the Lithuanian education law, which mirrors the law in Poland, and I would like to pose a rhetorical question: does Mr Tomaševski feel that national minorities are being abused in Poland too?"
"(SK) Madam President, I have already spoken in the debate and applauded the fact that Mrs Honeyball has tried to find a compromise across the entire political spectrum."
"Despite this, I abstained from the final vote because I think that this report interferes in the affairs of nation states in many points."
"This can be seen most clearly from the fact that it welcomes the Barcelona objectives, despite the fact that the Barcelona objectives ended in a fiasco precisely because they were mere numbers dictated centrally by the EU to the individual Member States."
"In my opinion, we must leave it to the Member States to decide how many pre-school facilities they need, because it is not just a question of numbers, but also a question of quality and the culture of a given country."
"I very much regret the fact that I was unable to vote for this report, but it fundamentally challenged a belief that is dear to me."
"(SK) Madam President, childhood undoubtedly has fundamental significance for the physical, mental and social development of children."
"We must therefore understand that the return on investments into pre-school education is the guarantee of future growth."
"Apart from this, many studies have already shown that funding used in this way brings considerable economic and social advantages in the medium and long-term."
"The best and most natural way to secure support of this kind is to protect the family as the basic unit of society."
"Parents are the first and most important teachers of their children, and thus the legal framework should not contain provisions which penalise parents for personally caring for their children, particularly in the early years."
"This agenda is within the exclusive competence of the Member States."
"It is more than desirable for the Union, through its coordinating role, to contribute towards improving the situation in the individual Member States."
"Madam President, supporters of the common fisheries policy often point out that fish do not recognise national borders."
"They tend to tell you this as though it is an original insight - oh really, they swim around, well who would have thought it!"
"Yet the reality is that territorial jurisdiction and property rights are the only secure basis for conservation."
"If you look at the countries that have pursued successful conservation policies in fisheries - whether it is the Falkland Islands, Iceland, Norway, New Zealand - all of them have done so on the basis of giving skippers a sense of ownership so that they have an incentive to treat fisheries as a renewable resource."
"It is the basic wisdom of Aristotle that that which nobody owns, nobody will care for."
"Unfortunately, the common fisheries policy defines fish stocks as a common resource to which all nations have equal access."
"Hence, the ecological calamity which has befallen stocks in the North Sea."
"One point which is particularly timely is that we have seen in recent years a migration of mackerel from common fisheries policy waters into Iceland territorial waters."
"That, I am afraid, makes them Icelandic property."
"There is no point in complaining about this."
"It is our bad luck and their good luck."
"It may happen that it comes the other way round in a few years time, then it will be our good luck."
"In the meantime, the best and surest way to ensure that we treat fish as a supply that is always going to be there is to recognise the ownership rights of the people who have the water under maritime law."
"(DE) Madam President, the rising global market prices for oil are not the only cause of the crisis in the fisheries sector, as the fuels are generally already exempt from tax and as the rising global market prices affect every fisherman in the world - in the European Union and beyond."
"As a second point, the raising of the de minimis thresholds should be seized as an opportunity to also help fishermen to be able to work - and fish - in a more environmentally sound and sustainable way."
"Thirdly, simply making the fuel cheaper will not achieve this aim."
"Put simply, I expect the Member States, too, to produce innovative and useful solutions in this regard."
"(ES) Firstly, Madam President, I want to convey my support to all the people in Lorca, in the province of Murcia in Spain, to the eight people who died and their families, and to the 250 who were injured in yesterday's earthquake."
"I voted in favour of this joint motion for a resolution, not having gone along with my group, due to my concern about the difficult time the sector is experiencing and which has worsened due to the oil price increase."
"The EUR 30 000 to EUR 60 000 increase of de minimis aid for companies for a period of only three years can help them in this complicated situation."
"In addition, I have to say that this increase does not imply any increase in the European Union budgets."
"Its application must also guarantee environmental and social sustainability, and should not distort competition between Member States."
"However, the European Fisheries Fund must continue to support this sector in order to reduce fishermen's dependency on fossil fuels, to make its activity more efficient and provide it with innovative proposals that must give new opportunities to the maritime sector."
"(GA) Madam President, I was pleased to support these recommendations."
"Fishing - like farming - is a very precarious occupation."
"It is open to the vagaries of the weather and subject to the quota situation and, of course, the vagaries of stocks and supplies."
"Now, added to this, we have the sudden increase in oil prices."
"Ultimately, the solution will have to come from within the European Union, with it becoming more self-sufficient in terms of more general energy supplies, obviously including renewable energies. However, I also think that we need to look at exploring areas within Europe that have not been explored before because it was not economically viable to do so."
"Now that is changing."
"I think if we could increase the supply within Europe, that would automatically bring down world prices and also, of course, make us less dependent on non-democratic regimes for our supply."
"(SK) Madam President, I fully agree with the demand for the assessment of the impact of all relevant bills on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to be performed systematically both at a national and at a European level, because these businesses are the real backbone of the European economy and, as such, provide more than 100 million jobs."
"Current practice shows, however, that at a regional and local level, access to financial support for the initial stages of innovation and for supporting start-ups and small innovative companies is still very inadequate and patchy in the EU."
"This heterogeneity is also confirmed by the finding that 75% of the overall EUR 21 billion assigned for financial support was made fully available through the intermediary banks, which was drawn on by just 50 000 out of the total of 23 million SMEs."
"Madam President, Fine Gael members have asked me to speak on behalf of all four of us in the EPP on this issue."
"We strongly support the main thrust of any provision such as this to support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)."
"We know the importance of SMEs to the Irish economy and to the European economy."
"However, we do not see the case for including reference to the CCCTB in this report."
"It appears to me that we buy into the propaganda of whatever the flavour of the day happens to be."
"Currently in Germany, for example, they say they are having second thoughts about this whole CCCTB."
"So let us assist SMEs, but let us not insert particular propaganda into provisions of this kind. There is a case for and against CCCTB."
"Let us not put ideology in the place of assistance."
"We should give every possible assistance to SMEs, but it is not necessary constantly to introduce these terms."
"We voted against CCCTB, but we did not vote against the entire report because we did not want to retard the sort of support that is needed for SMEs, and I am glad of the opportunity to put that on record."
"Mr Mitchell, I am going to ask you a question."
"Could you tell us what those initials stand for?"
"Madam President, I am glad you said that."
"I thought you were going to ask me whether I was speaking in Lithuanian at the beginning!"
"CCCTB stands for common consolidated corporation tax base."
"I felt sure that our visitors would appreciate knowing what we were talking about."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, I just wanted to ask whether something could be called an ideology just because it is not liked in Ireland."
"Madam President, this is not a question of what is liked or not liked in Ireland."
"We are Members of the European Parliament, and we will put our views forward."
"We will not be told what to do by any representatives of any other Member State."
"We are not obliged in this country to do what is liked in other Member States."
"Every Member State sends its parliamentarians here for them to put their views forward."
"Our views are that the case for the CCCTB, which is currently being denigrated in Berlin, is the sort of propaganda that came off the top of somebody's head."
"The case for it has not been proven."
"There is a case for and against this, and we should not be bludgeoned into this by any flavour-of-the-day political correctness."
"This item concerns explanations of vote."
"(FI) Madam President, as far as common corporate tax is concerned, it would be a very challenging prospect for the European Union, because its 27 Member States are all very different."
"Their economic structures are very different, though of course, as we are in the Single Market, it is very important to ensure that small and mediumsized enterprises, which actually make up the backbone of the European economy, have fairly equal opportunities for competition."
"At present, that is not the case, and in that sense it is very important that a review of SMEs is now conducted."
"Being from Finland, for example, I realise very clearly that Finnish companies are a very long way from the heart of the internal market and, for that reason, logistical costs - transport costs - push up the prices of products considerably."
"We therefore need different systems of compensation via taxation even within the European Union, but also in other ways, so that the competition situation might be fairer for everyone."
"It is very important that a report such as this one has been produced and that we should also aim to consider companies in remote areas in the north, for them to be able to compete on an equal footing with other European companies."
"(GA) Madam President, firstly, I agree with what my leader, Gay Mitchell, said about the CCCTB and I voted accordingly."
"However, I want to focus on another point."
"The point I want to mention is that it was notable that it took an oral amendment to raise the issue of counterfeiting with regard to this individual proposal."
"That is unfortunate, because counterfeited goods are doing huge damage to businesses right across Europe and this has not been highlighted or tackled enough."
"Many of these goods come from third countries and are facilitated by the governments of those countries, which give safe haven to goods coming to Europe."
"We need to name and shame and take action against those countries because they are having a terrible effect on legitimate businesses within Europe."
"It is time that we said: No more!"
"(PL) Madam President, more rapid development, efficiency, including cost-efficiency, and greater competitiveness are the best means for tackling economic problems."
"To achieve these objectives, we need to work together for innovation."
"Something which is very important, here, is the emphasis given to citizens' creativeness, for example, by making room for employees to suggest how to improve work processes."
"Another factor which drives innovation is consumption, and a specific example of the way in which citizens' creativeness can be combined with the desire to use modern technologies are the iPhone applications being developed by European consumers."
"Strengthening the knowledge base by bringing together businesses, knowledge institutions and the citizens themselves is an important factor in achieving the goals of the Innovation Union."
"In this respect, it will be essential to achieve the full engagement of public and local authorities."
"A fundamental objective of innovation is to maintain a high level of prosperity in Europe."
"I hope the joining of forces which has been proposed will contribute to support for the process of innovation and help bring about economic stabilisation."
"Hence, I support the report."
"(DE) Madam President, unfortunately, I never had an opportunity to speak in the debate yesterday, although I was present."
"I would like, however, to give my backing, in particular, to those speakers who stressed that innovation and research should and must take place in the agricultural sector, too."
"Agriculture is no 'old economy' - it is modern and it is also an environment where activity, research and innovation take place."
"European agriculture faces at least three major challenges; namely, ensuring the feeding of the population, sustaining the environment and producing energy."
"These at times widely divergent aims require systematic scientific permeation both now and in the future."
"(PL) Madam President, I endorsed the report on Innovation Union."
"Innovation is, of course, crucial for Europe's development."
"However, in my opinion, something which is absolutely fundamental is support for innovation in the small and medium-sized enterprise sector in particular, especially in the European Union's new Member States, which, in this respect, are some way behind."
"Indeed, it is events in this sector - as would appear from numerous analyses - which will decide if the European economy of the future will be competitive in relation to other major world economies."
"It should be remembered - as is shown by research conducted by accountancy firm Ernst & Young - that three quarters of applications submitted by small enterprises in Europe for research subsidies and the purchase of new technologies are, unfortunately, rejected by the banks."
"Funding is a serious problem, so we should persuade individual Member States to support small and medium-sized enterprises in this area."
"Without this support, they will not cope with the growing competition in the world economy."
"(PL) Madam President, I endorsed the interesting and comprehensive report on transforming Europe for a post-crisis world."
"I did so in the hope that the course of action proposed in the report will reduce the growing disproportions in development between the different EU Member States and slow down the 'brain drain', which the report calls - too politely, in my opinion - intellectual mobility."
"Therefore, to secure the sustainable development of Europe, we must allocate increased funds to the development of innovation and to research projects in the EU's new Member States."
"We should encourage governments that as well as increasing budgetary means allocated each year to research, they should establish a percentage of their budget as a minimum threshold which must be used on research and development-type projects."
"However, the amount spent on research and development should not in any way reduce future budgetary plans for the European Union's current priorities, such as the common agricultural policy or cohesion policy, because they are fulfilling their role well."
"(SV) Madam President, despite the fact that innovations are so incredibly important for economic and social development in Europe, up to now, the EU has not had any collective regulations on innovations."
"The fact that this proposal has been tabled by the Commission and Commissioner Geoghegan-Quinn is therefore extremely important."
"When we now lay down the rules that are to apply, we must try very hard, in this document and in the Innovation Union, to simplify and remove any unnecessary bureaucracy."
"Simplifying the rules is extremely important, because every researcher, every industry and every small business brings this up as the greatest barrier to using EU funds and working together in a focused way to improve the situation for innovations in Europe."
"We also need to ensure that we have much more effective management."
"We need to focus on the really big projects instead of spreading the money over a large number of different areas, as we do in all other contexts."
"Finally, the Innovation Union can be a really good tool in our work to solve climate issues. Thank you."
"(FI) Madam President, the everyday life of the domestic worker is often uncertain, undervalued and unofficial."
"They are treated unequally, unfairly and poorly."
"In Europe, domestic workers are generally migrant workers, a large number of whom have arrived in the country illegally."
"They no not appear in any registers, they are at risk of being exploited, and they are at the mercy of their employers."
"The ILO convention on domestic workers and the common rules that would apply are a primary means of ensuring that the human rights of domestic workers and their employment and social rights are respected, supervised and developed."
"It would be naïve to say that there were no illegal domestic workers in Europe."
"This is a kind of modern day slavery."
"These workers, who are frequently women, are the most vulnerable of all."
"They do not dare to complain about the fact that they are treated badly or about violence or sexual exploitation."
"The exploitation does not just apply to those from outside the EU: we are also exploiting our own citizens."
"Improving the situation of domestic workers should be a priority for the Europe 2020 strategy."
"(DE) Madam President, I will set out my views on domestic employment."
"First of all, I agree with those who say that those employed in this sector - and they are mostly women, of course - are entitled to fair pay and fair social services."
"I also very much agree with those who say that, in this sector in particular, many unbelievable things happen and there is much injustice."
"I do ask, however, that attention be paid to red tape when implementing justified demands."
"In Germany, for example, the reality is that I, as someone who is covered by this legislation given my employment of domestic staff, need to call on the assistance of a tax advisor quite simply because there is so much red tape and the statutory stipulations are so complicated."
"This takes its toll on the nerves, takes time and costs money."
"Those who eschew the red tape mostly then pay their staff cash, thereby contributing - sometimes inadvertently - to illegal employment."
"That is why I am calling for attention to be paid to the amount of red tape involved."
"(DE) Madam President, as a skilled farmer, I would like to add another couple of comments about these issues."
"The first is that it is right that it must be our aim to reduce the use of antibiotics in livestock production, in particular."
"'As little as possible' should be the cornerstone of our action in this regard."
"My second point is that we need an analysis of the status quo, in other words, an analysis of the data covering what is actually happening on the ground in the Member States of the European Union."
"Obviously, all Member States need to take part in such an analysis."
"My third point is that we need further scientific studies in order to analyse the dangers and also in order to be able to counter those dangers effectively."
"Fourthly, what we do not need is ideological bogeymen."
"Ideology cannot replace science."
"(FI) Madam President, this report is worthy of our support."
"It is with good reason that Europe has been regarded as an economic giant: it could also equally be a cultural giant."
"In all its cultural diversity, the EU is a coherent yet varied community of values."
"In international policy, culture is of major importance."
"It is a human right and each person and nation has a right to enjoy it."
"Culture is also linked to human wellbeing and coping generally."
"Cultural policy also allows the EU to connect with other countries with which no other form of partnership has been agreed on."
"Support for the cultural dimension in those countries in North Africa which are now building a new, more democratic society is also especially important."
"Bilateral development and trade agreements should always require not just elements of social responsibility but also cultural elements."
"There should even be cultural experts associated with the European External Action Service, so that culture can be made part of the EU's foreign policy in a way that is more coherent and systematic."
"(PL) Madam President, the cultural heritage of European countries is, in itself, something of value."
"Although there are many cultural differences between them, the Member States have already made a good name for themselves in the world, one which attracts the citizens of other countries who would like to draw on these cultural resources."
"The European Union's political and economic position can be strengthened by promoting the Union's identity and cultural value."
"An important role in the area of culture is being played by new technologies, which also enable people to exercise fundamental human rights."
"Particularly in countries which are in the grip of censorship, the activity of citizens and access to information are maintained by the instrumentality of the Internet."
"The Union must, therefore, support freedom of the Internet in the world arena and make significant contributions to the development of culture and the awareness of people in closed societies."
"In addition, the young generation needs a consistent strategy on mobility for increasing development in the area of science and culture."
"I support measures for cultural diplomacy, which can also be helped by the work of parliamentary delegations."
"This is why I endorsed the report."
"(PL) Madam President, the declarations and remarks contained in the report are exceptionally valuable and appropriate."
"In particular, I would like to refer, here, to the statements which point out that the European Union is obliged to take action throughout the world to promote respect for freedom of expression, freedom of the press and freedom of access to audiovisual media."
"Also very appropriate is the call for the European Commission to promote Internet freedom globally, in view of the threats to this freedom of which we increasingly read and hear."
"Although I am pleased to note that we are calling for values which we Europeans consider to be fundamental, I also admit that it was with a certain sadness that I endorsed this report."
"I am aware that we sometimes call for these fundamental values to be upheld in other parts of the world, but forget that they are also being violated in some of the European Union's Member States."
"An example of this is what is happening in Poland in relation to journalists who are critical of the government."
"They are being removed from public media en masse, and representatives of the government are trying to close down the independent, privately-owned daily newspaper Rzeczpospolita, which is the second largest quality daily in Poland and which is critical, incidentally, of the government's position."
"While we are dealing with the matters raised in the report, this, too, should be opposed."
"(FI) Madam President, it is very important that the cultural dimension is also included in the debate on foreign policy."
"I think that we have reached this conclusion because, with the current turmoil in the Middle East, it has been realised that we had forgotten all about the cultural dimension for decades: for example, in the European Union's relations with Syria."
"Since 1963, Syria has been under emergency law, which has allowed the execution of people without trial, but few European delegations, the EU delegation for example, have raised the issue."
"Trade and finance have taken priority over human rights."
"Just as Mr Repo said just now, human rights are also a crucial part of the cultural dimension when we speak of the European Union."
"This is important to remember."
"Human rights, democracy, this hard core: this is what we must promote more vigorously in European foreign policy, instead of looking at things purely from the perspective of the economy."
"(PL) Madam President, I endorsed the interesting report on the cultural dimensions of the EU's external actions."
"How can one not be in favour of these statements on action which the EU is taking throughout the world to promote respect for freedom of expression, freedom of the press, freedom of access to audiovisual media and so on?"
"However, I have the impression that we care too much about the situation outside the Union and care too little about standards inside the Union, for example, in Poland, because it is in Poland that after the current governing coalition gained control of the public media, it began to dismiss large numbers of journalists and close down their programmes, all of which had one thing in common - criticism of the current situation."
"So, for example, such people as Jacek Sobala, Anita Gargas, Jacek Karnowski and Wojciech Leszczyński have lost their jobs."
"Journalists such as Joanna Lichocka, Tomasz Sakiewicz, Rafał Ziemkiewicz, Jan Pospieszalski, Grzegorz Górny, Tomasz Terlikowski, Bronisław Wildstein and Wojciech Cejrowski have lost their programmes - and these are just some examples among many others."
"The gagging of free speech in Poland is a disgrace to the entire European Union."
"(FI) Madam President, first of all, concerning Mrs Sanchez-Schmid's report, I wish to say that it is extremely important that we in the European Union acknowledge the impact that creative industry and culture also has on economic growth in the European Union."
"It is very significant: 2.6% of EU GDP comes specifically from creative industries, and they employ 3.1% of the EU's workforce."
"You could therefore say that over the last few years, even decades, it has been a growth industry, and it will continue to be one in the future too."
"When we speak of the cultural dimension, it is also important to remember that it is something other than just economic growth."
"It is also growth for humanity, and this should never be forgotten when speaking about culture."
"In this respect, the impact of culture should not be measured in terms of growth in GDP: we must also appreciate the fact that a person does not just generate growth in GDP by participating in the rat race, but by living a unique life of human values, and it is to that end that we must create the right conditions and circumstances."
"We, as members of the European Union, should remember this because, all too often, the Union presents us with a narrow picture of itself, as little more than a system of bodies of economic cooperation, and we forget the wider picture."
"With respect to Sarajevo as Capital of Culture for 2014, I would like to say that I hope that this project goes ahead."
"For us on the Committee on Culture and Education, it has been an idea and project that we have all shared, as 2014 will mark the hundredth anniversary of the outbreak of the First World War, which began with an incident in that very city."
"It symbolises the developments that have taken place in Europe."
"We want to show that 2014 is the year that would mark the start of a long period of peace, or would continue the long period of peace that has already started."
"The Baltic countries should also, however, participate more robustly in this peace and stability development."
"It would certainly have greater significance for a wider Europe."
"(FI) Madam President, with respect to Sarajevo as Capital of Culture for 2014, I would like to say that I hope that this project goes ahead."
"For us on the Committee on Culture and Education, it has been an idea and project that we have all shared, as 2014 will mark the hundredth anniversary of the outbreak of the First World War, which began with an incident in that very city."
"In a way, it symbolises the developments that have taken place in Europe."
"We want to show that 2014 is the year that would mark the start of a long period of peace, or would continue the long period of peace that has already started."
"The Baltic countries should also, however, participate more robustly in this peace and stability development."
"It would certainly have greater significance for a wider Europe."
"Written explanations of vote"
"I am voting for this proposal as this initiative aims to achieve the major objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy of reducing school drop-out rates from 15% to 10% and of increasing the percentage of people with tertiary education from 31% to 40% by 2020."
"The 'Youth on the Move' initiative also focuses on promoting learning mobility, with it also being essential to ensure that the education they are receiving is compatible with the needs of the labour market to equip them with the skills and knowledge they will need."
"Mobility is important to learn about other cultures, but also to better understand one's own."
"Less than one third of the EU's population has a higher education degree, compared with over 40% in the United States and over 50% in Japan, so Europe must increase these numbers in order to be able to make itself more competitive in an ever-increasing global economy."
"Recent years have seen the European Union become increasingly focused on creating a knowledge-based society that is able to compete with all other economies on a global scale."
"With its Youth on the Move initiative, the EU 2020 strategy has given young people a key role, with the aim of meeting the five main targets by 2020: employment, research and innovation, climate and energy, education and reduction of poverty."
"These targets are ambitious, given that the current situation is so unstable and forces young people to live in a perpetual state of uncertainty, far removed from the encouraging prospect of a stable job in the future and of their place in society."
"It will be impossible to consolidate the spirit of European citizenship, and to unlock the potential that young people represent, unless the tools available offer the resources that are needed for things to work well."
"Member States should refrain from adopting austerity measures that involve making cuts to the educational system and employment."
"Instead, they should focus on establishing platforms that involve both employers and workers, universities, businesses and local and regional organisations, in order to offer opportunities in the educational and professional training sector, and to ensure that there is good mobility and that qualifications are recognised."
"I voted in favour of this report."
"Young people have suffered particularly badly from the crisis, and the average youth unemployment rate in the EU is over 20%, twice the average for adults, while in some Member States, it exceeds 40%."
"Owing to the economic crisis, Member States are cutting investment in education and training, directly affecting young people's future prospects and the future of the EU."
"Investing in education is, without doubt, essential for sustainable growth and development and, even in times of economic crisis, financing youth programmes and education should not be regarded as a cost to be met now, but rather as an investment in the future of Europe."
"I feel that the Youth on the Move initiative provided for in the Europe 2020 strategy can contribute towards strengthening the existing education, mobility and employment programmes for young people and encouraging Member States to achieve the targets of the EU 2020 strategy."
"I voted for the Zver report."
"At the moment, too many young people are failing to utilise fully their potential in education and vocational training."
"These problems require harmonised action at EU level so that young people are better prepared for the labour market."
"We need policies which will cover the steps that young people have to take when making the transition from education to employment."
"I feel that it is vital for young people and the various youth organisations to be involved in the decision-making process."
"This will help reinforce their sense of belonging and of making an active contribution to a youth strategy."
"The key objective of the 'Youth on the Move' initiative must be to increase European cohesion."
"The EU must deploy its own financial instruments to help young people, by using the European Investment Bank and European Investment Fund more effectively."
"The Youth on the Move initiative is part of the Europe 2020 strategy."
"It introduces 28 measures aimed at better adapting teaching and training systems to the needs of young people, encouraging them to make use of EU aid to study or take part in a training course in another country."
"This initiative aims to increase youth mobility by aiming to ensure that all young people in the EU have the opportunity to study abroad by 2020."
"This report, which merited my vote in favour, warns of a series of situations worthy of particular attention."
"In order to avoid this initiative existing simply as a concept, it is necessary that the Member States commit to it both in terms of financial support and its implementation, and it is also important that an EU budget is adopted for it."
"It is essential to overcome practical barriers and obstacles to mobility, and additional mechanisms should be put in place to ensure that people with disabilities are provided with the same opportunities as anyone else."
"The mobility of students in secondary education is no less important, and programmes such as Comenius should be better promoted in the Member States."
"Although the European youth unemployment figures are extremely worrying - in January 2011, the unemployment rate among under-25s in the EU rose to 20.6% - the report on the 2020 strategy's flagship initiative, 'Youth on the Move', calls on Member States to increase their investment in education, training and mobility."
"Policies relating to young people, whether they concern early, continuing or vocational education and training, must be seen as an investment, not a cost."
"Putting the emphasis on human capital is essential for the future of our European societies."
"Highlighting the synergies between the different agents involved, developing young people's independence, taking action to stop young people leaving education early, reasserting the importance of vocational training and apprenticeships, adopting a binding European quality framework for training schemes: these are the kinds of good ideas that it is important for us to air now at national level."
"This is because the success of the 2020 strategy will depend on the initiative and the political will of the States responsible for implementing it, as these policies largely remain within national competences."
"Youth on the Move (YoM) is one of the flagship initiatives of the Europe 2020 strategy for the promotion of smart, sustainable and inclusive economic growth."
"YoM outlines key courses of action for increasing young people's education and training by means of mobility, and thus for facilitating their entry into the labour market."
"According to recent figures, 14.4% of young Europeans aged between 18 and 24 years dropped out of school before completing their secondary education, and less than one third of the European Union's population have a higher education qualification, compared with around 40% in the United States and 50% in Japan."
"It is essential that young people are able to develop the skills and abilities that will enable them to enter the labour market and to make an active contribution to the Union's growth"
"I therefore wholeheartedly endorse and encourage the initiative that aims to reduce the school drop-out rate to 10%, and to increase the percentage of people with post-secondary education from 31% to 40% by 2020."
"Lastly, I believe that high quality education and training are indispensable for meeting the demands of the modern labour market."
"I supported this report because of the need to promote a framework for the improvement of education and training systems in Europe."
"The Youth on the Move initiative has to be a political initiative to promote education, mobility and employment programmes for today's youth and as an incentive for Member States to attain the aims of the Europe 2020 strategy."
"I applaud the rapporteur's vision regarding the investment that needs to be made in the future of young Europeans."
"Learning mobility, as well as improving European students' chances of finding a first job, promotes increased European identity and citizenship, and consequently increases young people's involvement in the Union's democratic processes."
"That said, I support the efforts towards guaranteeing the quality and accessibility of learning mobility, and I would highlight the rapporteur's mention of the importance of encouraging more Member States to sign up to the Commission's Quality Charter for Mobility."
"in writing. - Youth on the Move is a fantastic initiative, and I strongly support the group in giving it my full support."
"The report refers to the 'Youth on the Move' programme, which allows young people and youth organisations to do more at European level (seminars, meetings, trips) and to take an active part in debates on policies relating to young people, with financial assistance from the EU."
"The positive points in the report include frequent references to the importance of access to education, opposition to cutbacks in spending on education and training and a call for increased funding for them so that, all other things being equal, everyone will be able to take part in this programme."
"It also gives young people from neighbouring countries the opportunity to take part and highlights the need to oppose discrimination in the workplace."
"Huge importance is attached to a pragmatic system of internships which will allow everyone to earn a decent wage and access social insurance, so that they do not replace real jobs."
"However, as there are certain points in the report which are typical of the Bologna policy on education, to which I am opposed, in that it refers to the need to formulate programmes in keeping with the 'needs of the market', which I consider may jeopardise the nature of the programme, I abstained."
"Young people are currently one of the groups hit hardest by the global economic and financial crisis."
"The EU and the Member States have an obligation to support specific, effective measures that enable the transition to be made to the labour market, through better education, training and mobility."
"The Youth on the Move initiative is in response to this very aspiration, offering answers to the challenges faced by young people and helping them to be successful in the knowledge economy."
"In the face of unacceptable youth unemployment figures, I believe that the quality of education and training, adequate integration into the labour market, and a strong commitment to youth mobility, are key to exploiting the potential of all young people and to achieving the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy."
"Moreover, although this initiative focuses on employment as the end result, it does not ignore issues linked to education, to youth participation, to active citizenship, to mobility, to language learning and to a whole series of skills that are essential to the area of non-formal education today."
"I am voting for the tabled report, and I call for robust financing for the initiative, which is indispensable to sustainable growth."
"The 'Youth on the Move' initiative is an important point of reference for young European citizens."
"In financial terms first and foremost, as it represents another boost to European projects for the mobility of young students and improves European schools, stimulating research and debate about the significance of a united Europe and showing what it can offer."
"The contribution of 'Youth on the Move' to the debate on the definition of a European cultural model is no less important."
"Cooperation between the various institutes and learning in the various disciplines, which are taught differently in the various countries depending also on the political awareness of the ruling classes, also represents a key contribution to the definition of a European identity."
"We must ensure that through our young people, these identities are truly European and not allow the only educational model for our young people in the future to be the American one, although this has, of course, been an important point of reference until now."
"The European Union has all the tools it requires for offering the world its values and ideas of how it wants and will want its children to grow up."
"Young people are, to a large extent, characterised by their dynamism, by their enormous generosity, and by an enormous capacity for learning and assimilation."
"A Europe with a future, and one aiming to be increasingly competitive and dynamic, needs this important capital."
"The 'Youth on the Move' programme included in the Europe 2020 strategy is therefore an important collection of programmes to support the youngest people, with objectives that are ambitious but very clear, in which I see myself and in which I hope the people at whom it is aimed will participate significantly."
"This initiative advocates the need to give more young people improved access to the labour market, which is a very relevant goal given the level that youth unemployment is reaching in a number of Member States."
"I would also stress the attention given to the importance of mobility of young Europeans, during both their education and their working lives."
"This education in a variety of cultures and places will provide an education that is more complete and richer, whilst contributing to building a real feeling of 'European ownership', which will help to cement the concept of European citizenship included in the Treaties."
"To support and strengthen these measures, I am voting for this report."
"Student mobility programmes such as Erasmus, Erasmus Mundus and Comenius are attracting more and more candidates."
"However, there are still practical obstacles to mobility, especially for obtaining visas and medical papers in different languages, for transferring grants abroad, and for the recognition of qualifications gained in another Member State."
"In 2004, when the Erasmus Mundus exchange programme was launched, with the help of a large majority in this Parliament, I got the European Commission to agree to take the necessary measures to ensure quality in this programme."
"A 'European Quality Charter for Mobility' was even created."
"Only, seven years later, the same obstacles are still there."
"That is why the European Parliament has wanted to reiterate how much increased investments in education and training are needed."
"The opening of European mobility programmes to all young people, irrespective of their course or social background, is crucial in order to give them better access to the labour market."
"It is time for the Member States to genuinely commit in order to guarantee high quality training for all young Europeans."
"Since young people are the future of Europe, and since it would be irresponsible not to make them a priority when they are experiencing an unemployment rate of around 20%, I enthusiastically supported the Zver report on improving education and training systems in Europe."
"For a number of students, confronted with ever higher demands on the part of employers, entering the labour market is often a genuine ordeal."
"That is why the European Parliament has very warmly welcomed the proposals in the 'Youth on the Move' report: increasing investment in higher education, developing international mobility programmes, recognising informally acquired competences, combating early school-leaving and supporting young people in entering the labour market."
"Commitment to education and training to improve young Europeans' qualifications is a key objective of the Europe 2020 strategy, and an instrument that I consider essential to combating unemployment and encouraging entrepreneurship."
"I therefore welcome the Youth on the Move initiative, in particular, its aspect of supporting and encouraging student mobility, and of recognising qualifications, as well as the importance ascribed to non-formal and informal education, which are often as important as formal learning or even more so."
"If Europe wants to successfully achieve the ambitious objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, which place particular stress on innovation, research and training, it will have to invest in better qualified young people, opting for forms of education that are more geared towards future incorporation into the labour market and paying particular attention to knowledge that really prepares young people for the future."
"This report is on the 'Youth on the Move' initiative, which will eventually be, it is hoped, a framework for improving education and training systems."
"This is one of the seven flagship initiatives of the Europe 2020 strategy, whose interlinked priorities are smart, sustainable and inclusive growth."
"This initiative comprises 28 key actions and concrete measures to increase the education and training of young people through mobility and employability, working towards the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy to reduce the school drop-out rate to below 10%, to increase the level of tertiary education from 31% to 40% by 2020, and to reduce unemployment - youth unemployment in particular - that is currently at around 21%."
"Therefore, and as I am an advocate of the youth training scheme 'Your first EURES job', I could not agree more with the proposals outlined in the report, and I voted for it, aware that the EU should continue, and strengthen, all measures in support of our young people."
"That is the only way we will achieve a Europe that is stronger and more founded on solidarity and inclusiveness."
"The subject matter of this report and its scope mean that it inevitably ends up tackling important issues, in some cases correctly, in others, incorrectly or very insufficiently; it is contradictory in some places."
"It mentions, specifically in the recitals, important issues like the decline of public investment in higher education, the increase in fees and the consequent widening social gap, but this issue is not properly taken up in the body of the resolution."
"It also mentions the problems many young people have in taking part in mobility programmes for financial reasons, the problem of high drop-out rates from school, and of unemployment and insecure jobs amongst young people."
"This makes its contradictions more obvious: by endorsing the objectives of the so-called Europe 2020 strategy, it ends up advocating the path that leads to the problems it identifies, of unsecure jobs and unemployment for young people."
"On the one hand, it advocates the end of discrimination against young people in the workplace."
"On the other hand, its mention of work experience placements implicitly opens the door to a different status for these workers, and it is wrong as regards 'protection arrangements for atypical and insecure jobs'."
"For these reasons, we abstained from the final vote."
"It is not enough to express interesting principles if you do not take reality into account."
"A quality education from the earliest years of life is necessary to ensure the development of the human being and of societies."
"However, funds for quality public education are increasingly short, and students are faced with a lack of grants, unemployed families and dropping out of their studies, as is happening in Portugal with the restrictive policies that are being practised."
"The reality, then, is a sharp divestment in these areas."
"In the name of the crisis, there is a retreat of the state that, here too, threatens its social role and has the result of exacerbating inequalities in access to education, to knowledge and to culture."
"The result is the multiplication and deepening of social inequalities."
"The reality in Member States such as Portugal is the closure of thousands of schools, increasing youth unemployment and reducing the job security of thousands of teachers, as well as the chronic underfunding of the state higher education system and the increased cost of attending it."
"The reality is that budgets for culture are being slashed to penury levels."
"The most serious aspect of all this is that the situation will be exacerbated if the aggressive programme of intervention drawn up by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the European Central Bank (ECB) and European Commission is implemented."
"The Youth on the Move programme is an initiative that is central to the EU 2020 strategy."
"The aims of the Youth on the Move programme are to encourage higher education in the Union, to improve the quality of education and training, and to promote student mobility by improving the effectiveness of existing European programmes."
"This report adds a key element to a European policy that must aim to provide young Europeans with the tools to be more competitive on a labour market that has become increasingly globalised."
"Focusing on student mobility has to be the first step in giving more employment opportunities to our young people."
"Unfortunately, the figures on youth employment in many Member States must be a cause for concern and reflection."
"Supporting young people by encouraging dialogue between the European institutions and youth organisations is a good start, but it cannot be considered the ultimate aim."
"We should be able to listen to them and to give them credibility and trust."
"Only this way will we be able to create a Europe which the new generations will see as an opportunity and not as a millstone."
"in writing. - I voted for the Zver report."
"In order for the EU 2020 'Youth on the Move' (YoM) flagship initiative to be successful, EU Institutions must create a pragmatic, comprehensive and wide-ranging policy supported by all Member States which focuses on connecting the areas of vocational education, professional qualifications, lifelong learning and apprenticeship to the labour market so as to ensure that each Member State will truly take ownership of the EU's education system."
"YoM is about making the transition from learning and training into the labour market easier for Europe's young people."
"One of the goals of this policy initiative is to reduce the number of early school leavers and increase the proportion of people with tertiary education qualifications, the reason being that early school leaving runs counter to the dynamics and needs of the labour market and is also in direct conflict with Europe's economic and social sustainability in general."
"Consequently, all labour market players, including those from the professional sectors, businesses, trade unions, ministries and public employment services, should engage in a structured dialogue on how to guarantee professional integration of the young, promote formal/informal training and ultimately develop an education system in the EU which is able to provide career security for our young people."
"This report once again shows how important it is for European development to promote the mobility of our young people in all fields."
"The alignment of study programmes and corresponding mutual recognition must be achieved in all areas of training and education, in particular, in manual trades, where there is a lot of ground to make up."
"There should also be more checking by the competent educational authorities in the countries concerned of whether additional barriers need to be removed where these have been built up at the administration level or at the level of the trade associations."
"Mobility on the part of apprentices also leads to better recognition of many trades and impedes social dumping, as there is a progressive scale that means that, for the same level of training, the same pay is awarded."
"Popular common sense says that 'travel broadens the mind'."
"It is from this perspective that I support the idea, defended in the Zver report, that the funding of young people's education and mobility is an investment in Europe's future, not an additional burden on the budget, this despite the current difficult economic situation."
"What is more, someone's social background or financial situation should not restrict their accessing the opportunities of travelling abroad."
"Similarly, disability should not be an obstacle either, and that is why additional funding should be set aside for young people with disabilities."
"Finally, legally binding rights should be established in order to prevent the casual jobs and exploitation to which young trainees could fall victim."
"I voted in favour of this document because it recognises that it is essential to overcome practical obstacles and barriers to mobility and further promote recognition of time spent abroad and of qualifications from other EU countries."
"Moreover, it acknowledges that people with disabilities face even more barriers to mobility than those who are not disabled and additional mechanisms should be put in place to ensure they are provided with the same opportunities as anyone else."
"Furthermore, students with families (e.g. with children) should also be afforded additional support to overcome the unique challenges they will face in participating in educational mobility."
"Quality mobility is key to achieving intercultural learning, personal development and multilingualism for young people."
"The focus is on employment as an end result and, indeed, employment is a problem of education, but also of youth participation and active citizenship."
"Therefore, the existing programmes should continue to focus on active citizenship and the development of key competences, non-formal education and the promotion of European civil society."
"In order to avoid this new strategy from simply existing as a concept, it is essential that the Member States commit to it both in terms of financial support and its national implementation in their respective countries, and that an EU budget is adopted for it."
"Member States should see this as a long-term investment, not only in young people's education, but in the future prosperity of their individual countries and of the EU as a whole."
"My support for the 'Youth on the Move' programme goes without saying and is based on principle."
"However, we have tried to suggest additions to the Commission's proposal, which we regarded as necessary."
"Indeed, in the report adopted without any problem in the Committee on Culture and Education and during the European Parliament plenary session, we stressed how important it is for Member States to be involved in the implementation process and to be monitored by the European Commission."
"We also called for successful programmes, such as Lifelong Learning, to receive more funding in the new multiannual financial framework, and for better coordination between programmes."
"The appropriate attention should be focused on young people, who are at the heart of this umbrella programme, and jobs and opportunities for affirmation should be created for them because they are the European citizens on whom we will be depending in the future."
"In a Europe that looks to the future, thinking about young people must be a priority."
"Allowing them to follow the most suitable educational pathway, to make it easy for them to learn foreign languages, to approach the world of work equipped with the appropriate skills, or perhaps to enter a new educational or working environment, means building a future for all the countries of the European Union through the energies of university students and young workers, who come together in the same economic and cultural melting pot."
"Today, more than ever, I believe in one Europe - a hotbed of ideas and projects - which is why I voted in favour of the report by Mr Zver."
"In terms of the EU 2020 strategy, creating a network of knowledge and opportunities, not just for young people but also for teachers and for all those who work in education and training, means supplying oxygen to those energies that we must unleash, using the mobility of our young people, who must learn to live in the Europe of the future."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of Milan Zver's report 'Youth on the Move - a framework for improving Europe's education and training systems'."
"Throughout this report, I think that it is important to support the various programmes that have been introduced at European level to facilitate youth mobility, which are beneficial both in terms of acquiring new knowledge and competences and in terms of developing a genuine European citizenship."
"At European level, it is important that, beyond 2013, we increase the credits allocated to European mobility programmes, such as Erasmus and Leonardo da Vinci, and make them permanent so more young people can benefit from them - not just students, but also trainees, young professionals and young farmers."
"I also think that it is necessary to move towards greater recognition of qualifications obtained through all the various types of apprenticeship, non-formal or informal, given the competences that can be acquired in this way."
"Finally, I want to stress that one of the key ways of combating youth unemployment is to keep adapting educational and vocational training systems to the constantly evolving needs of the labour market."
"The question of education and training systems is currently taking on a completely different and a new significance than was the case, for example, a decade or more ago."
"In different parts of Europe, we are faced with levels of education which are not the same, so the need to improve the situation in this area seems beyond question."
"It is important that young people have the chance to play an active role in the world of work, and also in civil society in its broadest sense."
"I myself am strongly involved in and support work related both to Youth in Action and the European Voluntary Service, which is one of the five operational actions of 'Youth in Action'."
"Therefore, I think it is important for the European Parliament to be able to continue to support similar measures."
"At the present time, we must not forget young people."
"They should be given the chance to develop and they should be helped, so that they can acquire new skills in an economy which is becoming increasingly international."
"Youth on the Move is not only an opportunity for young people to become active and to get into work, but is, above all, a way for them to overcome their own limitations and weaknesses, and is a chance to develop."
"This is why I endorsed Mr Zver's report. Thank you."
"in writing. - I voted for this report."
"Youth on the Move (YoM) is one of seven flagship initiatives contained in the Commission's Europe 2020 strategy to promote smart, sustainable and inclusive economic growth."
"YoM comprises 28 key actions and concrete measures to increase the education and training of young people through mobility and ease their transition from education into the labour market."
"This is particularly important today as young people, being one of the social groups hit hardest by the global financial crisis and simultaneously having had the smallest role in causing it, must be supported in entering the labour market in order to secure their own futures, as well as to bolster the economy."
"Young people are tomorrow's decision makers, and it is vital that they are able to develop the competences, skills and knowledge today that will allow them actively to contribute to the growth and sustained future of the European Union over the coming years and achieve the goals set out in the EU's growth strategy."
"In the context of the Europe 2020 strategy, young people's knowledge and skills are essential if the objectives of smart, inclusive and sustainable growth are to be achieved."
"As such, youth has a key role to play in achieving the five EU headline targets for 2020: employment, research and innovation, climate and energy, education, and the fight against poverty."
"The 'Youth on the Move' flagship initiative of the Europe 2020 strategy aims to enhance the attractiveness of higher education in Europe, the overall quality of all levels of education and training and student and worker mobility through the more effective use of existing European programmes."
"It is therefore essential to vote for this initiative, so that in the future, we will have young people who are increasingly qualified and prepared to realise the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy."
"The 'Youth on the Move' initiative emphasises mobility for learning purposes, but it is also vital to ensure that the teaching young people receive meets the needs of the labour market and, as a result, it is vital to give them the skills and knowledge they will need."
"Young people are, unfortunately, one of the social groups worst hit by the global financial crisis and should be given assistance to enter the labour market and to be able to shape their own future and support the economy."
"Education and training are key factors for greater prosperity and greater social cohesion in Europe."
"Student mobility is clearly a central component of the Europe 2020 strategy."
"It offers many opportunities for students' intellectual emancipation, for combating early school leaving, unemployment and poverty, as well as for the development of international cooperation in higher education but also in vocational education and training."
"Moreover, student mobility is one of the major challenges of European integration."
"Nonetheless, this mobility should take place with financial resources that measure up to ambitions and with the removal of the practical obstacles to this mobility."
"The effects of the global economic crisis were drastic for young people, in particular, right around the world, but also within the EU."
"Youth unemployment within the EU has reached a high of 21%."
"This is compounded by the fact that 15% of these young people dropped out of school and thus lack any qualifications for the labour market."
"The EU has a target of reducing this rate to 10% by 2020 and increasing the proportion of people with a qualification from a university or technical college from 31% to 40%."
"In order to be able to achieve these targets, there must be EU-wide recognition of education and training courses and qualifications."
"This is also the only way that greater mobility of our young people can be achieved, something which is also intended to help them become acquainted with new cultures and societies so that they also have the option of making a success of themselves beyond their home country in years to come."
"For that reason, barriers that are still in place need to be removed and procedures simplified, while existing programmes need to be expanded and promoted."
"I abstained in the vote, as I believe that there has been no discussion of how to bring about mutual recognition of qualifications obtained through qualitatively differing methods of education and training."
"This especially applies to the skilled trades, for which there is no uniform standard across Europe against which qualifications can be measured."
"For young people in particular, there were grave consequences of the global economic crisis, namely, serious rises in the youth unemployment and school drop-out rates."
"Young people often find themselves with no prospects."
"Against this backdrop, it is important to increase the mobility of young people in the EU so that, where necessary, they will have more chance of finding work on another labour market."
"The basis for this is the mutual recognition of qualifications and courses of education and training."
"I abstained from the vote on this report as it fails to propose any tangible solutions to the issue of how mutual recognition is to take place where, of course, in many fields, there are qualitatively highly differing methods of education and training."
"European Union Member States are facing a high rate of youth unemployment."
"In some countries, it is even touching 21%."
"That is double the average unemployment rate for adults."
"I voted in favour of this report because it provides guidelines on how to improve young people's education and reduce the youth unemployment rate."
"I agree with the report's provision that it is very important to focus on the creation of new programmes that would allow young people to combine work with studies."
"This is crucial for students who are seeking an education, but who have to support themselves financially."
"One of the programme's key objectives is to reduce the number of people leaving school early, which increases the risk of future exclusion from both employment and society."
"We must increase support for people with disabilities and young people with children, so that they can participate in mobility programmes and take advantage of this opportunity to strike a study-work-life balance."
"Access to mobility programmes should be possible not only for university students, but also for young people with a low level of qualifications and school pupils."
"It is also vital for young people to gain more practical knowledge and experience through high quality compulsory traineeships."
"The emblematic initiative 'Youth on the Move' is one of the seven flagship initiatives included in the European Commission's EU 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth."
"It focuses on the mobility of students, but its added value lies in the fact that it also anticipates education that corresponds to the needs of the labour market and provides the skills and knowledge needed."
"However, this initiative needs to be combined with the report entitled 'An EU strategy for Youth', which was adopted by the European Parliament in 2010 and which seeks to set out a new, strong, European strategy for the next ten years, so that, when it comes to youth issues, Europe can develop a single policy framework."
"Moreover, in order to ensure that it does not remain a simple pronouncement, the responsibility generally lies with the Member States and it is a pity that the recent national reform programmes do not tally with the objectives set in the EU 2020 strategy, despite the fact that we all recognise that investment in research and education is a long-term investment with a good return which clearly reaches forward into the future prosperity of European citizens."
"in writing. - (PT) This report is on establishing a framework for improving Europe's education and training systems."
"This measure is one of the key actions of the 'Youth on the Move' initiative, which is part of the European Commission's Europe 2020 strategy to promote smart, sustainable and inclusive economic growth."
"It aims, through concrete measures, to promote the education and training of young people through mobility, and through facilitating their transition from education to the labour market."
"This is a very current issue given that young people, as one of the social groups most affected by the global financial crisis and one of the groups least involved in causing this situation, must be supported in terms of labour market access in order to safeguard their future and to boost the economy."
"Indeed, mobility itself may function as an engine for the transition from education to the labour market."
"I therefore consider ensuring the provision of high quality education and simultaneously making it accessible to all young people to be among the most important aspects of mobility in education."
"For these reasons, I voted in favour of this report."
"in writing. - The Youth on The Move (YoM) programme represents an opportunity to unleash the potential of young people and enable them to contribute to smart, sustainable and inclusive growth in the EU."
"The YoM initiative supports lifelong learning and the 'new skills for new jobs' initiative of the European Commission."
"YoM looks to improve higher level education within Europe and to improve student and worker mobility through existing European programmes."
"Part of the EU 2020 strategy states that 'by 2020, all young people in Europe must have the possibility to spend a part of their educational pathway in other Member States'."
"The current economic crisis has badly affected young people, and youth unemployment rates in the EU are twice the average for adults."
"This is one of the most difficult challenges facing Europe and it is vital that Member States do not respond by cutting investment in education."
"We need to ensure that our young people have opportunities to learn and to move abroad to continue their learning if they wish, as investing in education today will better equip the EU to face challenges in the future."
"At a time when young people are being hit particularly hard by the effects of the global financial crisis, everything must be done to ensure that they can develop the skills, qualifications and knowledge that will enable them to contribute actively to the growth and sustainable future of the European Union."
"The 'Youth on the Move' initiative is one of the seven flagship initiatives of the European Commission's Europe 2020 strategy for promoting smart, sustainable and inclusive growth."
"It comprises 28 key actions and concrete measures to increase the education and training of young people through mobility and ease their transition from education into the labour market."
"It is therefore very important that conditions be created to ensure its effective implementation and the achievement of the objectives to which this initiative is devoted."
"The recession is hitting European youth full in the face: whereas one young person out of five is out of work, 40% of young workers are on a part-time contract."
"In this context, I lend my support to Mr Zver's report, which proposes a series of recommendations aimed at improving the education and professional training systems for young people."
"While we need to act in order to encourage the take-up of higher education by the greatest number and actively fight against early school leaving - only 31% of Europeans have a university degree, compared to 40% in the United States and 50% in Japan - we also need to make sure graduates are employable."
"This report contains several proposals to achieve this: improving communication between businesses and universities, making university programmes and structures more relevant to specific needs in the labour market, introducing into study programmes periods of high quality work experience that are fairly remunerated and respect the young person's social rights."
"in writing. - Funding for programmes such as Lifelong Learning (Erasmus, Leonardo da Vinci, Comenius, Grundtvig), Marie Curie, Erasmus Mundus and Youth in Action must increase."
"The committee proposes to create international cooperation networks at universities, making use of virtual mobility."
"Mobility programmes should be available to vocational students, teachers and youth workers."
"We call for EU-wide recognition of school, vocational and university qualifications."
"We also insist on the importance of learning two non-native languages from an early age, including those of neighbouring countries."
"Finally, we call for extra support for disabled young people, young parents and those who wish to get back into education."
"I voted in favour of this report because it highlights how important it is for young people to have a multidisciplinary education, as far as the targets of the EU 2020 strategy are concerned."
"In this framework, it becomes necessary to encourage young people to continue their studies to university level."
"In fact, entering the world of work too early increases the risk of unemployment later on, and of a comparatively low standard of living."
"This could therefore have high economic and social costs, as well as a negative impact on the Union's sustainable economic growth and on its ability to improve its global competitiveness in the future."
"For the same reasons, I believe that a multicultural, multilingual and practical education is essential for shaping the citizens of the future, especially if this is achieved by means of mobility schemes such as Youth on the Move."
"Currently, too many young people are dropping out of school too early and not enough are taking advantage of higher education."
"This undermines the stock of qualifications that Europe will need in the future."
"Youth on the Move seeks to increase opportunities for educational mobility for all Europe's young people by 2020, enabling them to progress more smoothly from education to the world of work, by giving them an education that prepares them for the demands of the market."
"For these reasons, we should make schools and businesses more aware of the need to create networks, improving young people's practical knowledge by means of apprenticeships."
"This initiative is centred around young people, but we must not forget those young people with disabilities, who must be guaranteed the same opportunities for study and work."
"I endorsed the report on improving Europe's education and training systems."
"I am in favour of extending the operation of all educational programmes for young people."
"Besides Youth on the Move, funding and political support should be given to programmes such as Erasmus, Leonardo da Vinci, Comenius, Grundtvig, Youth in Action and Marie Curie."
"These programmes have achieved great success in the Union."
"They involve a huge number of young people from various backgrounds (the number of Polish students who went abroad on an Erasmus grant between 1998 and 2010 was 93 807) and they contribute to the development of young people's potential and the creation of a strong European civil society."
"They are very efficient programmes, where the cost for a single participant is very low but the funds are used by a high number of people."
"Promoting the mobility of young people requires practical barriers to be overcome."
"Around one third of the students who have participated in the Erasmus programme have experienced difficulties arising from uncertainties over the system of education in other countries and the lack of correspondence and continuity between the subjects of study in the home country and abroad."
"The recognition of time spent abroad and of qualifications from other EU Member States should be promoted."
"Other matters which also need to be resolved include difficulties with obtaining visas, medical papers being in various languages and the portability of scholarships when going abroad."
"People with disabilities face even more barriers to mobility than those who are not disabled."
"Additional mechanisms should be put in place to ensure they are provided with the same opportunities as anyone else."
"The 'Youth on the Move' initiative is one of the seven that are part of the Europe 2020 strategy."
"It is made up of 28 key actions to improve the education and training of young people through mobility and bringing them into the labour market."
"The relevance of this report in austere times for Europe is proven by the increasing proportion of young people who are unemployed in the various Member States, with the conclusion being that this age group is one of the hardest hit by the global financial crisis."
"As such, I consider it essential to apply measures to reduce early school drop-out rates, to increase the number of graduates, and to make education and professional training more attractive."
"Commitment to education should not be seen as a cost, but rather as an investment in the future."
"I therefore believe that it is important to reinvest in already existing mobility and education/training programmes, and to establish European-level minimum conditions for work experience placements, since these should not be seen as employment, but rather as the acquisition of practical skills."
"Finally, I would stress the need to coordinate measures with national, regional and local authorities, in the form of partnerships, in order to make the 'Youth on the Move' initiative a success."
"I voted in favour of the report by Mr Milan Zver on the Commission initiative 'Youth on the Move'."
"Its objective is to ensure that measures are taken to combat the problems of early school leavers and to provide incentives to increase the number of Europeans with a higher education."
"Reference is also made to the huge importance of ensuring that the education provided meets the needs of the labour market and provides the skills and knowledge needed by the young people of Europe."
"Creating a secure future for our young people is a subject close to my heart."
"Sadly, the prospects for young people in Lithuania today are rather bleak."
"In Lithuania, youth unemployment stands at 34%, almost 14% higher than the EU average."
"According to EU statistics, there are only two EU Member States where youth unemployment rates are higher than in Lithuania."
"Even those young Lithuanians who manage to find work are often forced to accept unfavourable employment contracts."
"We must make more effort to implement three key priorities: firstly, to promote entrepreneurship; secondly, to improve youth employability by adapting education to the needs of the labour market; and thirdly, to give young people an opportunity to play a more active role in society."
"The Youth on the Move initiative is one of the platforms which may help to promote youth employment."
"Work and study abroad may be beneficial to Lithuania's young people and our country."
"However, it is much more important to give our young people a European future in Lithuania."
"It is possible to ensure this by developing contacts between young people and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)."
"This would promote the need for young people among SME employers and would encourage young people to work for SMEs."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this resolution because ensuring that young citizens can travel and work throughout the EU is essential in order to boost competitiveness."
"EU 2020 objectives can be achieved by investing in programmes that provide young people with a wide variety of opportunities and promote labour market mobility."
"By increasing the funding for projects that support youth mobility and increasing the focus on the cooperation between business and education, young Europeans will have a better chance of career success."
"It is also vitally important to support young people who are no longer in mainstream education by encouraging non-formal and informal education."
"I abstained when voting on this report, despite the critical look it takes at European policies, particularly those carried out by the Member States, aimed at young people."
"This report contains a number of positive proposals, in particular, regarding the participation of young people in the process of drafting European youth policies, the enhancement of informal and non-formal education, and an improvement to trainees' status."
"However, beyond the stated desire to encourage the Member States to step up their investments in the area of education independently from the financial crisis, the report is in the spirit of the policies aimed at liberalising higher education and subordinating it to the sole immediate interests of the market and thus of companies."
"Some provisions, such as the introduction of a European system of loans for students, in partnership with the EIB, are even worrying given the objectives set in terms of access to university by the greatest number."
"By voting in favour of the 'Youth on the Move' programme - a framework aimed at improving education and training systems in Europe - I wanted to support an ambitious action plan in favour of young Europeans."
"The Treaty of Lisbon has broadened the EU's remit in the area of youth."
"In this respect, the European Parliament had a duty to reaffirm its support for this policy."
"Indeed, European identity only has meaning if it is endorsed by our young fellow citizens."
"Europe must take on this responsibility by proposing a concerted strategy in the areas of training and employment."
"I welcome the ambition of this report, which sets at 2% of GDP the investment in higher education."
"At a time when the European labour market has been affected by a major economic crisis, training must be our priority so that we are able to offer future prospects to young people and make accessing employment easier for them."
"The development of European exchanges (Erasmus, Leonardo da Vinci) will also be beneficial for young people, since these programmes offer real added value on a professional and personal level."
"Learning a new language and discovering another culture are both assets that should be accessible to all."
"Promoting smart, sustainable and inclusive economic growth necessarily implies the best possible opportunities and chances in education and training."
"Mobility whilst studying, facilitated by EU programmes such as Erasmus, Leonardo da Vinci and Comenius, promotes not only the aspects of formal education, but also personal and social development."
"I therefore voted in favour of this report."
"I am voting for this proposal, as pre-school end early-childhood education are provided in accordance with various traditions throughout the European continent, making the creation of a universal European system for early-childhood education difficult."
"It is easier to implement common goals and objectives in order to consistently harmonise practices."
"Children's early learning lays the foundations for their successful lifelong learning."
"Children in their earliest years are particularly curious, receptive and willing to learn, with this being the age at which the ability to speak and express themselves is formed."
"It is also at this age that the foundations for children's future educational and professional careers are laid, as well as for the development of their social skills."
"This period is critical for cognitive, sensory and motor development, affective and personal development and language acquisition, and also provides the basis for lifelong learning."
"I should stress that the early development of healthy lifestyle behaviours, such as good nutritional habits and appropriate and balanced exercise, can have a profound impact on physical and mental development."
"The European Union is made up of a rich and diverse mix of educational traditions, with early years education provided in a number of different ways across the continent."
"I voted for this report which, although it acknowledges that an EU approach to early childhood education services would be difficult to implement, encourages the development of a single European framework comprising shared goals and values, including shared entitlements and structures."
"I voted in favour of this report."
"Children's early learning lays the foundation for successful lifelong learning, which is central to the achievement of the Europe 2020 targets, which seek to create a knowledge-based society, raise employment, lower school drop out rates and reduce poverty."
"However, these objectives cannot be achieved unless all children are given an adequate start in life."
"The Member States must increase investment, ensuring accessible and quality early years education for all children, which can help reduce early school leaving, combat the educational disadvantages faced by children from vulnerable social and cultural groups and reduce the resulting social inequalities."
"I voted for Mrs Honeyball's report."
"Europe is made up of a rich and diverse mix of educational traditions."
"This necessitates the development of a European framework comprising shared goals, entitlements and values."
"The Europe 2020 strategy must be focused on creating an inclusive society by increasing employment."
"Lowering school dropout rates and reducing poverty can only be achieved by providing all children with a future paving the way to a better life."
"I wish to remind you of the importance of early years activities, especially foreign languages."
"Cultural activities are a vital source of enrichment for children by promoting intercultural dialogue."
"Last but not least, the variety of families' differing living conditions must be taken into account."
"In this regard, we need flexible and innovative early childhood education programmes."
"Early childhood education is fundamental."
"I totally support the aims previously set out to provide childcare services by 2010 to at least 90% of children between three years of age and the mandatory school age and to at least 33% of children under three years of age."
"Europe is made up of a rich and diverse mix of educational traditions, with early years education provided in a host of different ways across the whole continent."
"There is a clear variation between Member States in terms of the quality and supply of their provision, rates of enrolment, approach to services, governance of services, and so on. For this reason, a 'one size fits all' approach at EU level to early childhood education and care (ECEC) services is not suitable and would be difficult to implement."
"However, the development of a common framework of shared goals and values, including shared entitlements and structures, is more than recommended."
"The period from birth to the age of three is critical for children's brain development, physical and cognitive development, and for language acquisition."
"Furthermore, these early years lay the foundations for children's lifelong learning."
"Poor families are less likely to use ECEC services, especially in privatised markets, compared with other groups."
"This is worrying, given that disadvantaged children are those who have been shown to benefit most from access to services of this kind."
"in writing. - This is a very pertinent issue, and I strongly support the group line in focusing on Early Years Learning."
"Building strong foundations in terms of education and care during children's early lives, as a complement to the central role of the family, constitutes the crucial basis for success in terms of learning throughout their lives, social integration, personal development and future employability."
"Children's earliest experiences are the basis for all subsequent learning, conditioning children's development, and helping reverse potential situations of disadvantage and transmission of poverty from generation to generation."
"By giving children the ability to realise their potential, quality education and care structures can contribute significantly to achieving two of the major objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy: reducing early school drop-out rates below 10% and lifting at least 20 million people out of poverty and social exclusion."
"I therefore support the development of a European structure composed of common goals and values that includes shared rights and structures, which will contribute to coming up with adequate early-childhood education and care services; these must benefit from effective and equitable financing."
"It is well known that children in their earliest years are particularly curious, receptive and willing to learn, with this being the age at which the ability to speak and express themselves is formed, along with social skills."
"Since children's early learning lays the foundations for their successful lifelong learning, a key process for achieving the Europe 2020 objectives, I think that the Europe 2020 strategy, which seeks to create an inclusive society by increasing employment, lowering school dropout rates and reducing poverty, cannot be achieved unless all children are given an adequate start in life."
"I voted for the report on Early Years Learning as I argue that parental leave is an essential component during the early years of a child's life."
"Responding adequately to children's needs necessitates the defence of improved maternity, paternity and parental leave conditions, thereby putting both parents at the very heart of their children's education."
"As I said regarding the Youth on the Move initiative, education is an essential instrument in ensuring the realisation of the ambitious objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy."
"That is not just true for secondary and tertiary education, but also for the first things learned, from the very beginning, in early childhood."
"It is essential that European children have access to a quality education that prepares them in a challenging way for the basic skills of speaking their mother tongue, of mathematics and of one or more foreign languages."
"This education must also enable them to acquire the methods of work necessary to successfully pursue their studies, and to become as productive as we want young Europeans to be."
"This report is on early years learning in the European Union."
"We all know that you build a house from the foundations up."
"When the foundations are bad, there is a risk that the building might not be sound and could collapse."
"The same is true for education."
"An education with a robust, quality foundation guarantees Europeans a better future."
"Intervention during a child's early years is crucial to its future, improving health and family relations, and enabling it to get a better job in the future."
"Early years learning is a very important issue that has not received the attention it is due from lawmakers."
"The preparation of human resources is more important than the quality of buildings."
"The quality of the professional services and the qualifications of those working in the sector need to be improved."
"I agree that values and parameters common to all the Member States should be set out, so I voted for this report."
"This report focuses on the crucial issue of early years learning, and its positive impact in terms of cognitive, motor, behavioural, affective and emotional development."
"These are determinants of children's healthy and balanced mental and physical growth."
"Some important issues are acknowledged in the report's preamble, such as the link between a poor and disadvantaged background and low educational achievement, or the major difficulties many households have in reconciling family obligations with deregulated working hours and insecure jobs."
"Regrettably, these issues are forgotten further on: the proposals necessary to correct these situations are not made."
"As something essential to social development and combating poverty, early years learning should be founded on the guarantee of a pre-school network that is public, free, high quality and accessible to all."
"Education cannot be at the mercy of the logic of the market."
"In order to provide the prospect of a better life and future, a public network of crèches needs to be created, covering a wider geographic area and more open to models of teaching that encourage the development of the child and of society, and that combat social segregation and discrimination."
"The issue of early years learning is the key subject of this report, which focuses on its positive impact in terms of cognitive, motor, behavioural, affective and emotional development."
"These are determinants of children's healthy and balanced mental and physical growth."
"Some important issues are acknowledged in the report's preamble, such as the link between a poor and disadvantaged background and low educational achievement, or the major difficulties many households have in reconciling family obligations with deregulated working hours and insecure jobs."
"Regrettably, these issues are forgotten further on: the proposals necessary to correct these situations are not made."
"As something essential to social development and combating poverty, early years learning should be founded on the guarantee of a pre-school network that is public, free, high quality and accessible to all."
"Education cannot be at the mercy of the logic of the market."
"In order to provide the prospect of a better life and future, a public network of crèches and nursery schools needs to be created, covering a wider geographic area and more open to models of teaching that encourage the development of the child and of society, and that combat social segregation and discrimination."
"Both the submitted reports and the debate so far consider culture and education from a variety of perspectives."
"I consider the development of creativity right from birth to be a very important aspect."
"The report by Mrs Honeyball points out that, from many perspectives, it is best to make a start with education in the early years."
"According to the human rights documents currently in force in Europe, children are fully and actively engaged citizens with their own rights."
"They have enormous creative potential."
"The period from birth to the age of three has a fundamental effect on the development of thinking, and on physical and cognitive development."
"The foundations for lifelong learning, which play an important role in achieving the Lisbon targets, are also laid in this early period."
"Poor families, often Roma, usually have worse access to services in the area of early childhood education and care."
"It is all the more sad for the fact that children from disadvantaged families should benefit the most from the opportunity to use these services."
"We must ensure that education and care are available to all families and children, regardless of their origin or the financial situation of the parents."
"I very much dislike resorting to pragmatic, financial arguments in questions of human rights, and in matters that should be obvious and as independent as possible of the economic situation."
"However, it must be said that a decision not to invest in this area will actually give rise to costs that may not be immediately noticeable."
"From time to time, this House produces reports whose titles leave no doubt about the fact that there will inevitably be nonsense in them!"
"The Honeyball report is one of them."
"Pass over the usual paragraphs on the fate awaiting migrants, compulsory multiculturalism and the promotion of everything in the minority."
"The gem in this report is at paragraph 14."
"Fathers and mothers are thus 'equal partners in early childhood education and care'."
"Did I read 'partners'?"
"Is it not their responsibility, first and foremost, to educate their own children?"
"However it is true that, at paragraph 16, the rapporteur is calling for investment in parental education programmes."
"From the outset, parents are thus seen as incapable, irresponsible and childish."
"This impression is confirmed by paragraph 27, which stresses that, in the absence of adequate services for early childhood, our young children run the risk of falling into criminality and antisocial behaviour."
"Your trust in the human being is astounding and one wonders how mankind has been able to manage without you until now."
"No, really, the best favour you can do for our dear little darlings is to leave them in peace!"
"I voted in favour of this document, because the early years of childhood (pre-school) are critical for cognitive, sensory and motor development and language acquisition, and also lay the foundations for lifelong learning."
"It is therefore recommended that Member States consider introducing a compulsory year of nursery schooling before the start of schooling proper."
"The introduction and retention of innovative pedagogical models for language teaching is encouraged, particularly multilingual crèches and nursery schools which meet the objective set in Barcelona in 2002, which includes the learning of regional, minority and neighbouring languages."
"In an unstable economic climate, we must not neglect to invest substantially in early childhood education and care (ECEC) services."
"I feel that the Member States should devote appropriate resources to ECEC services."
"Quality early years education can help reduce early school leaving, combat educational disadvantages faced by children from disadvantaged social and cultural groups and reduce the resulting social inequalities, all of which affect society as a whole."
"Young people from vulnerable social groups are particularly at risk."
"We must care for future generations and the quality of their education."
"While we are aware that it is both inadequate and difficult to create an approach to the care and education of young children, it is important to look at the possible implementation of what is needed and the levels at which action needs to be taken."
"By young children we mean children up to the age of six."
"This is a delicate stage in children's cerebral, physical and cognitive development, as well as their language."
"These are the years when children learn and become familiar with the tools that as adults they will use to elaborate cognitive mechanisms that are different, but necessary for their future education and work."
"I therefore voted for this report because we are talking about protecting childhood, the right of thousands of children to go to school or to be given the best possible conditions in which to learn."
"This subject is the key to the future and the development of the European Union, and for this reason we need to take the action described by Mrs Honeyball, who I would like to congratulate for her work."
"It is of paramount importance that we support a standard policy and approach between EU Member States with regard to children's early years learning."
"Access to this kind of learning has important economic, social and cultural benefits."
"Apart from having a standard EU-level policy, it is particularly important to ensure good collaboration and coordination locally between the various institutions and ministries involved in youth education programmes."
"These programmes are very important as during their early years, children have a particular ability to learn things, and they can determine children's entire educational and professional paths."
"in writing. - I voted for this report."
"In 2002, the Barcelona European Council called for EU members to provide childcare to at least 90% of children between the age of three years and mandatory school age by 2010, and to at least 33% of children under three."
"These targets signalled a labour market approach to ECEC services, based on the need identified at the time of increasing the numbers of women in work."
"While it is vital to give due attention to the link between ECEC services and equality of opportunities for women, these targets are clearly problematic, and outmoded, since they fail to take into account many of the crucial qualitative aspects of a strong early education policy."
"ECEC centres are not simply a place to 'park' children so that women can work; they are of utmost importance in contributing to the well-being of children and improving their future life chances"
"The early years period of childhood deserves great attention and a careful approach in terms of the external environment."
"We must always remember that this is a unique and unrepeatable period of development, which forms the personality of the individual."
"There should be a more intensive focus on it, and it should never be undervalued or temporarily neglected in any way."
"Adults should be a role model, thus helping children to acquire different types of knowledge and ability."
"It is the period of development of the personality, when the learning process is, so to speak, unforced and natural, and the surrounding world is noticed, accepted and absorbed to the greatest possible extent."
"Although child development involves a number of contributing factors, whether genetically based or from the external environment, it is particularly the effect of the parents and the immediate circle of people that forms the personality."
"I would also like to mention and to emphasise that we should not forget in this context adequate and all-round focused movement activity aimed precisely at this age group, which can assist in the development of the individual and contribute to better health in the future."
"Early years education has far-reaching implications on children's future development and their chances of success later on."
"Investments made during this period reduce the costs incurred later relating to health matters, the crime rate and antisocial behaviour."
"Nevertheless, the provision of early years education is unequal across the European Union."
"However, it would be difficult to implement a 'one size fits all' approach."
"I think that we need to focus rather on establishing a common framework with clearly defined objectives and values."
"According to the target set in 2002, EU Member States must offer early years education to 90% of children between the age of three and the compulsory school age."
"There is also an economic rationale behind this, given the rise in the number of women on the labour market."
"It is vital for us to involve the minority population in early years education programmes, especially the Roma population, which is often disadvantaged."
"We must also ensure that a sufficient number of childcare places are available so as to avoid long waiting times for enrolling children in this kind of institution."
"We must not overlook either the qualifications of the staff working with young children, who have a crucial impact on the quality of education provided."
"Ensuring all young children receive equal quality care and education, whatever their age and social condition, is a minimum."
"The Honeyball report, despite being otherwise commendable, dares not ask for this minimum."
"That is deplorable."
"However, since this text has no legislative consequence, it can be approved in spite of its serious shortcomings."
"It is agreed that early years learning lays the foundation for successful lifelong learning."
"Children in their earliest years are particularly curious, receptive and willing to learn, and important skills such as the ability to speak and express oneself, as well as social skills, are formed at this age."
"It is also at this age that the foundations for the child's future educational and occupational career are laid."
"We must therefore make the necessary efforts so that young children have access to the same learning conditions, without discrimination of any kind."
"The learning undertaken by children during early childhood is the foundation of the success of their lifelong learning."
"This learning sharpens the child's intelligence, stimulates his or her natural curiosity and develops his or her motor skills, puts a premium on manual work and is good for mental health."
"It socialises the child, develops his or her mother tongue and accustoms him or her to the sounds of a foreign language."
"It leads him or her to the rudiments of reading and of arithmetic."
"Nevertheless, early childhood education and care takes on different forms in the various countries of the European Union, depending on the country's interpretation of childhood."
"Early childhood education and care generally receives less attention and investment than the other education levels."
"All parents and children should be able to use education and care services, regardless of family origin or financial situation."
"Parents should, for their part, be the full partners of these services."
"The pre-school period being the most important for the child's emotional and social development, those working with these children should have the required qualifications."
"In all cases, the prime concern must be to consider the higher needs and interests of the child."
"Early childhood is unquestionably of fundamental importance to the physical, mental and social development of children, and we must therefore understand that the return on investment in pre-school education is the guarantee of future growth."
"Apart from this, many studies have already shown that funding used in this way brings considerable economic and social advantages in the medium and long-term."
"The best and most natural way to secure support of this kind is to protect the family as the basic unit of society."
"Parents are the first and most important teachers of their children, and thus the legal framework should not contain provisions which penalise families for personally caring for their children, particularly in the early years."
"Although this agenda is within the exclusive competence of Member States, it is more than desirable for the Union, through its coordinating role, to contribute towards improving the situation in the Member States."
"For the reasons mentioned, I support the position of the rapporteur."
"The motion for a resolution by the UK socialist MEP, Mary Honeyball, seeks to reduce the role of the mother and father of a child to that of equal partners in the State education system."
"Verbatim, the report states (in paragraph 14) that '[The European Parliament] stresses that parents, both mothers and fathers, are equal partners in ECEC [early childhood education and care]; (...)'."
"This wording expresses deep mistrust of the family and the globally recognised right of parents to care for and bring up their children."
"This is in direct contrast to the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany, which states that 'The care and upbringing of children is the natural right of parents and a duty primarily incumbent upon them' (Article 6(2))."
"This report is a manifestation of the EU's anti-family agenda and seeks to meddle in the social competences of the Member States."
"Moreover, the motion recommends the introduction of a compulsory year of nursery schooling before the start of schooling proper, as well as developing and improving early years educational establishments In so doing, the report confirms the EU's 'Barcelona objectives' which, as once upon a time in the Soviet Union, provide quotas for the state takeover of children's upbringing."
"The well-being of the child is not central to this motion."
"The freedom of choice of parents in relation to bringing up their children is to be undermined."
"I therefore voted against this report."
"The first three years of a child's life are crucial for the development of the brain and for language learning."
"Language acquisition is the basis of logical thinking and contextual understanding."
"Without a certain level of language acquisition, further learning is scarcely possible, as the language deficits can only be overcome with great difficulty with increasing age."
"The report observes that most immigrant children in the EU are educated without adequate linguistic knowledge."
"At the same time, it declares that migrant families (and minorities such as the Roma) make much less use of the early years education offered than other families."
"We cannot allow it to be the case that the level of our schools continues to fall and fall because so many pupils quite simply cannot understand the teaching."
"Every child - migrant or not - must have mastered the national language by the time they enter school to a degree that enables them to follow the teaching taking place there."
"The report offers no meaningful attempts to solve this problem."
"Instead, it leans towards complete nannying of the parents and a state takeover of child-rearing."
"I therefore voted against this report."
"The diversity in European educational traditions and, hence, in pre-school education, are both acceptable and welcome, as they reflect the different European cultural, historical and social aspects of a country."
"However, there is room to develop a European framework with common coordination denominators, common objectives and values and common rights and structures."
"Moreover, if the Barcelona objective stipulating that EU Member States must provide childcare for at least 90% of children aged between three and the age at which compulsory education starts, and to at least 33% of children under the age of three, is to be achieved, we need agreement between the Member States and, where possible, exchanges of information and best practices, especially by Member States with highly developed structures in pre-school education to partners with less experience in that sector."
"Early childhood care and education are made available in different ways throughout the European Union, with different definitions of 'quality', which depend significantly on the cultural values of each country and region, and on their interpretation of 'childhood'."
"Early childhood learning is the basis for successful lifelong learning, which is central to achieving the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy."
"I therefore voted in favour of the report on early childhood learning which sets out common EU objectives in pursuing the aims of the Barcelona European Council: specifically, that, by 2010, the provision of childcare should be ensured for at least 90% of children between three years old and the mandatory school age, and for 33% of children under the age of three."
"Like the rapporteur, I call for even more ambitious goals."
"This is a child-centred approach which recognises that the early childhood years are crucial to cognitive, sensory and physical development, as well as to emotional and personal development, and for language acquisition, and that they also constitute the basis for learning throughout life."
"in writing. - Access to Early Years Learning is of vital importance to young children in terms of their receptiveness and willingness to learn, especially since important skills such as the ability to speak and develop social skills are formed at a young age."
"As well as this, there is a clear link between a poor and disadvantaged background and low educational achievement."
"Therefore, we should ensure that the targets set at the Barcelona European Council of providing childcare to at least 90% of children between the age of three and the mandatory school age, and to at least 33% of children under the age of three, are met."
"Addressing educational disadvantage by providing high quality early childhood education and targeted support, and by promoting inclusive education, are absolutely necessary to create a truly inclusive society."
"Early childhood is a time crucial to children's development of a series of cognitive and social capacities, the effects of which will be felt throughout their lives."
"The aptitude for multilingualism should be remembered, for example."
"However, this stage of learning has been minimally studied, and little importance has been attached to it in the context of education overall."
"This has a negative impact on, for example, those raised in less well-off families, in which the cognitive development of children is often less stimulated."
"We therefore urgently need to increase early childhood education and care (ECEC)."
"That is why I voted for this resolution."
"The first years of childhood are crucial for children's cerebral, physical, emotional and personal development, for acquiring language, and are the foundation of lifelong learning."
"Entirely in favour of the implementation of a common European approach for early childhood learning - while respecting the diversity of each Member State's approach - I lend my support to Mrs Honeyball's report, which recommends establishing a European framework for ECEC services, highlighting common values and objectives."
"Given the critical role played by parents as 'main educators', the report seeks to improve parental leave - which should be long enough to enable parents to play their leading role in educating their children in the early stages of their life - and encourages the Member States to invest in parental education programmes as well as provide other forms of assistance to parents who require additional help."
"Of course, this requires additional investment from all 27 Member States, and I am asking them to allocate adequate resources to ECEC services."
"For me, education must be a political priority."
"in writing. - Early learning in the EU follows a long and finely differentiated tradition in the different Member States."
"It seems important to define a framework of values and common objectives which could be set as a goal in all Member States, while the sharing of good practices remains the key to providing high quality service, with the child's needs and care at the core of all endeavours."
"The report focuses its recommendations on the balance between the role of Member States and the Commission; the necessity to make early school a broader service inspired by good practices in Member States where 'maternelles' and kindergartens are a right of parents; inclusion of all children, whatever their social background ('notion of public service'); caring for migrant children and their integration in early schools; the inclusion of arts and all tools to enhance the children's creativity; training of educators for better intercultural skills; gender parity while working in structures for early learning; and creation of new and well qualified jobs."
"I voted in favour of this report because I believe that, within the European Union, individual Member States still deliver early education very differently from one another."
"We need to develop a common European framework that includes targets and shared values, as well as shared entitlements and structures."
"Children must be fully considered real, active citizens who are able to form and express their own opinions, enjoy certain rights, and who possess their own creative potential."
"In this framework, once again, parents must be considered the centre of their upbringing."
"The natural family is the ideal place for a child to grow up and develop, and, once again, allowing parents an adequate amount of leave may help to reduce the demand for places in childcare facilities."
"We must therefore take concrete action, since very few Member States currently offer periods of paid leave that are long enough to meet families' requirements."
"A child's early years learning is extremely important to its proper development and is the key to creating a stable and economically dynamic society."
"Investing in early years learning has long-term benefits for the future of our children."
"The efforts made in this report to examine the issue at European and national level are important."
"I welcome the call for more European research in this sector, the need to identify and exchange best practices at European level, and for proper use to be made of the structural funds and programmes in this direction."
"The European Council of Barcelona in 2002 had set the target of introducing, by 2010, support centres for at least 90% of children between three years of age and school age, and for at least 33% of children aged under three."
"Unfortunately, we are still a long way from these figures."
"Yet the number and quality of support centres for childcare are crucial for Europe."
"Indeed, from a very young age, caring for children, their learning and gradual awareness of their environment are of decisive importance for the next phase of their education."
"In addition, their parents do not have to give up their professional aspirations because of a lack of childcare support centres."
"Nonetheless, this report reminds us, and rightly so, that each country has a different conception of childcare and different models thereof, which we should respect."
"With this report, the European Parliament is proving that the EU, far from wanting to sacrifice childcare in the name of free competition of services, lets Member States choose their educational model."
"in writing. - Early years learning profoundly affects the life-chances of every individual."
"In particular, development in the early years of healthy lifestyle behaviours, such as good dietary habits and regular exercise, are key determinants of physical and mental health."
"Like all policies which work on the principle that 'prevention is better than cure', early years learning is also relatively cost-effective to deliver."
"I congratulate the rapporteur on a comprehensive report which raises some key points for further discussion and action."
"I endorsed the report on Early Years Learning in the EU."
"I would like to call particular attention to three matters."
"Firstly, the early years of childhood are critical for cognitive, sensory and motor development."
"Therefore, when developing comprehensive early years policies and programmes, the Member States must take account of a number of different issues which affect childhood development, such as migration, gender equality and employment."
"Secondly, centres at local level should develop action programmes which take account of differing life situations and needs in the area of early childhood education and care."
"They must also have sufficient autonomy to enable the operation of programmes for children with uniqueness and creativity."
"The next matter is the need to improve early childhood education and care services."
"We should start here by developing mechanisms for evaluating provision and ensuring that quality standards are met."
"My final observation concerns the need for universal access to childcare centres."
"Data provided by the Polish Ministry of Education show that in Poland, there are 8 400 public nursery schools and 1 600 private ones, and that there are around 1.6 million children aged from three to six years."
"This means there are nursery school places for barely 40% of these children, while there are 352 crèches in Poland, which are used by only 2% of children under three."
"This problem is one of the main reasons for the high unemployment among women."
"in writing. - I support this report as it is important to recognise the valuable contribution of early childhood education and how crucial it is to achieving the EU's 2020 strategy."
"It is a fact that there is diversity between the education systems in the EU Member States and, as a result, the research and exchanges of best practices which this particular report advocates will, in my opinion, bring about important results in terms of improving a child's early years learning in the EU."
"In fact, due to the child-oriented approach of universal rather than targeted services, the involvement of parents and the improved integration of services, I voted in favour of Mrs Honeyball's report on early learning in Europe."
"I voted in favour of this report, which recommends public policies in favour of childcare that are a step in the right direction."
"While taking into account the diversity of systems and traditions in terms of education and childcare in the EU, the report emphasises an approach centred on the needs of the child and on the impact that learning from a very young age will have on the child's schooling and personal development."
"It presents in a clear manner the issues concerning childcare and equal access to education for all and, in particular, the children of immigrant families - whatever their situation - and particularly stresses these issues within the context of fighting against poverty and social exclusion."
"It also highlights the need to provide stable employment, quality training and fair social protection to staff working in childcare."
"I voted in favour of this report."
"The rapporteur correctly placed the needs of the child at the heart of this report."
"It is not surprising that the report should conclude that a single European solution is not possible."
"All the same, we do need a 'framework' at EU level in order to be able to coordinate early years learning with other EU-level programmes such as lifelong learning."
"I am voting for the proposal of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, which considers the Fisheries Partnership Agreement (FPA) to have seemingly contributed to the overexploitation of some stocks, particularly octopus, and has therefore reduced fishing opportunities for Mauritanian fishermen and given the EU industry a competitive advantage as a result of subsidised access fees for EU vessels, I welcome the European Commission's proposal to open negotiations on the renewal of the protocol of the FPA between the EU and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania."
"I also welcome the European Commission's proposal to introduce a human rights clause into the agreement, and call on the Commission to establish a dialogue with Mauritania aiming to help the country further develop a responsible fisheries policy which meets both conservation requirements and its objective to promote the economic development of fisheries resources."
"Moreover, I call on the Commission to take urgent measures to reduce by-catch by European vessels fishing in Mauritanian waters."
"I voted in favour of this resolution."
"The protocol to the Fisheries Partnership Agreement with the Islamic Republic of Mauritania expires on 31 July 2012."
"The Mauritanian fisheries sector is extremely important to Mauritania's economy, representing 10% of the country's GDP and 35-50% of its exports."
"Therefore, the Commission intends to launch negotiations regarding its renewal."
"I welcome the renewal of this protocol, but it should include many important issues."
"Evaluations have concluded that most stocks in Mauritania are either fully exploited or over-exploited and, therefore, the Commission must discuss with Mauritania the development of long-term fisheries management plans that would include all fishery allocations by the Mauritanian authorities, to both their national fleets and third-country fleets, in order to ensure the sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources."
"I am voting in favour of this resolution because it is necessary to begin negotiations for the renewal of the protocol to the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Union and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania."
"These negotiations will allow EU-flagged vessels to fish in Mauritanian waters based on a principle of surplus stocks as described in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea."
"It is also necessary that Mauritania ratify the relevant international fisheries instruments."
"I support the resolution on the renewal of the protocol to the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the EU and Mauritania because the agreement is based on the principle of surplus, which is compatible with the EU's sustainable fishing strategy."
"Mauritania is also one of the poorest countries in the world, classified as a Heavily Indebted Poor Country."
"For this reason, this agreement is extremely important to Mauritania because the European Union is paying for this access, thereby providing additional income separate from financial aid."
"I welcome the Commission's proposal to open negotiations on the renewal of the protocol between the EU and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania."
"This country has been losing value added because of the lack of opportunity to exploit its own fisheries resources."
"It is therefore necessary to study all the economic implications of this, particularly in economic and social terms."
"It is essential to bear in mind that the fisheries sector is extremely important to the Mauritanian economy, and that this is one of the poorest countries in Africa, which is financially dependent on foreign aid and subject to severe political instability."
"I voted for the motion for a resolution tabled today by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) because of all these factors, which require the special attention given to them in this legislative text."
"I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution on the EU-Mauritania Fisheries Partnership Agreement because I consider the renewal of the agreement, which should include a human rights clause, positive."
"I think it is necessary to continue helping the country further to develop a responsible fisheries policy which meets requirements regarding conservation of fisheries resources."
"As the protocol to the current Fisheries Partnership Agreement will expire in the future, the Commission's intention to open renewal negotiations with the other party is logical."
"Mauritania is a poor country that is highly dependent on the sector, so keeping the agreement with the European Union could be beneficial to both signatories."
"Like the rapporteur, I think that there is a need for rigorous assessment of the current state of stocks and of the various types of fish in Mauritanian waters."
"This joint motion for a resolution of the European Parliament concerns renewal of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, which expires on 31 July 2012."
"The European Commission, aware of the importance of the renewal of this partnership, and under the terms of the Council mandate, has launched a process aimed at renewing this protocol, fully pursuant to Article 218 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
"The current agreement with Mauritania has been contributing to the economic development of Mauritania, where the fisheries sector is one of the fundamental pillars of the economy, representing almost 10% of gross domestic product (GDP), 29% of national budget revenue and almost 50% of exports."
"However, it is also essential to the European Union, and to its fishing fleets in particular."
"I agree with this proposal, for which I voted, but I think that catch control needs to be scientifically monitored, navigation control systems need to be modernised and wrecks need to be cleaned."
"Surveillance should also be strengthened and illegal vessels impounded."
"This resolution raises a number of important issues, in line with our longstanding questions, criticisms and suggestions as regards fisheries partnership agreements; in particular, their serious lack of success with their development cooperation objectives."
"We welcome the fact that a number of the points from our resolution have been included in this joint motion for a resolution."
"Amongst the most important aspects, we would stress: the need for a comprehensive and detailed evaluation of the reasons for the inadequate achievement of the objectives regarding development cooperation and the various lines of support for the fisheries sector in Mauritania; the advocating of support for the fastest possible construction of adequate facilities for landing fish along Mauritania's central and southern coastlines, including Nouakchott, so that fish caught in Mauritanian waters can be landed at national ports rather than outside the country, as is often the case at present; and that fisheries agreements between the EU and third countries should be preceded by a wide-ranging debate in the countries concerned, allowing participation by the public, civil society organisations and national parliaments, thereby promoting greater democracy and transparency."
"We have a number of concerns about fisheries partnership agreements as they are currently undertaken and applied by the EU."
"In particular, their level of achievement of development cooperation objectives is clearly inadequate."
"We advocate the principle, enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, that access conceded to the EU must relate to quantities that Mauritania's fleet is unable to catch."
"Apart from that, the resolution includes several positive aspects, such as:"
"that fisheries agreements between the EU and third countries should be preceded by a wide-ranging debate in the countries concerned, allowing participation by the public, civil society organisations and national parliaments, thereby promoting greater democracy and transparency;"
"that financial support for the Mauritanian multiannual fisheries programme must be in line with Mauritania's needs for sustainable fisheries development;"
"the need for a comprehensive and detailed evaluation of the reasons for the inadequate achievement of the objectives regarding development cooperation and the various lines of support for the fisheries sector in Mauritania."
"For these reasons, we voted in favour."
"This resolution was adopted following the proposal by the Commission aimed at opening the negotiations on renewing the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Union and Mauritania."
"Voting in favour of a resolution is unfortunately the only thing Parliament can do to be heard in the negotiations of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement (FPA)."
"At present, Parliament can only have its say once the negotiations have ended, which leaves it no other option than to either approve these agreements or reject their ratification, thus leaving it very little room for manoeuvre."
"Now, the Treaties stipulate that Parliament be 'immediately and fully informed at all stages of the procedure'."
"Hence, it is essential and legitimate that we ask to be associated with the European Commission and Council during these negotiations."
"This issue is not new and raises regular questioning of the European Commission by the members of the Committee on Fisheries."
"It is regrettable that we are not able to make binding our opinion on our priorities relating to the provision of European funds to the countries concerned, in spite of the fact that Parliament has the power to exercise financial control."
"I voted in favour of this document because Mauritania is one of the poorest countries in Africa, classified as a Heavily Indebted Poor Country, and financially dependent on foreign aid, and has been characterised by considerable political instability."
"The current protocol to the Fisheries Partnership Agreement (FPA) with the Islamic Republic of Mauritania expires on 31 July 2012, and the Commission intends to launch negotiations regarding its renewal, for which it has received a prescriptive mandate from the Council."
"The European Parliament welcomes the Commission's proposal to open negotiations on the renewal of the protocol between the EU and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, while underlining that it should be maintained only if it is mutually beneficial, adjusted appropriately and implemented correctly."
"The European Parliament also welcomes the Commission's proposal to introduce a human rights clause into this agreement."
"in writing. - I voted for this report and in doing so, urge the Commission to ensure that fishing activities that fall under the Fisheries Partnership Agreement meet the same sustainability criteria as fishing activities in EU waters."
"The report, moreover, calls on Mauritanian authorities and the Commission to ensure that strict sustainability criteria are respected by all vessels exercising fishing activities in Mauritanian waters (either from the EU, Mauritania or third countries)."
"The current protocol to the Fisheries Partnership Agreement with Mauritania expires on 31 July 2012 and needs to be renegotiated so that EU-flagged vessels can continue fishing in Mauritanian waters."
"As such, it is a good opportunity for us to improve the already existing agreement."
"Improvements in terms of infrastructure and of building adequate facilities for unloading fish along Mauritania's central and southern coasts must be promoted, to enable the EU fleet to operate more efficiently, thereby facilitating the flow of investment and increasing this agreement's impact on the local economy."
"As regards the actual catches, they should be limited to surpluses and to those stocks that cannot be caught by Mauritania's fishing fleet, so that the environmental equilibrium can be maintained and the activity can remain sustainable over the years."
"Fisheries agreements with third countries should ensure a fair balance between economic interests and promoting sustainable fishing."
"As such, it is important that the EU use the fisheries agreements it establishes to ensure best practices are followed in other countries, fully respecting the key principles of the common fisheries policy (CFP)."
"Combating illegal fishing, creating jobs, reducing poverty levels in third countries and supplying the EU market with quality products for its consumers are the key objectives that should be guaranteed under this agreement with Mauritania."
"We also urgently need to ensure that Mauritania requires that third countries with which it establishes other agreements should respect the same rules followed by vessels flying the EU flag, so preventing competitive inequalities that put the EU fleet at a disadvantage."
"in writing. - With this, the EP firstly welcomes the Commission's proposal to open negotiations on the renewal of the protocol between the EU and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, while underlining that it should be maintained only if it is mutually beneficial, adjusted appropriately and implemented correctly; secondly, welcomes the Commission's proposal to introduce a human rights clause; thirdly, insists that any and all access negotiated for EU-flagged vessels to fish in Mauritanian waters must be based on the principle of surplus stocks as described in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea; emphasises, in particular, that there must be a rigorous assessment of all stocks for which access is sought or which are likely to be caught by the EU fleet as by-catch; stresses that any access granted to the EU must relate to those resources which are unable to be caught by the Mauritanian fleet; emphasises that, should effort reductions be necessary, those third-country (EU and other) fleets causing the most environmental damage must be the first to make reductions;"
"The Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Union and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania must be considered a strategic document of understanding that is very important as far as relations between the EU and Africa are concerned."
"Today, therefore, we must implement a new protocol which is in line with the undertaking that European countries signed up to in 2002 and which is able to ensure a sustainable fishing practice that will also contribute to development in the countries concerned."
"The priority is now to resume the negotiations that were already under way, but based on new premises and involving States which have, until now, been excluded from these negotiations."
"We must also review some requests that go back to the negotiations on the original agreement, in which Mauritania, for example, made a last minute request for further biological rest periods on fishing in May and June, in addition to that already agreed for the months of September and October."
"I voted for this proposal because I believe that it will benefit the EU, since a properly functioning procurement market is of essential importance in order to foster the Single Market, to stimulate innovation, and to promote a higher level of protection of the environment and climate, as well as social inclusion, throughout the EU."
"Public procurement is of crucial relevance, serving as a catalyst for the revitalisation of the EU economy and, accordingly, for employment and welfare."
"This is particularly true given the need to overcome the financial and economic crisis, and to protect ourselves against any future crisis."
"I agree that a sound and well-considered process of optimising the legal framework for public procurement is of vital importance for the welfare of EU citizens, for EU consumers and businesses, and for national, regional and local public authorities, and thus for the acceptance of the EU as a whole."
"I voted in favour of this resolution."
"A well-functioning procurement market is particularly important for fostering the integrity of the Single Market and stimulating innovation, and for achieving optimal value for public authorities and tax payers."
"This market is a particularly important part of the EU economy and has huge potential, but procurement rules and principles vary across the Member States and prevent companies, particularly small ones, from gaining access to cross-border procurement."
"Similar restrictions also exist in terms of access to third-country tenders."
"Despite the fact that the EU has opened up its markets, our companies face huge problems if they want to access public sector markets in third countries."
"I feel that significant political attention must be given to this issue as a matter of urgency."
"The Commission should conduct a detailed analysis of the problems relating to restricted access for EU companies to other countries' markets and take appropriate action against trading partners which benefit from the openness of the EU market, but do not open up their own markets to EU companies."
"Public contracts represent important economic opportunities for companies, are very important in the promotion of the Single Market, stimulate innovation, and promote the protection of the environment and climate, as well as social inclusion."
"Public procurement policy should ensure that public money is used as efficiently as possible, and should keep public procurement markets open, thereby contributing to the relaunch of the EU economy, to job creation and to welfare."
"Public contracts also play a key role in the Europe 2020 strategy, and are one of the instruments to be used to achieve the proposed goals."
"This motion for a resolution calls on the Commission to approach the issue of balanced access to public sector markets and to undertake the revision of public procurement and concessions, so allowing the involvement of the European Parliament, the Member States, and of citizens and businesses."
"It also calls on the Commission to give priority to modernisation of public procurement rules."
"Equally important is its call for the Commission to go ahead with assessing the problems associated with extraordinary low bids and to propose appropriate solutions."
"For all these reasons, I shall be voting in favour of this motion for a resolution."
"I voted in favour of this report, not with the aim of putting up protectionist barriers, but because we can no longer have a situation in which the European Union is the only one respecting the rules of the game."
"We can no longer ignore social and economic dumping in emerging countries, China in particular, which are winning contracts with rock-bottom prices in the countries of the Union, without regard for social rights and legislation on State aid, whereas the markets of these countries remain inaccessible to European companies."
"We can no longer be naïve: the survival of our businesses and our jobs depends on this."
"Finally, I am pleased that the amendments submitted by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament concerning respect, in the context of public contracts, for the labour, social and environmental standards in force in the Member States, have largely been adopted."
"That demonstrates real awareness and represents a positive and necessary change."
"It is now for the Commission to assess this call fully."
"Given that public procurement represents millions of euro every year, its economic importance is in no doubt."
"For this very reason, although there is a long tradition of EU legislation on such contracts, it will never be going too far to call for better, more effective laws that guarantee the total transparency of procedures; that prevent all forms of corruption or manipulation of proposals to benefit one candidate; that put a ceiling in terms of numbers and of value on the number of awards without a call for proposals or without negotiation; and that guarantee proper competition on the Internal Market between candidate companies, irrespective of their country of origin."
"This motion for a resolution of the European Parliament addresses equal access to public sector markets in the EU and in third countries, and the revision of the legal framework of public procurement including concessions."
"The EU has adopted a number of documents on this issue: directives 2004/18/EC, 2004/17/EC, 93/13/EC and 2007/66/EC, resolutions (European Parliament Resolution of 18 May 2010), reports (Mr Monti, A new strategy for the Single Market - At the service of Europe's economy and society), the European Commission communication 'Towards a Single Market Act For a highly competitive social market economy', and the European Commission Green Paper on the modernisation of EU public procurement policy."
"In order to overcome the current financial and economic crisis, a perfectly functioning public procurement market is of crucial importance to revitalising the economy and ensuring equitable treatment."
"I hereby state that I voted for this resolution as I believe that it is in line with the principle of better law making, and prioritises the modernisation of the rules on public procurement and concessions, which constitutes a significant improvement in EU law."
"This is yet another attempt to push through the liberalisation of public procurement."
"This is a direction that the EU is doggedly following both at home and in third countries, using free trade agreements."
"In all cases, the intention is the same: to prevent countries from protecting their own companies in public procurement, so as to make things easier for the big companies of the powers that also want to use competition, which is seen as the be all and end all, to dominate the awarding of public contracts."
"We disagree with this approach."
"Nevertheless, we acknowledge that there are important changes to be made in this area."
"Therefore, some aspects of the resolution deserve our support, specifically the criticism of the lack 'of transparency with regard to the composition and work of the Commission's internal advisory committee on public procurement (ACPP) and the role and competences of the Advisory Committee on the Opening-Up of Public Procurement (CCO)'."
"We also agree with the call for 'the Commission to take steps to ensure that the composition of both this committee and the planned new advisory committee on public/private partnerships is balanced, including trade unionists and representatives of the business community, in particular, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and that they work in a transparent manner'."
"With this resolution, the majority in Parliament wants to call for the liberalisation of public procurement on the pretext of relaxing and simplifying the rules and defending small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)."
"Although there could be justification for this in some cases, in the majority of cases, it is not this that is at stake."
"What they want is to prevent any country from protecting its own companies in public procurement, just to make things easier for the big companies of the powers that also wish to dominate the awarding of public contracts."
"That is why we voted against."
"However, there is another aspect of the resolution with which we agree, specifically, the criticism of the lack of transparency with regard to the composition and work of the Commission's internal advisory committee on public procurement (ACPP) and the role and competences of the Advisory Committee on the Opening-Up of Public Procurement (CCO)."
"We also support the call for the Commission to take steps to ensure that the composition of both this committee and the planned new advisory committee on public/private partnerships is balanced, including trade unionists and representatives of the business community, in particular, SMEs, and that they work in a transparent manner."
"It also seems the importance of strengthening anti-corruption mechanisms in the context of the European Union's commitments in the field of international public procurement should be stressed, as should the need to focus efforts on ensuring transparency and fairness in the use of public funds."
"Moreover, we call for the European Parliament to be kept duly informed and receive all available information at every stage and at the end of the process."
"Despite the openness of the EU public procurement market, access to third-country public procurement markets is still restricted to a large extent."
"In this situation, European businesses do not have equal opportunities for competing for public tenders in other countries of the world."
"For example, in 2009, the Chinese authorities adopted a system of accreditation of innovative local products, which restricted yet further access on the part of international businesses to the Chinese market."
"However, it is not only the Chinese market which is a problem, because highly developed economies such as the United States, Japan and Canada also pursue protectionist policies."
"This is why I support the call for application of the principle of reciprocity in access to public procurement markets contained in the resolution which was adopted today and which I endorsed in the opinion of the Committee on International Trade, which I drafted."
"I would, however, like the future European Commission proposal on the principle of reciprocity to contribute in particular to the opening of the procurement markets of third countries, and not just to restrict access for businesses from third countries to public procurement markets in the European Union, which might have an adverse effect on competitiveness in the Union market."
"I voted in favour of this resolution, because a well-functioning procurement market is particularly important for fostering the Single Market and stimulating innovation."
"Public procurement is of crucial importance, especially for overcoming the financial and economic crisis and protecting against any future crisis, because it serves as a catalyst for the revitalisation of the EU economy, and consequently employment and welfare."
"The specific issue of safeguarding equal treatment and fair competition on public procurement markets in the EU and in third countries urgently needs more political attention, especially given current problems regarding access to public sector markets in third countries."
"In my opinion, the Commission should give priority to the modernisation of public procurement rules and dealing with service concessions in such a way as to avoid further fragmentation of EU public procurement law according to the principles of better regulation."
"in writing. - (FR) I am pleased at today's adoption of the European Parliament joint resolution on equal access to public sector markets in the EU and in third countries and on the revision of the legal framework of public procurement, including concessions, a resolution of which I was a co-signatory."
"The good functioning of public procurement markets is essential for stimulating the Single Market."
"It is therefore important to clarify and improve the legislative framework regulating the awarding of public contracts, given their role as a catalyst for relaunching the economy of the Union."
"Regarding access to the European Union's public procurement markets by businesses from third countries, the European Union has a duty to act realistically and pragmatically and, above all, without naivety."
"This is not about taking a stand against the opening-up of our markets, but rather the quite legitimate position of advocating mutual access in this area, not by closing our public procurement markets, but by ensuring that our partners outside the European Union open up their markets in an equivalent way and, if necessary, by developing appropriate mechanisms enabling us to achieve this objective of reciprocity and balance."
"Equal access to public sector markets in the EU and the revision of the legal framework for public procurement are absolutely essential to boosting the Single Market in the Union and Member States, resulting in social and economic integration at EU level."
"Looking at the situation from the perspective of the economic and financial crisis, I think that the strategy proposed in this resolution is a necessity, in particular, the point about achieving greater coherence for the European common external trade policy."
"I should emphasise how important this legislative revision is in revitalising and stabilising the European Union's economy."
"in writing. - I supported this resolution as I believe the specific issue of safeguarding equal treatment and fair competition on public procurement markets in the EU and in third countries urgently needs more political attention."
"The calling into question of public/public partnerships, the scaling down of standards by public authorities (who are the guarantors of the general interest, need I remind you), the choices of these same public authorities leaning towards more competition ..."
