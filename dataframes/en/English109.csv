"The question, then, is this: how should the European Union present itself to Europe's citizens in the coming year?"
"Like all politicians, our task is to try to respond to citizens' concerns."
"The European Union has an outstanding opportunity to do this."
"We have many possible ways of responding to people's needs and concerns."
"Peace has been a fundamental concern throughout human history, and the European Union has safeguarded peace in Europe for many decades."
"We are able to find answers to external threats, such as international terrorism or the conduct of large neighbouring countries which occasionally trample the rules of international law under foot."
"We can make a contribution to ensuring that Europe has a secure and sustainable energy supply, while doing what we can to protect the climate."
"We can safeguard social security and justice in Europe by unleashing the growth potential of our successful European economy, and we can safeguard innovation and the competitiveness of the European economy, with the associated opportunity to create and safeguard jobs."
"Europe can become a haven of security in a changing world."
"My colleagues will have more to say about the finer points of detail on many of these issues shortly."
"What are the prerequisites for successful action in the European Union?"
"I would like to mention two in particular: firstly, we need appropriate institutional bases, and that certainly means the Treaty of Lisbon."
"This Treaty will create more transparency and more democracy and enhance the EU's capacity to act, thus enabling it to perform its functions more effectively."
"We can only appeal to the citizens of Ireland to reconsider their position on this Treaty."
"I share many of the criticisms levelled at the European Union, but we cannot ignore the fact that this Treaty provides sound solutions to many of these points of criticism."
"Thus the Treaty of Lisbon is vital."
"Secondly, however, we also need the backing of Europe's citizens, which has declined to an alarming extent."
"That became apparent from the referenda in France, the Netherlands and, not least, in Ireland."
"It is not about whether we need more or less Europe, as I recently had the opportunity to say to the Commission President."
"The real issue is where we need Europe, and where we do not."
"That needs to be decided."
"If I may cite an example - and I admit that this is my very favourite example - soil protection is not something that we need to deal with at European level."
"Soil protection makes work, but it does not create jobs."
"That is why Europe will be successful and will generate support if it acts where Community action is undoubtedly required, and where action at European level can achieve more than action at national level."
"The Commission would therefore be well-advised, in my view, to attach greater importance to the issue of subsidiarity in its action during the coming year."
"That will boost Europe's acceptance and we will probably all be re-elected by more of Europe's citizens than was the case at the last election."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Madam Vice-President, the European Commission has done outstanding work in the last few years in many areas, notably environmental and climate policy, and here in this House, we are in the process of translating this into legislation."
"As regards the development of the common market, however, we see major shortcomings, especially where the social dimension is concerned."
"The current financial crisis is sufficient reason to discuss this issue, and that is what we have done in the context of the Rasmussen report."
"It is not only my group and I, and indeed many others, who are deeply disappointed by what Commissioner McCreevy has said - or has not said - here."
"That is the major problem."
"If we read the lead articles in any conservative newspaper today, whether it be the Financial Times or the Frankfurter Allgemeine, the headlines could have been written by socialist groups in this House, but not by the Commission President and certainly not by Mr McCreevy."
"The Financial Times, for example, has had the following headlines:"
"'Modern history's greatest regulatory failure' or 'After the crash: why global capitalism needs global rules'."
"While Damien Hurst's The Golden Calf broke art auction records, the financial institutions have suffered record losses, prompting the following comment from the Financial Times:"
"'How we were all blinded by the golden calf'."
"(DE) Unfortunately, this applies to the Commission, or at least to those members of the Commission who should be responsible for these issues."
"Frank Schirrmacher, the editor-in-chief of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung and hardly a left-winger, writes: 'Neoliberal ideology created a rational and fortuitous connection between the individual and globalisation which was rooted solely in the economy', and laments 'the self-destruction of the social welfare discourse'."
"It would be nice to have detected at least an element of this in the words of the Commission President or Commissioner McCreevy."
"After all, I am not demanding a large amount of left-wing criticism or self-criticism, but what we are demanding, time and again, as Martin Schulz recently made very clear, is the strengthening of the social dimension and scrutiny of all Commission projects in terms of their social impacts."
"Unfortunately, this is still not happening."
"There is no response from the Commission here."
"What we are also demanding is a stronger common economic policy in Europe, which could also help to cushion or avert the type of crisis now spilling over from the US."
"Here, too, the Commission has been notable for its omissions."
"Another area where the Commission has failed - and I am sorry to address these comments to you as I know you can do very little about it - is its failure to tackle the growing inequality in Europe of its own accord, or to urge the national governments to act."
"We will be debating this issue this afternoon in relation to energy poverty, another topic which we have repeatedly raised and where we have received no response from the Commission, which has yet to produce any real initiatives here."
"It is unacceptable for the Commission - with its commitment to inclusion and social justice as a matter of principle - to stand by and watch while social inequality in Europe steadily increases during this particular phase of economic and social life."
"That is unacceptable, and we should not be accepting it."
"Europe's citizens expect the Commission to take their needs and concerns seriously, to present appropriate proposals and to act as a moral authority, notably in the context of the financial crisis."
"It should not be left to the French President, Mr Sarkozy, in his capacity as President-in-Office of the Council, to take a clear position here; this clear position should come from the Commission, the Commission President and the relevant Commissioner as well."
"Madam Vice-President, you are very eloquent in your endeavours to inform citizens about the Commission's work, and we pay tribute to and fully support your efforts."
"However, it is not just about form; it is also about substance."
"The Commissioners must provide you with appropriate content."
"When it comes to the financial crisis, regulation and the social dimension, the social market economy is supplying you with too little content."
"That is why you will often find it difficult to present a credible case to citizens."
"We say 'yes' to the ecological restructuring of our economy and society; we are completely on your side here and will translate this into action."
"However, my urgent message to you is this: we need to take a step back - or a step forward, if you like - towards policies based on social responsibility, and that means the Commission as well, for what we are getting here is too little, too late."
"I would ask you to ensure that this situation is remedied in the next few months."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Madam Vice-President, next year - 2009 - is indeed a very important year for the European Union, for it is the year in which the European elections are due to take place, and more generally, the major question as to the European Union's future course must be answered."
"The elections will take place: that we do know, but what we do not yet know is the exact basis on which we will be working together thereafter."
"That is a question to which our citizens are quite rightly expecting an answer."
"From the European institutions' perspective, how do we envisage the future of Europe?"
"The Commission's legislative and work programme of course offers an opportunity to provide a comprehensive answer to this question."
"That is why we, as the Parliament, have agreed to set out our own requirements of the Commission's work programme first, before it is presented to us and we then react to it."
"The European Union faces these major challenges of direct relevance to its future."
"What will that future bring?"
"At the same time, so much is happening in the world which directly affects citizens in their daily lives, such as rising energy prices and the financial crisis."
"Here, we need clear words from Europe to explain how the European Union intends to respond."
"For that, we need conviction and leadership."
"That is why it is important for the European Commission to set out very clearly how it intends to respond to these crises and, in its work programme, to define exactly where the political priorities must lie."
"In this context, it is important, from our perspective, for the Commission to keep the European Union's competitiveness in mind."
"In an increasingly globalised market, it is important for us to define this as one of our continued political priorities."
"Other aspects which are equally important, however, are strengthening and protecting civil rights, expanding research, and finding a solution to climate change."
"These are other issues which have been very important topics in the House for many years."
"These areas should be defined by the Commission, and above all, it should also ensure that Europe is able to take credit for any successes achieved."
"It is often the case that if something is achieved which is entirely in line with citizens' interests and wellbeing, the Member States take the credit."
"I would like the Commission to pay more heed to this in future."
"In that respect, I am very pleased to see you, Madam Vice-President, here today."
"There are one or two of our fellow Members of the House who have to accept that Mr Barroso, the Commission President, had something else in his diary for today."
"I am pleased that you are here, Madam Vice-President, because you are responsible for driving forward communication in the European Union and this might present an opportunity for today's topic - namely the Commission's work programme - to be fully debated in the national parliaments as well, so that we have this type of interplay from the outset."
"In the German Bundestag, this now takes place in most of the committees, but it is something which should undoubtedly form part of the plenary agenda in the national parliaments throughout Europe as a whole."
"Europe's hour has come: that much should be obvious."
"We are facing global challenges, and Europe has no option but to develop a joint response."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, members of the Commission, the debate about the work programme is, as always, the moment of truth."
"It is here that we see what the statements made in public on so many different occasions are really worth."
"If we look at the programme in more detail, it becomes apparent, unfortunately, that these announcements are not being acted on, notably as regards the financial perspective or the Commission's forward planning."
"We have before us a climate protection programme which suggests that the Bali conference never happened, as if Europe had never positioned itself as a key pioneer to avert the dangers of climate change at global level."
"The car industry has applied the brakes, and the Commission is sitting back and watching."
"The Member States are being given their heads and allowed to undercut each other in introducing ever-lower environmental standards for their own industries and making ever-greater concessions to their own car manufacturers."
"Unfortunately, we see the same thing happening across the board in the industrial sector."
"As ever, the focus is on nuclear energy: an industry which squanders capacity, finances and energy."
"Even though Europe has an innovative renewables sector, the European level has nothing but small change to spare for this sector after it has given its commitment and allocated its financial resources and planning elsewhere."
"That is completely unacceptable."
"If we are to remain market leaders here, we must send out a clear and unequivocal message, and that means setting the priority where it is needed."
"We have the same problem, unfortunately, when it comes to employment relations."
"I would underline just one issue here: the Working Time Directive which has now been agreed, and where considerable concessions have clearly been made."
"It is a slap in the face for all our young people who want to build a future for themselves."
"This is not how we should be treating our workers."
"Finally, we have the debate about the financial markets."
"I can only endorse what the previous speaker, Mr Swoboda, said."
"The last remaining champions of self-regulation of the financial markets are here in this House."
"Even in the US, regulations are being considered, but on this side of the Atlantic we seem to be pretending that this will all happen of its own accord."
"We should be signalling our willingness to create a sound framework so that the financial markets can no longer evolve in the same direction as before, where nonsensical financial products took precedence over sound economic policy."
"From my perspective, this whole programme is a huge disappointment."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (PT) Mr President, at this very worrying juncture when the people of Europe and the world are facing fundamental challenges, it is unacceptable that the European Commission has not presented any proposals that make a break with the policies that have made the social situation worse, pushed up unemployment and precarious and poorly paid work, brought about the financial, food and energy crisis - which is affecting in particular the economically weaker countries and the more vulnerable sections of society - and increased the militarisation of international relations, with all the dangers that this represents for world peace."
"Despite being aware that there is clear opposition and resistance by workers, consumers and public-service users to privatisation and liberalisation, to unfair health and social security reforms, and to the ever-increasing distribution of income to economic and financial groups, thus worsening social inequalities, the European Commission is insisting on maintaining and continuing with the same instruments and policies that led to this situation, in particular the Stability Pact and its irrational criteria, the liberal Lisbon Strategy and the false independence of the European Central Bank."
"It is insisting on proposals for unacceptable Directives such as the Working Time Directive."
"At such a time, the priority must be to halt the process of ratifying the draft Lisbon Treaty and to respect democracy and the result of the Irish referendum, which was a sovereign decision by its people, following on from identical results in France and the Netherlands."
"It is time for the leaders of the European Union to learn the lessons from these votes and from the opposition and resistance of workers and citizens to neoliberal, militaristic and anti-democratic policies."
"At this moment in time, the priority must be to make specific proposals such as those in our Group's motion for a resolution, including revocation of the Stability Pact and an end to privatisation and liberalisation, with a monetary policy and a reorientation of the European Central Bank giving priority to employment with rights, to the eradication of poverty and to social justice, including through a progress and social development pact."
"We need to give hope to our citizens, create jobs with rights for young people and ensure equality for women and equal rights for women."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, the whole climate change programme has given the EU yet another excuse to flex its muscles and show the world how important it is, claiming that this is an issue that nation states cannot deal with alone."
"The 20 20 20 slogan is a typical example of a catchy phrase to work with: 20% of energy in the EU from renewable sources; a 20% reduction in carbon emissions - all by the year 2020."
"But you are missing the most important point: is any of this necessary?"
"We were told recently by the IPCC that 2 500 scientists were all in agreement that CO2 was responsible for global warming and that we humans were the culprits."
"Al Gore's infamous film confirmed that view."
"Since then, however, over 30 500 scientists and climatologists have signed the Oregon Petition and the Manhattan Declaration which directly challenges the IPCC conclusions with some very compelling evidence."
"So whilst we are urged to believe the IPCC's 2 500 scientists, we are being told to completely ignore the 30 500 scientists who are painting a different picture."
"The EU is persuading nations across the world to spend billions of taxpayers' money, at the very time when the world is facing dire financial problems, on something that might not only be totally unnecessary, but could well prove to be counter-productive if the latest evidence of global cooling proves to be correct."
"We must have a full and open debate to prove exactly who is right."
"What do supporters of the IPCC's position have to fear?"
"You will no doubt be pleased to hear that this will be my very last speech in this Parliament since I retire after this session."
"(SK) The European Parliament's motion for a resolution on the Commission's work programme for 2009 can be agreed in principle like the document expanding on this programme."
"I would personally like to point to the complexity with which Parliament's resolution emphasises the importance of ensuring stability on the financial markets and reassuring consumers during the current financial crisis."
"There is no doubt that there is a need to develop regulatory measures so as to improve investor transparency and to improve the standards for valuation, supervision of business caution and the work of the rating agencies."
"The Commission must develop a detailed plan to bring about an improvement in the legal regulations for financial services and review the directives on the activities of credit institutions and capital adequacy."
"This will make it possible to achieve an improvement in the financial regulatory framework and increase the confidence of market participants."
"Paragraph 27 of the resolution rightly includes a call for the Commission to consider what kind of transitional arrangements should be put in place in the field of justice and home affairs pending the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty."
"If, however, the situation actually arises whereby the Lisbon Treaty does not enter into force before the 2009 elections, this request to the Commission will have to have a far broader scope."
"Otherwise, our dear European Commission will be caught with its pants down."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, allow me to pose a question to the House."
"What are Parliament's legislative work and the Commission's proposals all about?"
"The answer is that they are about creating authority amongst Europeans, amongst people who are citizens of the Member States of the European Union."
"I firmly believe that Parliament and the European Commission should concentrate on legislative work relating to job creation and the promotion of economic growth."
"It is only by demonstrating that the European Union and its structures are close to the people that we can develop the authority of the Union's institutions."
"The latter have been somewhat weakened in recent years."
"In my view, our main priority at present is not ratification of the Lisbon Treaty."
"We should be focusing instead on making it abundantly clear to the citizens of the Union that we want to create more employment and that we are concerned about existing jobs."
"There is also the issue of cybercrime, an entirely new problem affecting many people."
"I am calling for a suitable hierarchy to be established when it comes to the priorities;"
"I cannot make one out at present."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, let me first thank Parliament for taking up my suggestion to make the interinstitutional dialogue on the Commission's work programme a more political exercise with the involvement of the political groups, the plenary and the committees."
"I think this has been given a good start with your speeches so far."
"This year's work programme will be the last one of this Commission, and it has been prepared under very special and specific circumstances: the follow-up to the war in Georgia, the situation in our neighbourhood, the uncertainties surrounding the Lisbon Treaty after the Irish 'no', the escalation of fuel and commodity prices, the increase in food prices, inflation threatening purchasing power and, last but not least - and you have all mentioned it - the financial crisis affecting banks and other credit institutions."
"I will not need to remind you that what we do in the first half of next year will also set the scene for the European elections."
"This is why, in our presentation of the annual policy strategy last year, we underlined our intention to stick to our ambition of delivering a Europe of results and bringing concrete benefits to citizens."
"The main policy priorities which the Barroso Commission envisaged for next year are still structured around five pillars, but the circumstances are different and we are facing new and urgent questions."
"The first pillar is promoting sustainable growth and jobs."
"More than ever we need to address today's concerns: what we can do to boost growth, jobs and social stability in a period of growing inflation; what we can do to improve financial stability, building on and reinforcing the instruments available to the Union - and available to the Commission as well, which is an important discussion."
"As you know, the financial crisis is at the top of our agenda every week too, and we have established a kind of road map, but we have also discussed the preparation of a proposal on capital requirements for banks to tighten existing rules; we are also preparing a proposal to regulate rating agencies, which, as you know, played a very important role in the financial markets and in this crisis as well."
"Of course, we think that well-thought-through proposals also play a very important role in ensuring that we can deal with the effects of the financial crisis."
"So we are active, and will continue to be active."
"Another concern is what we can do to respond to the rise in oil, food and commodities prices."
"Our job is not day-to-day micro-management but, in a single market, we need to look carefully at how we can bring long-term stability into the financial system."
"That is the first pillar."
"The second major effort will be put into promoting the transition to a low-emission and resource-efficient economy."
"The Copenhagen meeting will be a major global rendezvous with a view to reaching a global climate-change agreement for post-2012/post-Kyoto."
"Europe must prepare its ground well and also maintain its role as a pioneer on climate change; we will also need to pursue work on how to assist with adapting to the impact of climate change so that we can be the leaders in development of smart growth."
"The third pillar has to do with a common immigration policy."
"We want to make a reality of a common immigration policy, following up on our communication in June, as well as to work on a pact on immigration, and we will need to move from pacts to acts if we are to make this a reality."
"The fourth pillar is how to focus our intentions on delivering policies that put our citizens first."
"The revised social agenda and the EU health strategy will also guide our action in this area, as well as the question of how we can further strengthen the rights of consumers."
"Finally, we will pursue our objective of consolidating the role of Europe as a global partner."
"On the external front, the challenges for 2009 are well known: the enlargement process, relations with our neighbourhood, the fate of the Doha negotiations, improving our record on development assistance and establishing full cooperation with the new US Administration."
"This debate means that Parliament is involved early, because the programme does not exist yet, so we are taking this as input into our discussion and we will take your suggestions on board."
"On the other hand, to be credible and to have a real impact, the demands from Parliament to the Commission must remain focused, and this is particularly true for 2009."
"On different sides of the House you have different views on how we should prioritise over the next year."
"I hope most of us can agree that we must work together to forge a positive agenda for 2009, concentrated on the essentials."
"I think we must only consider initiatives that can really make a difference."
"In addition to choosing our proposals carefully, we need to communicate them well, so that European citizens can make a fair judgement on what the EU does and can do for them."
"So I am grateful for this debate at the very moment when we are preparing the programme."
"We intend to adopt it next month and to present it in plenary with the whole college present on 19 November."
"I have taken good note of your views, and you can be sure that they will help us to build a work programme with concrete initiatives bringing tangible, concrete change for European citizens."
"Mr President, as Mr Nassauer has already said, the PPE-DE Group is very happy with the contents of the annual legislative programme."
"I think that, due to the improved process, Parliament has already come on board, which makes it very easy for us to improve the annual legislative programme."
"As a representative of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, I would like to concentrate on your first pillar - growth, jobs and European competitiveness."
"I think that a key factor is how we respond to the financial crisis."
"In the PPE-DE Group we believe that, as we already have quite good legislation in place in Europe, everything we do now should be based on the existing legislation and its improvement."
"We do not see the need for a very radical overhaul in Europe."
"We think that, firstly, soft-law measures should be considered because that is also the most effective way to respond to global issues."
"Financial markets are very global and we cannot act in Europe as though we were in a vacuum."
"We also believe that there are many improvements in the present regulatory and supervisory framework, the so-called 'Lamfalussy Framework', and we support completely the Commission's work on that area."
"The second issue is climate change."
"Climate change will influence growth and jobs in Europe."
"We should not take the fundamentalist view about climate change that Europe must act now and must do everything at once without global support."
"Thirty per cent of emissions, even if we were to go that far, is not enough to tackle climate change."
"We need a global, effective deal and that will probably come from Copenhagen."
"Until then we should not punish ourselves."
"We should not punish European competitiveness too much, but take a realistic approach to climate change policies in Europe."
"Finally, my third point concerns SMEs."
"SMEs are the key to European growth."
"For example, in the social package we should always take on board their views and how they see the social framework environment in Europe."
"The social package should not be a burden to European small and medium-sized companies."
"(SV) Mr President, Commissioner, I want to concentrate on the social EU."
"When the social agenda came, we said that it was too little too late."
"When we now look at the Commission's work programme and also at the joint resolution, we see that employment and social affairs issues are not particularly highly prioritised."
"They are a priority for people, but not for the Commission."
"That does not accord with the demands of ordinary people."
"In the resolution from the Social Democrats, we raise a number of questions."
"One concerns people with atypical jobs, a group which is constantly growing, and the need for those who have atypical jobs to be given proper protection."
"People who are vulnerable to and affected by unjustified dismissal."
"There must be minimum standards for this in the common labour market."
"We must also look again at the Globalisation Adjustment Fund and see whether we can further improve prospects for those affected by unemployment due to restructuring, so that they can get training and find new jobs."
"We have a number of proposals in the field of working conditions."
"Finally, I would like to raise the question which was discussed in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on Monday."
"Because of judgments in the EC Court of Justice, people today are terribly afraid that there will be social dumping in the EU, that it will become the policy."
"We succeeded in drafting proposals to open out the Posting of Workers Directive in order to guarantee equal treatment and to establish in primary law the principle that fundamental rights, such as the right to strike, are not subordinated to freedom of movement."
"I hope that the Commission will now take this up."
"It is good to know that you are organising a forum, but you must also present concrete proposals to prevent social dumping and to give workers reasonable pay and reasonable working conditions."
"Mr President, when we last had this discussion with Commissioner Barroso about the work programme, I said it was good that the Commission tried to avoid what I called 'end of term-itis'."
"It is, however, very difficult for Parliament up front of the European elections."
"Each of the groups will want to stamp its own imprint on the programme that goes forward."
"That is only natural, but we also have to try and speak to you in this dialogue with one voice so that some clarity comes forward."
"You will find that the group of Liberals and Democrats has joined the joint resolution, but also we pick things from other groups as well, to try and provide what is often our role: balance in the House and some equilibrium."
"These are really unnerving times for Europe's citizens."
"Everybody is uncertain about the future with the global financial turmoil, which brings worries about debt, unemployment, health costs, pensions, and it breeds an atmosphere where fairness and equality can fly out of the window when there is a scramble for everybody to save their own position."
"Climate change brings its own worries about adapting our lifestyles and about fuel costs in a very different world."
"This time of global problems should, of course, be a time when the EU comes into its own because we have a multinational reach, but as Liberals and Democrats we would say, OK, let us use that reach, but it should not reach too far."
"It should produce an umbrella, it should produce some control, but it should also give individual choice so that individual citizens can begin to feel in control again in these times of uncertainty."
"So, yes to greater oversight of financial markets and players, but also yes to greater consumer choice and greater consumer redress."
"We do not want another Equitable Life in Europe."
"Yes to greater labour mobility, yes to greater joined-up social security, but yes also to fairness and non-discrimination."
"Yes to greater choice in health and to patient mobility."
"So, let us give our citizens a choice in how they live their lives."
"If you are worried about the future, the one way you can begin to feel more secure about it is if you feel you can do something about it, you feel you have control, and that will be the theme running through the choices made by Liberals and Democrats in this resolution."
"Yes to Europe, but yes also to individual choice and empowerment."
"(GA) Mr President, the Commission, the Council and, of course, Parliament's greatest concern is that Europe's economy improves without delay."
"Europe will have no social cash fund to help those who are disadvantaged, unless the economy improves."
"We must face this challenge immediately."
"In light of what happened in the financial markets, I do not think that we can continue in the way we have this year."
"The current meddling with the rules of the financial markets must stop."
"The public is very worried about this and we must reassure them."
"We must act very soon."
"All of us, in the European Union, must invest more in research and development."
"I am delighted that EUR 55 billion will be spent on these areas between 2007 and 2013."
"We must keep up-to-date and competition must be ensured in these areas, in order to create employment and to guarantee that the world we now live in has a strong economic base."
"(DE) Mr President, we are currently facing an explosive mix of social decline, cultural conflicts, increasing democratic deficits, the threat of supply bottlenecks, inflation, imported security risks and a speculation bubble which could burst at any moment."
"For far too long, the worrying developments in the labour market and citizens' concerns have been ignored."
"It is high time to set the right priorities."
"As regards the food crisis, I believe that renationalisation of agricultural policy is essential to maintain our self-sufficiency capability."
"Problems of illegal mass immigration have to be resolved at last, and a sensible family and birth policy must be introduced for Europe's native population."
"Citizens must be protected from EU-subsidised business relocations, and the waste of taxpayers' money and tax fraud must also be stopped."
"We must halt the sell-off of the EU's family silver, which is being sacrificed to over-zealous privatisation, and we must also finally accept that the Lisbon Treaty project has failed."
"If the EU shows itself to be amenable here, we can ride out the current crisis."
"Otherwise, we are likely to witness the steady decline of the European Union."
"(ES) Mr President, my Group simply wants to highlight that the current budgetary and financial framework for 2007 to 2013 makes it very difficult to respond effectively to the new political priorities."
"Both this Parliament and my Group said that it was impossible to adopt new political priorities without ensuring sufficient funding."
"We are now seeing that there is no room for the new political initiatives taken by both the Council and the Commission, such as food aid or aid to Georgia, within the current financial framework and we therefore need to find solutions."
"However, we must not allow the solutions adopted to harm existing plans and available funds within the Interinstitutional Agreement."
"In this respect, we believe that we must be extremely strict."
"We must ensure that the necessary resources are fully available."
"We must use all aspects of the Interinstitutional Agreement, during its remaining years, to ensure adequate financing of our priorities and we must use something that we have rather forgotten about, namely the current review of the budget, to adequately solve those problems that are going to arise as the developing situation imposes new political emergencies."
"We therefore ask the Commission to make an additional effort to move forward, as quickly as possible, with its proposed review of the budget."
"(DE) Mr President, Madam Vice-President, citizens' scepticism about the European Union can be felt very strongly nowadays, and there is a reason for that."
"It is due to the policies which have been pursued over recent years and the way in which they have been conveyed to citizens."
"For that reason, it is extremely important for the European Commission and other EU institutions to gear policy-making far more strongly towards the lives of citizens and to convey the impression and demonstrate to them that the European Union is genuinely doing something for its citizens."
"To that end, it is also important - for example, in our analyses of what is needed - to focus more strongly on what we should be doing."
"For example, a consumer scoreboard is a very important instrument which must be further expanded so that we can take better account of citizens' concerns and interests in this area."
"The second point which is also important in this context is better monitoring of the impacts of EU legislation."
"It is not enough simply to assess the economic impacts."
"We need clear impact assessments in the social sphere as well, so that we are aware of how the legislation that we are forging is impacting on citizens, and so that we can demonstrate that what we know what we want and what we are doing, and that what we are doing can generate positive outcomes for their lives."
"It is also important to grant the same rights to citizens throughout the EU."
"I would therefore urge you to work on the further development of class actions and common legal entitlements."
"That would send out a very important signal to citizens."
"(FR) Mr President, Madam Vice-President, the Commission seems to be behaving like an inattentive pupil rushing to finish his homework on time."
"Yes, the social package exists, but it is not complete and can be seen only as one step towards a full engagement by the Commission with social concerns."
"The Commission President has not realised the scale of the warning given by citizens in France, the Netherlands and Ireland, which would, unfortunately, have been issued elsewhere if referendums been held."
"These results are a call to order."
"If people want more Europe, it is in order to build a better society and not merely to adopt yet more obscure directives."
"Legislation on the internal market is certainly necessary, but it is far from being the most important concern."
"The 2009 programme, just like its predecessors, incidentally, is going to miss the point."
"People do not expect the Commission to restrict itself to adding to or even streamlining legislation."
"They expect the Commission to be up to the task assigned to it by the Treaties: to be the driving force behind the Union, its suggestion box."
"To that end, it is not enough for its President to sit quietly and nicely behind the Council President."
"We expect the Commission to behave like a key player in the examination of the sort of society we need to build."
"However, what sort of society does this programme envisage? The 2009 programme contains no serious flaws, but it is not the programme our fellow citizens need."
"Mr President, it will be up to the new College to take up its responsibilities."
"I only hope that it will be more attentive to the voice of the European people than the present one."
"(DE) Mr President, Madam Vice-President, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, the diversity of the messages coming from the plenary to the Commission today cannot be ignored."
"I will therefore focus as far as possible on a few key points which I hope my fellow Members will endorse."
"In my view, what we are able to agree on - and Madam Vice-President, you mentioned this earlier - is that the European Union must maintain its commitment to the fundamental principle of the social market economy while promoting the interests of the business sector and consumers alike."
"At an individual level, that is a difficult balancing act whose outcome may, of course, vary according to one's political standpoint."
"However, I believe - and here, I would like to follow on from what Mr Nassauer said - that during the coming months, the Commission must develop a better sense of what is required in terms of subsidiarity."
"If we look at the type of proposals you presented on the procurement of eco-friendly vehicles or what you intend to propose as regards eco-friendly procurement in the work programme, you clearly take the view that our cities' mayors, as ordinary mortals, are not able to make eco-friendly decisions themselves, and you therefore feel a need to prescribe what they should be doing from your position at Europe's centre."
"In our view, this is the wrong approach."
"We want individuals themselves to understand that environmentally friendly procurement is in their own interests."
"To that end, we need more subsidiarity in these sectors, more best practice and less dirigisme."
"Madam Vice-President, may I also encourage the Commission to adopt a more courageous approach in its negotiations with Member States in future, for example when it comes to the issue of how we should harmonise consumer protection legislation in the European Union in the interests of companies and in the interests of consumers."
"Proceeding with this harmonisation will only make sense if we genuinely harmonise the entire sphere of consumer protection law and leave the Member States no further scope to tinker on the margins of this harmonised acquis."
"Otherwise, it is a pointless exercise."
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, 2009 is a year in which we will not only be going to the polls but will also have to provide some answers to specific questions asked of us by our electorates."
"One such question will concern the area of freedom, security and justice: why do we mean to create it, how do we mean to create it and when do we mean to create it."
"We need to provide an answer in the form of an ambitious programme of legislative policies which, Commissioner, the Commission has not yet put on the table."
"We expect strong legislative proposals with respect to immigration policy, especially on entry policies and asylum policies, in order to safeguard this fundamental right throughout the European Union and to avoid drawing a distinction between policies on legal and illegal immigration, which seems to us altogether inappropriate."
"We believe that a common policy framework and regulatory environment is necessary: alongside containment measures we need integration measures and legal immigration channels."
"We expect strong proposals on judicial cooperation in criminal and police matters, founded on mutual recognition of procedural guarantees."
"Mutual recognition is still lacking, and without such proposals the fight against organised crime and terrorism is likely to remain nothing but rhetoric."
"Lastly, we expect a bolder approach to the protection and safeguarding of fundamental rights, which remain the primary objective of judicial measures."
"The new Fundamental Rights Agency should become the main instrument of this activity once the Treaty of Lisbon enters into force."
"We expect, Commissioner, to find evidence of this intention in the programme to be unveiled to us by the Commission within the next few days."
"(FR) Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commissioner said that she herself wanted a Europe that was more visible, that meant something to citizens."
"Now, the largest budget item today, accounting for 36% of the Union's budget, is concerned with cohesion policy."
"If there is one area in which our fellow citizens can see the practical and tangible effects of Europe's achievements and determination, it is the Cohesion Fund."
"As has already been stated, 2009 will be a significant year, as we shall see the formation of a newly elected Parliament and Commission."
"This means that it will be a 'blank' year, a year off in certain areas."
"However, in terms of cohesion policy, we cannot afford to take any time off."
"We cannot stop the programmes that are under way and, above all, we cannot stop their effectiveness."
"Everyone here will surely have in mind the improvements brought to the daily life of people of Portugal, Spain, Ireland and all the countries of Europe thanks to our cohesion policies."
"The Commission must therefore be able to present to us a detailed work programme for 2009 as regards cohesion, which is, I repeat, the European Union's largest budget item and also the most tangible expression for citizens of our achievements, so that 2009 is not a 'blank' year but a year of progress within the 2007-2013 programming period."
"I thank the Commissioner and her colleagues in advance for their proposals on this matter."
"(FR) Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, the year 2008-2009 represents a transition period, as we are living through an unprecedented economic crisis."
"It is also European election year, meaning, unfortunately, that it is in danger of being wasted."
"We must therefore do all we can to maintain the competitiveness of our businesses and persuade our fellow citizens that Europe is the answer."
"Unfortunately, the programme is full - too full - and has come too late, and not for a lack of warnings on this subject over the past several years."
"On climate change, Mrs Wallström said that we should be pioneers of smart growth."
"We all agree, but the efforts must be joint or not at all."
"Europe cannot do this alone."
"It should not shoot itself in the foot."
"The consequences of the decisions we take will weigh heavily, socially and economically."
"We cannot talk about a global climate change agreement if China, the United States, Brazil and India are not on board."
"An agreement without China's signature is not an agreement."
"As regards health, we have been told that there is pharmaceutical package."
"At last!"
"We have been asking for this package for years."
"It has come just as we are about to begin preparing for the elections."
"However, it is still a source of great frustration."
"How can we justify our slowness to tackle the counterfeiting of medicines when it represents a real health threat and is a serious crime?"
"We could have begun long ago to work on the traceability of medicines and the ban on repackaging."
"Finally, it is imperative that we strengthen our consumer protection policy, particularly in the light of all the crises and food scandals the world is experiencing."
"I therefore urge you, Mrs Wallström, to make sure that 2009 is not a wasted year!"
"(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, Europe has in recent times become accustomed to relatively strong economic growth and economic prosperity."
"I fear that this period is now coming to an end, at least temporarily."
"The main priorities for the Commission, Parliament and also the Council next year should therefore be directed at restoring economic growth and strengthening social cohesion."
"There is a need to improve the system for regulating the financial markets in the Union; it is essential to strive for more effective economic and fiscal coordination, including coordination of the system of direct taxes and clear measures against tax fraud."
"There is an urgent need to put forward a complex proposal for an external policy in the field of energy, including active support for the construction of energy infrastructure."
"In a period of economic uncertainty, it is also essential for the Commission to reaffirm its commitment to support social rights far more strongly than before and I need not remind you that the main priority next year should also include completion of the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty and, of course, its implementation."
"(NL) Mr President, Commissioner Wallström has just talked about reaching the citizens."
"Well, cohesion policy with thousands of small-scale regional and municipal schemes is the most visible form of action of the European Community."
"With those we shall be actively reaching out to citizens in the future."
"I am thinking, for instance, not just of the regional and municipal open days here in Brussels in the next few weeks, but also of many different activities in the Member States."
"So far so good."
"However, changes are also needed and I shall mention two."
"First of all, it is the fervent wish of Parliament to make the European Union Solidarity Fund more flexible."
"Citizens want quick action in natural disasters and floods."
"We have a view on that and the European Council has already been obstructing that debate for a couple of years."
"Let us in any case make sure that it is opened up."
"Secondly, the Green Paper on territorial cohesion expected in October must be the basis for cohesion policy after 2013: not renationalisation, but a long-term European effort, a single integral European policy."
"We are seeing concentration in a number of regions in Europe; that is a consequence of globalisation and it is necessary."
"At the same time, however, we must have a view of how balanced development can be made possible in Europe in all areas with their own characteristics in the broad spectrum of agricultural development, R&D, ecology, and so on."
"The internal market has brought many benefits and it is nearly completed, but cohesion policy is now entering a new phase."
"The Green Paper will provide the basis for that and legislative steps should then follow in the new phase."
"(EL) Mr President, let me begin by thanking Commissioner Wallström."
"Her participation has truly enabled us to find common ground on a communications policy and on the schedule of priorities for the European Commission and the European Parliament, within the framework of an interinstitutional agreement, which we have consolidated and shall be presenting."
"Commissioner, as you have very rightly said, we all know that the first-pillar issue concerning social policy must be the priority for the communications policy and indeed at the core of an EU that does not simply respect its citizens but wishes to impose its own outlines, structures and order in this international context of the globalisation crisis."
"On this point, then, no-one disagrees."
"Allow me, however, to point out to you that in your proposal there is a lack of certain individual recommendations focusing on specific markets or handling important issues such as the protection of intellectual property rights."
"From now on the Commission needs to arrive at a decisive solution to the problem because in its recent communication it avoids making a specific recommendation and confines itself to 'technocratic' issues rather than issues of substance."
"As regards education and immigration policy, I think these are issues that you should highlight in your text."
"(DE) Mr President, Madam Vice-President, I would like to water down, if only slightly, the praise you have received from the House, at least as far as the issue of passenger rights is concerned."
"We urge the Commission to submit a comprehensive package of proposals for passenger rights throughout the transport sector."
"It is gratifying that we already have passenger rights in the air transport industry, although these require urgent review, given that a number of airlines are not applying the relevant regulation in the way that we would wish."
"This year, we have also agreed a package of passenger rights for rail users, to be implemented next year."
"However, Madam Commissioner, it was announced that passenger rights for people taking long-distance buses would be introduced, and a debate about passenger rights for ferry services has already started."
"We do not see either of these proposed measures included in the work programme."
"We need these proposals, as we want to have passenger rights for the entire transport sector, for we agree with the Commission: if we want to put the citizen first, one of the best ways of doing this is to introduce passenger rights that apply right across the transport sector."
"The second point which I would briefly like to mention is this: we hope that the Commission will implement the planned traffic management systems as envisaged."
"Specifically, this means SESAR for a single European sky and ERTMS as the single European Railway Traffic Management System."
"With these systems, Madam Vice-President, we are not only making transport safer and cheaper, we are also helping to protect the environment."
"You therefore have our full support for the rapid deployment of these systems."
"(DE) Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, there are no new issues in the sphere of budgetary control."
"Budgetary control is ongoing, and we would have been gratified to see some progress being made on the issues already on this agenda."
"I have five points to make."
"Firstly, we would urgently appeal for some support for Romania and Bulgaria in establishing the rule of law, the justice system and financial control."
"We do not want to be in the same position in two years' time, so this issue is very important to us."
"The second issue is the statement of assurance for the budget as a whole after the phased control procedure involving the national courts of audit."
"In the last half-year remaining to the Commission, it would be nice if we could achieve some major progress here, or at least agree on a common way forward."
"As budget controllers, our expectations are quite modest."
"The third point is simplification."
"We should be giving the lower tiers of administration in the Member States more help in implementing EU law."
"It is clear that they are completely overwhelmed by many areas of EU law, which is why the failure rates are so high."
"Fourthly, foreign aid: here, I would like to mention Kosovo in particular and the issue of cooperation with the United Nations."
"The Committee on Budgetary Control has been to Kosovo, and I would like to announce at this juncture that Kosovo will be something of an issue when it comes to the discharge of the budget."
"In my view, we are falling far short of the opportunities available to the European Union and have considerable ground to make up here."
"My fifth point is improving cooperation among the Member States in combating fraud."
"Here, we have homework for the ladies and gentlemen of the Council in particular."
"In November, the House will be voting on the regulation which provides the legal basis for combating fraud, and we will need to consider how we take this forward if we want to achieve better results in this area."
"At least, that is something that we have always agreed on until now."
"(PL) Mr President, much has been said in the House concerning the Commission's strategy."
"The main aim of the latter is to bring the Union closer to its citizens."
"We reiterate this year after year."
"Nothing has been achieved, however, despite the Commissioner's determined efforts, which I certainly appreciate, and despite the actions for which I am grateful."
"The Union is not closer to the citizens."
"I still believe that the reason for this state of affairs is to be found in the information policy."
"I have studied the point concerning information on Europe."
"There is one important reference in the action presented by the Commission, namely the launch of a grass-roots campaign concerning the social dimension of the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"This is a good point."
"The remainder, however, concerns information on the European Union's work and intentions, rather than on its actions."
"The citizen expects to be informed about results, not about what the Union is planning or intending to do."
"The man in the street wants to know what the Union has achieved and how it has affected him."
"Finally, I should like to ask the Commission why Mr Ganley's campaign in Ireland produced better results than the campaign undertaken by the Irish Government and the European Union regarding the Lisbon Treaty?"
"Was there some mysterious power at work or did Mr Ganley's funds have something to do with the outcome?"
"Perhaps the Commission should consider the matter."
"(ES) In 2009 the European Union will have to strengthen not only the internal dimension of the European project, but also its external influence, through an external policy that must be consistent and effective in responding to the challenges currently being posed by the global agenda."
"To do this, we will have to adjust our relations with Russia following the crisis in the Caucasus."
"We will have to, in some way, adapt the neighbourhood policy, firstly within our own continent, through association and stabilisation agreements and then through the enlargement policy, and also outside our continent, through the Union for the Mediterranean."
"I believe it is also important to maintain our presence in the conflicts of Central Asia, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan and now also Pakistan, to reinforce our presence in the Middle East conflict and to maintain our relations with the emerging powers of China and India."
"We must, in particular, develop the Association Agreement with the African, Caribbean and Pacific States."
"I believe we must pay very close attention to the result of the US elections and, last but not least, we must also give priority to the conclusion of the association agreements with Mercosur, the Andean Community and Central America."
"Finally, Mr President, Madam Vice-President, this is a huge task that I feel would be much easier to tackle if we could use the instruments provided to us, in the area of external policy, by the Lisbon Treaty."
"To end, I must say to you, Madam Vice-President, that you already know that you can count on the support of this Parliament."
"(HU) Thank you for the floor, Mr President."
"Contrary to expectations, the financial crisis that started in America a year ago, far from abating, has hit the whole world again and again in ever bigger waves, including the financial markets and thus the economies of Europe."
"The Central Bank has to pump enormous sums of money into the financial markets in order to ensure their survival."
"However, in order to remedy the economic and social impact of the financial crisis, the Commission must make progress in two areas."
"The first is that a common European financial supervisory authority must be established as soon as possible and must be charged with avoiding similar speculative dangers, thus also ensuring that Europe gradually takes over the role of America's broken financial and capital market."
"Secondly, it must make the European financial sector concentrate on funding real economies, which have been neglected up to now, instead of on speculative transactions."
"In order to do this, naturally, it would also be necessary for the European Central Bank to treat economic growth and the creation of jobs as priorities, in addition to keeping a tight rein on inflation. Thank you very much."
"Mr President, 2009 will be, to put it mildly, a crucial year for achieving the goals of the Lisbon process."
"There are four matters that I would like to raise here today."
"The first one is the need to make real progress on the process of better regulation, where we all agree that we should reduce administrative burdens by 25% by 2012, and I think it would be appropriate for the Commission to demonstrate here in Parliament, year by year, that it is moving ahead in really making better regulation."
"The second thing is research and innovation."
"The budget review is coming to an end, and it is crucial and of strategic importance that we now ensure that we can move ahead and put Europe in the forefront of research and innovation by contributing the proper financing."
"The third thing is mobility of workers."
"That is one of the more dynamic aspects of the European Union where we have seen enormously good achievements that are contributing not only to the economy of Europe but also to individuals all over Europe."
"It is important not only that we do not make it more difficult - that we defend opportunities - but also that we make it easier also by discussing and reforming education in the framework of the Bologna Process, making mobility a reality to even more people."
"Finally, 2009 will be an important year to take action on energy policy, where we currently have a number of legislative items going forward."
"There is legislation on the energy markets (which still has to be completed), on renewables, on effort sharing and on emission trading."
"Now it is also time to ensure that we can finalise this process and implement it in reality so that we have a good basis, not only for 2010 but for the further future, for being the best knowledge economy in the world."
"(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, 2009 is an election year."
"This does not mean, however, that Parliament and the Commission should focus on the election programme to the exclusion of all else."
"There is a tendency to promise a great many things in such programmes."
"We attach great importance to the joint action to be undertaken up until the middle of 2009 and in the second half of 2009."
"The citizens expect clear and comprehensible information too."
"I should like to refer to one of these elements, namely the fundamental change to be proposed by the European Commission in October."
"The change involves amending cohesion policy by introducing a spatial feature, namely territorial cohesion."
"The Commission has referred to October, yet we cannot find any reference to the matter in the 2009 programme."
"We already know, however, that the issue will arouse great interest as well as controversy."
"In this connection, I should like to highlight that 2009 is particularly important with regard to the issue of cohesion policy, notably territorial cohesion and integrated action."
"I trust additional information will be forthcoming."
"(LT) It is, of course, a pleasure to discuss a programme that should be a continuation of earlier programmes from previous years."
"In the first pillar we see the battle against the global financial crisis."
"This reminds me of firefighting."
"The crisis has been going on for a year now and we have failed to notice it; no measures have been taken."
"I would like to draw your attention to the energy policy."
"Three years ago we decided to have common energy policy."
"This is a lengthy, complex process that requires hard work."
"It is essential that our actions are consistent."
"Meanwhile, I am not aware that any actions regarding energy issues have been mentioned."
"The legal acts we have adopted will not create energy policy, common energy policy, by themselves, nor will they implement that policy."
"There are no connections, the search for alternative energy resources is non-existent, and nothing is being done about the problems of the Arctic, the potential resources in the Arctic."
"In fact, there is no long-term energy perspective and the outcome could be similar to the situation with the financial crisis."
"We will be taken by surprise when something happens as regards the energy situation, and only then will we take action."
"I suggest that we perhaps continue the work we have started."
"(RO) I would like to emphasize two priorities which the European Commission should take into account next year, with regard to social and employment policy."
"First of all, the European Commission should encourage the employment of young people."
"A recent European study showed that fewer and fewer young people enter the labour market, because they are discouraged by barriers such as the lack of employment in their chosen field of sudy, the lack of experience and the lack of professional skills."
"It is imperative that all young people should have access to the best education and that they should obtain qualifications which are demanded on the labour market."
"Therefore, I believe that the educational system should be correlated with the labour market, and that the transition from theory to practice should be done smoothly, through various professional training programs or EU internships."
"Secondly, the European Union should support, coordinate and perfect the actions taken by the Member States in the field of sports, by promoting competitiveness and the affiliation of children and youth to sports clubs, as well as an unbiased and transparent attitude in competitions."
"Sport also needs financial support, and I am in favour of creating a new budget line dedicated to European sports programs."
"Mr President, I would like to make a few comments on this, and I welcome the opportunity to do so."
"I want to speak on the situation as regards the Solidarity Fund."
"I am a supporter of this fund, because I think it has the ability to bring Europe and Brussels closer to the people."
"Europe is now 27 Member States, so it does not really matter if it is floods in my region in Northern Ireland or forest fires in Greece, or Spain, or Portugal."
"You see some terrible instances where people have almost been wiped out."
"So we are not talking about giving them a lot of money, but we are giving them some hope to restart again."
"I certainly would like to make an appeal that this Solidarity Fund is kept and supported, and please do not make it too complicated."
"Keep it simple, where either a national or a regional government can apply and can go back to their local area and tell the people that this fund is coming from Europe and Europe is giving them some support."
"So let us make it simple, keep it simple, but let us not do away with this Solidarity Fund."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, honourable Members, thank you for this debate."
"I think it reflects very well the full spectrum of issues that the European Union deals with, from sports - a budget line for sports - to how we label medicines, to what we do in the Caucasus, or how we try to help the situation in the Middle East."
"We do all these things at the same time."
"It also represents the ultimate challenge from a communication point of view."
"We have also heard some very detailed proposals here today."
"I want to assure you that the role of the Commission is to make sure that we can balance all of these interests, because the Commission cannot be seen as representing only one interest or only one stakeholder or only one issue."
"We have to cover this whole spectrum of political challenges."
"Sometimes we can choose the issues, others are chosen for us, and I think that, even if some people say that they had warned of the financial crisis, nobody knew exactly when it would occur or the full consequences of this financial crisis."
"So we have to deal with that as well."
"We have to be able to respond."
"The way we do it, of course, is that we are the guardians of the Treaties, and that also sometimes restricts our capabilities or our capacities to act."
"We cannot suddenly make up new competences or enter into areas where we know that it is actually sometimes the Member States that have the competences, or we are at least limited in what we can propose, or we have to work together with the other institutions."
"That is what forms the framework for whatever we do."
"When we met last time in a small seminar - and this is the message I want to pass on to Parliament as well - we said first of all that we will stay on message."
"We will not change our overall objectives of prosperity, solidarity and security."
"These will still guide everything we do, and prosperity means defending growth and jobs in Europe."
"Nobody should doubt our determination to continue to fight for growth and jobs in Europe."
"This has been even further reinforced by recent events and the financial crisis."
"It is all the more important that we have a very forceful policy and that we are careful about what we do right now."
"I do not think that anybody is ignorant of the fact that this is one of our major priorities, has been from the very beginning, and will continue to be one of our most important priorities."
"On the topic of solidarity, this is about energy and climate change and about how we use the solidarity fund, because defence today is also defence against natural disasters or threats that we did not have, say, 10 or 20 years ago."
"Now we need proper cooperation and defence against these things too."
"I do not like the doom-and-gloom atmosphere on energy and climate change."
"You know what, I think we have an enormous opportunity in Europe."
"I think we have the know-how, we have the technology, we have the resources, we have the people, we have hope for the future and, even if there is a cost to it all, I think we can do it and it will actually bring something very positive to Europe."
"It will bring a better quality of life and I think it offers new opportunities also for creating jobs in Europe."
"I think that we have to turn it around and not only see it as a cost, a burden, an effort, but actually as part of the future."
"This is a solution for the future, and it is Europe that can take the lead, that can create innovation, jobs, creativity in Europe."
"It will bring us a better quality of life, especially by bringing the future into the picture for once and also by bringing the rest of the world into the picture."
"We will also continue to deliver."
"Concrete results are the most important for this Commission."
"We will not be a caretaker Commission."
"We will continue to present proposals to this Parliament and to the Council until the end."
"I thank you for all your concrete proposals and I would just like to respond to a few of them because I think, for example, the whole issue of consumer protection is a very important one, and we have a very ambitious project."
"We will present a proposal to undertake a complete review of the existing legislation on consumer protection, simplifying it and making it more accessible to all."
"We hope that Parliament will be able to deal with this major proposal before the elections."
"We will also, before the end of the year, present a proposal to extend the possibility of action on the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, another important fund."
"We want to be able to also use this in the context of globalisation and to meet the effects of globalisation."
"Since Jan Andersson also mentioned the whole social issue - and again it is the role of the Commission to make sure that we balance all issues in which the social agenda plays an important part - the forum that the Commission will be organising in November can, I hope, also look at questions about the functioning of the Posting of Workers Directive and help us to decide on the way forward."
"We will not shy away from looking at these issues as well."
"We know by now how important they are and how they affected even the Irish referendum."
"On that topic, Mrs Grabowska, you also know the saying that 'the lie is already halfway to Damascus while truth is putting its boots on'."
"I do not know exactly if this is the English expression, but you know the meaning."
"I think that this is part of it."
"If you are well-funded, if you can use and mobilise fear as well, this is very often more effective than maybe having to explain a treaty text that is not always that clear or that helps to simplify things."
"At the same time in this debate you have, however, given some of the best examples of why we need a new treaty, why that would help us to act and speak with one voice in the world and also be more effective in our decision-making, and why that would help citizens."
"We continue to deliver, for example, with the proposal yesterday on the telecoms package which will give lower prices to all those of us who use mobile phones and make sure that roaming charges go down."
"Finally also on the budget review, I would like to say that this consultation process on an initial so-called reflection paper can help us from the end of November to propose a new way of constructing the budget."
"I think it will be an opportunity to look at the question about what Europe is and how it should act over the coming years."
"That is only to comment on a few of the more detailed things that you have raised."
"All of this I will take back to the Commission and it will feed into our discussions on the work programme."
"I have very much appreciated the full range of issues that have been mentioned here, and we will come back in a few weeks with a new proposal and present it in the full college."
"I also want to underline how important it is that we have a framework agreement that we also abide by and follow, and that we can agree on the way the institutions should work in an efficient, effective and democratic way together."
"I have received six motions for a resolutionpursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - The year 2009 is a crucial year, as the European elections, renewal of the Commission and, hopefully, also the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty will take place."
"The main political priority of the first half of 2009 will remain the ratification process of the Lisbon Treaty."
"Unity and better functioning mechanisms are crucial to remaining a strong player in the global arena."
"More than ever we need better coherence in our energy policy, with a perspective of enhancing energy independence."
"Solidarity between Member States and the search for alternative energy resources should become EU priorities."
"Reaching the goals set in the Lisbon Treaty has to get a new boost."
"Innovation, entrepreneurship and promoting a science-based economy are the key aspects to bear in mind."
"The completion of the internal market has to be finalized."
"More efficient tools for SMEs have to be provided to further support their role as the main creators of jobs."
"A new approach must be established on how to bring EU closer to citizens."
"This approach has to be a two-way road."
"We as politicians are not only leaders but first of all servants and attentive listeners to our citizens."
"in writing. - (HU) Of the tasks set out in 2004, the Commission has failed to deliver on the most important one, namely halting or significantly reducing indifference to and the lack of confidence in the idea of Europe."
"Next year's programme also fails to reflect the perception that this Europe is different from that of the past."
"The economic potential of the EU-27 is much greater than that of the EU-15, and it occupies a more serious position in the global economy."
"At the same time, the economic and social problems of the EU-27 are different, and internal tensions and fears are also different and stronger."
"The free movement of labour and services has brought fierce conflict to the surface."
"This is shown clearly by the French 'no' votes that derailed the draft Constitution, and the Irish votes are making the fate of the Treaty of Lisbon more difficult, partly because of the tensions surrounding employees of the special mission."
"The 2009 work plan also fails to mention what plans the Commission has for monitoring Member States that want to make use of further restrictions after the 5-year restriction, in the interests of the free movement of labour."
"In connection with all these things, I regret to say that the ever more frightening presence of racism and xenophobia in Europe is not inciting the Commission to act."
"These problems are unavoidable, and come back like a boomerang."
"The only question is whether we will deal with them while the tension can still be dealt with, or when neo-fascist groups filled with hatred run riot in Europe's cities."
"I hope that we will choose the former."
"in writing. - (RO) The European Union is facing major difficulties due to the unexpected fragility of the international context."
"The instability of financial markets, the oscillating price of fuel, terrorism, the spectre of the Cold War, the acute need for energy security, the accumulating effects of climate change are threats which the European Union can overcome only by means of unity and consensus."
"The consequences of the crisis in Georgia and of the US financial crisis, as well as the escalation of terrorism should outline clear lines of action in the legislative and working schedule of the Commission."
"2009 is a crucial year for institutional stability, due to the Lisbon Treaty, the ratification of which should be the main priority for the next period."
"The program should include those aspects on which the future evolution of the Union depends: the common energy policy, the common foreign and security policy, reforming the neighbouring policy and strenghening commitments to countries in the West Balkans, Moldova and Ukraine, which need the European Union and which the European Union needs in turn."
"2009 is also the year of European Parliament elections, and the Eurobarometer does not look promising."
"The legislative and working schedule of the Commission should show that the main goal of European institutions is to meet the demands and ensure the well-being of European citizens."
"Preparation of the EU-India Summit (Marseille, 29/09/08) (debate)"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on preparation of the EU-India Summit in Marseille on 29 September 2008."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome your interest in strengthening our relations with India."
"The European Union-India Summit, which, as Mrs Wallström reminded us, will be held on 29 September 2008 in Marseille, in the presence of the Indian Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, the Commission President, Mr Barroso and the Council President, Nicolas Sarkozy, is one of a dozen summits we are holding with third countries during the French Presidency."
"You will notice that the calendar of meetings features plenty of summits with major emerging countries."
"In July, a summit was held with South Africa and summits will take place - we hope - with Korea, and with China and Brazil in December."
"This series of meetings is a unique opportunity for the European Union to develop a dialogue with the major emerging countries on subjects of mutual interest, and the summit with India ties in perfectly with this approach."
"I am aware that Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs recently took part in a fruitful workshop on European Union-India relations, which was attended by a number of experts."
"It has fanned a deep desire to enhance dialogue and cooperation between the European Union and India."
"The Presidency is driven by the same will as Parliament."
"With a population of more than a billion, which should overtake that of China in 2025, and annual growth of more than 8% since 2005, India is set to become an essential partner of the European Union and we consequently want this summit to be an important step in deepening our relations with the country."
"Since 2000, when our first summit was held, we have enlarged the scope of our dialogue and cooperation."
"The European Union is now India's main trade partner."
"It is also one the biggest investors in the country and in many key sectors of its economy: energy, transport and telecommunications, in particular, and the summits we have held have contributed decisively towards strengthening our relations."
"This was the case in 2004, when we raised our cooperation to the rank of strategic partnership."
"In 2005, we came up with an action plan to boost this partnership and, in 2006, a free trade agreement was concluded."
"However, we need to do more and ensure that our political dialogue and cooperation with India reflects the country's true potential."
"We hope that the Marseille Summit will serve this purpose."
"We also hope to strengthen our cooperation with India in areas that are currently priorities for the Union: climate change and energy."
"These discussions with our major emerging partners are far from easy, but we must have them and we must work with our Indian counterparts to achieve certain aims."
"Firstly, we wish to adopt at this summit a new action plan that is shorter and more operational and enables us to adapt our partnership to the new concerns of energy security and sustainable development."
"We also want to secure future cooperation in the area of research and new technology, for example regarding solar energy and the ITER project."
"This action plan should be accompanied by a work programme on energy, clean development and climate change and should envisage cooperation in the areas of energy efficiency, clean coal and renewable energy use."
"These measures could, where need be, be supported by the new European Business and Technology Centre."
"The new centre should open in New Delhi by the end of the year."
"Of course, we shall also discuss at the summit regional concerns that are crucial for international stability, be it in relation to Afghanistan, Pakistan, Burma or Iran."
"We also wish to make progress at the summit in our strategic partnership with India through the launch or continuation of specific cooperation ventures."
"We hope to be able to sign a very important agreement regarding aviation."
"This agreement was initialled by negotiators at the beginning of the year."
"We are keen to sign it, because it will enable us to bring national legislation in line with Community law at the same time as improving legal certainty for European operators."
"I am referring here only to flights between India and the European Union."
"As for the rest, I hope that we are on track as regards Community legislation."
"We wish to bring fresh impetus to the negotiations through a trade and investment agreement."
"It will naturally be the Commission, which has responsibility in this regard, that will negotiate the agreement."
"We would like to assure the Commission, via Mrs Wallström, of our full support, as our relationship with India is worth strengthening."
"The signing of a trade and investment agreement would be a major step forward."
"While there is great potential for the development of relations with India, it should be remembered that the country is only the European Union's ninth trade partner behind South Korea, a surprising situation indeed."
"The three documents that we intend to adopt at the summit, the revised joint action plan, the work programme on energy and the agreement I mentioned just now, are currently being negotiated with India, along with the joint press release."
"I am unable to go into detail today regarding these documents, given that discussions are ongoing with our Indian partners, but I think I can say that we are optimistic about what can be achieved by this summit."
"In conclusion, I would like to congratulate Parliament on the highly constructive role it has played in relations between the European Union and India."
"The creation in 2007 of an individual Delegation for relations with India has boosted communication with the Lok Sabha, the Indian Parliament, and Parliament's delegation will certainly be called on to play a leading role, particularly in terms of the drafting of future parliamentary resolutions on sensitive issues affecting relations between India and the European Union."
"Finally, I would like to take the opportunity to give a special mention to the chairman of the Delegation for relations with India, Mrs Gill, and to praise the dynamism with which she fulfils her role."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, honourable Members, Mr Jouyet, I am speaking on behalf of my colleague Benita Ferrero-Waldner, and it is a pleasure to speak to you today on the preparation of the summit with India in Marseille on 29 September 2008."
"Europe's relations with India, I have learned now, have been growing in importance for several years, not only because of growing trade and investment but also because of a shared commitment to, and experience of, multilingual and multicultural democracy."
"In this Parliament you have recently demonstrated the political importance of relations with India, both by setting up a new parliamentary delegation and also by inviting President Abdul Kalam to address the House last year, which was the first time an Indian Head of State had done so."
"At this summit we hope to turn this growing political commitment into stronger concrete cooperation, and we can already report a good deal of progress since we agreed a Strategic Partnership with India in 2004 and a Joint Action Plan in 2005."
"The first thing to mention is the political dialogue and cooperation that has been strengthened, and there is now a regular calendar of summits and ministerial meetings, an annual security dialogue has been established, and new formats for dialogue in the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) and the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation meeting, and this has fostered cooperation even on sensitive issues such as counter-terrorism."
"The second point to mention is that the contacts between the EU and India are intensifying, particularly in education, where the European Union has provided funding for over 900 scholarships to Indian students under the Erasmus Mundus programme, and this funding will be continued until at least 2013."
"The third point is that economic and technical cooperation has deepened."
"Science and technology activities and exchanges have intensified and they have also been lifted to ministerial level; new dialogues have been created; an EU-India energy panel has been established; and the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor - the so-called ITER agreement - to which both India and the EU are party, is now in force."
"Trade and investment has also continued to expand."
"EU-India bilateral trade has doubled to EUR 55 billion since 2000, and the EU is now the biggest source of foreign direct investment into India while the EU is also receiving increasing inflows of Indian outward investment."
"Development cooperation has continued to increase and we will be using the bulk of our indicative budget of EUR 470 million for India for 2007-2013 especially to support health and education programmes related to the Millennium Development Goals."
"So we have achieved a good deal, but there is more to do, and we believe that our relations should be guided by the promotion of peace, human rights and comprehensive security, sustainable development with environmental considerations, social equity and economic prosperity, and the strengthening of cultural and educational exchanges."
"One of our main aims at the summit is to agree a revised joint action plan to reflect these objectives."
"As global players, both sides have a responsibility to address global challenges, and some specific global issues will be raised."
"With regard to world trade, we hope that India and the US can resolve their differences over the WTO Round and enable negotiations to get back on track."
"Climate change and energy are also summit priorities for us, and we hope to sign a joint work programme on energy, clean development and climate change focused on renewable and clean energies, together with two climate-change-related European Investment Bank loans."
"We will also discuss the global financial crisis and ways in which the world food situation can be addressed."
"On bilateral matters, we have some significant joint interests to discuss."
"The free-trade agreement negotiations that were launched last year have made good progress and now we are aiming for their early and balanced conclusion."
"We hope to sign a horizontal agreement on civil aviation at the summit."
"We will also push for progress on the conclusion of a maritime agreement."
"Concerning culture and education, our objective is to agree on the launch of a policy dialogue."
"Science and technology is also a priority, and the summit should welcome the creation of a European Business and Technology Centre in Delhi and the support provided for this by the European Parliament."
"Let me finish by welcoming the recent creation by the Indian Parliament of a group for friendship with the European Parliament."
"I am sure that this will enable all of you, through contacts with your Indian partners, to convince them that the EU is the most successful and forward-looking phenomenon in international governance of modern times and that we have much to offer each other."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, the EU strategic partnership with democratic, secular India is of critical importance in these dangerous and unpredictable times, as this is a country that shares our values and aspirations."
"We face common challenges: the fight against terrorism - and in this context I hereby call for Europol to grant India privileged status in the exchange of intelligence and the fight against terrorism - the need to protect the environment including the issue of climate change, and the importance of managing the benefits of globalisation."
"The recent bombings in Delhi have underlined the serious threat India faces from Islamist terrorism."
"Mindful of the instability in India's neighbouring countries, from Pakistan to Sri Lanka, it should be obvious to all of us that we should do our utmost to support India, both as a regional power in South Asia, but also one which plays a major, constructive and global role in multilateral fora such as SAARC, ASEAN and the UN, where it is high time that India be granted a permanent seat on the Security Council."
"Our resolution rightly expresses concerns about the recent killings of Christians in the Orissa Province and unrest in Jammu and Kashmir, calling for those responsible to be punished, as human rights and the rule of law are at the forefront of the EU's strategic partnership with India."
"This situation is in stark contrast to the EU's dealings with the People's Republic of China, which considers itself immune from our pleas to respect the human rights of its citizens."
"I do hope that the forthcoming summit will solidify the flourishing relationship between India and the EU, especially in the field of commerce."
"As co-president and founder of the Friends of India and draftsman in the Foreign Affairs Committee for the EU-India Free Trade Agreement, I want to see rapid steps towards establishing a free trade relationship, to our mutual benefit, with large foreign direct investment now flowing from India to the EU for the first time."
"But my group, the PPE-DE, also wants to see enhanced political cooperation in the many challenges, such as the current issue of global financial instability, that we both face for the future."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) The vast majority of this Parliament believe that India is the biggest democracy in the world and that we must increase our cooperation with that country."
"We have the same principles and realities as India, from democracy to multilateralism in international relations."
"However, there are some points on which we disagree: for example the death penalty, which we wish to see abolished from their judicial system."
"We also urge India to sign up to the International Criminal Court."
"Many regret that the Indian Government has not yet ratified the International Convention against Torture."
"Having said this, and despite this, we welcome India's cooperation with the UN Human Rights Council and we commend the Indian Human Rights Commission on its work on religious discrimination, the caste system and other issues."
"We are mindful of the terrible atrocities recently committed in the state of Orissa by Hindu fanatics."
"We condemn these atrocities without any hesitation but, at the same time, recognise that these are exceptions which, although very bloody, are not widespread."
"We therefore maintain that India is a model of cultural and religious pluralism."
"India plays a major role in its neighbourhood and is concerned, just like us, about the current volatile political situation in Pakistan and, again like most of us, about the increasingly insecure and uncertain situation in Afghanistan and Sri Lanka."
"It would certainly be laudable if New Delhi were to combine its efforts with ours in the European Union to help Myanmar to awake from its current nightmare."
"Finally, India can be regarded as a promoter of peace and stability in the region."
"Unlike other countries, India is now a responsible nuclear power."
"However, I personally believe that it would be even more so if it signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty."
"Its image in the world would be enhanced as a result, and I must say in passing that this comment is also true for countries such as Pakistan, North Korea and Israel."
"Having said all this - and I am about to finish - and with the understanding that shared aims should not exclude reasoned and reasonable criticism, I am convinced that the imminent summit between the EU and India will be a success."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, it is always a pleasure to speak on matters which will enhance the steady growth of one of the most important international relationships in the globe, that between the European Union and the Republic of India."
"We call, in our resolution, for those involved in the summit to explore further ways of upgrading this relationship, and we look forward to concrete results which will be reported back to this Parliament."
"It is a critical time for the summit."
"We paid tribute in our resolution to the September victims of terrorism in India, including those killed in the assault on the Indian Embassy in Kabul."
"But today, surely, we must also pay tribute to those heroes who saved lives in Islamabad, and we must remember that India lies at the heart of a region that is in considerable security difficulties."
"It is proper that the wish in our resolution that there should be greater intelligence-sharing should be taken up and honoured, and all efforts to support India in her fight against terrorism with us should be supported - including, we believe, a seat on the United Nations Security Council."
"In our resolution we call also for a peaceful future for the former princely State of Jammu and Kashmir, on both sides of the border and now split into two nations."
"Peace comes, as we know so well with the European Union, with employment - with jobs - and it is particularly pleasant to learn that India is at present, in Jammu and Kashmir, building the longest railway tunnel in the globe, which will be nearly 11 km long, as part of a 148-km long section of track."
"This will be the longest in the world, 95% complete, which gives 3 900 new jobs of direct employment and, I am sure, many thousands more to come."
"And culture: we call, too, for greater links with culture."
"This is the year of dialogue, and India has much to teach the European Union on this."
"We call for more people-to-people dialogue, and I am sure that is the way forward."
"In conclusion, I urge colleagues to support this excellent resolution."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, India is one of our strategic partners where both trade and politics are concerned."
"It plays a constructive role in the region. The time has come, however, for the Indian Government to be on the receiving end of strong words regarding the blatant infringement of freedom of belief on its territory."
"The All-India Christian Council states that Christians are the targets of varying levels of aggression and intolerance on average every three days in India."
"People are dying and churches are being demolished whilst the judicial system has adopted an exceptionally passive stance."
"We cannot condone the legislation banning conversion to Christianity in certain parts of India."
"We expect determined action in this respect and also in respect of the compensation to which Christian communities are entitled for the damage done to their property."
"Mr Jouyet, Commissioner, I am calling for all these issues to be made very clear at the EU-India Summit later this month."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I would like to start by underlining that my group has a strong interest in good partnership-based relations with India, a country which is regarded as the world's largest democracy."
"However - and this also needs to be emphasised - equal partnership means addressing problems honestly."
"That is still not happening with India, and nor is it evident in the resolution before us."
"That is why we are unfortunately unable to support this compromise."
"How can we claim that India provides a model for handling cultural and religious pluralism, as stated in the resolution, when yet again, there have been countless deaths in the violent excesses perpetrated by extremist Hindus against Christians in Orissa and Muslims in Kashmir?"
"Those responsible for the pogroms in Gujarat have still not been brought to justice."
"Around 200 cases are still caught up in India's sluggish judicial system."
"Is resolute action genuinely being taken to deal with the radical factions' excesses and the massacres of Christians and Muslims?"
"How much equality do the Dalits really enjoy?"
"Is there genuine universality of human rights?"
"Are children being protected from labour and exploitation at last?"
"These are questions which we should be discussing frankly with our Indian partners."
"In the last five years, the Indian National Human Rights Commission has recorded more than 14 000 deaths in police and military custody."
"I appeal to India to reform the Armed Forces Special Powers Act."
"It is this arbitrary justice which is fuelling the rebel movements in many Indian states."
"Poverty in India is still a cause for serious concern, and even good-quality programmes are not enough."
"Much more needs to be done, given that 40% of the world's most undernourished children live in India."
"With knowledge and technology transfer, Europe can make a very substantial contribution to genuinely sustainable development in India."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, when India achieved independence in 1947, its 18% literacy rate, unstable political environment and level of economic development in no way hinted at the kind of problems with which we would be faced 60 years on."
"Indeed, the country's development problems are far from over."
"There are still many millions of illiterate, unemployed and socially marginalised people, but we are now dealing with a nuclear power with gross domestic product growth of about 8% for several years now."
"This is a country which urgently needs to build tens of power plants, modernise the basic rail and road network, and solve the problems of the small cities."
"Small cities in India are those with about a million inhabitants, just so we know what we are talking about."
"There is still great demographic pressure in some parts of the country, but today the problem of outsourcing is on the table."
"Indian firms are taking qualified work from the European Union, programming work, for example in the field of accounting, and this work is often undertaken by workers living in India."
"Many countries import qualified specialists."
"We have got used to Lakshmi Mittal's company being the largest steel company in the European Union."
"We are aware of other industrial companies beginning to look at our market."
"The problems inside the SAARC are still far from being solved and the delicate matter of Kashmir is still on the negotiating table."
"There are, however, positive signs here and it seems that there are numerous topics for discussion in the political and economic fields."
"I should very much like to plead for support for the large infrastructure programmes in India and other SAARC countries."
"One example is the gas pipeline connecting Iran, Pakistan and India."
"We have common interests in this and other projects."
"Security, energy security and worldwide international cooperation: these are good signs ahead of the summit."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, the joint motion for a resolution is ending up in the precarious position of the Christian minority in India."
"I want to emphasise to the Council and Commission that this situation will be hopeless, especially in the state of Orissa, if the political and socio-economic causes at the root of the problem are not actually addressed."
"According to reports, on 23 August this year the local leader of the radical Hindu organisation VHP, Swami Laxmanananda Saraswati, was murdered by Maoists in Orissa."
"However, the Christian minority had to pay the price."
"Hindu nationalists hunted down their Christian fellow citizens, armed with clubs, axes and torches, and continued to wreak havoc for weeks on end, even in the refugee camps."
"This violence is apparently purely religious, but it does have an obvious political element."
"The point is that, not just in Orissa but also in other parts of India, the Hindu nationalist BJP is now winning strong support."
"There is no room in its ideology for religious minorities, let alone a Christian minority."
"I have just heard that the Council and Commission will be meeting the Indian Prime Minister, Mr Singh, in Marseille on 29 September."
"Mr Singh called the shameful events in Orissa a national disgrace."
"You must talk to him about this in Marseille."
"You must put on the agenda that point, namely the religious intolerance and the persecution of Christians, and discuss it in detail, because it is unacceptable to continue a strategic partnership in that way."
"(NL) Mr President, I too want to take the opportunity to express my concern at the violence against Christians in India in recent weeks."
"Dozens of people have been murdered and thousands driven from their homes."
"Hundreds of houses have been set on fire and even churches have not been spared."
"The European Union must call upon not just the central government of India but also the governments of the states to do everything they can to stop the violence and bring the guilty to justice."
"At the summit in Marseille next week, as well as reinforcing the strategic partnership with India as far as our trade relations are concerned, cooperation in the fight against terrorism must also be extended."
"The bomb attack in Islamabad last week has once again shown how much the neighbouring country of Pakistan is plagued by the problem of Islamic terrorism."
"Certainly in this political transition period in Pakistan it is very important that relations between India and Pakistan should not deteriorate."
"The European Union must provide all possible assistance to keep the dialogue going and encourage further dialogue."
"India has a fast-growing economy, which is having an impact on the demand for energy."
"It must therefore be the policy of the European Union to ensure that India does not become too dependent on countries such as Iran and Russia."
"(IT) Mr President, Mr Jouyet, Commissioner Wallström, ladies and gentlemen, I must respectfully point out a difference between my colleagues' speeches and your introductions, namely that you did not have the courage to speak in those introductions about the massacres of the past few days, nor to strongly condemn the lack of religious freedom in India."
"This is a very serious sign."
"It leads us to believe that we will present ourselves at the forthcoming summit without having the courage to address the key issue, which affects the real relations and true friendship existing between the European Union and India."
"What is at stake, in fact, is not solely the massacre of Christians but the principle of religious freedom, and religious freedom is a freedom unlike any other."
"Religious freedom determines the quality of a democracy."
"We heard the Indian President tell us in this House how, in a Christian school, he learned not only to love knowledge but also to distinguish between religion and politics."
"If this is true, we emphatically demand that the European Union devote the days of the European Union-India Summit to recalling that religious freedom is fundamental to the development of democracy, and to pressing home the point that we have to perform a common task: we must remember in a spirit of friendship that the infringement of human rights puts an end to truly constructive relations between entities which have everything to gain from building their future together."
"We must have this courage, Commissioner; we must have this courage, Minister, because, if we do not assume this responsibility, we will inevitably make ourselves complicit in eroding the quality of democracy."
"Mr President, as chair of Parliament's India delegation, I really welcome this debate."
"I would like to stress the central importance of continued and frequent dialogue between India and Europe on many issues that benefit from a shared approach - both at Council and Commission level, but also at parliamentary level - so I welcome the group that has been set up in the Indian Parliament, and I hope they will be coming to the European Parliament in the very near future."
"On our resolution, whilst it makes clear the values that Europe and India hold dear on commitment to democracy, pluralism, the rule of law and multilateralism, it is key that we are natural partners."
"I do believe our resolution should have focused more on major issues such as terrorism, climate change and the economic strengthening of this partnership, which I hope this summit will go some way towards tackling."
"I also would like to give my deepest sympathies to the families and victims of the recent bomb attacks which have taken place in India."
"I think, for this reason, we need to acknowledge that both Europe and India have many enemies who want to destroy our shared values."
"This summit should be an opportunity to deepen our ties, but I think we have to recognise that progress so far has been slow and the joint action plan needs more resources in order to achieve the ambitions that we have given ourselves."
"In conclusion I would just say that in many friendly relationships we can have constructive criticisms, but it is a responsibility of both sides to ensure that this is balanced."
"So criticism of India's difficulties and failings must be balanced by full and frank admission of our own."
"We are right to condemn the poor treatment of minorities, but Europe must also be mindful of our own problems with intercommunal violence and our own unsatisfactory record in some areas on race relations."
"(PL) Mr President, India is the world's largest democracy."
"It also has great demographic potential and is enjoying swift economic growth."
"India is therefore a key partner for the European Union and the West."
"It is important for such relations to be built on sound foundations."
"There are many positive features of India's development."
"The recent wave of persecution of Christians in Orissa and other locations is cause for concern, however."
"The relevant local authorities have failed to take any action to protect citizens of their country from attacks perpetrated by fanatics."
"This is not particularly surprising, as certain states within India have passed legislation banning Hindus from converting to other faiths."
"In addition, there are no legal restraints on the activities of extremist Hindu organisations calling for India to be cleansed of Christians."
"India prides itself on its democratic system, yet such a system requires the rights of ethnic and religious minorities to be respected."
"Does Mahatma Ghandi's home country really wish to disregard this now?"
"If that is indeed the case, the matter must be raised at the forthcoming Summit."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me briefly explain why my group is about to reject the compromise resolution in the vote."
"In the negotiations, it proved impossible to formulate a critical position on the nuclear deal between the US and India."
"We regard this as a failure by the European Parliament, as we expect this House to have the courage to criticise Europe's silence during the negotiations in the Nuclear Suppliers Group."
"It is sheer cowardice for all the Member States, and especially the German Chair Country of the NSG, to prove incapable of defending the European Security Strategy in a meeting of such importance."
"We have a compromise in which one of the priorities is combating proliferation."
"However, by remaining silent, we have forfeited - indeed, wrecked - the credibility of disarmament policy."
"Nuclear disarmament?"
"No chance!"
"Strengthening the NPT regime?"
"No chance!"
"Credibility in negotiations with Iran?"
"No chance!"
"Instead, we have France's economic interests, especially in closing a deal on nuclear technology with India."
"That is the inherent position, which is why we are rejecting the compromise."
"(NL) Mr President, India, just like Europe, is a subcontinent with many peoples and different languages, which is trying to put the war and oppression of the past behind it."
"However, India still has torture and the death penalty and there is still violence against the people of Kashmir, who never had the referendum that was needed after partition in 1947 to establish the state to which they wanted to belong."
"In Europe, the strategic partnership with India that was agreed in 2004 should not be a reason to close our eyes to the discrimination against the 170 million untouchables who do not belong to any caste and have no rights."
"In 2007 the Indian Prime Minister rightly compared the discrimination against these Dalits to apartheid in South Africa."
"Many Dalits have converted to Christianity or Islam."
"The extremist opposition party BJP is trying to use the forthcoming elections to mobilise Hindus against the Christians and Muslims and to force the Dalits to resign themselves to always being poor and having no rights."
"How can we help the Indian Government to stop this violence and how can we make sure that the EU aid after the floods also reaches the Dalits?"
"Mr President, this relationship between the two biggest democracies of the world is a very special one."
"India is emerging as an economic and political giant, but it is a shared commitment to the rule of law, multicultural democracy, global stability and the fight against terrorism that unites us."
"I hope that the ninth summit will bring us closer to reaching a free-trade agreement and that the still unresolved issues such as services, competition and intellectual property rights can be settled."
"I too express my concern about the recent wave of attacks on Christians in Orissa."
"It is not the first time this has happened."
"The last wave of mob violence occurred last December."
"It is very important - and I asked the Council and the Commission to bring this to the attention of their Indian counterparts - that Indian authorities take all possible steps to compensate for the damaged property, provide full protection for people who do not dare to return to their villages, help them to restore their churches and bring the perpetrators to justice."
"At the same time, we understand the complexities of this huge country and I would like to express my deep sympathy with the victims of numerous terrorist attacks which have hit India."
"We stand together with our Indian friends for common values, for the rule of law and the unconditional respect for human life, values so forcefully embodied by Mahatma Ghandi."
"(NL) Mr President, nearly a year ago there was an uprising in Burma."
"The repression is still going on."
"It would be to the credit of India if the government were to break with the criminal regime in Burma."
"More and more Indians are asking for that, shocked after the terrible reaction of the regime to the effects of the cyclone."
"In recent years India has achieved fantastic growth, with more and more highly qualified people and an enormous curiosity for innovation."
"India is playing a new role in relation to developing countries, with its own 'everything but arms'."
"India is a new donor."
"The dialogue between the European Union and India is also different and sometimes sharper, as you would expect of a dialogue between equal partners."
"The enormous economic growth can create better conditions and opportunities for greater social justice in India."
"Unfortunately, the problem of the untouchables is still acute."
"The European Union also wants India to comply with the ILO conventions on child labour."
"There is no easy solution to that."
"In India, whole families live off the money that the children earn."
"However, child labour is both a cause and an effect of poverty."
"With children working, there is too much cheap labour and adult wages remain low."
"As such, the gap between rich and poor remains too wide in India."
"Working on opportunities for everyone is a matter of survival, it prevents unacceptable social tensions and is an issue of justice for millions of Indians."
"That is a joint responsibility, for the EU, for India and for the world."
"(PL) Mr President, the European Union must depart from its policy of servility and readiness to make concessions if it is to rise to the challenges of the future."
"One example of this policy is the Union's attitude towards Russia and the argument that such a policy is justified because of Russia's energy resources."
"In today's fast-changing world the Union is called upon to promote and defend rights and inalienable principles such as an individual's right to freedom and tolerance, and a nation's right to self-determination."
"The talks and contacts with India, a new world power, will reveal whether the Union is prepared to take on this role and act accordingly."
"One of the key issues the European Union should raise is Christians' right to freedom of religion."
"I refer in particular to the rights of members of the Catholic Church, which is currently being persecuted and threatened with extinction in India."
"Churches are being burnt and Christians killed in India at present, yet Europe gave the people of India Mother Teresa of Calcutta."
"She was a holy person who brought goodness and kindness to where it was most needed."
"The European Union should seek inspiration from Mother Teresa on how to pursue its relations with India."
"India should look to Mother Teresa for an example of how to develop relations between followers of different faiths."
"Mr President, I, as a long-standing rapporteur on this issue within this Parliament, welcome the EU-India Summit, which is due to take place very soon."
"I see India in many ways as a natural partner for the European Union."
"We must use this summit to make progress, and I welcome the Council and Commission statements that have been made today."
"But I have to say, as a rapporteur, that too much time has been taken to get to where we are today."
"It is now time that we have delivery."
"I hear comments made by so many of my colleagues today pertaining to the issue of human rights and religious freedoms."
"I remind them that this House fought very hard to have a human-rights clause included in all of our free-trade agreements."
"We, Commissioner, must underline our commitment to that clause."
"So, whether it is thousands of disappeared or mass graves in Jammu and Kashmir, or the murder of Christians in Orissa and attacks upon them, our commitments to human rights must remain absolute and committed."
"Concerning the FTA: we now need delivery."
"A comprehensive bilateral between us and India is not just of importance to us and India but is of global significance."
"(PL) Mr President, Europe is founded on Christianity, and we should always be guided by Christian values."
"Freedom of religion is one of the European Union's fundamental rights."
"This should be emphasised in the context of relations between the European Union and other countries."
"The attacks on Christians in India, their persecution, and the damage to their churches have given rise to great concern."
"The Indian authorities have failed to take action, thus indicating consent to the escalating terrorist attacks."
"In the context of the forthcoming EU-India Summit it would be appropriate to make holding the talks conditional on clear commitments by the Indian authorities."
"The latter should undertake to immediately implement all possible measures to halt the persecution of Christians and to ensure that those responsible for such actions are punished."
"Furthermore, the European Union cannot make any concessions, including trade concessions, to countries where fundamental rights are violated with impunity."
"The European Parliament must send out a clear message that it places the defence of these values above short-term economic interests."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the EU-India Summit marks a new stage in the deepening of relations between the European Union and India."
"We want to promote economic development in India."
"However, we are also monitoring very closely what is happening in the context of human rights and dignity in India's regions."
"Almost all the previous speakers have talked about the persecution of Christians which has recently been taking place."
"These are issues which must be discussed at the Summit as well."
"The murder of a spiritual leader and member of the World Hindu Council on 23 August this year triggered this new conflict."
"This is not the first attack on Christians, which is why some 60 000 Christians in the state of Orissa alone have now fled their homes."
"Christians are being subjected to a campaign of persecution, humiliation, abuse and murder."
"Homes, churches and monasteries in Christian communities are being ransacked and destroyed."
"The Indian Government must guarantee the right to life and liberty of the Christians who live there."
"Economic prosperity and stability can only be achieved through freedom for the people."
"(DE) Mr President, India and Europe need more and better contacts with each other at all levels, but particularly between ordinary people: business people, tourists and students, for example."
"Let me make a brief comment, which is also of relevance to the Commission's legislative programme that we were discussing earlier."
"In international aviation, we need good security regulations that are genuinely useful and effective and not simply token gestures."
"One sensible and genuinely necessary measure would therefore be to abolish the senseless rules that prevent passengers from taking liquids on board at last, and to come up with a more sensible solution."
"(PL) Mr President, as the EU-India Summit approaches, we ought to reflect on the prospects for increasing cooperation with India."
"Despite significant progress, our cooperation with India is still significantly less dynamic than our links with China."
"The Union is India's main economic partner, but there is still scope for our companies to improve their position in those sectors of the Indian economy that are undergoing dynamic development."
"I am referring to energy, telecommunications and machinery."
"At the same time, we must ensure that the prospect of doing business with India does not lead us to overlook the problems facing its population."
"The most important of these are widespread poverty, the inadequacies of the health and education systems, the AIDS epidemic and the marked social contrasts."
"As we dispatch politicians, financiers, goods and know-how to India, we must not forget the need for humanitarian aid and medicine."
"Above all, we must not neglect the cause of religious freedom in India."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Mr President, I would like to thank everyone for this debate, which has shown the importance we attach to the development of our partnership with India, because it is a power that contributes to international and regional stability, because it is, as has been said, the largest, most populous and most democratic country in the region and because it is a country that, in spite of the difficulties that have been mentioned, upholds cultural and religious pluralism."
"In response to the concerns that have been voiced by Mr Tannock and others, I would say that the fight against terrorism is a key element of the dialogue between the European Union and India."
"With regard to the terrorist violence that has struck India, the Union condemns all the attacks of which the country has been victim and, as Mrs Gill stated, our sympathies are with the victims of these attacks, which aim to destroy the multiethnic and multi-confessional nature of Indian society."
"Several speakers have, quite rightly, referred to the violence, persecution and attacks targeting the Christian community in general and the Christian community in Orissa in particular."
"We have been extremely watchful of these incidents and we will obviously address them at the summit."
"However, as Mrs Gill said, we must provide constructive criticism and we must make sure to praise the courageous attitude, which has been referred to by several speakers, of the Indian Prime Minister, who described these events as a national disgrace and was quick to dispatch 3 000 police officers to Orissa."
"We remain deeply concerned by the attacks and the violence committed against people of different faiths, in particular the Christian communities."
"We reiterate that the fight against terrorism must take place in a context of respect for the rule of law and international law."
"On the issue of regional stability, raised by Mr Menéndez del Valle and Mr Berman among others, the European Union has requested that the situation in Burma should be included on the summit agenda."
"The Union wishes to convince all Burma's neighbours that democratic reform and a peaceful transition in the country are in their interests."
"We will discuss the matter with India and with other countries."
"We wish to see greater stability too and hope that the negotiations can bring results with regard to the situation in Kashmir and India-Pakistan relations."
"In terms of the social issues mentioned, including child labour, touched on by Mrs Kallenbach, the Council shares these concerns and not only with regard to India."
"We are negotiating with our Indian partners an action plan aimed at strengthening commitments in the area of corporate social responsibility, decent work and efforts to combat child labour."
"We have made provisions on fundamental labour rights in line with the International Labour Organisation's standards a part of our delicate negotiations on the trade and investment agreement."
"As I said, I share in part Mrs Gill's opinion, which seems to me a very balanced one."
"We should stand up for the victims of all terrorist attacks and must criticise India when the measures it takes to counter them appear to us insufficient, but we must also support the Indian authorities when they take appropriate action."
"As regards the comments made on nuclear cooperation, I would like to remind you that, on 6 September 2008, an agreement was concluded by the Nuclear Suppliers Group, in which it was agreed to grant a derogation making it possible to establish trade relations with India in the field of civil nuclear power, under the supervision of, with the agreement of and in respect of the conditions set by the International Atomic Energy Agency."
"I would also stress that India has pledged to extend its moratorium on nuclear testing and that the civil and military programmes should not be confused."
"In conclusion, I reiterate that the European Union is alone in developing a firm dialogue with all the emerging countries and which applies to each partner the same human rights criteria, with a compulsory clause appearing in all new agreements from 1995 that requires respect for international law, whether it is in the form of the International Criminal Court, the United Nations conventions on political rights or the application of social and environmental rights."
"This goes for all emerging countries, including our Indian partners."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, honourable Members, let me almost in telegram form answer some of your detailed questions and add a couple of points."
"Firstly, a piece of information that I think is important to all of you who are engaged in the issue of India-EU cooperation concerns the recent flooding in Bihar state, where the European Commission is providing assistance to the victims of this catastrophe."
"The Commission mobilised EUR 2 million for emergency relief to cover the most urgent needs of food, shelter, water, sanitation and medical support."
"This has been provided both to those displaced and those who remained in the affected villages."
"I thought it important for you to know that."
"There was a question on civil aviation."
"In principle, the signature of the horizontal agreement at the summit should be accompanied by the signature of the financing agreement on a new civil aviation cooperation programme covering EUR 12.5 million."
"That is the highest amount of European Community funding for aviation for any third country."
"I would just like to say a few words on climate change, because it is, of course, in our interests to engage India in the run-up to the post-Kyoto regime."
"As you know, we take the view, contrary to India, that climate-change-related measures are not incompatible with economic development."
"On the contrary, they can help us and we urge India to also be proactive in the coming Poznań Conference to prepare post-Kyoto and in the negotiations on an agreement in Copenhagen."
"We have good reason to expect that a work programme on energy and climate change will be adopted at the summit, and this is an essential component of our cooperation with India."
"We are, of course, following very closely the communal violence in the state of Orissa, which we deplore."
"We raised the issue of Orissa at the last human rights dialogue in February, asking the authorities to prevent such violence."
"We also raised the issue with the India National Human Rights Commission and the National Minorities Commission."
"We will also raise it at this summit on the basis of a report which has been requested from the Heads of Mission in Delhi."
"Finally, concerning our dialogue on India, I would like to say to Mrs Gill that the Commission is prepared to inform Parliament on the priorities set in the revised Joint Action Plan."
"Our External Relations Department holds regular meetings with all the services directly involved in Indian affairs and a representative of the secretariat of the Parliament is always invited to these meetings, but I think it is important to follow this up in a very practical way."
"Thank you very much for this debate."
"We will of course take back to the Commission all your detailed and well-informed views."
"in writing. - (PL) In the run-up to the EU-India Summit in Marseille on 29 September, I should like to draw attention to certain dramatic events."
"I am referring to the wave of violence against Christians and the serial killings of Christians in August in India, notably in Orissa."
"The European Parliament should strongly condemn such incidents."
"The issue of police behaviour in the context of the massacre of representatives of religious minorities is also of concern."
"I should like to express my deep distress and concern regarding the attacks on Christians in Orissa, and in particular in the Kandhamal district."
"I would also like to emphasise the need to provide immediate aid and support for the victims."
"in writing. - (PL) India is an important partner for the European Union."
"In both political and economic terms, India's achievements are impressive."
"There is scope for ongoing improvement of the relations between India and the Union."
"Such relations could be mutually beneficial."
"There does seem to be, however, a serious impediment to the development of India and of our mutual relations, an impediment that significantly reduces India's potential."
"I believe that this impediment is the caste system currently operating in India."
"The Indian authorities must make every effort to cleanse Indian society of the negative, and indeed sometimes tragic, consequences of this system."
"In such cases, legislative action and political declarations alone are not enough."
"What is important is actually changing social relations and inhuman traditions."
"This is not an easy task and one cannot expect immediate results."
"We should not be dissuaded by the prospect of a long-term process."
"On the contrary, we should support India's efforts in this important enterprise."
"I trust that the forthcoming EU-India Summit will help to weaken the caste system in India and to improve standards of human rights and citizens' rights in the world's largest democracy."

"- Before the vote:"
"rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, Madam Commissioner, we are about to vote on the Telecoms package, one of the most sensitive proposals of the closing period of this parliamentary term."
"My fellow rapporteurs, Mrs del Castillo Vera and Mr Harbour, and I have worked together closely to achieve a coherent and efficient proposal for the end-users of these directives, namely the Commission and regulators, but one that is also positive and valuable to those looking for legal certainty, encouragement for investment, and a dynamic and balanced market, that is, operators and their employees, as well as for the primary beneficiaries of the numerous services and quality at a fair and accessible price: the consumers."
"All of us - rapporteurs, draftsmen and shadow rapporteurs - were united in these aims and that is why we were able to reach a solid compromise, attested to by the small number of amendments on which we are to vote."
"I would like to express my profound gratitude to all the rapporteurs, the chairmen of the committees responsible and committees asked for opinions, their secretariats and all the political groups."
"I also wish to thank the colleagues that have shown an interest in this matter and contributed to our work."
"I now call on my fellow Members to support their rapporteurs and draftsmen through their vote and to grant them a clear and decisive mandate for the period of codecision that will follow."
"Finally, I hope that the Commission and Council will respond positively to Parliament's amended version of the package, which, although it represents in many regards an alternative to the Commission's initial vision, still presents as many areas of agreement between our three institutions."
"- Before the vote on Amendment 132:"
"(DE) Mr President, with reference to Amendment 132, on behalf of the signatories, I wish to withdraw this amendment, as regrettably, our efforts in this House to achieve a compromise which strengthens copyright have been unsuccessful."
"- Before the vote on Amendment 138:"
"rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, we have a relatively difficult decision with regard to Amendment 138, for which three requests for a split vote have been tabled."
"I personally tabled an oral amendment to the first part of the amendment, which is included on the voting list and reads: 'applying the principle that no restriction may be imposed on the fundamental rights and freedoms of end-users'."
"That is the first oral amendment."
"Since then, we have been looking for a solution acceptable to the political groups in relation to the third part of the amendment."
"I therefore propose a new oral amendment, with the backing of the signatories, including the Chairman of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, Mrs Niebler, and others, which would read: 'save when public security is threatened where the ruling may be subsequent'."
"This would replace the third part and clarify matters, as the third part proposed by Mr Bono is ambiguous as regards the exception."
"By making this clarification, we have a readable and acceptable amendment."
"Incidentally - for the benefit of Mrs Hieronymi - it has nothing to do with intellectual property, as she was saying."
"(The oral amendment was accepted)"
"Voting time"
"The next item is voting time."
"(For the outcome and other details of the vote: see Minutes)"
"Welcome"
"Voting time is being suspended very briefly while we receive the Lebanese parliamentary delegation, which is observing our work and to which we of course extend a warm welcome."
"The delegation from the Lebanese Parliament, led by Boutros Harb, is visiting the European Parliament in the context of our interparliamentary meetings."
"Allow me to emphasise the importance which we attach to this visit, after the difficult years Lebanon has experienced, with a civil war that lasted 15 years, followed by occupation and more recently the war that raged during the summer of 2006 and the paralysis of its State institutions."
"We are particularly pleased to receive the delegation at a time when the political situation in Lebanon, but also in the region as a whole, has improved considerably, particularly following the Doha Agreement and the election of the President of the Republic."
"We hope that, with the new electoral law being put to the vote within the next few days, the legislative elections scheduled for next year will take place under the best of circumstances and will give fresh impetus to Lebanese democracy, which the European Parliament fully supports."
"On behalf of the European Parliament, therefore, I should like to welcome the members of the delegation, in the hope that the discussions in which they take part at the European Parliament will be extremely fruitful."
"I thank the delegation once again."

"The next item is the continuation of voting time."
"Formal sitting - Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew"
"Your Holiness, Patriarch Bartholomew, it is a great honour to welcome you to this formal sitting of the European Parliament during the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue 2008."
"The first guest to address the European Parliament as part of the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue was the Grand Mufti of Damascus in January."
"He is from Syria and addressed us as a messenger of peaceful Islam."
"Your Holiness, you represent the Christian faith, and the Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks will address the European Parliament in Strasbourg in November as a representative of the Jewish faith."
"People from these three faiths - Christianity, Judaism and Islam - have lived side by side for centuries."
"Unfortunately, this coexistence has not always been peaceful."
"Even today, in the Middle East and elsewhere, there are areas marked by tensions between these communities."
"We in the European Parliament support every effort to promote the peaceful coexistence of religions and cultures in the Middle East and elsewhere in the world."
"In the Middle East, there are also examples of religious tolerance and harmonious relations between people of different faiths."
"When I visited Syria a short time ago, I had the opportunity to meet the spiritual leaders of the various faith communities and they assured me that in their country, good relations exist, underpinning the dialogue between religions and cultures."
"The European Union is a community based on values, and one of our most fundamental values is the dignity which is inherent in every individual."
"In this respect, religious freedom is central to human dignity, and goes far beyond the powers invoked by state authorities."
"The separation of church and state, which we esteem so highly, is a guarantee of the freedom of religious communities to manage their own internal affairs and external relations."
"These principles are reaffirmed in the Treaty of Lisbon, whose entry into force we are seeking to secure."
"The Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, with its seat in Phanar in Istanbul, was founded in the 4th century and is an important spiritual centre for 300 million Orthodox Christians worldwide."
"Phanar means 'beacon', and you, Your Holiness, have always been a beacon of reconciliation and peace for the faithful in the Orthodox world and beyond."
"The latest enlargement of the European Union has brought countries with Orthodox majorities, such as Cyprus, Bulgaria and Romania, into the EU, while Greece has been a member since 1981."
"The late Pope John Paul II, who addressed the European Parliament in 1988, used the following metaphor to describe this: he said that after overcoming its division, Europe is breathing with both its lungs again."
"We could use this metaphor again today to describe the richness of the enlarged EU, brought about by the different perspectives of Western and Eastern Christianity."
"Your Holiness, we thank you for your visit."
"You are one of the very few figures to address the European Parliament for a second time."
"You were here in 1994, and you are honouring us with a further address on the occasion of the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue."
"We are looking forward to hearing your speech."
"May I now invite you to address the European Parliament. Thank you."
"(Applause)"
"Your Excellency Mr President of the European Parliament, your Excellencies, honourable Members of the European Parliament, distinguished guests, dear friends, first and foremost we convey to you salutations from the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, based for many, many centuries in what is today Istanbul - greetings replete with esteem and respect."
"In particular, we express our gratitude to an old friend of ours, His Excellency Hans-Gert Pöttering, President of the European Parliament."
"We likewise express our sincerest appreciation for the extraordinary honour to address the plenary sitting of the European Parliament for the second time (as the President already mentioned), especially on this occasion that commemorates the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue."
"As a purely spiritual institution, our Ecumenical Patriarchate embraces a truly global apostolate that strives to raise and broaden the consciousness of the human family - to bring understanding that we are all dwelling in the same house."
"At its most basic sense, this is the meaning of the word 'ecumenical' - for the 'oikoumene' is the inhabited world - the earth understood as a house in which all peoples, kindreds, tribes and languages dwell."
"As is well known, the origins of our religious institution lie at the core of the Axial Age, deep in the history of the Christian Faith - with the earliest followers of Jesus Christ."
"Inasmuch as our See - our institutional centre - shared the centre and capital of the Christian Roman Empire, it became known as 'ecumenical', with certain privileges and responsibilities that it holds to this day."
"One of its chief responsibilities was for bringing the redemptive message of the Gospel to the world outside the Roman Empire."
"In the days before the exploratory age, most civilisations held such a bicameral view of the world as being 'within' and 'without'."
"The world was divided into two sectors: a hemisphere of civilisation and a hemisphere of barbarism."
"In this history, we behold the grievous consequences of the alienation of human persons from one another."
"Today, when we have the technological means to transcend the horizon of our own cultural self-awareness, we nevertheless continue to witness the terrible effects of human fragmentation."
"Tribalism, fundamentalism, and phyletism - which is extreme nationalism without regard to the rights of the other - all these contribute to the ongoing list of atrocities that give pause to our claims of being civilised in the first place."
"And yet, even with tides of trade, migrations and expansions of peoples, religious upheavals and revivals, and great geopolitical movements, the deconstruction of rigid and monolithic self-understandings of past centuries has yet to find a permanent harbour."
"The Ecumenical Patriarchate has sailed across the waves of these centuries, navigating the storms and the doldrums of history."
"For twenty centuries - through the Pax Romana, the Pax Christiana, the Pax Islamica, the Pax Ottomanica (all epochs marked by intercultural struggle, conflict and outright war) - the Ecumenical Patriarchate has continued as a lighthouse for the human family and the Christian Church."
"It is from the depths of our experience upon these deep waters of history that we offer to the contemporary world a timeless message of perennial human value."
"Today, the ecumenical scope of our Patriarchate extends far beyond the boundaries of its physical presence at the cusp of Europe and Asia, in the same city we have inhabited for the seventeen centuries since her founding."
"Though small in quantity, the extensive quality of our experience brings us before this august assembly today, in order to share from that experience on the necessity of intercultural dialogue, a lofty and timely ideal for the contemporary world."
"As you yourselves have said - in this most esteemed body's own words: 'At the heart of the European project, it is important to provide the means for intercultural dialogue and dialogue between citizens to strengthen respect for cultural diversity and deal with the complex reality in our societies and the coexistence of different cultural identities and beliefs' (Decision No 1983/2006/EC) and we would humbly append this noble statement, as we did last year in our address to the Plenary of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, in Strasbourg: 'Dialogue is necessary first and foremost because it is inherent in the nature of the human person'."
"This is the principal message that we propose for your consideration today: that intercultural dialogue is at the very root of what it means to be a human being, for no one culture of the human family encompasses every human person."
"Without such dialogue, the differences in the human family are reduced to objectifications of the 'other' and lead to abuse, conflict, persecution - a grand-scale human suicide, for we are all ultimately one humanity."
"But where the differences between us move us to encounter one another, and where that encounter is based in dialogue, there is reciprocal understanding and appreciation - even love."
"In the past 50 years, our human family has experienced leaps of technological achievement undreamed of by our forebears."
"Many have trusted that this kind of advancement will bridge the divides that fragment the human condition."
"As if our achievements had given us the power to overcome the fundamental realities of our moral and - may we say - our spiritual condition."
"Yet, despite every conceivable benefit and technological skill - skill that seems to outstrip our anthropological wit - we still behold the universal banes of hunger, thirst, war, persecution, injustice, planned misery, intolerance, fanaticism and prejudice."
"Amidst this cycle that cannot seem to be broken, the significance of the 'European project' cannot be underestimated."
"It is one of the hallmarks of the European Union that has succeeded in promoting mutual, peaceful and productive co-existence between nation states that less than 70 years ago were drenched in a bloody conflict that could have destroyed the legacy of Europe for the ages."
"Here, in this great hall of assembly of the European Parliament, you strive to make possible the relationships between states and political realities that make reconciliation between persons possible."
"Thus you have recognised the importance of intercultural dialogue, especially at a time in the history of Europe when transformations are taking place in every country and along every societal boundary."
"Great tidal forces of conflict, and economic security and opportunity have shifted populations around the globe."
"Of necessity, then, persons of differing cultural, ethnic, religious and national origin find themselves in close proximity."
"In some cases, the same populations shun the greater whole and close themselves off from the dominant society."
"But in either case, as we engage in dialogue, it must not be a mere academic exercise in mutual appreciation."
"For dialogue to be effective, to be transformative in bringing about core change in persons, it cannot be done on the basis of 'subject' and 'object'."
"The value of the 'other' must be absolute - without objectification; so that each party is apprehended in the fullness of their being."
"For Orthodox Christians, the icon, or image, stands not only as an acme of human aesthetic accomplishment, but as a tangible reminder of the perennial truth."
"As in every painting - religious or not, and notwithstanding the talent of the artist - the object presents as two-dimensional."
"Yet, for Orthodox Christians, an icon is no mere religious painting - and it is not, by definition, a religious object."
"Indeed, it is a subject with which the viewer, the worshipper, enters into wordless dialogue through the sense of sight."
"For an Orthodox Christian, the encounter with the icon is an act of communion with the person represented in the icon."
"How much more should our encounters with living icons - persons made in the image and likeness of God - be acts of communion!"
"In order for our dialogue to become more than mere cultural exchange, there must be a more profound understanding of the absolute interdependence - not merely of states and political and economic actors - but the interdependence of every single human person with every other single human person."
"And such a valuation must be made regardless of any commonality of race, religion, language, ethnicity, national origin, or any of the benchmarks by which we seek self-identification and self-identity."
"And in a world of billions of persons, how is such inter-connectedness possible?"
"Indeed, there is no possible way to link with every human person - this is a property that we would ascribe to the Divine."
"However, there is a way of understanding the universe in which we live as being shared by all - a plane of existence that spans the reality of every human person - an ecosphere that contains us all."
"Thus it is that the Ecumenical Patriarchate - in keeping with our own sense of responsibility for the house, the oikos of the world and all who dwell therein - has for decades championed the cause of the environment, calling attention to ecological crises around the globe."
"And we engage this ministry without regard to self-interest."
"As you know so well, our Patriarchate is not a 'national' church, but rather the fundamental canonical expression of the ecumenical dimensions of the Gospel message, and of its analogous responsibility within the life of the Church."
"This is the deeper reason that the Church Fathers and the Councils have given it the name 'Ecumenical'."
"The loving care of the Church of Constantinople exceeds any linguistic, cultural, ethnic and even religious definition, as she seeks to serve all peoples."
"Although firmly rooted in particular history - as any other institution is - the Ecumenical Patriarchate transcends historical categories in her perennial mission of service during 1 700 years."
"In our service to the environment, we have, to date, sponsored seven scientific symposia that bring together a host of disciplines."
"The genesis of our initiative grew on the island that gave humanity the Apocalypse, the Book of Revelation: the sacred island of Patmos in the Aegean Sea."
"And it was in the Aegean that we commenced, in 1995, an ambitious programme of integrating current scientific knowledge about the oceans with the spiritual approach of the world's religions to water, particularly the world's oceans."
"Since Patmos, since 1995, we have traversed the Danube, the Adriatic Sea, the Baltic Sea, the Amazon, the Arctic Sea (last September), and we are now making preparations to sail the Nile in Egypt and the Mississippi River in the United States, both next year."
"What we seek is not only an ongoing dialogue that is serviceable to practical necessities, but also one that raises human consciousness."
"While we strive to find answers to ecological concerns and crises, we also bring the participants into a more comprehensive sense of themselves as belonging to and relating to a greater whole."
"We seek to embrace the ecosphere of human existence not as an object to be controlled, but as a fellow-struggler on the path of increase and improvement."
"As the Apostle Paul, whose 2 000-year legacy both the Orthodox and the Roman Catholic Churches are celebrating this year, says in one of his most famous epistles, the Epistle to the Romans, 'For we know that until now, the whole of creation groans with us and shares our birth pangs'."
"Every ecosystem on this planet is like a nation - by definition limited to a place."
"The estuary is not the tundra, nor is the savannah the desert."
"But like every culture, every ecosystem will have an effect that goes beyond far beyond its natural - or in the case of cultures, national - boundaries."
"And when we understand that every ecosystem is part of the singular ecosphere that is inhabited by every living breath that fills the world, then do we grasp the interconnectedness, the powerful communion of all life, and our true interdependency on one another."
"Without such an understanding, we are led to ecocide, the self-destruction of the one ecosphere that sustains all human existence."
"Thus it is that we come before you today, highlighting this Year of Intercultural Dialogue, bringing parables from the natural world to affirm your transcendent human values."
"As an institution, the Ecumenical Patriarchate has lived as a relatively small ecosystem within a much larger culture for centuries."
"Out of this long experience, allow us to suggest the most important practical characteristic that enables the work of intercultural dialogue to succeed."
"Chiefly and above all, there must be respect for the rights of the minority within every majority."
"When and where the rights of the minority are observed, the society will for the most part be just and tolerant."
"In any culture, one segment will always be dominant - whether that dominance is based on race, religion or any other category."
"Segmentation is inevitable in our diverse world."
"What we seek to end is fragmentation!"
"Societies that are built upon exclusion and repression cannot last."
"Or, as the divine Prince of Peace Jesus Christ said: Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand."
"Our counsel to all is to recognise that only when we embrace the fullness of shared presence within the ecosphere of human existence, are we then able to face the 'otherness' of those around us - majority or minority - with a true sense of the consanguinity of the human family."
"Then do we behold the stranger amongst us not as an alien, but as a brother or sister in the human family, the family of God."
"St Paul expounds on pan-human relation and brotherhood quite eloquently and concisely when addressing the Athenians in the first century."
"This is why Europe needs to bring Turkey into its project and why Turkey needs to foster intercultural dialogue and tolerance in order to be accepted into the European project."
"Europe should not see any religion that is tolerant of others and respectful to the others as alien to itself."
"The great religions, like the European project, can be a force that transcends nationalism and can even transcend nihilism and fundamentalism by focusing their faithful on what unites us as human beings, and by fostering a dialogue about what divides us."
"From our country, Turkey, we perceive both a welcome to a new economic and trading partner, but we also feel the hesitation that comes from embracing, as an equal, a country that is predominantly Muslim."
"And yet Europe is filled with millions of Muslims who have come here from all sorts of backgrounds and causations; just as Europe would still be filled with Jews, had it not been for the horrors of the Second World War."
"Indeed, it is not only non-Christians that Europe must encounter, but Christians who do not fit into the categories of Catholic or Protestant."
"The resurgence of the Orthodox Church in Eastern Europe since the fall of the Iron Curtain has truly been a marvel for the world to behold."
"The segmentation of Eastern Europe has led to fragmentation in many places."
"Not only does the centre not hold; it is hardly discernible."
"Through this process, as nation states strive to re-establish themselves, it is the Orthodox Christian faith that has risen, even above economic indicators, to a new status that could not have been predicted even 20 years ago."
"One of the vital roles of our Ecumenical Patriarchate is to assist in the process of growth and expansion that is taking place in traditional Orthodox countries, by holding fast as the canonical norm for the worldwide Orthodox Church, over a quarter of a billion people around the globe."
"At this moment, we wish to inform you, dear friends, that in October - next month - at our invitation, all the Heads of the Orthodox Patriarchates and Autocephalous Churches will meet in Istanbul, in order to discuss our common problems and to strengthen Pan-Orthodox unity and cooperation."
"Simultaneously, we will also concelebrate the two thousand years since the birth of the Apostle of the Nations, St Paul."
"Currently in the City (Istanbul) we are experiencing great joy and enthusiasm as we are all preparing for its celebration as the European Capital of Culture in the year 2010."
"The City, which has a long history, was a crossroads for gatherings of people and served as a place of cohabitation of diverse religions and cultures."
"This past week, we attended a luncheon hosted by the Prime Minister of Turkey in honour of the Prime Minister of Spain."
"As is public knowledge, both are co-sponsors of the Alliance of Civilisations under the auspices of the United Nations."
"We heard their wonderful speeches, which were harmonious with the diachronic tolerant spirit of our City."
"And now dear friends, please allow us to conclude in French in order to honour the French presidency, and also because this week you celebrate the European Day of Languages, I think next Friday."
"Excellency, ladies and gentlemen of the European Parliament, the Ecumenical Patriarchate reaffirms its desire to do all in its power to contribute to peace and prosperity in the European Union."
"We are ready to join you in other constructive dialogues like that of today and we will lend an attentive ear to the problems of the day."
"It is in this spirit that our Patriarchate has been cultivating and nurturing meaningful dialogue with Islam and Judaism for the past 25 years."
"We have held many bilateral and trilateral meetings."
"Within this framework, we will be meeting in Athens at the beginning of November to resume, for the 12th time, our academic dialogue with Islam."
"Alongside these discussions, we are continuing our theological talks with the Roman Catholic, Anglican, Lutheran and Reformed Churches and with the ancient Oriental Churches: Armenian, Coptic, etc."
"This should illustrate that the Ecumenical Patriarchate is extremely active in the area of ecumenical dialogue and seeks to contribute to a better understanding between peoples, reconciliation, peace, solidarity and efforts to combat fanaticism, hatred and all forms of evil."
"We would like to thank you for this unique opportunity to address your Assembly for the second time and we call for God's infinite blessing for all your just ventures."
"Allow me, from this distinguished platform, to present my best wishes to Muslims all over the world at the approach of the great festival of Ramadan and also to the Jews of the world on the eve of Rosh Hashanah."
"We are all brothers and sisters, children of the same heavenly Father and, on this wonderful planet, for which we are all responsible, there is room for everyone, but there is no room for war or for those who kill each other."
"Once more, we thank you with all our heart for allowing us the great honour and privilege of addressing you today."
"(Standing ovation)"
"Your Holiness, the European Parliament has accorded you a standing ovation to show its great appreciation of your speech."
"You spoke of pax, of peace for the human family and creation."
"Peace is the culmination of respect for human dignity."
"We do not have to agree with every belief that exists, and we do not have to accept every view."
"What we must do, however, is respect our fellow men and women."
"It is this respect which is the core of human dignity, and it is the core of tolerance."
"In that spirit, we would like to express our warmest thanks to you once again for the contribution that you have made to the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue."
"It is a valuable contribution which fosters understanding between the people of our continent and the world, and promotes reconciliation, peace and freedom."
"Thank you very much, Your Holiness."

"- Before the vote:"
"rapporteur. - Mr President, I know that I will not be popular for making a long speech at this time, but my two fellow-rapporteurs, with whom I have worked very closely as a team, have made short statements so I want to keep the team spirit together."
"I would just like to say that there are more amendments in my report because my committee has been more ambitious in the improvements it wanted to make to the Commission proposal."
"I ask for your support to ensure that we have confident, well-informed consumers for electronic communications, who are also secure and know that their personal data is protected."
"I would like to thank all my colleagues on the committee who worked with me to put together some really big compromise amendments which we will pass today."
"I would like particularly to thank Alexander Alvaro and the Civil Liberties Committee, with whom we worked very closely, for their part on the E-Privacy Directive."
"I would like all of you to give us a huge majority for this so that, when we come to negotiate with the Commission and Council, we will do our very best for Europe's consumers."
"- After the vote:"
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteurs for their excellent work."
"It was not easy: they have worked miracles and they have my respect."
"I would also like to thank the honourable Members of the European Parliament for the strong signal they have given with today's vote."
"This is the signal for an open and competitive single market, for telecom companies and for Europe's 500 million consumers alike."
"Yesterday the Commission had to propose new rules to tackle excessive charging for SMS and data roaming in the EU."
"These proposals will provide a fast cure for one of the most visible symptoms of the lack of a single market in telecoms, from which both companies and consumers are suffering."
"Today, the European Parliament has gone an important step further by proposing to remedy the problem once and for all at its root: to get rid of the fragmentation by paving the way for a single market in regulatory terms."
"I welcome in particular the fact that the European Parliament voted, after an intense debate - and probably to the surprise of many observers - for the establishment of an efficient European telecom regulator, as a facilitator for bringing together the national regulators, and for the dialogue between the national regulators and the Commission."
"This is good news in the interest of a level playing field for the provision and use of telecom services across borders in Europe."
"This new European regulator will make a strong contribution to enhancing cross-border competition and consumer choice."
"Now, honourable parliamentarians, we need to sit together - Parliament, the Council and the Commission - in order to get this telecoms package up and running by 2010."
"There is not much time left."
"We have to do it substantially; we have to do it quickly now."
"Everything the Commission can do in order to help to advance will be done."
"I am convinced that the signal given today by Parliament goes beyond Europe: it is a signal that will be heard across the globe."
"It will show that the single telecom market in Europe is open for business in the interests of a strong industry and of an empowered consumer. Thank you and congratulations."

"In English, this must say as follows, from the last line:"
"'calls on India and the EU, particularly through the intermediary of the EU Special Envoy for Burma/Myanmar, to work together to prevail upon the Burmese military junta to release political prisoners and to respect human rights;'."

"The reason is that nowhere in the document is there any explicit condemnation of what happened in Orissa; much weaker synonyms are used instead."

"Explanations of vote"
"Oral explanations of vote"
"(NL) Mr President, in the end I voted for the two reports on the updating of the Schengen Information System."
"However, I should like to add that I still believe that the implementation of the Schengen Agreements has made our borders a sort of glorified sieve, that they have become much more insecure and less controlled."
"Since Schengen we are absolutely all just as vulnerable as the weakest link in the border controls and that creates especially serious problems."
"However, if the system does exist and continues to exist, I do of course have a duty to support controls that are applied as efficiently as possible and the exchange of information."
"That is why I voted in favour, but that should certainly not be taken as approval of the open borders policy of the European Union."
"(ES) Regrettably, for reasons beyond my control, I could not take part in yesterday's debate on this directive on ship inspection and survey organisations."
"I want to take advantage of this opportunity to express my satisfaction that this directive has been adopted by Parliament with the recommendations of the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"There were a couple of aspects that were not clear enough or properly dealt with in the common position adopted by the Council."
"The first was that ship classification societies, when acting on behalf of national administrations - because it is the responsibility of flag States to guarantee the safety of ships - must be covered by the same legal guarantees as when it is the national administrations that are acting."
"Secondly, I believe we have properly clarified the financial liabilities in the event of an incident."
"The Council common position did not clearly distinguish between the three possible cases - where these incidents cause the deaths of people, where they cause personal injury or where they simply cause property damage - so Parliament has sorted this out and ensured that it is clarified."
"I hope this will be accepted by the Council."
"Mr President, I voted in favour of this report, because I believe it will go a long way towards creating the competition that the European electronic communication industry really needs."
"For too long, British telecommunication companies have struggled in other parts of Europe against enterprises, because they are still effectively run as a monopoly."
"Spectrum trading has created a significant amount of revenue for the UK Government, which has been successfully reinvested, but the advantage of this report is that it introduces principles of service, technology and neutrality, which, by foregoing the practice of insisting on the service that spectrums are used for and the technological standards used, will go even further towards ensuring large companies do not dominate the market."
"In the UK, BT has come a long way from nationalised telecommunication provider to a successful regulated company."
"However, within my own constituency, I still see problems associated with the dominance of large service providers."
"Particularly problematic are rural areas, where consumers suffer because they are deemed too commercially unviable to be given adequate broadband coverage."
"I hope the report's determination to see these disparities solved will be put into practice."
"(CS) It is true that the lack of a functioning competitive environment in the telecommunications sector makes the adoption of a new regulatory framework a desirable, even a necessary, step."
"I consider the chosen solution to be an undoubted contribution in the field of functional separation based on the principle of voluntary commitment."
"Every Member State will thus be able to decide, in the light of the local conditions, whether to agree to functional separation or whether to maintain the status quo."
"I myself have reservations about functional separation, both because there is insufficient experience of it and because I consider competition between different types of network, which the Union's activities should encourage, to be more important than competition within a single network."
"In some case, however, regulation goes too far."
"I cannot, for example, agree that the European Commission should have the right of veto in relation to remedial measures adopted by national regulators within their own markets."
"It is inconsistent with the principle of division of powers for the Commission to interfere in matters of national, and not European scope."
"I should like a balanced legislative framework reflecting the needs of operators and their customers, in which there is no room for regulation for its own sake, but only for regulation which helps to improve the quality and availability of telecommunications services."
"(CS) I must admit that I was surprised by the disagreements in the discussions on draft Amendment 138, when some fellow Members were unable to interpret the draft amendment in accordance with the text."
"As the co-author, I wish to emphasise that the provisions guarantee that users can only be disconnected from the Internet with the assent of the Board of Regulators."
"Users' rights may, however, be violated if this is necessary in the interests of general security."
"The fundamental right of users to privacy will not be violated by blocking or filtering content without the consent of the competent public authorities."
"I was attracted to this proposal by some examples from France, where the Ministry for European Affairs' pages and some train reservation pages were blocked on the Paris Town Hall's public network owing to the erroneous assessment of their content as pornographic."
"Thank you, fellow Members, for eventually supporting our balanced proposal, and thank you, France, for falling into line with it."
"(CS) As the shadow rapporteur, I am pleased that the Body of European Regulators in Telecom (BERT), on the basis of amendments adopted by the European Parliament, is saving European taxpayers tens of millions of euro each year."
"Contrary to the Commission's proposal, a slimmer and more flexible institution has been established, which is making the most of the advantages of the single market while retaining the independence of national telecommunications authorities."
"I am pleased that, thanks to my initiative, the position of consumer organisations has been strengthened."
"I also supported the broad consensus on the matter of the financing of the Body's budget, but I would again point to the risks which might arise from the differing contributions of Member States."
"This may lead to an imbalance in the influence of the Member States, especially the large ones, on decision-making on the cross-border regulation of their telecommunications."
"(SK) I should first of all like to thank the rapporteur for his many years' work and consistent approach within the framework of the legislative package in the field of electronic communications."
"I supported his report in today's vote."
"The telecommunications package represents a necessary update of the current regulations, especially as regards protection of individuals' privacy and personal data."
"This aspect was one of the main objectives of the proposal and I supported the view that the data protection and security aspects need to be understood in a broader context than the purely European context, since communications service and Internet system providers are based all over the world and work with personal data within different legal systems."
"I also supported the proposal to improve and strengthen consumer rights, in particular more information on, and transparency of, prices and the terms and conditions for using telecommunications services."
"Last but not least, I welcomed the draft report's attempts to facilitate and improve access to electronic communications for the disabled."
"(CS) Mr President, the report just adopted is related to my own year-old report on consumer confidence in the digital environment and I therefore welcome the fact that the rights of end users and consumers are significantly strengthened."
"I am particularly pleased that we have been able to deal with such matters as number portability within one day, which frees up the rigid market in mobile operators, and the emergency call number 112 giving the location of the caller, which will save more people's lives."
"There are many improvements, including the following: the European call number 116 will be extended beyond the scope of missing children, there will be a breakthrough in the transparency of contracts and prices, it will be easier to terminate contractual relations at an early stage, ordinary users will have easier access to protection software, disabled users will be guaranteed equal access and spam will be more precisely defined."
"(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to express my disagreement with the dispute, which had not even been settled by the end of yesterday's debate with the Commission, with respect to the legal basis for approval of this international agreement on the sustainable and lawful logging of tropical timber."
"I firmly believe that it should require the approval of Parliament, not just consultation."
"The agreement is inadequate, but we have nothing else at present and I am therefore pleased that we have adopted it so clearly today."
"We are making a stand against the plundering of tropical forests, but I am afraid that millions of tonnes of tropical timber will continue to pour into Europe at dumping prices, because it has not been possible to force environmental requirements into European trade policy."
"This is a paradox, because we pride ourselves on carrying the banner for the reduction of CO2 emissions throughout the world."
"Something is not quite right here."
"Perhaps the right hand does not know what the left hand is doing, or vice versa."
"(SK) I voted for the European Parliament's resolution on the legislative and work programme for 2009 owing to its overall competence."
"In my view, fundamental support for the European Parliament's measures to stabilise the financial markets in the current financial crisis is a particularly good decision."
"I believe, however, that this programme does not take any account of food safety, which will have to be covered by concrete measures and not just expressions of regret."
"One particularly urgent element is maximising the agricultural potential in the new Member States, since the current discriminatory common agricultural policy is resulting in a serious deterioration of agriculture in these new Member States."
"(NL) Mr President, the recommendations this Parliament drew up for the work programme of the European Commission for 2009 were, all things considered, really quite strong."
"However, one might have expected that this Parliament should, in the first place, have urged respect for a democratic legal order in Europe through the politically appointed mandarins of the European Commission."
"What would that mean in practice?"
"I shall give just two examples."
"Firstly, for goodness' sake, respect the decision of the Irish people, a decision that undoubtedly expresses the wishes of a large majority of our European citizens who do not even have the opportunity to speak out against the Treaty of Lisbon: so throw out the disguised European Constitution."
"The second example, and this is the most crucial, is to stop the accession negotiations with Turkey, for which there is absolutely no democratic basis."
"Of course we have already known for a long time that the Eurocrats do not care one bit about the wishes of the citizens, who nonetheless pay for their lavish lifestyle with their taxes."
"(PL) Mr President, during the vote on this resolution there was an appalling instance where an oral amendment was rejected."
"It happened at the request of Mr Schulz, one of the main defenders of human rights and an advocate of non-discrimination."
"Mr Cohn-Bendit, who is well-known for his defence of human rights across a broad spectrum, was also involved."
"We are all fully aware, however, of the gruesome happenings in India, and of the blood spilt in that country."
"It was precisely Christians who were affected."
"I cannot therefore understand where this neo-racism manifested by leading European politicians has originated."
"I cannot understand how these people dare to reject such a clear amendment to the report in this very Chamber."
"After all, Parliament is supposed to be founded on defence of human rights and the principle of non-discrimination."
"I believe that this issue is likely to provide abundant food for thought for Parliament and the general population."
"(DE) Mr President, I voted against the resolution on the EU-India Summit, not because I am opposed to cooperation with India."
"On the contrary, as a Co-President of the Friends of India in this House, I am clearly in favour of strengthening cooperation with India."
"However, this resolution is nothing short of a shopping list of all the topics that we could possibly think of in relation to this enormous country."
"Paragraph 29 is a case in point: in this paragraph, we call for a Commission progress report on human rights in India and the outcomes of the EU-India human rights dialogue."
"Despite that, we then have numerous paragraphs referring to specific population groups, such as the Christians in Orissa, the Muslims in Kashmir and the Dalits in other parts of the country."
"To that extent, what we have just heard from the previous speaker was quite absurd, given that this topic is mentioned very frequently in the resolution."
"I think everything has its proper time and place."
"Just imagine if the Indian Parliament were to adopt a resolution on the status of the Roma in the Czech Republic, the Hungarians in Slovakia and the Russians in Estonia and Latvia."
"We are not mature enough to focus on the most important matters; instead, we always get distracted with a long list of all kinds of issues, and that really does narrow our influence."
"I know we are not taken seriously as a result."
"That is why I have voted against the resolution."
"It is a great pity: this Ninth Summit is important."
"The House has been talking about reform, and that is exactly what we need: we need to think about reforming this kind of resolution text as well."
"Written explanations of vote"
"in writing. - Costas Botopoulos' report 'Amendment to Rule 121 of Parliament's Rules of Procedure on proceedings before the Court of Justice' deals with a minor modification of the rules to Parliamentary procedure."
"I therefore voted in favour of its recommendations."
"in writing. - (PL) I voted in favour of the report on amendments to Rule 121 of the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament concerning proceedings before the European Court of Justice."
"I did so because the issue in question is an example of respect for the rule of law."
"Rule 121(3) of the Rules of Procedure states that the President shall bring an action before the Court of Justice on behalf of Parliament and in accordance with the recommendation of the committee responsible."
"This provision refers explicitly and exclusively to complaints before the Court."
"In such cases it is not possible to apply a broader interpretation according to which this provision could be applied to other cases of a different nature before the Court."
"The provision is only implemented in cases involving the filing of a complaint (on repeal of a legal act, for instance) when Parliament initiates court proceedings."
"In the interests of ensuring legal certainty and completeness, the rapporteur rightly proposed the addition of a new paragraph to Rule 121."
"The new paragraph would enshrine the established practice regarding the submission of comments by the President of the European Parliament to the Court and his or her appearances before the Court at the request of the Committee on Legal Affairs."
"The proposed amendment establishes a procedure to be followed should a difference of opinion emerge between the President and the relevant committee."
"Thanks to this amendment, the procedure currently being followed will have a democratic legal basis."
"in writing. - (PL) I should like to express my dissatisfaction that despite the fact that the SIS is a matter of such importance to the citizens of the European Union it is being with under the consultation procedure according to which Parliament simply presents its views."
"The latter are not binding on the Council."
"The SIS, the Schengen Information System, actually symbolises the Europe without borders that guarantees an area of freedom, security and justice across the Union."
"The SIS has created the possibility for police and judicial cooperation on criminal matters in the old Member States."
"It has allowed a unique European database of individuals and entities to be established."
"This is particularly important in the context of issuing visas and residence permits."
"When the 12 new Member States joined the Union it became necessary to include them in the SIS system."
"SIS II has met that need."
"This is a new generation system covering all the EU Member States and enabling complete data to be gathered, including biometric data and information on European arrest warrants."
"The Union now needs to tackle the tricky operation of transferring all the data into the new SIS II system."
"This is a particularly necessary operation but also a complicated one."
"I therefore appeal for care and caution."
"The data gathered in the so-called old system must not be allowed to leak and fall into unauthorised hands."
"That data must be handled safely, because the safety of the EU citizens and Member States depends on it."
"in writing. - (PT) We are striving to ensure that there is truly free movement of persons within Europe."
"As a result, we consider that the 'Schengen area' (which does not include all EU countries and much less so all European countries), despite removing barriers between the participating countries, is actually reinforcing those barriers with other countries (particularly countries with which Portugal has historic links)."
"Having said this, we cannot ignore the fact that, using the excuse of 'freedom of movement', an information system and databases are being set up which go well beyond this objective, making these into one of the central supporting instruments (or 'backbone') of the security offensive (led by the EU) and the progressive 'Communitisation' of justice and home affairs, areas which are at the heart of Member State sovereignty."
"In other words, we cannot agree to what the Council Presidency is proposing: first set up the system and then define its objectives."
"This is particularly important because the objectives have been defined for a long time (introduction of the European arrest warrant and biometric data, access by new entities, including data-sharing with third countries, and so on)."
"As we have said previously, these measures threaten the protection of citizens' rights, freedoms and guarantees."
"in writing. - (FR) On reading this rapport, one question comes to mind: is it because the 'first generation' Schengen Information System did not work or was at least ineffective as a means of ensuring security within the Schengen area that a 'second generation' system, intended to remedy these shortcomings, is being implemented?"
"Sadly not, as this second-generation system is no more than an updated version of an already flawed system."
"According to the figures given by the Commission, 400 000 illegal immigrants cross the Union's borders each year."
"Even supposing that biometric data will soon be available and ready to use to establish files for and send home illegal immigrants already registered as such, the European Union would be incapable of putting an end to the mass immigration that takes place along its coasts and land borders because of a lack of controls at the Member States' internal and external borders."
"The Schengen Information System will only ever be a useless gadget as long as the dangerous Schengen agreements are in place."
"in writing. - (DE) The implementation of SIS II had to be postponed several times due to technical difficulties."
"At the time, the new Eastern European Member States, for example, faced major problems at their borders and therefore pressed for the introduction of a 'stop-gap programme'."
"That may have been a sensible approach in view of the situation at that time, but it undoubtedly resulted in additional costs being incurred."
"Experience with the current SIS model seems to be positive."
"In the long term, the programme must of course be developed further."
"Improvised interim solutions can cause security gaps, however, which is why I have rejected the planned introduction of the improvised version, as I believe that it is premature."
"in writing. - In relation to RCVs 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 on the Sterckx Report, I and my Irish EPP-ED colleagues voted against or abstained on these amendments, so as to demonstrate our concerns over issues relating to the power of the independent authority and the scope of the Directive which would undermine Member State competence in a number of areas."
"We fully support the general thrust of the Directive and wish to see a successful agreement reached between Parliament and Council."
"in writing. - (FR) Europe wishes to protect itself against maritime accidents and the pollution of its seas and oceans."
"We welcome this."
"The recent terrible examples of the Prestige and Erika shipwrecks are there to remind us of our duty to be careful and to monitor vessel safety, but also of our responsibilities in the event of an environmental disaster."
"A special reference should, moreover, be made in the proposal for a Directive to post-accident inquiries."
"For the first time, it has been agreed that an investigative body should be set up that is charged with deciding, with complete independence and impartiality, whether or not to open an inquiry to determine the causes and circumstances of an accident."
"The intentions are good; let us only hope that they are not cast aside in the face of the huge financial interests at stake."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of this report by my Belgian colleague, Mr Sterckx, on the regulation of maritime traffic."
"Since the Erika shipwreck of 1999 and that of the Prestige in 2002, we have been waiting in vain for European solutions to ensure that such disasters never happen again."
"Far from having decreased, the risk increases every day: maritime traffic is set to triple in the next 30 years."
"In spite of this worrying prediction, the majority of Member States have been quick to 'sink' the main measures put forward by the Commission and supported by the European Socialists."
"One noticeable disappearance is that of an insurance policy, by means of a financial guarantee, that would make it easier for the victims of maritime disasters to be compensated."
"Adopting this report means opposing cynicism and the irresponsibility of states."
"Parliament can be proud of its unity, because, through its vote today, it is showing its unstinting commitment to safer and less polluted European waters."
"in writing. - I and my Irish EPP-ED colleagues abstained on the report on the amendments to the Kohlicek Report."
"We did so due to concerns relating to the impact of the division of investigations into technical and criminal and the problems that this would create under Irish law."
"We support the general thrust of this and all the Maritime Reports adopted today in plenary."
"in writing. - Representing Scotland, I recognise the importance of maritime transport and believe that this sector is one which has immense potential for future development."
"It is vital that adequate measures are taken to maximise safety at sea and to prevent accidents; accordingly this package, which will serve to prevent repeat accidents occurring, is one which I welcome."
"in writing. - The Costa report deals with important issues for all maritime regions."
"It is vital that the EU is serious about improving safety standards at sea whilst not placing unrealistic burdens on carriers."
"I fully support the notion that national authorities and port authorities play a vital role in identifying risks involved in this area and am on the whole satisfied with the measures adopted by this House today."
"in writing. - I and my Irish EPP-ED colleagues abstained on the vote on the Report on Port State Control due to concerns that the amendments as put forward would undermine and complicate the Paris MoU, and we feel that the issue of Flag States would be better dealt with in a separate Directive and that inclusion of such amendments would unnecessarily complicate this Directive."
"in writing. - (FR) With our vote today, we have reminded the Council that the Erika III package forms a whole and should be examined as such."
"That is why I agreed to the inclusion of the amendments to the Savary report in my report on port state control."
"Furthermore, by reverting to our first-reading positions, we have refused to follow the Council in abandoning two important proposals on flag state control and shipowners' civil liability, for which we received no common positions."
"The French Presidency, whose hard work and ongoing commitment to finding a solution to this problem deserves a mention, has convinced the Council to resume work on the two missing proposals."
"I am certain that it will manage to break the deadlock and that the conciliation procedure will produce an overall agreement on the Erika III package."
"I hope that this procedure can be launched without delay so that we can reach a conclusion before the end of the year."
"Maritime security should remain a priority on the European political agenda and it is with this intention that I shall continue to uphold our proposals."
"in writing. - (SV) The moderates essentially support the proposal for a directive on common rules and standards for ship inspection and survey organisations, and also voted for it on first reading in April 2007."
"In preparation for the second reading, the Committee on Transport and Tourism decided to incorporate into this directive large parts of the proposal for a directive on compliance with flag State requirements, which was rejected by the Council."
"The directive on compliance with flag State requirements was an attempt to extend EU competence to an area in which there are already UN rules."
"We already voted against that extension on first reading in March 2007 and therefore also do not support this attempt to introduce these rules by the back door as part of the Directive on common rules and standards for ship inspection and survey organisations."
"We have therefore chosen to vote against Mr de Grandes Pascual's report."
"in writing. - I am in support of this report from the Parliament looking at Ship Inspections and Survey Organisations and I am in favour of the other Parliament reports which, along with this one, make up the Maritime Package."
"The issue of the two 'missing' dossiers, on Civil Liability and Flag States, needs to be resolved by the Council one way or another, so it is important that Parliament keeps the pressure on by including them collectively in the Sterckx report on Vessel Traffic Monitoring, the Vlasto report on Port State Control and this report."
"Much work has been done, and I feel that agreement on the five dossiers we have voted on today could be easily reached, However without Civil Liability and without Flag States we will not be able to move any further forward."
"The Council must find a solution to their internal stalemate or else we will not be able to deliver a safer Maritime sector to the citizens of the EU."
"in writing. - (FR) Following the shipwrecks of the oil tankers Erika and Prestige, the European Socialists led the fight for 'high-end' EU legislation on maritime safety."
"The seven Third Maritime Safety Package reports are a decision step towards achieving that aim, provided the Council does not empty them of their content."
"Since the first reading in 2007, the Council has rejected most of Parliament's recommendations on the other five."
"At this second reading, and after a great deal of amendment work, Parliament reaffirms the absolute priority it attaches to the creation of a European maritime policy that affords a high level of protection with regard to:"
"flag state control,"
"a Community vessel traffic monitoring system,"
"liability of passenger carriers,"
"ship inspections and survey organisations,"
"the designation of an independent competent authority for the accommodation of vessels in distress,"
"the application of the 'polluter pays' principle to the maritime sector."
"I strongly support this message to the Council."
"I appeal to Nicolas Sarkozy and Dominique Bussereau to ensure that the French Presidency allows the creation of a maritime area in Europe that can serve as a model for all."
"in writing. - (LT) The main purpose of all legislation on medicinal products has to be to protect our society's health."
"However, this aim should be achieved by measures that do not interfere with the development of industry in the European Union or the trade in medicinal products."
"Despite the fact that earlier regulations have drawn up a list of food colourants, different countries have different laws on their use."
"These differences can hinder the trade in medicines containing these colourants, and that is why the regulation must be amended; this would bring more clarity and make the work of quite a few institutions easier."
"in writing. - (PT) This proposal seeks to amend the regulatory framework for electronic communications in order to improve its effectiveness, ensure simpler and more efficient access to frequencies available in the radio spectrum and reduce the administrative costs needed to implement the regulations."
"As a result, wherever they are in the EU, European citizens should benefit from more efficient and cheaper communication services, whether they are using mobile phones, broadband connections to the Internet or cable television."
"The new system for the radio spectrum is intended to promote investment in new infrastructures and allow all citizens to have broadband access."
"An internal communications market that is operating correctly and a competitive information society economy, benefiting consumers and businesses, can only exist if the regulatory framework for telecommunications is coherently applied."
"To this end, the Commission's coordination role should be reinforced, acting in strict cooperation with the NRAs (National Regulatory Authorities) and the new Body of European Regulators in Telecom (BERT), in order to improve the coherence of both national decisions with an impact on the internal market and the imposition of remedies."
"I therefore support this report and the main amendments which seek to extend the offer to consumers by reinforcing competition."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of Catherine Trautmann's report on electronic communications networks and services because, in my opinion, the legislative framework for electronic communications must be improved in order to offer the consumer more choice, better protection, a cheaper service and improved quality."
"Together with the creation of a new Body of European Regulators in Telecom, this new legislative framework will ensure better protection of consumers' private data, increase competition, offer consumers more choice and make contractual terms clearer."
"It should also be highlighted that the 'package' will facilitate access for people with disabilities to telecommunications services."
"in writing. - (PT) Like other natural resources, spectrum is a public good."
"It is therefore an area which should remain within public management to ensure that it serves the public interest."
"This is the only way to offer public goods which are essential to developing an information society for all."
"That is why we fundamentally disagree with the resolution adopted and voted against it."
"Experience has shown that combined approaches (policies and market) always end up serving the interests of economic groups rather than the interests of the people."
"The same applies to the allocation of spectrum released by the digital switchover, where the priority should be social, cultural and economic value (better public service, wireless broadband to underserved areas, growth and jobs, and so on) and not increasing public revenues."
"Spectrum management is the exclusive competence of each Member State."
"However, there are certain aspects of the resolution with which we do agree, bearing in mind that spectrum knows no borders and that effective use of spectrum in the Member States and EU-level coordination are useful, particularly for the development of pan-European services and the negotiation of international agreements."
"However, we disagree with the idea of using an approach identical to commercial policy."
"in writing. - (RO) The Telecom package is one of the most important packages submitted to EP scrutiny in this session, given that one of the major pillars of globalization is communication in real time, both in the domestic and the international space."
"Hence the multitude of amendments due to the different approaches of the 27 Member States, each with its own national realities."
"Despite the differences of approach shown during the debates, I believe that the Trautmann report represents a step forward for the entire European space, even if amendments such as 132 or 138 caused lively debates."
"I believe that the current version adopted by the European Parliament ensures both a common approach to the development of communication within the European space, and a constructive form of control over virtual space, concerning such aspects as data protection or organised crime via cyberspace."
"Therefore, in my capacity as Member of this Parliament, I voted in favour of this report."
"in writing. - (DE) On behalf of the 40 signatories, I have withdrawn Amendment 132 to the Trautmann report because it was not possible to reach a compromise on strengthening the basic right to protection of intellectual property during the European Parliament's deliberations on the Telecoms Framework Directive."
"The aim of Amendment 132 was to develop new ways of achieving a more balanced relationship between the basic right to free access to information and the Internet, on the one hand, and the basic right to protection of intellectual property in response to the dramatic rise in piracy on the Internet, on the other."
"The PPE-DE Group withdrew its support for this amendment after the left-wing groups (PSE, Verts/ALE, GUE/NGL) linked their support for the del Castillo Vera report (creation of the European Electronic Communications Market Authority) to this issue."
"in writing. - (FR) The telecommunications sector is developing at such a rate that it became necessary to adapt the legislative framework."
"However, it was obvious to me that this framework should be clear and precise and, above all, that it should not stop investment by European telecom companies, which face stiff competition from the American and Asian markets."
"Our businesses must be able to plan and invest in new technologies without any delay."
"Although it is of benefit to all to strengthen the internal market in the telecoms sector, I am delighted that the Commission has not succeeded in imposing its authority on us but that Parliament has proposed the Body of European Regulators in Telecom, a credible alternative that enhances cooperation among national regulators and avoids the additional bureaucracy the European Electronic Communications Market Authority would have meant."
"The Luxembourg telecommunications market (4.7% of the working population are directly or indirectly employed in this sector), for example, requires a powerful national regulator that is close to and aware of its peculiarities."
"In this case, it was the right decision to apply the principle of subsidiarity."
"in writing. - The telecoms industry is rapidly evolving."
"Consequently, new measures are required to preserve and enhance consumer protection and the rights of the telecoms user."
"Catherine Trautmann's report on electronic communications networks and services aims to encourage the development of the next generation of telecommunications networks in Europe."
"I believe this to be a positive contribution to the advancement of telecoms regulation that will promote investment in new communications infrastructure and strengthen consumer rights."
"My vote reflects this view."
"I voted in favour of the amendments proposed by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left: they guarantee a greater degree of freedom on the Internet because this is a freedom of expression as important to democracy as freedom of the press."
"It is a positive sign that Parliament, despite massive pressure from lobby groups, has expressed its objections to such arbitrary exclusion from the Internet and has not accepted that any user can be denied access to the Internet."
"Nevertheless, in the final analysis, the report remains negative."
"The EU should attach great importance to public dialogue in order to ensure both freedom of expression and the protection of personal data, in cooperation with civil society."
"in writing. - (SV) I have to say that the telecoms package is one of the most difficult legislative proposals I have seen since I came here."
"On the one hand because it is technically complicated, with overlapping legislative proposals; on the other hand because the balance between confidentiality and security, by its very nature, calls for careful consideration."
"I took the view that, while the Internet cannot be left entirely unregulated, the principles of a society subject to the rule of law must nevertheless apply undiminished."
"I cannot accept the privatisation of the administration of justice, which is what would happen if private companies were allowed to intervene and censor content on the Web before users got the chance to have their say."
"If the view is that transparency should be a guiding principle, filtering is deeply problematical."
"While it must be clear that surveillance of civil Web users must never be allowed for commercial reasons, of course I will not have any part in legislation which, for example, would prevent the police from investigating child pornography or in some other way pose a risk to public safety."
"It was important not to contribute to a European legal framework which would impede the development of the technology and restrict the democratic, social and professional scope and potential of the Internet."
"Finally I took the view that sufficient protective mechanisms were in place to enable me to vote in favour of the liberalisation of the telecoms market which is otherwise so important."
"in writing. - (FR) I wanted to vote in favour of Mrs Trautmann's report, as it enshrines the social, cultural and economic value of radio frequencies while providing for better management of the spectrum of radio frequencies for the benefit of all operators and consumers."
"This first reading also allows us to suggest a balanced alternative to the initial Commission proposal by making the Commission arbitrator rather than judge as regards the monitoring of competition."
"It is important for the national regulatory authorities to continue to play a full role."
"I regret, however, the adoption of Mrs Trautmann's oral amendment."
"While it seems perfectly acceptable, in practice this amendment introduces a hierarchy of end-users' fundamental rights by banning all preventative action without a prior court ruling regarding the communication and online distribution of content."
"Yesterday's events in a Finnish school show more than ever why we should put in place well-thought-out and proportionate prevention mechanisms."
"This was what the cooperation amendment I supported was all about and I therefore regret the current situation within Parliament."
"in writing. - (RO) As IMCO rapporteur for this report, I am pleased to see that the work carried out by my colleagues over the last three months has materialised in this balanced report containing significant improvements to the electronic communications sector."
"I trust that these changes are to the benefit of consumers, providing them with a wide array of choice; I am also confident that these changes will support a competitive market."
"I believe that maintaining functional separation as an option available to national authorities will give them a chance to promote competitiveness in this field."
"European economic growth and consumer welfare depend on a dynamic and competitive telecommunications sector."
"Competitive markets have more broadband available, and new-comers on the market have brought with them increased speed and innovative services."
"In this way, the objectives of the new directive have been attained: reformed spectrum management, improved consistency of the regulations governing the internal e-communications market, and increased level of security and integrity, to the benefit of service users."
"in writing. - (PT) Begun in 2001, the liberalisation of telecommunications has given free rein to the European markets, which are now more competitive, more innovative and highly profitable."
"European consumers have without doubt been the main beneficiaries of this development, with more and better services, forms and content, which are increasingly accessible."
"This was a technological, economic and sociocultural (r)evolution."
"Despite this clearly positive assessment, we cannot rest on our laurels."
"Bottlenecks still remain that are preventing the creation of a genuinely integrated market."
"These are basically due to disparities in the application of European regulations for which each National Regulatory Authority (NRA) is responsible."
"I therefore support the creation of BERT, or the Body of European Regulators in Telecom, which is an updated and reinforced version of the European Regulators Group for electronic communications networks and services (ERG)."
"It will be responsible for the more coherent application of regulations and will be able to rely on the participation of the NRAs which have precious experience of the day-to-day situation on the ground."
"By creating BERT, a coherent regulatory approach will be followed throughout the EU with regard to the corrective measures taken by the NRAs, with total independence from government and industry."
"BERT will also play a role in raising consumer awareness."
"In this respect, the EU already has reason to be satisfied given its role in substantially reducing the price of roaming."
"in writing. - (LT) The liberalisation of the European telecommunications market has been beneficial to the whole of the European Union."
"More active competition within the sector has become the main driver of investments and innovations."
"I agree with the Commission that the telecommunications market still needs control until it begins to work in line with general competition laws."
"However, in principal I cannot agree with the Commission's proposal to establish another institution to regulate this market, as it would further increase the bureaucratic burden and would be distant from the regulated markets of the Member States."
"In the vote I will be supporting the amendments proposed by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE), which aim to expand the role of the existing Body of European Regulators in Telecom (BERT) as well as give the European Commission additional powers."
"National telecommunications market regulators should cooperate more closely with BERT and the European Commission."
"In my opinion, the proposal of the Committee on Industry would enable market participants to be regulated more effectively and guarantee the effective participation of the national regulatory authorities and the use of their experience at EU level."
"This in its turn would help prevent taxpayers' money from being wasted in establishing yet more bureaucratic apparatus."
"in writing. - I welcome Pilar del Castillo's report on the European Electronic Communications Market Authority."
"The report's vision for a Board of European Regulators that acts as a bridge between both the Commission and National Regulatory Authorities is one that adequately accounts for the complexity of the market and its ever-expanding nature."
"This is reflected in my vote."
"in writing. - (PT) The aim of this proposal is to promote coordinated action at EU level in order to ensure effective use of the digital dividend."
"The switchover from analogue to digital terrestrial television by the end of 2012, given that the superior efficiency of digital technology will free up a significant amount of spectrum, will create a unique opportunity for the EU to open up possibilities for market growth, expansion of quality and choice of consumer services."
"It is therefore hoped that Member States will be able to release their digital dividends as quickly as possible in order to allow European citizens to benefit from a whole new range of innovative and competitive services."
"Member States must therefore decide how to use the digital dividend and ensure that all these types of electronic communications service are offered in available radio-frequency bands, in accordance with the respective national frequency allocation plan and the regulations of the International Telecommunications Union."
"However, it is vital that there is a coordinated Community approach so that we can avoid prejudicial interference between Member States, and also between Member States and third countries."
"This will allow the benefits of using the spectrum to be maximised, thus guaranteeing optimal use in social and economic terms."
"in writing. - Spectrum is a finite resource in the telecommunications industry."
"With Member States set to switch to entirely digital television broadcasts by 2012, more spectrum will become available."
"Consequently how we use it needs careful consideration."
"I believe Patrizia Toia's report on the Common approach to the use of spectrum released by the digital switchover recognises the competing demands for spectrum and accounts for the issues of service and technology neutrality when allocating new licences."
"I therefore voted in support of her recommendations."
"in writing. - (IT) We Radical Members abstained from approving the Harbour report today in order to highlight the missed opportunities for taking immediate, binding action to promote the inclusion of people with disabilities."
"Although some progress has been made, too few mandatory requirements are to be imposed on the competent authorities and telecommunications operators as regards the inclusion of disabled people."
"For example, no account has been taken of the proposals drawn up jointly with the Luca Coscioni Association for the subtitling of all public service broadcasts such as news and current affairs programmes; service operators will not be obliged to inform disabled users periodically about services intended specifically for them and about the reduced tariffs available to them."
"Furthermore, a good deal of confusion persists about the guarantee of Internet neutrality and the safeguarding of users' fundamental rights."
"The web is increasingly being subjected to military-style monitoring and, on the pretext of protecting security, users' freedoms are once again being eroded whereas, given the possibility of systematic filtering of the web, protection and guarantees for users have yet to be demonstrated."
"With its new package of proposals on electronic communications, the EU is promoting measures to police and intimidate users of the Internet and all electronic communications, by introducing 'filtering' systems on the pretext of public safety and protection of rights."
"At the same time, it is uniformly placing the internal EU market for telecommunications, the Internet, audiovisual production and transmission, radio and television media and satellite connections under the control of a strengthened 'independent' authority for the benefit of the monopoly companies."
"Profits are being secured and the position of the European monopolies vis-à-vis international competition is being strengthened by liberalising and unifying the markets at European level."
"First there will be complete liberalisation and privatisation at national level, and then radical restructuring, over-concentrating of the media and an accumulation of capital at the expense of workers in the sector and of users."
"There are two separate infrastructures: on the one hand, there are public services funded by the government; on the other, we have free market trade."
"The government funds public services with money from the state, and as this is unprofitable, the services are sold off to private operators."
"The acceptance of these proposals by centre-right and centre-left forces once again reveals their enthusiastic support for the choices made in the interest of capital."
"This confirms the need to change the balance of power in favour of the workers with a radically different policy to make use of new technology for the benefit of the workers."
"in writing. - (PL) The report adopted on universal services and the rights of users of electronic communications services aims to improve the consumer's position in the market for electronic services."
"Universal services should ensure consumers have access to public telephone services at an affordable price, and guarantee national and international connections and emergency calls."
"Adoption of this report will enhance consumer rights."
"Consumers will have the right to change telecommunications service provider whilst retaining their existing telephone number."
"In addition, transfer of the number must not take longer than one day."
"That is very important."
"The maximum length of time for which a telecommunications undertaking may enter into an agreement with a subscriber will be limited to 24 months."
"Nonetheless, an operator should also be able to provide the user with the option of entering into a contract for a maximum period of 12 months including all the services and equipment involved."
"Access to the 112 emergency number must also be increased."
"This is very important in crisis situations."
"The Member States should ensure full access to public telephone services in cases when the network collapses as a result of a disaster or force majeure."
"Access to the 116 emergency number for missing children should also be improved too."
"Currently, this number operates on a voluntary basis in just seven EU Member States."
"in writing. - (PL) I warmly welcomed the report on the amendment of the Directives on users' rights in electronic communications networks drawn up by Mr Harbour."
"It is a balanced document intended to significantly improve the condition of the market in electronic services."
"It was right to draft compromise amendments that were accepted by a significant majority of Members of this House."
"This made it possible to adopt the report as a whole, despite the very large number of amendments."
"The Union's legal provisions in the area of telecommunications date back to the 1990s."
"I believe that the amendments to the Directives represent a great opportunity to adjust them to the tremendous technological changes that have taken place."
"This is particularly important since we intend to add mobile communications and broadband Internet access to universal services."
"Licence holders should be assured of the right to full information on all restrictions concerning access to legal software."
"Service providers must ensure security of the network, protect users' personal data and stem the flood of so-called spam."
"I believe that it is especially important to take account of the needs of disabled and elderly people, who need to have easier access to telecommunications services."
"It is to be hoped that appropriate new technical solutions for equipment will emerge."
"I trust that such developments will result in a significant reduction in the cost of telecommunications services across the entire Union."
"At present, we are still obliged to pay unfair high prices for the transmission of data across the Union's internal borders, despite the existence of the Schengen system."
"in writing. - What Malcolm Harbour's report shows quite emphatically is that Internet and phone users are currently getting a raw deal."
"In these tough economic times consumers need to be confident that they are getting value for money."
"The proposals in the report mean that customers will be better informed and their personal data, be it online or off, will be more secure."
"The stipulation that disabled users receive equivalent access to the Internet and other communication services is also essential to ensure that everyone benefits from today's digital age."
"I voted in support of the report."
"in writing. - (DE) Today, an attempt is being made to assert economic interests by hook or by crook."
"Suddenly, a framework directive on telecoms provision is to include a raft of copyright legislation."
"It is quite enough for the EU to introduce an obligation for suppliers to caution customers about the risks of violating 'intellectual property rights', with penalties being regulated at national level."
"Everyone can then blame each other afterwards."
"Moreover, in the report before us, major software developers have attempted to put stumbling blocks in the way of their smaller competitors."
"There may well be violations of the law occurring on the Internet - child pornography being a case in point - where we need to take action, but we must not allow data protection to be sacrificed to the economic interests of a handful of large corporations and multinationals."
"The original concept behind the Telecoms package was very sensible, but with the mass of amendments - and one or two of them with the type of critical content that I have just described perhaps having slipped in - I abstained in the vote."
"in writing. - (RO) The liberalization of the telecommunications market, which has been carried out by the EU for 10 years, is an undisputed success."
"The reform of the regulatory framework of electronic communications is part of the Commission's global strategy concerning the internal market, and is essential to achieving the Lisbon Strategy objectives, because, from a macroeconomic perspective, telecommunications contribute to rendering activity more effective in other sectors."
"I appreciate the rapporteurs' work on this set of coherent and effective measures, reflecting both EU objectives, and the points of view of most MEPs concerning a vital field for the development and strengthening of ties between education, research and innovation, and in particular for the building of the European information society, adapted to global economy and capable of contributing to economic growth by generating employment and providing better services, thus improving the overall quality of life of European citizens."
"The positive vote on essential aspects such as clarifying and extending users' rights, strengthened protection of personal data, creating a body of European regulatory authorities (BERT), and better spectrum management, shows PPE-DE's concern with striking a balance between the European citizens' fundamental right of being integrated in information society, and the creation of a favourable framework for innovation and economic development."
"in writing.- (NL) My vote against the Telecom package (Harbour report) was prompted by the loopholes left in the Directive, which might be a potential breach of our freedoms."
"Member States authorise providers to follow the activities of individuals on the Internet."
"I hope that, when implementing these new rules, the Member States will not be tempted into filtering the content of the Internet."
"That task should be reserved solely for the police."
"I understand that infringements of property rights on the Internet have to be dealt with, but that should not mean encroaching on the freedom of an individual Internet user."
"Surely we cannot create a situation where we are like a postman who opens letters to see whether the contents are actually legal?"
"The amendments with which the Greens sought to improve this text were rejected and so I can no longer support this proposal."
"I would gladly have voted for the many consumer benefits, but I think it is unacceptable to make Internet providers responsible for the contents of the Internet."
"That was not the purpose of this legislation either."
"in writing. - (SV) Illegal logging and deforestation are causing serious damage to the environment, and there is general agreement that the clearance of sensitive tropical forests must be reduced."
"Junilistan is therefore favourably disposed to the idea that individual states should draw up codes of conduct on the import of tropical timber."
"We also welcome labelling initiatives, for example through the Forest Stewardship Council, which would give consumers more scope for taking conscious decisions based on facts regarding the purchase of timber or timber products."
"Unfortunately, the salient feature of this report is its manifest desire to advance the positions of the European Parliament on matters concerning forestry policy in general."
"Junilistan is firmly of the view that a common forestry policy within the framework of EU cooperation is not desirable."
"Instead, responsibility for questions relating to or associated with the forestry policies of individual Member States should remain at national level."
"In view of these considerations, Junilistan has chosen to vote against the report."
"in writing. - I was happy to support my colleague Ms Lucas's report on the ITTA."
"Millions of hectares of tropical forest are lost annually and the resultant carbon emissions are bound to have a drastic effect on the planet."
"In future the EU must ensure that it plays a lead role in minimising destructive and unnecessary practices."
"in writing. - I welcome Ms Lucas's report on the International Tropical Timber Agreement 2006."
"A serious approach to preserving the environment requires an effective framework for consultation, international cooperation and policy development regarding the world timber economy."
"The EU needs to support conservation, reforestation and the restoration of degraded forest land."
"I believe this report helps set the EU on the right track towards achieving a sustainable timber economy and I voted in favour of it."
"in writing. - (FR) More than 20 years after the first tropical timber agreement was concluded, we are obliged to admit that overexploitation and illegal logging continue to be a problem."
"It therefore became imperative for us to revise the agreement in order to reflect better these new objectives."
"It is now a fait accompli: the International Tropical Timber Agreement, negotiated by the Commission within UNCTAD (the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development) in 2006 embodies the new concerns for sustainable and legal exploitation of forest areas."
"I warmly welcome the inclusion of these objectives."
"However, producers in the countries concerned should not be forced to bear the inevitable cost of these new provisions."
"The international community must establish a suitable financial compensation scheme."
"I would also like the Commission to go further and to draft a comprehensive piece of legislation to ensure that only timber and timber products derived from forests managed in the interests of sustainable development and legally exploited are placed on the European market."
"This is the only way to encourage producers to operate legally and respect the environment and therefore to promote, at global level, the sound and sustainable exploitation of tropical forests."
"in writing. - (PL) Today I supported the resolution concerning the 2006 International Tropical Timber Agreement (ITTA)."
"I did so because I believe that supporting measures aimed at resolving regional or global environmental problems in the international arena is actually one of the European Union's most useful areas of activity."
"I trust that we are all aware of the need to ensure protection and sustainable management of tropical forests, and to provide for the regeneration of degraded areas of those forests."
"in writing. - I and my British Conservative colleagues are extremely supportive of much that is contained in this resolution."
"We strongly support the calls for a reduction in administrative burdens, the pursuit of the Lisbon Strategy on growth and jobs, support for SMEs, further progress on completing the Single Market, measures to boost consumer rights, further action on climate change, cross-border health care initiatives and boosting relations with the United States."
"However, we cannot support the text on the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty, the call for a common immigration policy, the call for a common asylum policy or the call for the creation of a European External Action Service."
"in writing. - (PL) Today I voted against the European Parliament resolution on the European Commission's legislative and work programme for 2009."
"The Commission's ambitious plans provide for further unnecessary harmonisation and directives to be imposed on the Member States in the coming year."
"I should also like to lodge a strong protest against the pressure exerted on Ireland and other Member States to continue the process of ratification of the Lisbon Treaty, as expressed in the first point of the resolution."
"The aforementioned Treaty was rejected in the referendum held in Ireland."
"in writing. - (PT) It must be symptomatic that the European Parliament has not managed to adopt any resolution on the priorities of the European Commission's programme."
"Obviously the European Parliament elections are drawing nearer, which is influencing the decisions of the Members, particularly those who want to cover up their conduct and their responsibility for the policies that have worsened the social situation, increased unemployment and precarious and poorly paid work, brought about the financial, food and energy crisis - which is particularly affecting the economically weaker countries and the more vulnerable sections of society - and increased the militarisation of international relations, with all the dangers that this represents for world peace."
"However, at the same time, they do not want to accept the need for a break with the policies that have led to all this."
"They prefer for the European Commission to continue with the same instruments and policies that have led to this situation, albeit with a few pink and green touch-ups to keep up appearances."
"We therefore insist on the proposals contained in our Group's resolution, including the revocation of the Stability Pact, an end to privatisation and liberalisation, priority to employment with rights, eradication of poverty and social justice."
"I voted in favour of the resolution on the Commission's Legislative and Work Programme for 2009 and regret the fact that it has not been adopted."
"It is vitally important for the Commission to present a communication assessing implementation by the Member States of the Directive and the Regulation on the coordination of social security systems in the Member States."
"While preparing this document as a shadow rapporteur I pointed out that these documents are of great importance to every EU citizen."
"They determine procedures and tackle people's every-day problems."
"The document does not aim to unify social security systems."
"It implements procedures allowing for different social security systems in the Member States."
"At the same time it prevents people from losing out on social security because of these differences."
"The everyday welfare of every EU citizen depends on the implementation of these documents."
"Unfortunately, the Commission will not be given the responsibility of assessing what has been achieved in the Member States in the sphere of establishing transeuropean energy networks or how long the creation of the common energy market could take or ensuring energy security throughout the European Union."
"This issue is vitally important to Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia and therefore the EU institutions and primarily the Commission must take concrete measures in order to lift these Member States out of their energy isolation and dependence on Russia, their sole supplier of gas and electricity."
"in writing. - (SK) I voted against the resolution on the Commission's legislative programme for 2009 because it took over draft amendments requiring new legislation in the social sphere."
"Since the social sphere falls almost exclusively within the competence of the Member States, our group rejected the amendment of the Directive on the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, the minimum standards concerning the unfair dismissal of individual workers, the protection of workers with untypical employment contracts and the improvement of working conditions and reduction of the number of accidents at work."
"Matters of legal protection against discrimination differ between Member States, in particular with respect to reproductive rights, the traditional family, education and religion."
"Our political group therefore considers it necessary in this matter to retain the principle of subsidiarity whereby each Member State is entitled to apply these principles in accordance with its national traditions and customs."
"The question of Turkey's accession to the EU is also a sensitive matter in our political group, many of the members being German and French conservatives."
"in writing. - (PT) In 2009 the Commission's activities will be governed by the European election timetable, resulting in a reduced chance of action, particularly by one of the institutions."
"However, this circumstance does not prevent us from developing a realistic plan of action."
"The world demands a review of the paradigms and an understanding that the reality has largely gone beyond many of the theoretical debates on economic and social models and on the multiple polarities in international relations (in terms of both hard power and also economic powers or relationships between commercial forces)."
"We want the Commission to respond to this new reality with a long-term view that is flexible and adaptable in its implementation."
"At the same time we want an agenda for 2009 that will help to clarify, in the eyes of voters in each Member State, the importance of and benefit to our economies and our societies of the EU's policies."
"This evidence, which will stem much more from the quality of our policies than from communication issues, must form the crux of our activities and, as a result, the activities of the European Commission."
"Unfortunately, the resolution put to the vote did not reflect this approach which is why I voted against it."
"in writing. - There is still a need to promote children's rights."
"Currently there is too little being done to tackle child poverty across the EU."
"One in five children lives on the brink of poverty in the EU - that is one too many."
"I am pleased that Parliament has rejected the Commission's work programme for 2009."
"We need to do more to promote decent work in order to tackle poverty across the EU."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of the European Parliament's joint resolution on the preparation of the EU-India Summit because I feel that it is essential to adapt our strategic partnership with India, adopted in 2004, to the new challenges that the EU and India are facing, such as the food crisis, the energy crisis and climate change."
"I would highlight the fact that the resolution encourages India to continue its efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, particularly in the area of gender equality."
"It is also important that the resolution reminds India of the EU's values, calling on the Indian Government to abolish the death penalty."
"in writing. - (PT) In addition to the many other issues raised by this resolution that we value, we consider it essential to stress that we unquestionably support the deepening of genuine and effective cooperation and friendship between the countries of the EU and India."
"This requires a relationship that is based on responding to the needs of each population, that is mutually beneficial and that contributes to reciprocal development, while respecting the principle of non-interference and respect for national sovereignties."
"However, based on these principles and assumptions, we clearly cannot agree with many of the proposals contained in this resolution, particularly on the conclusion of a 'free trade' agreement which aims to include, among other aspects, an 'agreement on services', 'competition', 'public procurement' and the 'abolition of ... ongoing restrictions in the field of Foreign Direct Investment' between the EU and India."
"This proposal (and objective) seeks to respond to the desires for expansion of the major economic and financial groups - which were not formalised in the WTO negotiations aimed at liberalising world trade - in which the need to increase the accumulation and centralisation of capital is pre-eminent."
"This objective is contrary to the needs of workers and people in India and in the various countries of the EU."
"in writing. - (FR) We need to develop our relations with India, which, with a population of more than a billion and a booming economy, provides a counterweight to the Muslim world and China."
"However, the motion for a resolution tabled, which reflects the views of Mr Sarkozy and the Commission, runs counter to the interests of the nations of Europe."
"The 'comprehensive free trade agreement' it calls for will contribute to the destruction of our economies and social systems, which are forced to compete with countries that engage in social dumping."
"Furthermore, India's demand for a seat on the United Nations Security Council is one of the proposals for UN reform, which also aim to strip France and the United Kingdom of permanent membership of the Security Council and give it instead to Brussels."
"Moreover, describing India as a 'model for religious pluralism' is an insult to the Christians massacred in Orissa."
"India is defending its national interests and age-old values."
"In order to have a balanced relationship with India, our Member States must do the same."
"They can only do that in a different Europe: a Europe of sovereign nations rooted in the Christian and Greco-Roman values of its civilisation."
"in writing. - As a member of the EU-India Delegation, I support the Joint Motion for a Resolution on the preparation of the EU-India Summit 2008."
"The motion addresses the issue of the failure to reach agreement at the WTO and expresses a desire for renewed efforts to reach agreement."
"However, the motion does not reflect the key stumbling block to such an agreement, namely the failure of the US and India to reach agreement on a special safeguard mechanism to prevent dumping of products onto the Indian market to the detriment of India's large rural/farming population."
"Without such a mechanism there are fears for the very survival of the subsistence farmers in India."
"The key issue of food security is not adequately addressed at the WTO and perhaps this is why ultimately the talks failed to deliver."
"Any renewed effort to re-open the talks must ensure that food security concerns of members are adequately addressed."
"Import surges can have a very negative and dramatic impact on local food production, and in developing countries with a large farming base import surges would be hugely damaging to efforts to develop a local agriculture/food production base."
"in writing. - (PT) Sometimes we need to remember that India is, demographically speaking, the biggest democracy in the world."
"This fact, combined with its economic vitality and its growing role in international relations - primarily within its own neighbourhood - suggests that we should rethink our relationship with this important partner."
"It would clearly be a mistake to ignore the weaknesses in the Indian democracy, its economic structure or its social organisation, which is why these aspects should be at the top of the agenda in our relationship with this country."
"However, this agenda must be broader and, in particular, be more in line with the new realities and circumstances."
"The reinforcement of political ties and greater closeness to this giant must be regarded as strategic."
"Likewise, we must be alert and ready to reinforce India's role in the concert of nations, particularly with regard to the institutional architecture and framework."
"While it is often said that the 21st century will be the century of the Pacific - a suggestion that warrants Europe's close attention - India should be added to this prophecy and our strategies adapted accordingly."
"Corrections to votes and voting intentions: see Minutes"
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.45 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Approval of Minutes of previous sitting: see Minutes"
"Situation of the world financial system and its consequences on the European markets (debate)"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the situation of the world financial system and its consequences on the European markets."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are witnessing the end of an era."
"The next few years will change the face of world finance as we know it."
"We have to deal not only with the US crisis but with a crisis affecting the international financial system and sparing no region of the world."
"For a number years, there had been criticism of the growing imbalances in the financial sector: an unreasonable exposure to risks for many players, the relative inability of financial controllers to keep in check the rapid introduction of increasingly complex financial products and, as the Commission will no doubt mention, a taste, too marked for some, for greed."
"Now we are seeing the results."
"The US financial sector is in turmoil and the US authorities have been forced to intervene more and more heavily to avert a full-scale crisis."
"Europe and the rest of the world are experiencing fallout from this crisis at a level not known since the 1930s."
"The French Presidency is convinced that the events of the past few days make a strong and united Europe even more necessary on the economic and financial stage."
"We must first come up with an immediate response to the financial disruptions."
"In the European Central Bank the Economic and Monetary Union has a powerful central bank that has been able to intervene promptly, resolutely and effectively when tensions have been at their highest, in close cooperation with the other major central banks."
"This is a considerable asset in these turbulent times and we should praise the actions of the European Central Bank, which is ready to step in in any situation."
"Faced with the worsening disruption of the last few days, the regulatory authorities in the majority of Member States have decided, like the US authorities, to issue a temporary ban on short sales."
"This is an emergency measure, but it is welcome as it can help to the calm the tension on the markets."
"At present, we do not envisage the type of initiative just announced by the US federal authorities for the large-scale buy-back of 'toxic' products held by financial players, and Mr Almunia was right in what he said in this regard."
"The Union's financial system remains robust overall and there is therefore no call for this type of measure, but we must remain vigilant, and nothing can be ruled out in the name of whatever ideology."
"Realism and pragmatism are the order of the day."
"If necessary, we will have to address possible systemic risks using the means at our disposal."
"Emergency interventions by central banks and regulators are vital, but all experts recognise that they cannot resolve the crisis by themselves."
"Europeans must face up to their responsibilities and intervene in the other areas in question."
"We must respond to the economic slowdown."
"This was the subject of the joint European approach adopted by the Ministers of the Economy and Finance at an informal Council in Nice."
"The Ministers, together with the Commission and the President of the European Central Bank, decided to leave the automatic stabilisers to operate freely as regards budgetary matters in those Member States with room for manoeuvre."
"They also approved a finance plan for European SMEs, with EUR 30 billion to be provided by the European Investment Bank between now and 2011, which will lend the sector substantial support, as, paradoxically, even though the financial crisis in Europe is less pronounced than in the US, there are just as many risks to the real economy."
"A stable financial system and robust banks can be called on to restrict or to increase the cost of loans as necessary, particularly in the case of SMEs."
"Direct action was required with regard to the latter."
"We must also reform our financial system along two main lines: the first is prompt legislative and regulatory measures to restore the transparency of the financial system and make financial players accountable."
"With this in mind, on 13 September 2008 Ministers showed their determination to speed up the implementation of the roadmap adopted in 2007 to respond to the initial signs of the financial crisis."
"This roadmap sets out four key measures to address the financial turmoil: transparency, prudential rules, the valuation of assets and the functioning of the markets, including credit rating agencies."
"It is now time to deliver on the supervision of credit rating agencies, the revision of banking controls and the adaptation of accounting standards, which have undoubtedly played a procyclical role in the financial arena."
"This is a real priority for the French Presidency and we will discuss it at the next European Council."
"The Commissioner will confirm this, but I believe that the Commission will shortly propose that the directives in force since 2006 concerning the requirements for own funds should be amended."
"This is one of the measures currently under way in various areas to tackle the financial turmoil, which, of course, also include the recent recommendations drafted by the Financial Stability Forum."
"I know that the Commission will able to table these proposals very quickly and we are counting on Parliament to reach an agreement with the Council at first reading, before the end of the present term, on these urgent proposals."
"A proposal concerning credit agencies is also expected from the Commission in a few weeks' time."
"It will follow on from the request issued by the July 2008 Council of Finance Ministers and, in this regard too, I am counting on Parliament to reach an agreement on this ambitious proposal as quickly as possible."
"I also note with satisfaction that a decision has been taken to set up a working group to examine how the prudential supervision of banks and insurance companies should take account of the cyclical nature of developments, particularly as regards capital."
"Specific measures should also follow."
"These are the essential components of financial sector reform and will most probably be accompanied by other initiatives, as European examination of the financial crisis progresses."
"Parliament must play its full role in this examination and the Presidency notes with great interest the recent contributions the institution has made. I am thinking, in particular, of hedge funds, which some experts say could be the next victims of the crisis."
"I am also thinking, as I said earlier, of the issue of accounting standards but also that of financial sector salaries, on which we must take immediate action."
"Saying, as I have heard from some European leaders, that we must continue in our laissez-faire approach and that no regulation is necessary is a mistake."
"It is more than a mistake: it is an assault on the stability of the financial system; it is an assault on reason."
"I shall be plain about this: if we need to consider regulating hedge funds, then the European Union must do so."
"We must think about the transparency of risks, the supervisory powers of regulators and the salaries at this type of institution."
"The second basic line of approach is to strengthen financial supervision."
"The Finance Ministers welcomed the agreement by the European committees of regulators on the harmonisation by 2012 of the requirements for data transmitted by European banks to the supervisory authorities."
"These are the first significant results, but they must be followed by others, and the Ministers have agreed to continue their efforts to improve the coordination of the monitoring and supervision of financial players."
"The Presidency is ready to work with Parliament and the Commission to strengthen the integration of supervision and prudential monitoring of groups that are increasingly cross-border in nature."
"The Union requires a more effective and more integrated supervisory system in order to be better equipped to tackle financial crises."
"Ladies and gentlemen, France is presiding over the Council of the European Union at a time of great disruption."
"In these difficult circumstances, we are fully aware of our responsibilities."
"The time has come to take important decisions with regard to the organisation of our financial system, its place within the European economy and its role, which should remain the financing of businesses and individuals."
"The Union has not been idle over these last few months."
"The Presidency can therefore draw on the reflections made and work carried out by the Commission in this area, as well as on the work of a number of experts, including, in France, Mr Ricol."
"The October European Council provides an opportunity to set strict guidelines at European level: that is our aim."
"It is clear that Europe should not act alone."
"It needs to be proactive and encourage fresh international cooperation, as President Sarkozy said at the United Nations yesterday."
"We also propose to hold an international meeting before the end of the year involving the G8 and their financial regulatory authorities."
"Our goal is to help to produce the first principles and new joint international rules for an overhaul of the international financial system."
"The European Union is showing, through an initiative of this kind, the importance it attaches to a new, balanced world governance."
"The European and international response must address the short, medium and long term."
"In the short term, we need emergency measures; in the medium term, a revision of our legislation; and in the long term, a more comprehensive examination of the role of our economic model in terms of growth and employment and the continuation of structural reforms, which remain essential."
"This concludes the information I wished to provide you with today."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, the series of events we have witnessed in financial markets during the last year, and in particular during the last few days, are of a magnitude that exceeds anything we have seen in our lifetime."
"Many believe - and I tend to agree - that this will trigger important changes in the functioning of the international financial system."
"Since the outbreak of the crisis in August 2007, disclosed losses have totalled more than USD 500 billion, a sum equivalent to the GDP of a country like Sweden."
"And, unfortunately, the final figure is considered to be larger still."
"The acceleration of declared losses in the US during the last few weeks, and the subsequent decline in investor confidence, have pushed several major financial institutions to the brink of collapse."
"In cases where the fall of one of these institutions would have implied a systemic risk - that is to say, put the entire financial system at risk - emergency rescue operations have been required."
"Some of these rescue operations took the form of public interventions, such as those carried out by the US Treasury and the Federal Reserve to avoid the bankruptcy of the world's largest insurance company, AIG, or of the mortgage financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, that together underwrite half of all mortgages in the US."
"Others took the form of private takeovers, such as the purchase of the investment bank Merrill Lynch by Bank of America."
"For others, like the case of investment banker Lehman Brothers or almost two dozen US regional banks, bankruptcy was the only option possible."
"In short, we have witnessed an extraordinary transformation in the US banking landscape."
"Consequently, we have reached the point where the US financial system is facing a substantial confidence problem."
"At this juncture, according to the US authorities, a series of bail-outs is not the answer any more."
"A systemic solution is urgently needed."
"In the short term we all need a response that will restore confidence and stabilise markets."
"The US plan announced by Secretary Paulson last week is a good initiative."
"In short, the US Treasury Secretary proposes to set up a federal fund to remove from the banks' balance sheets the illiquid assets - those mortgage-linked securities that are at the root of the problems we face."
"Removing these from the system would help to remove uncertainty and refocus the market on fundamentals."
"However, the details of this proposal need to be properly defined - and quickly - if it is to succeed."
"I should say that we are talking about a US plan, adapted for the circumstances in the US, where - it should be recalled - the crisis originated and where the financial sector has been most severely affected."
"But we all have to analyse why this has happened."
"We all have to cope with the consequences and react to the present situation."
"To do this, we first have to understand how we arrived at this point."
"The origins of the turmoil we see today lie in the persisting global imbalances in the world economy, which created an environment of high availability of liquidity and poor assessment of risks."
"The interconnection of global financial markets, the high level of leverage and the use of innovative and complex financial techniques and instruments, which were only poorly understood, caused these risks to spread across the international financial system on an unprecedented scale."
"What is clear is that market participants - but also regulators and supervisors - were unable to properly understand the risks of this situation and, therefore, could not prevent the consequences that we see today."
"True, in the months leading up to the crisis, the IMF, the European Central Bank and the Commission, among others, all warned of these underlying risks."
"We knew the situation was unsustainable, but what we could not know, and what no one was able to predict, was how, when and just how violently the crisis would be triggered by rising defaults in the sub-prime mortgage sector."
"What we are now seeing is the process of the last few years going into reverse, with the financial system grappling with the consequent need to deleverage."
"Because of the exceptionally high leverage and the scale of linkages between risks, this process of unwinding is proving particularly painful."
"The lack of transparency in the system and the inability of supervisors to piece together an accurate and complete picture of the situation, has led to a dramatic fall in confidence."
"The financial sector has been most severely affected, as nervousness among banks has caused liquidity to dry up in the interbank lending market."
"Several key credit markets remain disrupted, and recently there has been a renewed flight to quality among investors, accompanied by widening spreads between benchmark bond yields and yields on relatively risky investments."
"Thanks to the swift and coordinated intervention by central banks - with a relevant role here for the ECB - we have managed to avoid a severe liquidity shortage."
"Nevertheless, banks remain under pressure."
"The crisis of confidence has provoked a fall in asset prices, compounding the strain on banks' balance sheets."
"Combined with the situation in the interbank market, banks face difficulties to recapitalise."
"The situation we face here in Europe is less acute, and Member States do not, at this point, consider that a US-style plan is needed."
"Taking a medium-term perspective, it is evident that we need a more comprehensive structural response."
"The latest events in financial markets have made it clear that the current model of regulation and supervision needs to be revamped."
"In the short term, we rapidly need to address the weaknesses in the current framework, and in this respect - and I fully agree with the Council position - the ECOFIN road map of regulatory actions and the recommendations of the Financial Stability Forum contain all the elements necessary."
"As you know, this includes concrete initiatives on enhanced transparency for investors, markets and regulators; revised capital requirements for banking groups, and clarification of the role of credit-rating agencies."
"Work is progressing at the Commission, and the Commission will soon come forward with proposals on a revision to the Capital Requirements Directive - next week - and new legislation on credit-rating agencies, I hope, before the end of October."
"But given the latest developments, it is likely that we will need to explore additional issues that have come to light."
"We will continue to discuss what else should be done to better ensure financial stability and to correct the reasons underlying this crisis, and in this regard I fully share the words of welcome that the Presidency of the Council gave to your contributions."
"Finally, let me turn to the impact of the financial sector crisis on the economy - on the real economy."
"There can be no doubt that events in the financial sector are hurting the real economy."
"These effects have been compounded by the inflationary pressures of the rising oil and other commodity prices and the severe housing-market corrections in some Member States."
"This combination of shocks has impacted directly on economic activity through higher costs and negative wealth effects and, indirectly, via a sharp erosion of economic confidence."
"The result has been a brake on domestic demand at a time when external demand is fading."
"Leading indicators on economic activity point to a marked deceleration in the underlying growth momentum both in the EU and in the euro area."
"Against this background, GDP growth for this year was revised down significantly in our last interim forecast to 1.4% in the EU and 1.3% in the euro area."
"At the same time, for this year inflation forecasts have been revised up to 3.8% in the EU and 3.6% in the euro area."
"Inflation could, however, be at a turning point, as the impact of past increases in energy and food prices gradually fades in the coming months."
"This could possibly be reinforced by a further downward correction in oil and other commodity prices, although this remains to be seen."
"Overall, the economic situation and outlook remain unusually uncertain."
"Risks to the growth outlook remain on the downside, while risks to the inflation outlook are on the upside."
"These uncertainties are even higher regarding economic developments next year, but we expect growth in both the EU and the euro area to remain relatively weak next year."
"How should we respond to this economic slowdown?"
"The best answer is to make use of all the policy instruments we have at our disposal."
"Firstly, in budgetary policy, we must preserve our commitment to fiscal discipline and the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact while letting the automatic stabilisers play their role."
"In this regard, the reform of the pact in 2005 is proving very helpful."
"Secondly, a clear commitment to implement structural reforms, as defined in the framework of the Lisbon Strategy and the national reform programmes, would be crucial to boost consumer and investor confidence in the short term and to improve the resilience and dynamism of our economies in the longer term."
"Measures to strengthen competition in retail and energy markets and improve the functioning of our labour markets would be particularly valuable at this juncture."
"Finally, delivering improvements in financial-market regulation and meeting the goals of the ECOFIN road map is, as I have already stressed, more urgent than ever before."
"An effective and rapid solution to the difficult challenges we are facing could go a long way to restore confidence quicker than expected and limit the damage to our economies."
"In each of these policy areas our actions will be more efficient and effective if we coordinate them at the euro area and European Union level."
"Inevitably, we will need to overcome some resistance by Member States to agree common action, yet the consensus we reached during the last informal ECOFIN meeting in Nice should be deepened and developed."
"European countries face common challenges."
"We will overcome them most effectively if we work together to find common solutions."
"In this respect, the Economic and Monetary Union is a formidable asset, and we should exploit the opportunities it provides to strengthen coordination, along the lines we proposed in our EMU@10 report and communication last May."
"However, events make clear that internal European action is not sufficient to confront global challenges."
"We need to reinforce common external action in the Financial Stability Forum, in the Basel Committee, in the G7, as well as devoting more attention to the future role of the International Monetary Fund."
"Looking ahead, we need to think about how we can shape the future of our financial systems and global governance, and the role of the European Union in this regard is vital."
"Europe can be a driving force behind reinforcing global coordination and should take a leading role in international debates in this area, and this first requires European countries to work together and agree on internal solutions."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, listening to the Commissioner's statement just now, it felt as if I was in the wrong film."
"He repeatedly emphasised that swift and rapid action is being taken."
"In reality, the only thing that has moved swiftly in recent weeks, months and years is the market, which is frequently invoked in our regular debates here."
"The fact is that the market regulated the problem of the investment banks very quickly on its own."
"We were unable to react as swiftly."
"'Swift' is certainly not the word that we can use when we look at the Council and particularly the Commission."
"We are now being kindly invited by the Americans to pay a share."
"I do not wish to comment on that at this juncture."
"It is enough, at this stage, to monitor developments."
"However, what I expect from the Council - although when it comes to the Commission, I am not sure whether the Barroso Commission is capable of this - is to ensure, at the least, that we overcome the American and British resistance to transparency in the financial markets."
"I need only remind you of the German Presidency, when President Sarkozy and Chancellor Merkel came up with an initiative and the Barroso Commission sat back and said, 'Who is Sarkozy and who is Merkel anyway?' and took no action."
"'Swift' is really not the word we can use."
"I need only remind you of Enron and Parmalat."
"At the time, the European Parliament had adopted a relevant report by Mr Katiforis - I was the shadow rapporteur - on the issue of credit rating agencies."
"That was back in 2003."
"Now, in October 2008, the Commission may well present proposals, but the IOSCO is already saying that we should not deviate from the Securities and Exchange Commission and US rules, for otherwise the international financial system will be disrupted."
"Europe must go its own way here."
"That is why I do not really care what the SEC is proposing, and if the Commission plans to move in the same direction as the SEC, all I can say is that it should wrap up warmly."
"We must do what we think is right, and the Americans can then follow us."
"That is all I have to say about rating agencies."
"It has been said that we should deal with the revision of Basel II at one reading."
"I hope that the Council representative is listening, as that is something that he mentioned."
"We can do it at one reading, as long as the Council gives up its opposition to a European supervisory regime."
"What the Council has achieved so far through its closer cooperation with the European supervisory authorities is lamentable."
"Nice was based on intergovernmental cooperation."
"That being the case, the Council should jump over its own shadow for once and think along European lines."
"Hedge funds have also been mentioned, along with private equity."
"Commissioner McCreevy told the House only this week that we must not be overhasty."
"We can accuse Mr McCreevy of many things, but being overhasty is not one of them."
"(Heckling and applause)"
"I have regularly attacked Mr McCreevy in the House on the issue of hedge funds and private equity."
"We must ensure that the Commission now presents proper analyses and does not remain in a state of denial."
"This is no longer Mr McCreevy's problem; it is now Mr Barroso's problem."
"(Applause)"
"I would be delighted if we were now to make it clear to the US that the SEC - the Securities and Exchange Commission - should put its own house in order for once."
"Siemens is the subject of a rigorous investigation, but no one looks at the US."
"I expect the Commission and the Council to enable us to set out a European policy course in this area."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Madam President, we have listened very attentively to what Mr Radwan has to say."
"The Bavarian election campaign casts a long shadow."
"Yes, Mr Radwan, some of what you say is absolutely right."
"The market has regulated it, but the US taxpayer is footing the bill."
"It is the state which is paying the price."
"What we are witnessing at present is not only the bankruptcy of investment banks and major insurance companies."
"It is the bankruptcy of an economic philosophy which has been 'sold' to us for years: a philosophy which claims that in a supposedly modern economy, growth and prosperity are generated through speculation, not in the real world."
"That is the system that is going bankrupt now."
"(Applause)"
"Incidentally, Mr Radwan, we have a very clear memory of the Katiforis report."
"You are an astute politician, I will give you that."
"You are standing for election to the Bavarian State Parliament on Sunday."
"Good luck with that."
"However, the person who applied the brakes to the Katiforis report was you, Mr Radwan."
"That is also something that we recall very clearly."
"Charlie McCreevy is not here, which is a pity."
"Joaquín Almunia has presented a very sound analysis."
"Commissioner Almunia, I would ask you to brief your colleague Mr McCreevy on the measures which are necessary and which we must now adopt."
"I do not know where he is."
"Perhaps he is back at the race track; perhaps the betting shops at the race track are better regulated than the international financial markets."
"However, one thing is clear: we expect the Commission to adopt the measures that are possible and necessary, and we expect this action by the end of the year, or by spring at the latest."
"This means, for example, adopting rules for the credit rating agencies, and doing so very swiftly."
"It is vital, too, to decouple City bonuses from short-term speculative profits."
"That is a very important point."
"If a manager knows that he himself will bank 5% of a billion that he generates in speculative profits, because his bonus is coupled to the speculative billion, then it is only human nature that he will attempt to generate the billion in profits by whatever means, whatever the cost: even if tens of thousands of jobs are lost as a result, which is what we have seen happening all over the world in recent decades."
"Without turning a hair, the financial managers - the smart young things we run into here in the corridors - are wrecking entire companies and entire business locations, with all the social ills that this entails."
"The costs of this devastation are included in the 700 billion which the US taxpayers now have to invest in rescuing the major banks and insurance companies."
"The amateurism of governance in the US is apparent from the fact that even in this massive crisis, it is these major corporations which are being rescued, costing ordinary taxpayers more than 700 billion dollars from the US budget."
"Unfortunately, the fates of these ordinary taxpayers, their debts and mortgages do not feature in the US Government's rescue plan."
"A perfect example, once again, of how profits are privatised and losses nationalised."
"That must stop as well."
"(Applause)"
"We heard all about it in Monday's debate."
"I almost have the impression that we should be handing out membership forms for the Social Democratic Party to the PPE-DE Group: it seems that they cannot change their opinions fast enough, and the Liberals, I have to say, are even worse."
"In a debate last November about the European Union's role in globalisation, I made the following comment: 'The Wild West capitalism that dominates the financial markets is threatening entire economies, including the US economy now, and needs international rules."
"We need control, transparency and restrictions on the power of the financial markets.'"
"In response, the leader of the ALDE said: 'Mr President, we have just heard the language of the past'."
"At least he is not present for today's debate, which will obviously enhance its quality."
"What I said, however, was not the language of the past."
"Now, more than ever, control and government supervision of a deregulated market - which has no respect for anything or anyone - are the way forward."
"I therefore have one thing to add, if I may."
"Of course, we must act swiftly, but we also must act in the area which is closest to my heart and the hearts of my colleagues here in the European Parliament."
"The speculation bubble will not burst: even if we ban short sales for the time being, they will be back."
"Another thing which we are bound to see happen again is that investors will be encouraged to speculate on rising food prices, for example."
"Food price rises occur when there is less food available."
"That means that those who have an interest in high food prices must ensure that the supply of food is reduced."
"However, food scarcity means hunger in the world, and if we have a system which makes it possible for hunger in some regions of the world to generate profits in others, our 700 billion dollar rescue package will not help us."
"Sooner or later, the system, in all its perversity, will have bitter consequences for humankind as a whole."
"What we are discussing here, then, is not about short-term necessity."
"It is about how we can guarantee humane social development for the long term."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the global financial crisis has spread through the markets with unforeseeable consequences."
"Some people may feel a sense of satisfaction at the sight of bankers falling from grace and losing their jobs."
"However, this is very short-sighted, for the real losers are not the company bosses or the traders."
"It is ordinary families who are hardest hit by the credit crunch and the collapse in the value of shares and savings."
"It is their financial security which is shattered when the value of pensions and savings is put at risk."
"That is why it is essential to undertake a precise analysis of the financial crisis and its causes to ensure that it does not happen again, and I am pleased that we are doing so today."
"Martin Schulz used his speech to rail against the markets."
"In light of Mr Schulz's predictions last November, which he has kindly reminded us of, this might give him the chance to earn some extra income as an oracle."
"However, it is money which drives the markets, not hot air, and he needs to recognise that fact."
"The appropriate response to the current crisis is not a move away from free enterprise."
"It is enterprise which creates jobs and prosperity."
"Do the financial markets really need more regulation?"
"Ludwig Erhard, the father of the German economic miracle, summed it up neatly."
"He said that the state should establish the rules for the economy and the financial system, but like a referee, it should not involve itself in the game."
"What this means, of course, is that it must take action against fouls and violations of the rules."
"Regulation is appropriate and necessary in order to avoid excesses, but it is not the market economy which is to blame for the crisis; that blame attaches to those who refuse to abide by frameworks and rules."
"For years, experts have been warning against high-risk loans, unsecured credit and a bubble waiting to burst in the financial and property markets."
"We need common and transparent rules for Europe as a whole, and for the world."
"Yes, we need international controls, but with a sense of proportion."
"It is no good to anyone if we immobilise capital movements with more rules and trigger an economic downturn."
"Above all, we need to restore confidence in a free and open market."
"The economic stability of Europe's and the world's citizens depends on whether we show ourselves to be capable of action."
"However, the international markets will not stop and wait for decisions in Europe, and nor will they wait for Parliament to make its pronouncements."
"Commissioner, Minister Jouyet, my group is expecting you to take rapid, rational and successful action, and to do so now."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - Madam President, the President of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, recently said that, when the market stabilises, we will not return to business as usual, but instead we will experience a new normality."
"Given the failings and weaknesses in the market and institutions that have been brought to light in devastating fashion over the last year, a move away from the abuses and faults of the past is only to be welcomed."
"The financial crisis has caused terrible panic, but it has also served to emphasise the need to eliminate obscurities and to introduce transparency, and for we legislators to regulate."
"But we also must avoid panic, because if we panic we will make poor decisions."
"In the US, out of the scramble to avert catastrophe, radical alterations to the landscape of high finance are emerging."
"Our institutions have stood steadier than those in the States - understandably as the crisis originated across the Atlantic - yet certain cases are a reminder that we are in no way invulnerable."
"To ensure the stability of our markets in the future, we must implement structural and systematic reforms and be prepared to act quickly."
"There may be three things that will happen or have happened already, such as reforms - for example ensuring that central banks prevent runs on banks and financial institutions - and there has been significant action in this regard already."
"Secondly, treasuries must remove the reason for runs occurring in the first place, namely the presence of distressed assets in the balance sheets of financial institutions."
"Lastly, it is pivotal for the financial system to be recapitalised."
"We have passed the initial stages of the crisis."
"The effects on banking and the political response to this initial trauma will not be known for some time."
"However, we now have to face up to ensuring that the new financial reality that emerges from the other end of this crisis is a strong and healthy one."
"To this end, it is necessary to address the root of the crisis and to remove distressed assets and clean up balance sheets."
"To emerge from the quagmire of the crisis, it is also necessary, for both localised and global economic health, to show there is sufficient capital in the finance system."
"Whether this is from public or private injection or a combination of both is another discussion, but we must have one soon."
"We do not know yet what the full and lasting impact of the world's financial crisis and its consequences on European markets will be."
"However, what we do know is that, to emerge standing from this crisis and to be sure that investors, markets and citizens are protected in the new normality that will result, we must keep our heads - even in time of doubt and turmoil - and take concrete steps towards implementing structural and systematic reforms that will safeguard the health of our European system and the financial well-being of citizens of European countries and globally."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FR) Madam President, if the main European leaders wished to illustrate the gulf separating them from European citizens, they need only react as they did to the financial crisis following the meeting of Finance Ministers on 14 September 2008."
"What are the main measures that have been announced, apart from a welcome but insufficient increase of EIB loans to small and medium-sized enterprises?"
"They can be summarised in three points."
"Firstly, as regards hopes for a fiscal stimulus, I quote Jean-Claude Juncker: 'We have ruled out adopting a European revival plan.'"
"We are going to apply the Stability Pact, the whole Pact and nothing but the Pact."
"Next, with regard to the deregulation process under way, I quote Christine Lagarde: 'We must not allow any slowing-down of the structural reforms';"
"Competitiveness needs a bigger playing field.'"
"Finally, the question on all our minds is who should foot the bill?"
"Again, I quote Jean-Claude Trichet: 'Banking watchdogs should not have disproportionate requirements regarding credit agencies', and, on the other hand, according to Jean-Claude Juncker: 'Everything must be done to prevent salaries from getting out of hand'."
"We wish to tell them this: come out of your bubble and try to put yourself in other people's position."
"They see, on the one hand, finance ministers moving heaven and earth for the major global speculators - a sum of EUR 110 billion has been released by the ECB alone - and, on the other, the employees who are at risk."
"In attempting to reassure the markets, you are unsettling companies."
"The truth is that, in the name of the free movement of capital and the famous open market economy with its free competition, financial leaders have collectively fuelled devilish mechanisms that they can no longer control."
"Let me remind you that, five months after the beginning of the subprime crisis, Mr Trichet, representing the 10 main world central banks, was still talking only of simple 'market corrections' and announcing 'robust growth, even if there is a slight slowdown'."
"Three months later, he was urging Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to 'give the private sector a chance to rectify itself'."
"What insight!"
"If a system can lose its own cronies in this way, it is in the midst of an existential crisis."
"This is why, if we wish to avoid further increasingly painful collapses, we must have the courage to make a break."
"Firstly, we must break with the idea of productivity based on the lowering of salary costs and social expenditure."
"We must reverse the continuing trend of reducing the share of salaries in added value."
"That is not the source of inflation; it is the immoral actions of financial operators."
"Secondly, we must end the complete reliance on financial markets to fuel the economy, as they are not feeding but poisoning it."
"The European Central Bank has a decisive role to play in directing money towards a socially effective economy, one that creates jobs, promotes training and develops public services, that ensures sustainable production and useful services, that has a place for research and development, respects public enterprises and the public interest and puts cooperation above economic warfare."
"However, to achieve that, the mission of the European Central Bank must change."
"It should refinance banks at very different interest rates depending on whether the loans benefit the sound economy I have just described or, on the contrary, are to be used as the basis of unsavoury financial operations."
"The conditions of access to loans should be advantageous in the former case and extremely dissuasive in the second."
"At the same time, rigorous controls are needed with regard to banks and funds and a tax should be introduced on financial capital movements."
"Finally, work should begin on radically reforming international economic institutions, as called for recently by President Lula in his address to the United Nations."
"Thirdly, there needs to be an end to the self-satisfaction and condescension of a small elite explaining to citizens that the only valid choice is its own."
"If we could at least discuss all this seriously with an open mind and a sense of responsibility, then the crisis would, in one respect, have brought some benefit."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (DA) Madam President, the first news item when I switched on the car radio on my way to the airport early on Monday morning was that my bank was undergoing a serious financial crisis."
"Fortunately I am just a saver so I shall not lose any money - but shareholders are in tears."
"The worldwide financial crisis has reached my little bank."
"The heart of the problem lies in the development of globalisation - not least the right for capital to move freely across borders."
"We have seen unheard-of speculation, with no aim other than a profit for some owners."
"This practice only goes to harm the real economy, just as we are seeing now, with speculation on the US housing market triggering an international financial crisis."
"Therefore, there should be an end to the thinking that the free movement of capital is the way to growth and wealth."
"This free movement only benefits speculators and tax evaders."
"I dare say that ordinary citizens and people wishing to invest in companies and finance the purchase and sale of goods can live with controls on who moves large amounts of money across borders and for what purpose."
"Controls on capital movements would give democracy greater insight and opportunity for influence."
"What is the solution to the immediate crisis, then?"
"A safety net funded by taxpayers is guaranteed to increase aggressive, speculative foreign policy in the financial sector and promote the worst of capitalism."
"The banks themselves must clear up after crashes and crises; it is not up to national banks and thus taxpayers to do this."
"Danish financial consultant Kim Valentin suggests a rescue fund financed by the banks themselves."
"It is crucial that the banks' contribution to the new fund is large enough to give them a real interest in keeping an eye on one another and intervening when a crisis looms, as they themselves must pay to clear it up."
"I propose that we use the EU to lay down tough rules on the size of banks' rescue funds."
"This would also help us fulfil the wish of UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for a responsible global economic policy."
"The banks must stop behaving like children who have never tried falling down and do not know that they can hurt themselves."
"Madam President, I do not share the views of my colleagues who blame the Commission for their non-delivery."
"I think the biggest mistake the European Commission could have made would have been to think that more regulation is always the right answer."
"All proposals from the Commission should be proportionate, balanced and well-targeted."
"I have been moderately content with how this Commission has responded until now, and I remain confident that the Commission has all the right tools to improve the regulatory framework for financial services."
"Improvements should be based, in the first place, on existing legislation and legal bases."
"In the second place, soft-law measures should be considered, and finally, if there is no improvement otherwise, then we should turn to legal, new regulations."
"I think that sometimes there is a tendency to forget how much we have already done in Europe."
"Since 2000 we have gone through a serious overhaul of our financial services laws, and we have updated many of the relevant regulations already."
"We have a modern and sophisticated legal framework in Europe."
"I think it is followed by most of the people in America already, so I do not think we need to radically change our approach."
"Finally, I would like to say that it of course needs to be considered that the supervisory framework is not as good as it could be."
"We should develop - based on the ECOFIN road map - the way the supervisors work in Europe, but also we should remember the global scale of things."
"We should remember that the financial industry is probably the most global industry in today's world, and we cannot act in a vacuum."
"We should remember that we are living together with the outside world, and we should try to develop standards, mutual recognition and convergence with transatlantic players - because that is the way to currently open competition - and also very good rules on the protection of retail clients and the way these things go forward."
"Finally, one thing about the ECB."
"I think we need to thank the ECB."
"The ECB did a very good job."
"The consequences to the European economy, both in the financial economy and also the real economy, would have been much more severe without the very good delivery of the ECB in terms of liquidity."
"I think the ECB should be congratulated for that."
"(FR) Madam President, Mr Jouyet - we are sorry the minister responsible cannot be here - Commissioner, the Socialists are supporters of the market, but they know that, on any market, there are honest traders and there are thieves, meaning that a police force is needed."
"It is astonishing to think that, when one tries to put in place a modern police force to deal with modern thieves, one is suddenly accused of archaism."
"We need modern supervision and regulation."
"There is no danger here that we will rush into adopting ill-advised and hasty legislation of the Sarbanes-Oxley kind, as it is more than a year since the crisis began."
"When Mr McCreevy addressed the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on 11 September 2007, he pointed the finger at the credit agencies as the chief culprits."
"More than a year later, we still have no proposal."
"I do not think this can be described as better regulation."
"As for the roadmap that was drawn up in October and December 2007, I have it here and I have checked it off, point by point."
"Quite frankly, first of all this roadmap was perhaps not designed for the level of crisis we are experiencing today and, secondly, when I look at how the timetable has been respected, well, it is hard to know where to start on that issue."
"The French President has announced a plan: he is going to condemn those responsible and gather everyone around the table for discussions."
"However, what is he going to discuss?"
"Returning to the roadmap drawn up by the Financial Stability Forum and that no one can implement, because no one in Financial Stability Forum has the authority to do so?"
"He proposes all this, yet his initial reaction to the crisis was to rush off to London in autumn 2007 to approve Gordon Brown's strategy to set up an early warning system rather than strengthen Europe's capacity to deal with the problem, which Mr Barroso is today defending in Washington."
"I hope that he will be able to persuade his Commissioner, Charlie McCreevy, so that European intervention in terms of the regulation and supervision of financial markets is as vigorous as it is necessary."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(Off-microphone comment from Mr Purvis on speaking time)"
"I am sorry."
"I interrupted Mrs Kauppi and I interrupted Mrs Berès."
"I am generally fair, Mr Purvis."
"Madam President, are only greed, euphoria and cheap money to be blamed for the whole mess?"
"What about the flaws of the originate-and-distribute model, which has enhanced systemic risk?"
"What about skewed pay schemes with a lack of ethics, which have stimulated reckless risk-taking?"
"What about investment-grade values assigned to trash?"
"What about conflicts of interest?"
"What about banks engaging in casino-type transactions?"
"What about the 'shadow' banking sector, with its extreme leveraging and speculation?"
"Why have policymakers not learnt from previous crises, though stern warnings were sent?"
"Just remember what Lamfalussy, Gramlich, Volcker and Buffett said years ago."
"The argument that regulation stifles financial innovation I find ludicrous."
"Not all financial innovation is sound."
"Is a quasi-international Ponzi scheme, as it has been developing via toxic products during the past decade, to be tolerated?"
"The issue at stake is the lack of proper regulation and supervision, and a poor understanding of financial markets, of the way they function and of systemic risk."
"Free markets are not synonymous with deregulated markets."
"Correction is going to be very painful, especially in the United States, but Europe is not immune to economic downturn."
"Solutions should not be patchy - consider that markets are global."
"International coordination is needed to restore confidence."
"(The President cut off the speaker.)"
"(LV) I think that we can use a familiar phrase to describe the situation on the financial markets: 'the party is over, and now it is the morning after.'"
"Somebody will pay dearly for the upset stomach, but, of course, there are some states and businesses that will profit from this extremely bad situation."
"In other words, there are several energy resources and particularly developed states and businesses that shifted their extra profits in that direction, and this will clearly also change the centre and balance of political influence in the world."
"In Europe, in my view, it is the small, new EU Member States that are the most vulnerable in this situation."
"Mistaken structural and taxation policies at a time of high economic growth are now creating obvious economic and social threats in most of these states, including in my own, Latvia."
"The large volume of domestic private loans in euros from banks in euro area states, the large proportion of non-resident money in the banking sector and the rapid increase towards the levels of European average wages expressed in euros may lead to a revaluation of national currencies."
"In that case, long-term repayment to financial institutions in the euro area may become a new burden for the citizens and businesses of those Member States."
"If a national currency's exchange corridor is widened with respect to the euro, then inflation, which is already high, may gain ground and further postpone the entry of the new Member States into the euro area."
"If the total amount of private loans in payments to the bank adds up to a two-figure percentage of GDP, then the citizens of those states will not be optimistic."
"This will instead create pronounced political pessimism and will impact on public opinion regarding the European Union as an institution, with all the attendant consequences for Parliament, too, in political terms in the new Member States."
"Madam President, the financial crisis rages on and euro-zone countries are facing recession."
"The answer, we are repeatedly told, is that we need more regulation to make the financial sector work better."
"But we have a problem now, and changing the rules after the problem has arisen is not going to help us with that problem."
"I urge Members to consider a completely different reaction to the current economic difficulties."
"They are a signal that we cannot continue as we are and that, thanks to borrowing that has been too cheap and imports that have been too cheap, we have all been living above our means and we cannot go on consuming at the same rate."
"Adjustment will be painful, but it is necessary, and in these hard times there is another message that is even more salient but will not be heard in these institutions."
"It is that the EU cannot continue with its massive legislative programmes in the name of health and safety, consumer protection, social equality, for instance, for the overriding effect of all these schemes is to add costs and to crush the productive activity on which our very prosperity depends."
"In these hard times, the one message that should be heard is that European countries can no longer afford the European Union, its institutions and its immense outpourings of legislation."
"(ES) Mr President, I will try to be very clear, given the wide variety of opinions expressed from my bench."
"Firstly, the current crisis is not a biblical curse or a punishment from the gods."
"The markets have failed and these failures have prompted interventions which would have delighted Keynes himself."
"If the markets have failed, then we must correct what has failed in the markets; in other words, we must do something."
"This something involves various things."
"Firstly, we must administer a shock treatment to bring the patient out of his current coma."
"I would remind the Commission and the Council that, while the liquidity problems can be solved by the European Central Bank, the solvency problems are something which directly affects you: the Council, the Commission and the Member States."
"Secondly, to stop this happening again, we need to know what has failed in the markets and what principles we should re-establish."
"There has been a failure in the management of risk, in governance and, finally, in ethics."
"This means that we must re-establish some basic principles: transparency in products, in companies and in markets; responsibility of managers; confidence between the financial economy and the real economy, and the central role of politics."
"I agree with the Council that the times of total deregulation are over."
"Neither the markets nor industry can self-regulate."
"The final prescription - which is needed to vaccinate the patient and ensure that this does not happen again or in any other way - is that we must continue with market integration."
"We have to achieve a sufficiently critical dimension, as they have done in the United States."
"We have to establish a democracy of the euro so that our currency can have some influence in the world in a crisis that is global."
"Finally, we have to review the regulatory framework and the supervisory framework which are what have failed."
"I therefore do not agree with soft legislation, with codes of conduct or with self-regulation."
"It is up to us all to offer a response to our people who are, after all, the ones who will ultimately pay the price."
"(PT) In one minute, what conclusions can I draw on the current crisis?"
"It is the result of choosing not to adequately supervise the activities of the financial markets."
"Competent regulation does not kill markets but, on the contrary, is essential for their survival."
"There are people who are responsible for the losses, but there are now also citizens who are paying the price for their excesses and for the failures in public supervision."
"Warnings were given some time ago."
"The Rasmussen report, which this Parliament adopted yesterday by a very large majority, makes specific proposals on the risks of excessive leverage, lack of transparency and conflicts of interest, but this report stems from work begun by the Socialist Group years before the crisis began in 2007."
"The own-initiative report by Ieke van den Burg and Daniel Dăianu takes the same line."
"The European Union is a major partner in the international context and I congratulate Commissioner Almunia on his announcements today; but will Commissioner McCreevy agree with these?"
"The paralysis affecting the Commission in relation to these matters has no possible justification."
"Parliament is doing what it should."
"The other institutions should also act accordingly."
"Mr President, it is a pity that Mr Schulz has already left."
"I wanted to make the point that it is too early to say who will go bankrupt, because nobody knows who the end-investors in the toxic assets are."
"Maybe they are state-owned banks."
"Nevertheless, I would like to encourage a broader view of events and to recall that Parliament, as early as the beginning of this year, put forward some valid proposals which were not accepted by the Council and the Commission."
"Firstly, we asked for economic management at EU level to be brought into line with global developments and for the broad economic guidelines to be updated."
"We also suggested ensuring vigorous enforcement of EU competition rules and not allowing the crowding-out of small and medium-sized business from the market, or the creation of monsters which are too big to fall."
"We have to promote and preserve our national, traditional business culture because the slogan of the European Union is 'in diversity we are united'."
"Mr President, let us hope that the American proposals for purchases of toxic assets do work, because, if they do not, the contagion will almost certainly spread over here."
"I would like assurance from Mr Jouyet and Mr Almunia that we really do have our defences in place."
"Do we have our lenders of last resort ready to meet the very worst which might occur in such a circumstance?"
"We are moving from a liquidity problem to a solvency problem."
"It is true that, in due course, we will have to review our regulatory defences, but this cannot and should not be done precipitately, in the heat of the crisis."
"We would risk overreacting, imposing unnecessary, wrongly directed, over-draconian conditions which would only harm the prospects for investment in our economies and jobs for the future."
"The most vital thing, which we must bring about immediately, is the restoration of confidence."
"Mr Almunia, you mentioned the word several times."
"Let us see how we can set about it."
"I would urge that the leaders of the world's most important economies of America, Europe, the Middle and Far East meet together within days and assure the world unequivocally that whatever is necessary to douse the flames will be provided unequivocally wherever those flames may erupt."
"Only when the flames and embers are extinguished can we turn to post-mortems as to how this happened and what is needed to avoid it happening again."
"Confidence is the vital base on which a vibrant financial system and a vibrant global economy rests."
"It is now up to the political leaders of the highest level - a summit indeed - of the free-market economies to come together - no excuses, no holding back, no arguments - to take full responsibility for restoring confidence."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson called the past few weeks a 'humbling' time for the United States as he unveiled his rescue package of up to 700 billion dollars for the country's crippled financial sector."
"The situation in the US is indeed alarming."
"The US financial system with its investment banks, hedge funds and structured products, which are not subject to normal banking supervision, and its numerous business operations conducted through single-purpose companies which do not appear in any balance sheet, has virtually collapsed."
"It is unlikely to be resurrected very quickly in its original form."
"The last two pure investment banks - Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley - have now switched to the commercial banking sector."
"The promise of cheap money for everyone to fuel ever more growth, profits and liquidity has been revealed as an illusion: this type of perpetual motion simply does not exist."
"A debt-fuelled high standard of living for everyone with a car, house and everything else early on in life simply cannot be maintained over the long term."
"The real economy has caught up with us: without employment, there can be no savings, without savings, there is no investment, and without investment, there is no sustainable growth."
"We Europeans should learn from the US disaster."
"There is no alternative to budget consolidation."
"Money does not grow on trees."
"A plentiful supply of cheap money, which is what the Socialists are always demanding from the ECB, will not solve the problem; it will simply make it worse."
"The Commission should implement the proposals which have the European Parliament's support as regards securitisation, maintenance of structured products on the initiators' books, more supervision, a code of conduct for market participants and various other measures as swiftly as possible, albeit with a sense of proportion and diligence."
"(FR) Mr President, Mr Jouyet, Commissioner, I would like to begin by thanking Mr Jouyet for being available and for the great competence he displays in all areas."
"Europe cannot go on periodically suffering the consequences of crises that are rooted in American capitalism."
"This has been made quite clear by previous speakers."
"This position is not one of hostility towards the United States."
"It stems from an obvious fact: the crisis is the result of serious malfunctioning which requires vigorous remedies."
"Self-regulation is not enough."
"Today, however, the crisis is global."
"Mr Jouyet said earlier that we needed new measures - legislation and regulation - and to assess the balance sheets and solvency of banks, the sovereign wealth funds, salaries, transparency, supervision and accounting standards."
"All of this should be built upon and improved."
"It has also been said many times that we need to restore confidence in the financial system, which is an integral part of economic life."
"I disagree with the criticism that has been voiced and believe that, in this regard, the French Presidency has been quick to react."
"The proposals put forward by President Sarkozy, speaking on behalf of the European Union, gave a strong signal in New York and the extended G8 meeting he has proposed will allow the world's various economic players to come together round the table, which is truly a significant step."
"In order to come up with global rules, we cannot simply settle matters in Europe."
"Of course, there needs to be progress in Europe and, in this respect, it is unfortunate that there has been some slowness to act."
"However, rules also need to be adopted internationally."
"The economy is global, meaning that the rules must also be global."
"There is a great deal of work ahead of us and I am confident that the measures Mr Jouyet announced earlier will ensure that, over the coming weeks and months, possible solutions are found."
"It would be foolish to think that these matters can be resolved in a few minutes."
"(DE) Mr President, over the last few days, we have seen great turbulence in the US financial system, and that is putting it mildly."
"One of the major news items was that the company Lehman Brothers Holdings was forced to file for bankruptcy protection from creditors."
"I would like to make two points in this context."
"Firstly, the US is planning a massive support package."
"However, this will not end the crisis or protect us from further surprises as events continue to unfold."
"Secondly, yes, it is necessary to determine which regulatory mechanisms could be improved and where more transparency could be created."
"Unfortunately, though, more and better regulation will not rule out all the unpleasant surprises that might occur in the financial markets in future, because we are not familiar with all the existing banking mechanisms."
"Why do I say that?"
"Let me give you an example."
"Surprises can arise, for example, in the netting agreements between banks, which are very important in minimising risk."
"Of course, banks can only take netting agreements into account in risk assessment if these agreements are enforceable in law."
"Could better rules in future rule out any uncertainty about the validity of netting agreements?"
"I do not think so."
"In my view, therefore, even sound and reliable regulations will not rule out unpleasant surprises in future."
"(PT) Mr President, the current financial crisis, which in the short term will be economic and cannot fail to be social, perhaps also political, could have been anticipated because it was predictable."
"It is a shame that ultraliberal dogmatism and the economy of financial speculation, the so-called 'economy of the devil', have taken the upper hand over social concerns and the economy of entrepreneurial spirit and action, which is the only economy capable of generating wealth and serving the citizens."
"Regulation has failed, as Commissioner Almunia stated."
"It has failed and must now be radically overhauled, after being punished."
"The crisis in the world's financial system is structural, as Commissioner Almunia also stated."
"As a result, merely using the political instruments at our disposal today is not enough."
"The attitude of the European Central Bank, which is insisting on applying remedies that the current disease is rejecting, the blindly optimistic autism of certain members of the Ecofin Council, who just 15 days ago expressed surprised at the dimensions of the crisis, and the attitude of Commissioner McCreevy, who is proposing changing something so that everything stays the same, are unacceptable."
"The Commission now has a responsibility to use all its instruments and to put pressure on the Member States to create new instruments."
"This responsibility particularly involves paying heed to the correct and ambitious recommendations made by the European Parliament following the Rasmussen report."
"(RO) They say that you can run, but you can't hide from globalization."
"The same holds for global financial markets."
"While there was profit all around the world, there was normalcy; now that losses occur, it is the fault of capitalism."
"In our opinion, the blame rests to a great extent with the state which has forgotten about one of its main infrastructures, the financial one, which is just as important as roads, railways and airlines."
"What the United States and the European Union, as well as Member States, are trying to do now, is to lay the foundations for a new infrastructure: the global financial infrastructure."
"Unfortunately, state intervention comes rather late."
"This is not a new regulation, but a fluidization, a supervision of global financial flows, and all the states should take part in it, thus enabling the financial system to regain credibility."
"Mr President, on Monday we were told by Commissioner McCreevy that hedge funds and private equity were not the cause of the current turmoil."
"In today's Guardian it was reported that the billionaire John Paulson was revealed yesterday as one of the hedge fund bosses who has been short-selling UK bank shares, placing a nearly GBP 1 billion bet that their shares would fall dramatically."
"His New York-based Paulson & Co was last year's most successful hedge fund after it bet against the sub-prime mortgages that later turned toxic in the credit crunch."
"Paulson & Co has placed bets on four high street banks, including HBOS, which was forced to agree a rescue takeover by Lloyds TSB last week after a precipitous collapse in its shares."
"If Commissioner McCreevy is not prepared to regulate all financial institutions, then he should be forced to step aside."
"The Commission has a responsibility to ensure that these institutions are not allowed to pick the pockets of pension funds, of savings and of jobs."
"They have to be stopped and the only way to do it is to bring transparency and regulation into this area."
"The so-called 'invisible hand' of the market is in fact a pickpocket and the more invisible it is, the more pockets it picks."
"I think that Mr De Rossa is proposing that Commissioner McCreevy be offered a subscription to The Guardian."
"The President's office will look into it."
"(SV) Mr President, we have every reason to react to unreasonable compensation and bonus schemes."
"I think that we all do that and it is entirely understandable, but I will say nevertheless, having listened to the debate, that strident political rhetoric is not the way to resolve global financial crises."
"Do not sound as though you are throwing the baby out with the bathwater and adding to the panic which raged on in the financial markets last week."
"That must not happen in this House."
"We must be reasonable, we must be sensible."
"That is the responsibility we have been given by our voters."
"My friends, we must take a balanced view, we must create good and effective rules and laws which allow scope for growth and self-regulation."
"I worry when I hear this strident rhetoric."
"It makes me anxious, and I fear that it will lead to an overregulated financial community which will not be able to deliver the growth we all need so much."
"It is growth and the prospect of creating more jobs which our voters are looking for."
"(FR) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened in amazement to the views of the socialists and communists, who tell us that it is the failure of the system."
"They obviously have a short memory, they who, in the 20th century, bankrupted every economy in their hands."
"The problem is global and the solution must therefore be European."
"Regarding the financial question, Commissioner, I would like to know whether or not you are going to implement Article 105(6) of the Treaty establishing the European Community, under which the Council may, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission, confer on the European Central Bank a task relating to the prudential supervision of credit institutions."
"I believe that, today, citizens consider that is time for us to monitor the arrangements in place for the prudential supervision of financial systems."
"We cannot build an internal market without a European regulation policy."
"Mr President, this crisis has demonstrated that the global financial system is seriously flawed."
"First the supervisory agencies failed to prevent irresponsible behaviour by investors."
"We have seen the development of new financial instruments that are, however, not transparent enough and do not allow for proper risk assessment."
"Secondly, owners and shareholders of financial institutions failed to supervise properly their own managers, who paid themselves exorbitant salaries and bonuses, and for what?"
"For driving their companies into bankruptcy!"
"We need urgent action at least in these two areas."
"We do not want a repetition of the American meltdown scenario in Europe."
"We do not want in Europe a situation in which chief executive officers of financial companies go away with tens of millions of dollars while taxpayers are left to pay their bills."
"We expect the Commission to take serious action on this."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Mr President, I would like to thank Members for this exciting debate."
"We could stay here for hours, as the subject is certainly worthy of a great deal of discussion and the thoughts they have shared have been fascinating."
"Unfortunately, however, our time is limited."
"I shall draw the following conclusions."
"Firstly, as regards the laissez-faire approach and the lack of regulation, bearing in mind the reserve that comes with my job, I think I have expressed myself quite clearly."
"It is my opinion that we must move beyond the regulation/no regulation debate."
"Financial deregulation is now an outdated notion."
"Strong, modern financial regulation will be the solution from now on."
"It must be adapted; we must go beyond what has been done so far."
"This is the first point I wish to make and, on this, I am extremely clear."
"I also listened carefully to what Mrs Koch-Mehrin was saying and I repeat what she said, namely that regulation is not the enemy of the market."
"Everyone must face up to their responsibilities."
"It is the job of the public authorities to regulate and to adapt the rules in force, because the stability of the system, the protection of individual savers and the protection of depositors are at stake."
"I would also say to Mr Wurtz: it is also employment and growth, which have a direct impact on the real economy, that are threatened by this crisis."
"That is why we must act, including for the least wealthy, and quickly."
"My second belief is that Europe must act within a framework of enhanced international cooperation."
"There is no alternative."
"As has been said, Europe must make its voice heard, otherwise we will be subjected to the effects of US solutions."
"It has already happened with Sarbanes-Oxley."
"We saw the consequences that had for some European companies; we saw the effect it had on accounting and market standards."
"We can begin as of now."
"The only advantage we have is that, today, Europe can, as Mr Almunia and President Sarkozy have both stressed, assert itself firmly, make its voice heard on the international stage, take the reins and get a head start."
"I call on Europeans to coordinate themselves so that the Union has a strong presence on the international stage, and to reflect upon international financial structures and on international regulatory authorities."
"Because if no international measures are adopted, we cannot complain about having no alternative but to draw on sovereign funds, which, moreover, we wish to keep."
"I am not passing judgment, but there needs to be a certain consistency in this respect."
"We need to know what we want to do and that if Europe fails to act, we will have to rely on other funds to stabilise the financial system."
"My third belief is one that has been mentioned by several speakers, including Mr Schulz."
"It is true that we must address the issue of salaries and the problem of profits linked to cyclical market activities."
"The issue of market operators' salaries should also be seen in the context of this international reflection."
"I am not the first to say so."
"Gordon Brown has also said so in the past."
"It seems logical to me, and in-depth thought must be given to this issue."
"It is clear that this is not just an economic and financial crisis, but also one of ethics and responsibility."
"It is a crisis of economic ethics and concerns all actors and political leaders, whatever their leanings."
"As Mr Wurtz and other speakers have stressed, finance must continue to serve the economy; the economy must not be the victim of finance."
"As I have said, thought must be given to the role of financial institutions and to the roadmap concluded by the Finance Ministers on the basis of Commission proposals."
"Let us talk about specific progress."
"To Mrs Berès, I say that we must go further and, with regard to the timetable, act quickly."
"I repeat what Mr Almunia said: the Commission must act quickly because it is a question of restoring confidence, and I wish to conclude on this point."
"Even if Europe is less affected, it is still important for us to send out messages of confidence."
"This means action, international cooperation, not being afraid to adapt rules, acting quickly and having proposals on the table ready for the European Council on 15 October, applying the suggestions made by Parliament and, as has been said, being aware of the fact that we are dealing with transactions that affect not only the liquidity but also the solvency of the entire financial system."
"It is now economic confidence that will kickstart growth and that is why we must cast aside dogmatism to take firm action and use the full range of tools at our disposal."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - The US financial system has been jolted in the last few days as Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy and Merrill Lynch, fearing a similar-type collapse, agreed to be taken over by the Bank of America."
"The Dow Jones industrial average fell 4.4 % on 15 September, and another 4.1 % two days later."
"The decline in stock prices worldwide on 15-17 September resulted in about USD 3.6 trillion in losses for the investors."
"The stock of AIG has plunged more than 90 %, from USD 72 last year to USD 2.05."
"The U.S. government took control of AIG with an USD 85 billion bailout on 16 September."
"These 'developments' point to the largest financial crisis facing the US since the opening of the Great Depression."
"They have occurred a week after the US federal government seized control of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the giant mortgage companies."
"The problem is that Lehman Brothers and AIG owe many billions to creditors not only in the United States but in Europe as well."
"Is Europe prepared to absorb the shock induced by its indissoluble link with the US market?"
"Is the EUR 36.3 billion injected into the market by the ECB and Bank of England enough to make the danger disappear?"
"in writing. - (PL) I should like to draw the attention of the House to the following issues."
"1."
"The US Government and the Federal Reserve have so far allocated a sum close to USD 1 trillion to combating the effects of the financial crisis."
"The so-called Paulson package contains additional proposals estimated to cost a further USD 700-800 billion."
"This suggests that the current crisis is comparable to the great crash of 1929."
"2."
"In addition, the ECB made available around USD 750 billion to improve liquidity, whilst the Bank of England released approximately USD 80 billion."
"These moves provide further confirmation of just how serious the situation of Europe's financial markets is deemed to be."
"3."
"All the measures mentioned indicate that strong and decisive government intervention is back in favour."
"Even the most liberal economists recognise the need to introduce rules to stem the crisis, and are actually prepared to accept the involvement of governments and international financial institutions in these processes."
"4."
"The scale and extent of this crisis will impact negatively on the course of transactions in the real economy."
"This will result in recession in the US economy, which means negative economic growth."
"It will also mean a slowdown of economic growth in Europe."
"5."
"In view of this situation, it is imperative for all countries to strengthen institutions providing financial supervision."
"This is particularly true of the EU."
"These institutions need to be able to exercise stronger supervision of the activities of the major banks, investment funds and insurance bodies."
"Stronger supervision is the only way to improve financial security and ensure financial stability in the future."
"(FI) Now we know that the state is needed as a guarantor of capitalism financially and not just militarily."
"The Government in the United States of America, that fatherland of predatory capitalism, has privatised the profits from speculation and is now socialising the biggest losses to the trash bank through speculation in the history of its economy."
"Raubtier (predator) is the German name for that type of capitalism that is based on another word Raubgier (rapacity), which is close to Raub (robbery)."
"Both are better."
"Savers who have prepared for rainy days everywhere in the world will be robbed of the value of some of their savings in the years to come when, as a result of the events of last week, the world economy is inflated and/or we go into economic decline."
"It is hard to imagine how the United States could otherwise pay the enormous debts it is only now incurring and how, in a time of inflation, the weakening of the value of money, it will respond to its own worsening ability to pay off its debts and normalise its overpriced assets."
"The time bombs permitted by the American Government and made by the market terrorist banks of predator capitalism there, based as they are on swap deals, the virtual packaging of financial products, the insolvency of customers who are not creditworthy, and bogus loan insurance policies, have exploded in the face of the taxpayers; and the rest of the world is paying the price."
"Getting a grip on energy prices (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on:"
"the oral question to the Council on Getting a grip on energy prices, by Hannes Swoboda, on behalf of the PSE Group - B6-0460/2008)"

"the oral question to the Commission on Getting a grip on energy prices, by Esko Seppänen and Ilda Figueiredo, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group - B6-0469/2008)."
"author. - Mr President, I am sorry the Socialists have chosen to vent their old prejudices about profits and social issues in what is, essentially, an economic and industrial question."
"Clearly, oil price rises are serious for the real economy - especially any volatility or instability in those prices - but let us remember the lessons that we learned from the 1970s."
"Those lessons include the fact that higher prices will encourage more exploration and the development of resources."
"They will discourage excessive consumption, and they will drive efficiency."
"I submit the issue of fuel poverty is an important one, but it should be tackled via social security measures and not through market distortions such as seeking to cap prices."
"Let us also remember that prices can come down as well as rise, and that markets always tend to overshoot before settling down at a realistic level."
"Establishing a truly competitive market is an essential prerequisite for pursuing other policy objectives."
"This prices issue underlines the fundamentals of EU energy policy and the EU energy situation - the three pillars, namely: the essential need for truly competitive markets - markets which will deliver the lowest prices and the most efficient services; the security of supply issues in our dependence on imported fuels; and the convergence of sustainability objectives with the other two elements of our policy."
"Let us beware throwing out the baby with the bathwater because we are concerned about price rises last summer and forget that prices come down as well as go up."
"author. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, Mr Chichester, of course the prices can go down as well as up, but I think almost all of us here would agree that given the scarce energy resources and their limited availability, and the growing competition worldwide over access to, and shares in, these resources, it is likely that prices will remain very high over the long term."
"Current developments and the problem of energy poverty demonstrate that we have not yet responded adequately to this situation."
"In my view, the acute social problems related to high energy prices must always be tackled through social policy, but we also have to ensure in structural terms that our societies are no longer wasteful of energy resources."
"Mr Piebalgs will undoubtedly have something to say about this, as he showed such commitment to this issue at the start of his term in office."
"The goals of energy saving and energy efficiency must be pursued much more consistently than has been the case so far."
"We have often said that we should build a different type of house, and that we need different types of heating and cooling systems and more efficient electrical appliances, but where is the large-scale concerted action that we need to harness the major potential available to us in relation to energy efficiency and energy saving?"
"If there is an area where we need some kind of European master plan or national plans, it is here."
"In my view, the Structural Funds, the Cohesion Fund and European Investment Bank programmes etc. should be utilised in a joined-up way in order to pursue seriously the objectives that you, Mr Piebalgs, repeatedly proposed three years ago."
"If we look at the current debate about oil prices, for example, and see what has been proposed in this House in order to apply the brakes to the Commission, which after all wanted to make cars more energy-efficient, the question we should be asking ourselves is whether the idea that prices will remain high for the long term is actually being taken seriously."
"Commissioner, I would like to encourage you to place your earlier proposals on energy efficiency and energy saving at the heart of the Strategic Energy Review, because this will be the area which will determine whether we do the right thing for our societies or not, and whether we serve their needs at times of permanently high prices."
"author. - (FR) Mr President, Mr Borloo, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the increase in energy prices is having all kinds of negative effects, the most obvious being the rise in the cost of living for our fellow citizens."
"This again illustrates just how reliant we are on energy."
"Various actions are needed if we are to reduce energy price fluctuations and, more especially, drive down prices."
"I have three proposals to make in this regard."
"The first course of action concerns the economic management of energy prices."
"This is something that has to be done right away, in other words the Member States need to develop financial mechanisms whereby the factor of rising prices can be deleted from company budgets and from household budgets too."
"They also have to promote social measures aimed at combating energy poverty in low-income households."
"The second line of attack is to work on the prices being charged for imported energy."
"What are you proposing that will enable the European Union to speak with one voice when dealing with the producer countries - and people are always talking about 'speaking with one voice' - so that all these neighbourhood policies and partnership agreements can at last take proper account of the energy dimension?"
"Allow me, perhaps naively, to put forward a solution that might help ease relations in our negotiations with Russia."
"Why not interconnect the Nabucco gas pipeline operation with the South Stream project?"
"Perhaps this would help calm things down a bit."
"The third course of action is to reduce imports, or even stop them completely, which would be the ideal solution."
"To achieve this we need to break the symbiotic link between increasing growth and increasing energy consumption."
"It is really important that growth should not automatically generate a proportionate rise in energy consumption."
"Of course we need to develop renewable and low-CO2 forms of energy, and the report presented by our colleague Mr Turmes is a step in this direction."
"Being efficient in energy also means saving energy, which is something we are not doing sufficiently at present."
"The texts that will be tabled here are therefore well overdue."
"We need to focus on physical and technological energy storage capacities and indeed on those elements that are acting as vehicles for energy consumption."
"Could you tell us, Mr Borloo, if you have high hopes of the energy-climate package being adopted at any time in the weeks ahead?"
"What would need to happen before an ambitious package of measures is put in place to meet these various objectives?"
"author. - (FI) Mr President, Commissioner, in the compromise resolution the significance of speculation in the rise in the cost of energy is excluded from energy prices."
"Virtual oil is, however, being sold on the derivatives markets for six times more than physical oil."
"The price of electricity is also tied to the securities market: virtual electricity is being sold on the energy markets for more than physical electricity, and on the European Energy Exchange it costs five times more."
"There is massive evidence of fraud in the OTC derivatives market, which is unregulated and not monitored by the stock exchanges themselves."
"The harmonisation of electricity will result in automatic windfall profits for big companies, and by 2013 emissions trading will increase the scope for speculation many times over."
"In the energy derivatives markets, consumers are being forced to pay the price of speculation, the same way they did in the subprime mortgage market in the United States: the profits were privatised and the losses are being socialised."
"Capitalism is a casino where the price of energy is raffled in the stock exchanges."
"Thank you."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after having listened to the various questions that practically everyone seems to be asking, allow me to make a few remarks of my own."
"The first concerns the erratic way in which prices have been changing: at one point USD 10, then 140 a short time ago, now it is back to 100."
"In fact there seems to be a disconnection between the way the product itself is appreciating and the financial market that is based on that very same commodity."
"However, in the long term, it seems to me to be fairly clear that speculators will always be active as long as it is our perception that global energy needs - which continue to grow - are not based on a new energy mix that is less reliant on hydrocarbons."
"Moreover, I note that in Jeddah at the end of June, where Commissioner Piebalgs and I attended a gathering of all the producer and consumer countries, the common message was absolutely clear."
"The expectations were unmistakable: the main consumer countries have to indicate their clear intentions to modify their energy mix, implement energy efficiency measures and become less reliant on hydrocarbons."
"The producers themselves are all for this."
"I think that this is what the forthcoming climate-energy package is all about and I believe that Europe's 500 million consumers are saying: let us have more locally produced energy, more self-sufficient energy, and let us have a more direct link between producers and consumers."
"That said, in the very short term it is obvious that there are various regulatory problems to be solved, including access to information on commercial stocks, and this does not just mean strategic stocks."
"The United States does it, Japan does it."
"The Commission has been asked to think about this."
"I believe that by the end of October or early November the Commission will be putting forward a proposal aimed at providing greater transparency in this area in the very short term."
"However, a proper strategy for energy self-sufficiency and a different energy mix still represent the most effective response in the medium and long term."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I think these are very timely questions and this is a very important debate."
"The Commission is now finalising the second Strategic Energy Review, which is also based on the debates in this House."
"I expect that this second Strategic Energy Review will be adopted in November, and it will particularly cover the issues that we have been addressing today."
"Definitely there is a limit to what we can propose in the strategic energy review due to the Lisbon Treaty ratification, because there is an energy article that would give much more opportunity to streamline the response."
"But still we can do quite a lot."
"The Commission shares the opinion that oil prices are likely to remain high in the medium and long term."
"The justification for this type of prognosis is volatility in daily markets."
"Even if now, the oil price is USD 106 or USD 110 per barrel, which is much lower than it was some time ago, at USD 145, the daily volatility still makes the situation relatively difficult to predict, and it is definitely making a major, wide-ranging impact and deserves a response."
"While there is clearly a need for short-term action by Member States to mitigate the impact on the most vulnerable households, the main policy response should aim at facilitating our transition towards clearly more sustainable ways of producing and consuming energy."
"In other words, to pursue our aim of becoming a low-carbon and energy-efficient economy."
"In order to do so it will be vital to take forward the Commission's proposals on climate and energy policy, following up on the political commitments of the European Council."
"On the structural reforms."
"It is important to underline that we are facing an energy price increase, not only for oil: it also goes for coal, it also goes for gas and, as a result, it also has an impact on electricity prices."
"Links between these prices are related by pricing structure: for example, gas contracts often use oil price benchmarks; gas-fired electricity generation is increasingly marginal and thus price-setting."
"So I think it is very important to address not only issues about oil prices but all the sectors."
"The situation clearly reinforces the need for encouraging competition throughout the whole energy sector."
"That is why, again, I would like to underline the importance of swiftly reaching an agreement on the third internal energy market package."
"Europe can and must develop its own strengths to deal with the fast-changing global energy economy."
"A well-functioning, fully interconnected and competitive EU-wide internal market is a response."
"This will diminish European vulnerability to energy-supply disruption and facilitate our cooperation with energy producer and transit countries."
"Solidarity between Member States in crises will be enabled by European networks."
"On European energy oil stocks, we have now prepared legislation that will clearly address two things: one, that these oil stocks will be always available at moments of crisis and can be easily used; and second, it is issues of precedence addressed, it is transparency and reporting on a weekly basis on commercial stocks."
"In this respect, even though we are not the biggest oil consumer in the world, we are able to influence transparency in the market and diminish volatility and the level of speculation in the market."
"Speculation is definitely an issue."
"We have done an analysis."
"The available evidence suggests that supply and demand are the main drivers of oil prices, and that these fundamentals are set to underpin high prices in the future."
"But, at the same time, we will continue our work on analysing what impact speculation has at a particular moment and whether there is really the ability to diminish volatility and have more supervision in the energy market."
"In any case, it is very clear that transparency in oil markets, both in terms of contracts and related financial instruments and fundamentals, is a must."
"I would also like to say that both Commission and national competition authorities are acting against anti-competitive behaviour."
"This is a way in which we can pass the changes in oil prices to the consumers, because consumers use refined products."
"The Commission will make additional efforts in this respect - we are following this issue - and a lot of competition authorities in member countries have already started investigations into the issue of how soon and how fast the oil price changes are being passed to the consumers."
"At the same time it is very clear that there are differences between different member countries, because there are different sourcing strategies for the companies concerned."
"Also, in some countries there are biofuel blends that also influence the velocity of the possibility to change prices according to the oil price."
"Nevertheless, it should be very clearly in the focus of attention in all anti-trust authorities."
"Energy efficiency, renewables and diversification: it is very clear that our main lines are in our energy and climate policy, and it will be prominent in our Strategic Energy Review."
"There is already a substantial European legal framework in place."
"In addition, there are many actions being pursued under the current Energy Efficiency Action Plan, including also legislative initiatives and studies."
"And there are also support actions, for example under the Intelligent Energy Europe programme."
"Regarding existing EU legislation, it is implementation that is very essential."
"The ambitious 2020 target for energy savings cannot be met without adequate transposition by Member States."
"The Commission is vigorously pursuing infringement procedures to ensure that member countries are really implementing their existing EU legisaltion."
"This year the Commission also will adopt an energy efficiency package."
"This will include a communication with a comprehensive overview of the Commission's ambitions for energy effciency, as well as legislative and policy initiatives - in particular, prominent proposals for an ambitious recast of the Directive on the energy performance of buildings; also for a modification of the Energy Labelling Directive, to ensure more effective and dynamic labelling."
"Needless to say, continued high energy prices further support the need for action in this area."
"And also we get clear involvement of the European Investment Bank in this area."
"The European Council, when analysing the appropriate responses to the high oil price situation, underlines the importance of a sustainable and adequate tax framework."
"There is considerable scope for the EU and its Member States to make more systematic and effective use of taxation to encourage energy savings."
"The Commission intends to present proposals and recommendations on the cost-effective use of taxation and specific tax incentives, including reduced VAT, to promote the demand and supply of energy-efficient goods and services."
"Furthermore, in its review of the Energy Tax Directive, the Commission will look at how it can better support the EU's energy and climate policy, encouraging energy efficiency and emission reductions."
"More widespread and systematic use of road pricing, in line with the principles of the Commission's 'Greening Transport' Communication, would also encourage a shift to more energy-efficient transparency rules."
"On financing alternative energy technologies and research, let me draw your attention to the fact that we are in the process of preparing a communication on financing low-carbon technologies as a follow-up to the European Strategic Energy Technology Plan."
"The Communication will analyse the resource needs for long-term research and development, large-scale demonstration projects and the early-stage commercialisation phase."
"We are considering measures that best use public investment to leverage additional private investment, such as the creation of a specific facility for large-scale demonstration projects."
"This could be built on existing instruments such as the Risk Sharing Financing Facility, a joint initiative of the Commission and the European Investment Bank."
"The Commission also encourages Member States to use national resources, for example potential resources that could be raised through the auctioning of CO2 allowances in the revised ETS schemes."
"On energy security and foreign policy aspects, I come back to the idea that Europe can and must reinforce its own strengths to deal with the fast-changing global energy economy."
"Internal and external policy in energy work together."
"The stronger a common European energy market is, the stronger it will be towards external energy suppliers."
"We are pursuing diversification with countries like Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Egypt, Iraq, Nigeria, but it is clear that we also encourage predictable relations with current suppliers like Russia, and definitely we are looking very much at the possibility that Norway could increase supply to the market, because it is very clear that the EU market is attractive for suppliers, and we should not be afraid that we will run out of gas, but we should really work for competitive supplies to the European market and not be in a situation where we could be blackmailed on prices."
"Regarding the issue of assistance to oil-importing developing countries."
"Given the strong impact of access and price of energy on development and global climate change, energy cooperation is increasingly important throughout our development assistance activities."
"It was a central theme of my joint visit with Commissioner Michel to the African Union and a number of African countries earlier this month."
"We invest substantial resources in supporting movement of these countries, not only to eliminate energy poverty, but to power themselves with clean and new energy sources."
"On macroeconomic and social aspects, the increase in oil price levels certainly put a strain on consumers and certain sectors of the economy which face difficult adjustment processes."
"More immediately, most member countries have undertaken - or are currently considering - short-term measures in response to the recent surge in energy prices."
"In line with the European Council conclusions, most of these policies focus on vulnerable households."
"Some Member States have also implemented or discussed temporary measures targeted at specific sectors."
"As high energy prices are expected to prevail in the long term, it is essential that the policy measures aim at facilitating the structural shift to more sustainable patterns of production, transport and consumption."
"This also points to the significance of flexible product and labour markets and the Lisbon agenda, and to the importance of the transition towards a low-carbon and highly energy-efficient economy."
"But I believe there is clearly not one answer to these issues."
"Still, the framework that we propose with the energy and climate change package and the internal energy market package is a backbone, because, the sooner it is adopted, the stronger we will be, and also there will be more competition and lower prices for consumers."
"At the same time we should be open and honest and say to the people: do not expect oil prices to come back to USD 20 per barrel."
"That means each of us also should change our behaviour, because part of the issue is also our behaviour, and I believe that we should really pay true attention in our everyday lives."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (PL) Mr President, we are confronted by two different problems."
"The first relates to the price of oil and gas."
"The Union imports most of the aforementioned resources."
"The second relates to the price of electrical energy."
"Regarding the first point, I should like to say that oil and gas prices could fall, if the producers, not just the consumers, become subject to market forces."
"This is a subject for our negotiations as a Union with Russia, the North African countries and OPEC."
"We must also significantly improve energy efficiency and energy saving."
"It is our duty to do so and we should give priority to this task."
"We have been discussing it for a long time now."
"Obviously, we must also develop the use of renewable energy, as it exploits our indigenous resources."
"It will certainly not suffice for our purposes, however."
"That leaves us with our coal and our nuclear energy."
"If we wish to forestall drastic price increases, we cannot afford to disregard either of these two energy sources."
"This leads on to the second point, namely electrical energy."
"The cost of electricity could be reduced through a determined effort to create a common European market in energy."
"Swift implementation of the third energy package is needed."
"We can also control electricity prices through sensible and gradual implementation of the energy and climate change package."
"This is particularly important for the electrical energy sector."
"In connection with the latter, it is important to consider benchmarking or phase-in arrangements in the directive on the emissions trading scheme."
"I should like to thank the Commission for undertaking such hard work on these matters, and the authors of the resolution for raising the subject."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, on 2 January 2008 Richard Arens, who is a trader at Nymex, offered USD 100 000 for a consignment of one thousand barrels of oil."
"The price of a barrel of oil had reached USD 100 for the first time."
"The trader laid out some USD 5 000 for this transaction."
"He sold it on immediately and in doing so accepted a loss of USD 800."
"It was a small loss that he fittingly celebrated with his colleagues as being the first to break the psychological barrier of USD 100 a barrel."
"New York traders were frequently to celebrate new records in the months that followed."
"On 14 July oil reached USD 148 a barrel."
"Even if prices are now falling again the damage has been done."
"The explosion in oil prices has triggered an orgy of speculation in raw materials, including foodstuffs."
"The global economy cannot do without markets, but it is unacceptable for the financial world to be indulging in wild commercial gambles more worthy of a gaming casino."
"With a lever of a mere USD 5 000 the New York trader had succeeded in triggering a wave of speculation on oil that was to wreak havoc throughout the world economy."
"The stock-market authorities finally put the brakes on this unadulterated speculation by prohibiting traders, at least temporarily, from selling shares they did not hold, a process known as 'naked short selling'."
"If we are to curb this unhealthy practice it is not temporary rules that we need but absolutely strict regulations."
"We therefore have to be more consistent in the way we control the gambles being made by the speculators."
"The US Senate is now debating a proposal aimed at increasing to a minimum of 25% the actual stake being put up by traders for each transaction."
"This would prevent many of the risky gambles that at the moment are based on nothing more than small change."
"The amount of money invested in the US raw materials market alone has increased tenfold in the course of the last four years."
"The price index for the 25 main commodities has exploded by more than 200%."
"Price levels are no longer being determined by physical supply and effective demand for raw materials but by the speculative mechanisms of the financial markets."
"During the first six months of this year 60% of the deals being done on the American oil market were for virtual oil that was repeatedly sold and re-sold."
"The stock exchange is no longer being used as a means for adjusting the complex interplay between available supply and actual demand but has become a venue where bets are being placed on financial products whose complexity is even too much for those in charge of the finance companies to understand."
"The only thing that matters to the traders and their bosses is the bonus."
"All these 'golden boys' from this global casino have pocketed millions while losing billions belonging to their clients."
"The profits were cashed in while the losses have now been nationalised."
"American taxpayers are going to have to fork out more than USD 1 000 billion to pay off the bad credits of the financial world."
"This is equivalent to seven times the total EU budget."
"In Europe, too, purchasing power is down, credit has become more expensive and recession is looming."
"The Commission and the national governments have always refused to introduce too much regulation to the financial markets, which were renowned for their efficiency."
"However, with the total demise of these financial geniuses the public authorities now have to act quickly by imposing stricter rules and by introducing effective measures to prevent the wild speculation running through the markets, including the oil market."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - Mr President, I welcome the fact that this debate is encompassing all energy prices, and not just that of oil - which of course is a major concern."
"Over the past year it is not only oil that has experienced a price shock: the cost of coal and gas is rising just as fast as oil, if not faster."
"As is always the case, the consumers are the worst affected."
"Spikes in energy prices put huge pressure on the budget of the average consumer."
"As representatives of the people at policy level, it is up to us to implement policies that will ensure a sustainable fuel supply at a reasonable price."
"How can we achieve this as fuel wells' supplies approach depletion?"
"We should be concentrating to an even greater degree on renewable energy and resources."
"We should increase study of, and investment in, alternative fuel sources."
"This is by no means a new idea, yet to date we have not done enough in this regard."
"We have a duty to the European people, and for the sake of our environment, to turn our words into actions."
"Environmental protection and consumer financial welfare are not mutually exclusive goals."
"By spending more money, time and resources on the area of renewable energy, we can achieve them both and can ensure a sustainable supply of energy for the future."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Goebbels is quite right that there is massive speculation in oil prices, and indeed Mr Borloo and Mr Piebalgs have said the same."
"The Greens, the Socialists and the United Left have all tabled amendments aimed at ensuring that our resolution takes this issue into account and those on the Right who today applauded the idea of measures to combat wild speculation in the oil market - and I am delighted about that - will, I hope, be voting for our amendments tomorrow."
"It would be ridiculous if this House were to vote for a resolution that did not deal with the subject of excessive speculation in the oil markets."
"The second important matter is the social aspect."
"We have to help the poorest members of our society to overcome this situation."
"I for my part would recommend targeted aid."
"It would be better to give poorer households EUR 100 than to float so-called good ideas such as reducing VAT."
"This notion, so dear to Mr Sarkozy, will clearly be rejected tomorrow by Parliament, for we would rather side with Mr Borloo, who is for encouraging the bonus-malus system, by giving citizens access to services and appliances that consume less energy."
"Let me just make two final remarks."
"Firstly, we shall only be able to deal with the issue of the allocation fund by making progress in the area of energy management and renewables management."
"I would therefore ask the Commissioner if the Commission is once again set on looking foolish by presenting a strategy document on energy and energy security that fails to deal with the issue of transportation?"
"In all the drafts that I have seen there is no mention of transportation."
"This is ridiculous, for Europe is most heavily reliant on oil, not on gas, and there is nothing about this in your documents."
"Now a final remark to Mr Borloo: today Coreper discussed renewable energies and I for my part no longer comprehend the French Presidency."
"You are undermining things with the rendez-vous clause, including the 20% target."
"Thankfully, this proposal was today rejected by the majority of the Member States."
"I would therefore appeal directly to the French Presidency: stop jeopardising this directive, for it is a very important document."
"(SK) Europe has a great opportunity to influence energy prices by achieving sufficient production of its own energy based on resources other than oil and gas."
"Is Europe going down this route, however?"
"In the 1980s, Slovakia and Hungary began the joint construction of the Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros hydroelectric power plant."
"Hungary subsequently withdrew from the project and Slovakia completed the hydroelectric power plant alone."
"Rather than the production of peak energy, the consequence was an international arbitration dispute, the results of which, however, have been ignored by Hungary."
"In the 1990s, Slovakia invested significant resources in improving the safety and extending the service life of the Jaslovské Bohunice nuclear power plant."
"The International Atomic Energy Commission confirmed that the safety standards were satisfied."
"As part of the process of accession to the European Union, however, Slovakia was obliged to close two reactors at the power plant prematurely."
"The European Commission is currently considering the matter of the construction of two additional reactors at the Mochovce nuclear power plant."
"The first two reactors are already operating safely and efficiently."
"The European Commission, however, is taking its time in producing a response."
"The example of Slovakia shows that the aim of increasing our own production and thus controlling energy prices in Europe is still a long way away."
"(EL) Mr President, the rise in oil prices this year is a major scandal, which hits the lowest-income households in Europe."
"It demands answers in terms of policy because, as well as adjusting to a green economy, a policy for pipelines, and an energy package policy, we must resolve the fight against the oil cartels without fail."
"There are currently two oil cartels operating at the expense of European citizens."
"One is the international oil cartel, which we do not address in one voice - or any voice at all - because when OPEC acts, it feels under no pressure from the EU to refrain from doing so."
"There is a second cartel, within the European market itself, Commissioner; your fellow Commissioner responsible for Competition is still observing it without interfering."
"I think that beyond the profiteering issue that Mr Goebbels has quite rightly raised, we have to deal with a lack of transparency in the internal market for petroleum products."
"This is a shining opportunity for the European Commission's Directorate General for Competition, from which we expect some action in the interests of citizens, as, if I am not mistaken, competition policy remains a Community responsibility."
"If, then, we have difficulties with OPEC, let us implement competition policy within the EU."
"Mr President, there are going to be radical changes in the way the EU produces and consumes its energy."
"This has been based on a three-pronged strategy by the Commission: security of supply, sustainability and competitiveness."
"But the Commission left out a fundamental part of this important debate, namely the issue of affordability."
"Since the publication of the Green Paper on energy, Socialists in this Parliament have been asking for consumers to be put right back into the driving seat."
"We want to see energy poverty as a part of this debate."
"So far in the EU there are no national definitions and there is no data collection, so we have no idea of the scale of this problem."
"We know that energy prices have been rising exponentially and they are hitting the most vulnerable in our society the hardest."
"I would like to give fair warning to the Council that, in the negotiations on the electricity and gas directives that we are about to begin, the issue of energy poverty will be fundamental to our agreement."
"We are not going to step on your toes."
"We are asking for domestic action on this - not Community action - but we do expect action for the poorest people in the EU on energy poverty."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would venture to suggest that one cannot possibly say how to curb rising energy prices in just over one minute."
"Let us try to sum up the situation: first of all we need national social policies in favour of the most vulnerable groups and small businesses, such as fishermen, but also public authorities."
"I am therefore in favour of targeted social measures, as Mr Turmes said."
"Next, we need a different policy towards producer cartels and countries, as Mr Buzek and perhaps others have said."
"This is without doubt essential."
"I also wish to stress another aspect on which we often draw a blank."
"It is the question of excise duty."
"If the maximum price governments could charge for fuel were capped, excise duty would automatically be adjusted to this ceiling without infringing either fiscal subsidiarity or the laws on free competition."
"Why not consider this idea?"
"It seems to me that Mr Piebalgs was implying that he favoured something similar."
"Generally speaking, in my view, we need a strategy which rewards those who consume less and penalises those who consume more: in other words, a strategy which rewards energy efficiency."
"However, we also need measures to clamp down on speculation, which do not exist as yet, and a two-way adjustment of retail prices and production costs."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the trend in energy prices is throttling the economy and eroding the purchasing power of families, who are seeing energy bills rise relentlessly."
"In this new context the link between energy prices and foreign policy, and hence the increased political clout of producer countries, is obvious."
"Clearly, Europe must pursue a short strategy based on speeding up the use of renewable energy sources, the promotion of and search for new methods of exploiting natural, clean energy, and the building of new pipelines."
"Therefore it is also necessary to increase our oil and gas reserves."
"All of this is not enough; new initiatives are required."
"I would emphasise the two proposals made by Prime Minister Berlusconi in recent weeks: a coming-together of all energy-purchasing countries and hence the setting of a maximum price; and the launch of a major plan for nuclear power stations."
"Can the Commission respond to these two proposals, Commissioner?"
"Furthermore, when elucidating its strategies for mapping out a different future in terms of supplies, can you tell us whether - as far as you know - financial speculation is taking place, and what the Commission intends to do about it?"
"(FI) Mr President, this resolution is important and we have our own basic view of it."
"This situation is as stormy as the Bermuda Triangle, and dependence, climate problems and prices that the poor just cannot pay are making the sea churn - not to forget the speculators and the price of food."
"Saving energy is necessary and the most effective solution; that we know."
"The carbon footprint of the poor, however, is tiny compared to the rich, who have no intention of actually reducing it but are ready simply to pay more."
"Should we in this situation therefore introduce legislation on energy taxation that is progressive?"
"Those who can afford to pay would pay relatively more for energy."
"Or should we impose a higher price on goods that consume a lot of energy or services that waste it?"
"The speculators must obviously be brought under control."
"We speak of sustainable development: its heroes are the energy-poor and their situation needs to be organised sustainably."
"That is our basic view."
"Mr President, among the projects that the EU has encouraged is the single electricity market on the island of Ireland."
"Can the Commission explain why it is not working for consumers in Northern Ireland and why, instead of stability and price savings, we have seen a massive 52% hike since January of this year and an ever-widening gap with prices prevailing in the rest of the United Kingdom, where in the same period the price rise was 29%?"
"Big in itself, but a lot less than 52%."
"Will the Commission investigate the failure of this scheme to deliver the promise of Minister Dodds, when he launched it, of efficiency savings and enhanced competition to help minimise the wholesale cost of electricity, with the vast bulk of the benefits, he said, going to the consumer?"
"For my constituents, less than a year on, that rings very hollow indeed."
"In particular, will the Commission investigate the contribution to the non-delivery of the single electricity market of the failure adequately to address the dominance of the ESB in the southern market and the resulting lack of competition, which of course is the imperative to success in any single electricity market?"
"Mr President, we always talk about renewable energy when we talk about prices."
"Well, we know that it is going to cost us an arm and a leg and so financial responsibility regarding energy prices often has gone with the wind."
"What about this 80%?"
"What about meeting the needs of tomorrow's increasing energy consumption?"
"Look at Nord Stream."
"We are just talking about the environmental standards regarding Nord Stream."
"Well, that is a little bit like looking at the standards of the rope that is a noose around your neck, because Nord Stream and such projects are reducing our energy independence when we have to increase our independence."
"So, what are we going to do?"
"The only really responsible answer is the nuclear one: it is independent, it is cheap, it is competitive and the price is foreseeable - it is also emission-free and Russia-free."
"(BG) Mr President, Commissioner, in the conditions of growing energy prices it is especially important to ensure more transparency in respect of price formation."
"Common rules have to be regulated for the development of a single European energy market."
"This will provide greater security for new investments in the energy sector and in electricity and gas transmission networks."
"It is precisely the third energy package that must be adopted as soon as possible, and the role of the Commission and the Council in this respect is particularly significant."
"The package strengthens the rights and independence of energy regulators, and harmonises their activities through the newly established agency."
"It is also necessary to pay particular attention to the notion of ""energy poverty” and to the national definition of this notion, among other things in order to ensure, through the mechanism of public services of general interest, a minimum amount of energy in winter for people below the poverty threshold."
"I believe that the problem of high energy prices could also be brought under control by an adequate energy policy, intended to offer incentives to energy efficiency, renewable energy sources and environment-sparing products."
"We will consider with interest the proposal on the matter of energy efficiency that Commissioner Piebalgs discussed in his statement."
"(RO) According to research, at least 20% of the energy consumed in the EU is wasted."
"We should stress that households have an energy-saving potential of nearly 30%, which means that one third of the energy currently consumed by apartment buildings can be saved."
"A handy solution is the heating rehabilitation of houses, but this solution is unjustly ignored and underfunded by the European Union."
"In Romania, for instance, rehabilitation would lead to savings in excess of 600 000 tonnes of oil equivalent every year."
"I believe that the European Parliament should support the increase by at least 10% of the EU funding that can be allocated to improving household heating efficiency."
"This is a concrete, convenient and sustainable solution to the problems caused to citizens by the increasing price of energy."
"Mr President, I would like to speak about only one aspect of energy prices, namely the price of district heating."
"In Hungary, hundreds of thousands of households use district heating - mostly families with modest incomes - and its price is a crucial social issue."
"However, due to the run-down infrastructure and for other technical reasons, district heating is far more expensive than individual heating."
"This contradicts common sense and the basic interests of the environment."
"That is why, whenever I can, I urge the Commission and the Council to provide financial support to improve district-heating systems in order to make it socially acceptable and environmentally efficient."
"As long as district heating is more expensive in some Member States than individual heating, it is nonsense to speak about energy efficiency."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the European Commission has unveiled a package of measures for the safety and security of nuclear power plants."
"Will you ensure that this package is now finally put on the agenda of the Council working group so that it can become a success for the French Council Presidency?"
"I would like to ask Commissioner Piebalgs whether it would be possible to talk to Commissioner Kovács to see whether we could get some incentives and opportunities to write off investment in the energy sector, so that the profits can be invested sensibly."
"This could also drive down prices."
"(LT) In order to solve our energy problems, it is essential to have a common energy policy with foreign policy aspects."
"We have to establish the internal market."
"The third energy package forms the basis of this."
"However, the directive itself is not the answer."
"We need financial input and the creation of proper links in the sphere of both gas and electricity."
"This would guarantee our energy security."
"With regard to the external aspect, the European Union, like the WTO, should speak unanimously."
"The Commission should have the power to negotiate energy prices."
"This should not be a matter for every individual state to speak about; we should negotiate this subject jointly as one major world market participant."
"We should take a wider view of who our energy suppliers are."
"Are we not building gas pipelines that could potentially have no gas, as is suspected with Nord Stream?"
"Do we view the Arctic as a potential energy source?"
"I would also like to point out the importance of short-term measures."
"Here I am thinking of talks with the OPEC countries and the issue of value added tax."
"Mr President, during this debate colleagues from the Socialist and Green benches have referred to speculation and how unacceptable that is in terms of energy prices, and I agree with them."
"I would ask them also to reflect on the political context of energy pricing, and in particular on the career of former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, currently employed by Gazprom, who quite clearly is pursuing an interest which is nuclear-free, but as Ari Vatanen has reminded us, is not free of Russian politics."
"I should like to ask the Council if it could explain in its reply the route map towards achieving a common energy policy in the EU, giving the timescale."
"And I should like to ask the Commissioner whether he has produced a table for the Council of relative costings of oil and gas, for example from Russia, as opposed to liquefied natural gas from Qatar, nuclear energy, and all the others, because it seems to me that our governments are not actually producing energy at the prices that the consumers would want."
"They are pursuing their own political interests."
"Mr President, here are three pieces of information."
"I really think that the era of producing energy in one place and then transporting it and selling it all around the world has taken us into a territorial situation that for good reason has become part of the global financial crisis, for there is rainfall that is beneficial and then there is flooding."
"When we suddenly have too much rain in a place that cannot absorb it we call it a flood and a disaster, and this results in a stream of by-products and in all this accumulated money supply being managed in an unreal way."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, energy is the subject of the century."
"I have listened to Mr Goebbels speaking just now and I was struck by the emotive tone of his contribution."
"I am of the view that we not only have to reduce our consumption levels but also localise it in a way that removes our dependence on the type of energy involved."
"This will also create problems, as is the case with coal, which is a localised resource and one that has to be taken into account."
"We also need to localise speculation, we need to limit it and we need to combat it."
"The EU-OPEC meeting one and a half months ago proposed calling in specialists to carry out a major review in an attempt to understand what has been happening from a short-term perspective in various market sectors."
"Then we have the matter of long-term anticipation."
"The only response as far as anticipation is concerned is to abide by what was decided at Jeddah, namely that Europe, which means every country in Europe and Europe as a whole, has to move towards energy efficiency and reduced consumption."
"If we give up six to nine billion, and if we follow this model, then the anticipators will clearly always be right."
"The question may arise, Commissioner, about a certain course of action, about increasing the global financing for various areas of research."
"As for energy efficiency, that is a subject to which we will certainly be returning."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I really would like to reassure you that oil prices will go down."
"But I would like to draw attention to the issues that somehow we have underestimated."
"Oil markets have ensured the physical delivery of oil, gas markets are delivering physical supplies of gas and coal markets deliver coal."
"That means that the interaction between financial markets and oil markets can work."
"In other words we do not need to question the market, but we need to change the way we produce and consume energy inside the European Union."
"This is the real answer, because we cannot expect the market to become easier."
"There is growth."
"If growth is there, then there is more demand for energy resources, and none of the existing energy resources are in such quantities that we can say easy access is guaranteed."
"So for this we need a paradigm shift, we need to really invest in energy efficiency, renewables, research and development: a new investment."
"But for this we need money, coming from both private investors and public investors."
"So we should be able to do this only if there is a really functioning market."
"A really functioning market means that everybody pays the real price to cover not only the cost but also the interest on investment."
"What we need to concentrate on - and there is EU existing legislation on this - is public service obligations that apply to households or small and medium-sized enterprises that really need it."
"But we should not deviate from this course."
"I believe - and I have said it again and again - that the proposals made in the second package are crucial to making this change, and for this to be strengthened we will add a couple of elements in the second strategic energy review under the headings: infrastructure needs and diversification of energy supplies, external energy relations, oil and gas stocks and crisis mechanisms, energy efficiency and making the best use of the EU's indigenous energy sources."
"We are on the right track."
"We do not need to deviate and believe that there is a magic solution that will bring prices down immediately."
"But, if we follow this path, we can really guarantee that already in this generation we will have efficient, affordable, clean energy."
"If we are slow in changing the energy sector, then not only will we suffer but also the next generations will suffer."
"So we are at this critical stage and, as the Minister said, energy is this century's main issue."
"It is a main issue, but the public perception is not always there."
"The belief is that we have this silver bullet which will change everything."
"We should continue on the path we have started with Parliament, and I believe it is consistency that matters, and I very much hope that the proposed legal proposals will be adopted during this Parliament."
"It is crucial: this is the best response to the rising oil prices."
"I have received six motions for a resolution pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (PT) We recently saw an unprecedented rise in fuel prices."
"This mainly resulted from speculation engaged in by companies which have made very high profits from the speculative valuation of oil stocks purchased at lower prices."
"This scandalous rise in prices has worsened the living conditions of the general population, particularly the economically weaker sections of society, and has had a devastating impact on economic activity in various sectors, such as transport and other services, industry, agriculture and fisheries."
"However, despite a significant fall in the price of crude oil, in some countries high prices are being maintained and the victims are the consumers."
"This should prompt the creation of a tax, by each Member State, imposed solely on extraordinary and speculative profits in order to bring these into the State coffers, which can then help to support the sectors and people most affected by the situation."
"However, the main changes should be structural, with a halt to the liberalisation of the energy sector, bearing in mind that this is a strategic sector for development."
"As a result, this should be nationalised in order to guarantee public policies that serve national interests and the population as a whole."
"in writing. - How appropriate that the European Parliament is debating energy prices just as the summer ends."
"Many of my constituents are already watching the thermometer with a real sense of dread."
"Falling temperatures mean that they have to calculate whether they can justify switching on the oh-so-expensive heating."
"The day the bill for a household's gas or electricity is expected is anticipated with dread."
"It is not just the poorest families who have to make the decision of which essential purchases they will have to do without this autumn and winter in order to keep themselves warm."
"Households with small children or elderly residents are especially hard hit."
"They have the most limited budgets and at the same time the greatest requirement for energy."
"Any action taken which alleviates the burden of energy costs placed on the most venerable in society gets my wholehearted support."
"In the civilised heart of Europe, in the 21st century a warm home cannot be treated as a luxury item."
"in writing. - (HU) In recent months, right before our eyes, energy prices have risen as never before."
"The soaring costs of energy consumption may have extremely harmful consequences for Europe's competitiveness."
"Furthermore, the process has a severe impact on the most defenceless layers of society."
"The problem is made even greater by the fact that some countries subordinate the reserves of raw materials available to them to political goals."
"For these reasons, the increase in energy prices has become one of the most sensitive political questions."
"Although not a single Member State can pull itself out from under the impact of price increases, some countries are in a particularly defenceless situation."
"Thanks to drifting, erroneous government policy, Hungarian consumers have been forced to bear an increase in gas prices four times in 2008 alone."
"For this very reason, the increase in energy prices has become one of the most important sources of social dissatisfaction in Hungary."
"Coordinated, consistent action is needed in order for prices to remain manageable."
"Everything must be done to ensure that the system of long-term international agreements that define energy supply is transparent."
"Furthermore, competition must be tightened up both at Community and Member State level, together with measures aiming for an improvement in energy efficiency."
"The European Union must take real steps in order to make a firm stand, primarily through building alternative energy transport routes."
"At the same time, we feel it is appropriate to coordinate measures aiming to protect the most defenceless."
"We feel that the increase in electricity prices may not combine with an exacerbation of social differences."
"in writing. - (ET) It is essential that this coming winter the Governments of the Member States do everything possible to support individuals for whom the rise in energy prices may be too much."
"Price rises of up to 30-40 per cent are also forecast in Estonia."
"I am especially worried about the impact which rising energy prices may have on those on low incomes, the poor and vulnerable groups."
"I agree one hundred per cent that the Member States must take adequate measures to guarantee affordable energy prices."
"These include dedicated income support and abatements, and incentives to improve the energy efficiency of domestic households."
"I am also convinced that the Member States should compile action plans to combat energy poverty."
"There is above all a need to define 'energy poverty'."
"Definition of the concept would help focus attention on the objectives."
"We must lift everyone out of fuel poverty!"
"Unlike for example in Great Britain, at home, in Estonia, the term 'energy poverty' is very strange."
"It is a typical example of Euro-jargon which, whether intentionally or not, is creeping into use."
"Behind it, however, is a very interesting idea with which the authors of legislation must familiarise themselves."
"Dedicated support for the elderly, large families and the disabled along the lines of 'winter fuel payments' or 'cold weather payments' in Great Britain play an important role."
"Measures such as these are, in my view, a magnificent example to others."
"There is much talk of savings but little action, although action would be the quickest way of changing anything."
"The better insulated and energy-efficient our homes, the less we will have to spend on maintaining the temperature inside them."
"The savings would be large because in Estonia, for example, buildings absorb 40% of primary energy."
"But on this point we must not rely on leaving things to the initiative of each person feeling the cold."
"Question Time (Commission)"
"The next item is Question Time (B6-0462/2008)."
"The following questions are addressed to the Commission."
"Part one"
"Subject: Eurozone budget deficit limits"
"Under the rules of the European Union's Stability and Growth Pact, eurozone countries should remain inside a budget deficit limit of 3% of GDP."
"Can the Commission provide an up-to-date assessment of current adherence to the rules?"
"Does the Commission consider current fiscal rules to be flexible enough to allow governments to react to economic trouble but strict enough to ensure the sustainability of public finances?"
"What, if any, are the circumstances in which eurozone countries may be permitted to exceed the 3% budget deficit?"
"Member of the Commission. - The subject of the first question is covered in detail in the Commission's 2008 report on public finances in the EMU."
"The only significant budgetary development which is not covered there is the recent launch of the excessive-deficit procedure for the United Kingdom."
"Given that the budget deficit in the UK is expected by the Commission to exceed the 3% reference value in both fiscal years 2008-2009 and 2009-2010, in accordance with Article 104(6) of the Treaty, the Council has decided this year that an excessive deficit does exist in the United Kingdom."
"On the same occasion, in accordance with Article 104(7) of the Treaty, the Council set a deadline of one year for the correction of this excessive deficit."
"More generally, in line with its mandate under the Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact, the Commission is continuously monitoring the economic and budgetary development in Member States and stands ready to activate the instruments of budgetary surveillance where necessary."
"The answer to the second question is positive, particularly with reference to the corrective arm."
"Since the 2005 reform, excessive deficits have been corrected, with currently only the UK and Hungary subject to the excessive-deficit procedure."
"Overall, in 2007 the euro area recorded its lowest structural fiscal deficit since 1973."
"Nevertheless, the application of the preventive arm has sometimes been uneven."
"So, in the April 2007 Berlin Declaration, the euro-area Finance Ministers committed themselves to reaching their medium-term budgetary objectives by 2010 at the latest."
"In principle this commitment was reiterated this year."
"At the same time, the 2005 reform introduced enough economic rationale into the pact to be able to react flexibly to serious disturbances where necessary, in particular through the revised flexibility clause and the incorporation of implicit liabilities in MTOs."
"The functioning of the revised pact is well documented in the Commission reports on public finances in the EMU of 2006, 2007 and 2008 and in the accompanying communication."
"In this year's report, the methodology proposed for incorporating implicit liabilities in the MTOs of the preventive arm is also presented."
"Regarding the third question, according to the reformed Stability and Growth Pact, only under tightly constrained circumstances are budget deficits in EU Member States permitted to exceed the 3% reference value without resulting in the existence of excessive deficit."
"In particular, these deficits will always have to be close and also temporary."
"In addition, either the excess over the reference value must be exceptional, and/or it must include a deficit occurring under circumstances of severe economic downturn, which is defined as negative growth or accumulated loss of output."
"If the deficit is close and temporary, various other element factors always need to be taken into account, but this must happen in a very balanced way."
"Other relevant factors include, for instance, growth-enhancing expenditure on research and development."
"However, a direct deduction of any spending items from the deficit is excluded."
"Finally, in any event, an annual structural fiscal improvement of the order of 0.5% of GDP as a benchmark must be delivered."
"I will take time to digest the detail in your answer."
"You mentioned in particular the UK."
"I have an interest, obviously, in the Irish situation and we are expecting a tough budget in Ireland in a number of weeks."
"I would like you to comment if you will on the conversations you have had with the Irish Minister about our deficit and, indeed, whether we will exceed and what impact that will have from an EU perspective."
"Member of the Commission. - Well, we always follow facts."
"Any conversation between my colleague Joaquín Almunia and Irish colleagues is for more information, but we analyse the facts and figures at the end of the year."
"That is why, unfortunately, I cannot answer this question, but it is very understandable."
"As I said today, we have excessive-budget procedures against the UK and Hungary."
"Does the Commission accept that under the Treaty - as opposed to the Stability Pact - the 3% is not a limit, it is a reference value?"
"The Commission's report on any Member State that exceeds that reference value has to take account - and I quote Article 104(3) of the Treaty - 'of all other relevant factors including the medium-term economic and budgetary position of the Member States'."
"Does he not think that in the last few days and weeks the economic positions of Member States have necessarily changed, and perhaps warrant an extra degree of flexibility?"
"Member of the Commission. - I think we have a rather good track record when we start the procedures."
"Three per cent is a threshold that we really looked at."
"If it is exceeded, then, in very exceptional circumstances, we will not start the procedures."
"So, basically, 3% is the threshold that we are looking at, and I think we will follow the procedures we have always followed."
"We will not change the goalposts, even in the current situation."
"Subject: Mortgage crisis and financial regulations"
"During the spring, there were further economic problems and strains in the global financial markets, caused particularly by the spreading mortgage crisis. With both Fannie Mae and Freddy Mac now receiving capital injections from the US State, the mortgage market is rocking on its foundations."
"I was in Washington in July and met a number of Senators who believed that the bottom of the mortgage crisis had not yet been reached and this would not happen before 2010."
"How long does the Commission think the financial crisis will continue?"
"What does the Commission think of the signal sent to the market by the USA bailing out companies in financial straits, even though these are not generally protected by the State - first Bear Stearns and now Fannie May and Freddy Mac?"
"Finally, what does the Commission think of the current and upcoming reviews of existing legislation such as Lamfalussy and the Capital Requirements Directive, given the major risk nowadays of the changes spilling over and damaging the competitiveness of the European financial market?"
"Member of the Commission. - International financial markets have now been in turmoil for about one year and the interaction between accumulating losses in the financial system and the deteriorating global economic outlook make it very difficult to predict when the turmoil will end."
"The current situation in financial markets illustrates how the problem that seemed initially limited to a specific market segment, for the United States and sub-prime mortgages, can rapidly affect the international financial system as a whole."
"As losses linked to the US sub-prime mortgages have spread via interconnected markets and complex financial products, several key credit markets have been disrupted."
"Problems in the functioning of these markets have been felt, though, most severely within the banking sector, where substantial losses have been incurred and market liquidity shortages have required support by central banks."
"Nevertheless, a number of financial institutions in the United States and in Europe have been rescued from insolvency after experiencing serious difficulty in accessing liquidity."
"These public sector interventions have reflected concerns about risks to financial stability and have been met by a generally positive response from financial markets."
"In the United States, as a consequence of the mis-selling of sub-prime mortgages in the past, reset of these mortgage contracts is expected to continue until mid-2009."
"Problems in the international financial market remain acute - you have already discussed these issues today - driven partly by developments in the financial sector itself and partly by the implications of the deteriorating economic environment."
"Uncertainty about the ultimate scale and location of credit losses continues to undermine investor confidence, and the total losses so far disclosed by banks remain well below estimates for overall losses across the financial system based on various projections of future mortgage losses."
"Banks are increasingly forced to recapitalise, often at high cost and in difficult market conditions."
"Moreover, problems in the banking sector are increasingly reflected in tightening lending standards and reduced bank lending activity."
"The implied higher financing costs and the reduced access to credit are likely to interact with other headwinds, such as high oil prices and rising inflation, facing the global economy."
"On this basis, the economic outlook for the EU and the euro area economy has further deteriorated since the Commission's spring 2008 forecast."
"Economic prospects vary across the Member States."
"As economic conditions deteriorate, the pressure on bank balance sheets is set to continue."
"Fragile market conditions require continued vigilance from public authorities, notably central banks, supervisors and finance ministers, to monitor market developments."
"The need for further interventions in the case of systemic crisis cannot be ruled out."
"In a broader context, concrete actions to address weaknesses in the framework for financial markets are being addressed."
"Further to the Economic and Financial Affairs Council discussion in October 2007, a road map of regulatory actions has been adopted."
"While this road map applies only to the EU, it is consistent with corresponding initiatives at a global level."
"The objectives of the road map are to enhance transparency, address valuation issues, strengthen prudential supervision of banks and examine structural market issues by analysing relevant weaknesses in the regulatory framework and formulating appropriate policy responses."
"The Commission is currently working to ensure that this road map is delivered on time, including concrete initiatives on enhancing transparency for investors, markets and regulators, revised capital requirements for banks and the regulation of credit-rating agencies."
"In this respect the Commission has completed its external consultation on proposed changes to the Capital Requirements Directive and intends to come forward with a proposal during the coming months."
"It is also considering legislation on credit-rating agencies."
"In this context, a public consultation was launched at the end of July 2008."
"Progress has also been achieved with regard to supervisory cooperation across borders within the EU with the entry into force of a new memorandum of understanding at the beginning of July 2008."
"More generally, one of the aims of the Lamfalussy review is the improvement of the new supervisory arrangement where the Commission plans, for instance, to revise the decisions on the EU committees of supervisors."
"In all its efforts, the Commission is well aware of the global dimension of the required response and in this respect we are coordinating our responses with our partners."
"Sometimes a question flies away, and this is perhaps a bit obsolete, I must admit, but I thank the Commission for giving such a fair answer."
"My appeal, and my worry, is that we are over-reacting, and I hope the Commission could consider that."
"I agree that we should act and react, but we should not overdo it, because we need a balanced approach."
"Otherwise - and I think that is something we should consider in the long term - we could harm growth in Europe."
"So, I think, a balanced approach; and I rely on the Commission to ensure these measures are implemented in an appropriate way."
"Member of the Commission. - I think the Commission is really balanced."
"We have had one hour of debate when a lot of Members of Parliament called for very hasty action, but the Commission is really taking a balanced approach."
"(LT) Today we held a discussion on the world financial crisis and its impact on our economy."
"One Member mentioned the fact that in her country one bank had already gone bankrupt."
"Are you aware of any imminent danger of banks going bankrupt in our countries, the EU countries?"
"(DE) I would be interested to hear about the current situation regarding real purchases as opposed to financial transactions in the energy sector."
"Does the Commission propose to indicate clearly, in the statistics, which are the real purchases of energy and what is simply being traded in the financial markets, and does it plan to adopt rules governing short sales?"
"Member of the Commission. - My country, Latvia, has plenty of banks, and definitely insolvency could happen."
"I believe that we have rather an advanced market."
"But it happens under central bank supervision, and at least there was no turmoil whatsoever on the Latvian financial markets."
"Therefore, I can assure you that the Latvian financial market is very stable and there has been no perturbation."
"But it is very important to emphasise the role bank supervision should play and that all the conditions for this supervision are fulfilled by commercial banks."
"Concerning energy purchases, if the honourable Member is agreeable, I will reply in writing because I think it is a very specific question and I would hesitate to give a concrete figure."
"Subject: Air safety"
"The recent Spanair disaster in Madrid in which many people were killed and the forced landing of a Ryanair Boeing 737 in Limoges in France, in which 26 people were injured, once again raise questions about whether the Community's arsenal of legislation and controls governing air safety is being adequately and effectively implemented."
"Regulation (EC) No. 1899/2006/ specifically lays down the obligation of airlines to carry out accident prevention and flight safety programmes and the requirements applicable to the operation of any civil aeroplane (certification, supervision, maintenance, instruments and equipment, safety, etc.)."
"Does the Commission consider that these provisions are satisfactory and adequate, or does it believe that a more stringent control framework should be established for airlines?"
"How does the Commission judge the implementation to date of Directive 2003/42/EC on occurrence reporting in civil aviation (adoption of a system of notification of accidents and serious incidents)?"
"Does it consider that the aid provided so far for control mechanisms and early warning systems in respect of airlines with a dubious safety record and for the compliance inspections carried out by the European Aviation Safety Agency in respect of the airline authorities of Member States and the data released for establishing a blacklist is satisfactory?"
"Member of the Commission. - With regard to the application of the Community rules regarding aircraft operations, the Commission has no indication of weaknesses or safety-related loopholes in the respective air safety legislation which only recently became applicable in the Community on 16 July 2008."
"The set of technical requirements for aircraft operations is constantly undergoing changes reflecting the state of scientific knowledge."
"This is achieved through constant monitoring of the performance of operators; hence, at this stage, a more stringent control framework is not deemed to be required by the Commission."
"With regard to the application of Community rules regarding occurrence reporting, the Commission is satisfied that all Member States have set up a mandatory reporting system and collect the information in national databases."
"These rules contain a system of exchange of information and provide for the dissemination of information."
"The exchange of information is still not fully operational, because it requires the agreement on individual protocols between each Member State and the Commission for the updating of the central repository in accordance with the Commission Regulation."
"The Member States and the Commission are actively working on this matter, but information is already available at national level at this stage."
"The dissemination of information is correctly implemented on the basis of the Commission Regulation of 24 September 2007."
"The implementation of the protection of information has been transposed into national legislation, but only time will enable us to judge the efficiency of these provisions, which constitute the cornerstone of good reporting culture by ensuring the necessary trust of the reporters."
"With regard to the control of airlines with a dubious safety record, the Commission can reassure the honourable Member that it is applying scrupulously the provisions of the Community rules regarding the imposition of operating bans on air carriers not complying with safety requirements."
"Today in Europe 54% of all aircraft ramp inspections concern European operators."
"That means that the Commission pays equal attention to the safety performance not only of European but also of non-European airlines."
"Thanks to its constant and close cooperation, the civil aviation authorities in Member States are stepping up the supervision of their carriers."
"The results of the ramp inspections have been a particularly successful preventive instrument to avoid air carriers being faced with operating restrictions in the Community."
"With regard to the standardisation inspection of national civil aviation authorities by EASA, the Commission should like to reassure the honourable Member that it is thanks to the close cooperation and mutual trust established between the civil authorities in the Member States and EASA that sustainable solutions are being agreed and worked out between the Agency and the inspected authorities."
"Evidence of the good cooperation is the fact that the Agency has been able to double the number of inspections since the relevant rules were adopted in 2006, and the safeguard measures imposed on a Member State at the end of that year were lifted this week."
"(EL) I am very grateful to the Commission for its answer, but I do wonder, Commissioner."
"Air accidents happen comparatively infrequently compared with flights, but they are still accidents that cause many deaths, create doubts in public opinion and undermine confidence in our policy and our inspections."
"I have not seen you propose any measures or allocate any new responsibilities or missions to the safety organisation."
"This concerns not only airlines, but also the civil agencies responsible for inspections in the Member States."
"It also concerns the blacklist: on what criteria is it based?"
"Will you support it?"
"You have not given me an answer to match the consequences of these accidents and the problems created in addition to the tragic effects on human lives."
"Member of the Commission. - I can assure you that the safety system in Europe is at the highest level."
"It is very clear that it is implemented, and we have all the measures in place."
"Unfortunately it does not prevent accidents from happening."
"I am very sorry that people have been killed, but it is not because safety levels in the EU have not been satisfactory."
"As soon as we know the results, what caused the accident, we will carry out analyses, and if there is a need to strengthen some of the measures, it will be done."
"But today I can assure you that Europe's aviation safety meets the highest standards that exist anywhere in the world."
"(DE) The situation is as follows: the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) is now being given more and more competences in order to guarantee a uniform standard of safety in Europe, and that is most welcome."
"Its competences are now being extended for a second time."
"What is not happening, however, is any budget increase for the EASA, nor are other sources of financing being identified."
"There are two options here."
"The first option is not to treat all the agencies equally."
"I would not go as far as some colleagues, who say that if some agencies ceased to operate, no one would notice."
"The EASA is different: if the EASA has no money, human lives are put at risk."
"The second option is third-party financing, which means boosting the EASA's funding through some sort of ticket-based levy."
"My question is this: which of these two options would you favour?"
"Madam President, I would also like to make a brief comment outside the agenda, if I may: I fully endorse what our fellow Member from Poland has said regarding the conduct of the sitting."
"Member of the Commission. - For any agency, my view is that direct financing through taxpayers' money is the best way because, with its own income, you can never guarantee that public service, exactly, is delivered."
"So, I believe that the best way is for the budget to finance any agency, but if there is the possibility of supplementary funds being raised, it should be evaluated."
"In any case, each budget is discussed according to the procedure and tough regulations imposed by European legislation."
"Part two"
"Subject: Safety of nuclear power plant"
"The European Union is now being faced with the immediate problem of satisfying ever- increasing energy demand."
"Given that oil and, natural gas supplies and renewable sources of energies can only meet some of this demand, the major role of nuclear energy in resolving the problem is undeniable."
"At the same time, European citizens are becoming particularly anxious about the safety of nuclear power plant and proper nuclear waste management, particularly following recent leaks of radioactive material from nuclear plant in France and Slovenia."
"It is therefore only natural that a large number of questions should arise concerning the safety of nuclear power plant in all EU countries and of the nuclear power plants to be constructed in Turkey and other Balkan countries and the guarantees provided concerning their safe operation."
"Has the Commission made a survey of the need to build nuclear power stations?"
"What are its conclusions?"
"Finally, has it calculated the extent of EU dependency on nuclear energy in the near future?"
"Member of the Commission. - The EU currently relies on nuclear energy for 30% of its electricity production, and it accounts for two thirds of the EU's carbon-free electricity."
"By 2030, energy demand in the EU is expected to grow by 20% and electricity demand by 38%."
"As a result, the share of electricity in the final energy demand would grow from 20% to 23%."
"Electricity-generation capacity is forecast to grow by 31%, but, under the PRIMES baseline assumptions studied by the Commission, the share of nuclear energy will decrease from 30% to 20% in electricity generation."
"Also, the International Energy Agency in its recently published EU energy policy review concluded that 'EU nuclear generating capacity will decline from now on unless significant investment is forthcoming in the near future for plant lifetime extensions and the replacement of facilities reaching the end of their operational lives.'"
"It is for each individual Member State to decide whether or not to rely on nuclear power for the generation of electricity and launch new projects or go ahead with a nuclear phase-out policy."
"Should the Member States decide to invest in new nuclear power generation, the Commission will exercise its available powers to ensure that the new projects in this field meet the highest standards of safety, security and non-proliferation as required by the Euratom Treaty."
"The assurance of the high level of safety, security and safeguards throughout the entire lifecycle of a nuclear installation also represents a priority in the context of EU enlargement, and in relations with third countries through the Instrument on Nuclear Safety Cooperation."
"The Commission is following the overall picture of ongoing investments in the nuclear energy sector in the EU."
"In 2007, the Commission adopted the Nuclear Illustrative Programme which provides an overview of the status of the EU nuclear sector."
"At present, the Commission is updating this Communication, as part of the Commission's overall Strategic Energy Review."
"It should be available before the end of 2008."
"In addition, the Commission launched two initiatives to further debate the future of nuclear energy and to identify requirements for its development."
"The first is the 'High Level Group on Nuclear Safety and Waste Management' focusing on identifying safety issues for priority handling and recommending actions to be taken at EU level."
"The second, the 'European Nuclear Energy Forum', intends to provide a platform for a broad and transparent stakeholder discussion on the opportunities and risks of nuclear energy."
"(EL) Madam President, Commissioner, I understand that we shall be waiting till the end of the year to see the results of these studies so that we can draw some better conclusions."
"I wanted to hear the Commissioner comment on information that has been known since last year: Russia is building a floating nuclear plant to be completed in 2010 and sent to a remote part of Russia."
"There are plans to build a further six for distribution to countries that may request them and have already expressed an interest."
"What is your comment on this, in terms of safety?"
"Member of the Commission. - Russia is also part of the International Atomic Energy Agency, and Russian nuclear technology corresponds to international standards."
"So, if any country would like to have Russian nuclear technology, there are some international rules that Russia is following."
"For the EU, Russian supply technology could be used, provided that the Commission's opinion is positive towards it and, from the standard level, Russian technology competes with other technology providers."
"So merely because it is Russian does not mean that it is less safe."
"Commissioner, I would like to ask you once more about our famous Ignalina atomic plant."
"Recently our Prime Minister met the President of the European Commission, Mr Barroso, and in our papers there were some interpretations that there is a gap; there is a possibility of prolonging the work of this station."
"What is your opinion, and what would you recommend to the Lithuanian Government in this situation?"
"(SK) Nuclear power plants and nuclear facilities are among the most closely monitored installations with regard to safety."
"The prospects for using nuclear power engineering in Slovakia, activities requiring the construction of the 3rd and 4th reactors at Mochovce, and the Slovak Republic's undertaking to shut down the reactors at Jaslovské Bohunice in 2006 and 2008 represent difficult tasks for Slovakia."
"Why, Mr Commissioner, is there such political caution on the part of the Commission as regards the construction of the nuclear power plant at Mochovce?"
"Does the Commission have real reservations about its safety?"
"Member of the Commission. - I will start with Ignalina, because I have talked about this issue many times."
"During the accession negotiations it was agreed by Lithuania and the negotiating parties - the other Member States - that because of safety concerns it should be closed by the end of 2009."
"This Treaty is primary law and it is ratified by all Member States."
"The Commission is not part of this process."
"The Commission is the guardian of the Treaty and its role is really to see that the law is being observed."
"Therefore I cannot give you any positive news about any change of position, because the Commission position is decided by the Treaty."
"What could be done?"
"I believe that in the Treaty there are also general provisions for support for Lithuania's transformations in the energy sector - an overall package, if I am not mistaken, of EUR 1.3 billion, and this should address areas that could strengthen the supply of energy resources to Lithuania, by strengthening interconnections, by financing energy efficiency measures, by financing alternative supplies."
"So that is the way to go, but, at least in my opinion, there is no way in which the Treaty could be changed, because only an intergovernmental conference and ratification can change a primary law of the European Union."
"As for Mochovce, in the Commission's opinion it is actually the same question as for Ignalina - it is not a different approach."
"But, for Mochovce, we analysed the situation, and in today's world there are particular requirements for new challenges we face."
"We have also seen not only safety but security concerns where aircraft could be used to target nuclear installations."
"The technology proposed for the new reactors did not sufficiently address this issue."
"That is why we asked the operator, together with the Slovak nuclear energy control authorities, to take some supplementary measures that would guarantee that, even if a nuclear power plant was targeted in this way, it would sustain no permanent damage."
"Subject: Investment in first generation, priority for second generation"
"The Turmes draft report (2008/0016/COD) on the proposal for a Directive on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources, currently making its way through Parliamentary committees, is reconsidering the Council and Commission biofuel and renewable energy mandatory target in transport, because second generation research and development has not attained a breakthrough."
"Is it not the case, however, that we should set out a clear regulatory policy for investors in first-generation biofuels? Why?"
"These are the very same investors in second- and third-generation research and development who will build plants which can be easily converted to the needs of second- and third-generation technology. They cannot afford not to invest in R&D for next generation plants, as their plants will become obsolete."
"Member of the Commission. - The Commission agrees with the opinion of the honourable Member that clear regulatory policy is needed for investors in first-generation biofuels in order to get to the second-generation biofuels."
"The Commission sees the first-generation biofuels as a bridge to the second-generation biofuels using lignocellulosic materials as a feedstock."
"Without a good domestic production base for first-generation biofuels, innovative and efficient products will have difficulties finding their way into the market."
"Having said this, clear regulatory policy is paramount not only to spur growth in the biofuel industry but also to avoid negative effects on the environment."
"The development of biofuels should also not be to the detriment of food security and also should not influence the prices of food."
"At the same time, there should be no doubt that the Commission wants to accelerate the development of second-generation biofuels."
"The proposed directive on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources clearly specifies that the contribution made by biofuels produced from waste, residues and non-food cellulosic material shall be considered to be twice that made by other biofuels, when counting towards national biofuels obligations."
"Further to this, Member States will also be required to report on how they have structured their support schemes in favour of second-generation biofuels."
"The EU is also providing significant support to the ongoing research to develop second-generation production techniques."
"The activities under the EU's seventh Research Framework Programme have an increased focus on second-generation biofuels and 'biomass to liquids' processes in particular."
"Research should include technically and economically based pilot studies to ensure not only an attractive economic benefit-cost ratio but also one that yields net benefits toward the Community's goals of curtailing climate change and affordable food prices for all citizens of the world."
"So Commission policy and the Commission proposal were really tailored to the need to develop second-generation biofuels, the need to use also, if necessary, those of the first generation, but in a sustainable way."
"Mr Commissioner, can I ask you why you think the European Union is losing the information battle on the advantage of strong and consistent biofuel targets, particularly in a world of more limited supply?"
"I would like to ask this in relation to biodiesel, which has the potential to make a significant contribution to enhancing the European Union's security of energy supply."
"Biodiesel can be produced in accordance with sustainability principles without endangering food supply - which you have referred to - and biodiesel is the only renewable energy where Europe holds a strong, wide leadership."
"Member of the Commission. - The Commission proposal does not discourage development of the biodiesel industry and its use in the transport sector, particularly as the refining sector very specifically suffers from a lack of diesel production in the European Union."
"So it is not that we are discouraging it, but I believe that if there is no clear sustainability requirement the damage done by one unsuccessful project will be to the detriment of the whole industry, because the focus is so strong now on biofuels that we cannot afford to have any unsuccessful projects, because that would mean the end of the whole industry."
"To explain why I feel so strongly about biofuel policy, what we have in transport is: firstly, more efficient cars - and in this House there have been some very tough debates on cars; secondly, there is modal shift, but people still prefer in a lot of cases to use the car; and the third is replacement with alternative fuels - one of the alternative fuels is biofuel, but we should take into account that it is produced on the land that could also produce food products, so that is why I believe that although this measure is positive - and it is very clearly positive - all the necessary precautions need to be taken."
"(ES) Commissioner, on the subject of biofuels, fact and fiction are often combined in a way that easily confuses the population, causing damage to research, innovation and industrial investment in this area."
"Has the Commission considered launching a Europe-wide information campaign, which must be rigorous and objective, in order to clarify this situation?"
"Indeed, the two questions could almost have been taken together, but the subliminal message, I think, in my Irish colleague's question, if I am doing justice to it, is that he would like to see - or that the legislation might favour - first-generation investment, or at least that we should not apologise for legislation favouring first-generation investment, as that leads on to second- and third-generation."
"I would come at it slightly differently, and I would like ask you through the chair, Commissioner: should not all legislation in this area, as a matter of principle, be technology-neutral?"
"Member of the Commission. - I will perhaps start with the second point."
"I think we need to be aware, from the debate on oil, that we could face a similar situation with an unpredictable growth in demand in other sectors, and food is the one that is a really basic need for people."
"So we need technology to give us a broader opportunity."
"Broader opportunity definitely comes when you use things that usually just go to waste."
"So for this purpose I believe that we clearly need to promote second-generation."
"I would say that perhaps even this is not sufficient, because there we do not have the risks."
"We need new technologies."
"It is not just that we would like to replace oil with biofuels, but that we have technology that really guarantees that we do not have this competition, or limited competition."
"That is why - even if in theory all technologies should be equal - I still believe that the second generation is worthy of particular attention."
"With regard to education, I believe that this is a broader part of education."
"There are educational programmes, because generally this is not education about biofuels but about sustainability, energy efficiency and a quite different attitude towards the environment and knowing that whatever you use is taken from somewhere and is always doing damage."
"Sometimes, in the debate on biofuels, we forget that oil is also produced and sometimes it is produced from tar sands."
"Recently some pictures have been published about where it is produced."
"It is not a farm and it is really also a challenge."
"So I believe that each of us, when using energy, should try to use it as efficiently as possible and follow the trend of using greener energy, supporting this even it if it costs a bit more."
"Subject: Biofuels"
"When determining targets for biofuels should priority not be given to biodiesel rather than bioethanol?"
"Member of the Commission. - The Commission recognises that there is greater demand in the European Union for biodiesel as a replacement for diesel fuel rather than bioethanol, which could reduce petrol consumption."
"With this in mind it can be expected that in the years to come biodiesel consumption in the EU will remain higher than that of bioethanol."
"Nevertheless, the Commission believes that it is not necessary to have technologically specific targets as both biodiesel and bioethanol can have an important role to play in reducing the oil dependence of the European transport sector."
"Having said this, it is second-generation which promotes biodiesel or bioethanol independently, but still demand in the EU market is definitely bigger for diesel."
"I do not believe that we should discriminate between ethanol and diesel, but we should encourage second-generation instead of first-generation."
"Could you comment please and give your views on the whole issue of the life-cycle sustainability for biofuels, or transport fuels generally, in relation to the Turmes report?"
"In other words, on the overall CO2 reductions from start to finish, including the production of the crop, the production method, the transport, refining and use."
"Where do you come down in the argument concerning the percentage of CO2 reduction?"
"Are you in the 40-45% or 35% camp?"
"Member of the Commission. - I would be in the 35% camp, because it is important that, if we put requirements that completely ban biofuels from the market and there is too high a risk of leverage, we will move to oil - and deeper - and perhaps to coal and liquid technology."
"In my opinion this is worse than really keeping 35% as the threshold, and a 35% threshold is clearly saving CO2."
"So I will stay with 35%."
"It is now up to negotiations with Parliament and Council: if it comes to be a different figure, well, I will live with this figure, but I think 35% is rather tough, because in the college, when the figure was discussed, we were also in different camps, and this is already compromised from the two camps: one that believes in biofuels and one that is afraid of biofuels."
"So 35% was actually the compromise."
"(SK) Madam President, today we are looking for ways forward in the field of alternative sources of energy."
"Together with my fellow Member Mr Rack, I went to New Zealand in July: I was attracted by the use of geothermal energy."
"My region, Stará Ľubovňa in Slovakia, has similar geothermal sources but developing them requires large financial resources."
"What is the Commission's stance on the use of geothermal sources for energy production?"
"(DE) I would like to raise an issue which has not yet featured in the debate to any great extent."
"Biofuels, biodiesel and bioethanol all have different efficiency values and different classifications, also in terms of their CO2 emissions."
"One issue which has not really been addressed is actual energy input in the production of these various fuels."
"Could the Commissioner comment on that?"
"Member of the Commission. - We are very positive about the development of geothermal, and I believe that the draft directive now being discussed, and the climate-energy package, will facilitate the use of renewable power, including geothermal."
"Why is it not being used now?"
"Well, partly because it is not sufficient to focus on the renewables."
"It is much easier to pass the costs of fossil fuels to the consumers, because to use renewable energy, like geothermal, you need capital investment, and for this you need a specific environment for, and focus on, renewables."
"So I believe that a renewable energy source, like geothermal, will have much better developments in the EU, not only for power production but, for example, in Copenhagen it is used for district heating."
"So there are different applications of this technology, and it will grow in the European Union."
"Concerning energy content: it is true that biofuels have a low energy content and you need bigger volumes, and I think we should not be mistaken that we will replace oil with biofuels."
"But at least here I drive a car that is powered by biofuel, and its only disadvantage is that I need to go to a service station much more often, but I do not mind this."
"That is why I would say that it is different, but not so different as to make me change my behaviour."
"That will be a problem with the electric car."
"At the moment it is very much slower, at least at this stage - city-run cars."
"Perhaps there is a need for some kind of hybrid, because if you travel a longer distance, electric vehicles might not be satisfactory - but for biofuel-driven vehicles there is no problem."
"Question No 41 was ruled inadmissible and Questions Nos 42 to 45 will be answered in writing."
"As they deal with the same subject, Questions 46, 47, 48 and 49 will be taken together:"
"Subject: Price fixing in the telecommunications sector"
"Following the regulatory action taken by the Commission seeking to rationalise roaming charges, the Commissioner responsible for the information society announced plans to cut charges for mobile data roaming services from the summer of 2009, targeting principally the disparities between SMS messaging service charges."
"What is the Commissioner's response to the telecommunications sector which is levelling charges of populism and attempted market manipulation through 'price fixing' in place of measures to create a healthy competitive environment in the telecommunications sector?"
"How will she respond to the open hostility of the telecommunications sector to the above plans?"
"Does she consider that price fixing policies should have been adopted in other sectors of the EU internal market also?"
"Subject: Lowering the price of SMSs sent or received in a different Member State (roaming)"
"The European Regulators' Group (ERG), which comprises the 27 European regulators, has been calling on the Commission for a year to cap prices for SMSs sent or received in a different Member State other than the user's state of origin."
"The Commission gave operators until July 2008 to lower the price of SMSs and the internet in the case of messages sent or received when roaming in the European Union."
"The operators have not responded, and are penalising consumers heavily."
"Can the Commission state what measures it intends to take to force operators to lower the exorbitant prices charged to consumers for SMSs and the internet when roaming within the EU and whether it plans to extend beyond 2010 the cap on mobile communications prices introduced in 2007?"
"Subject: EU Roaming Regulation"
"What has been the exact progress to date vis-à-vis the EU Roaming Regulation, and has there been success for the voluntary reduction of roaming prices for text messages and mobile data services in the mobile industry?"
"Subject: Roaming charges"
"In light of the Commission's commitment to set regulatory caps on cross-border text and data roaming fees, what steps has the Commission taken to ensure that inadvertent roaming charges do not occur for people living in and travelling to border areas of a particular country?"
"Member of the Commission. - You know that the Commission yesterday decided on a proposal for the second roaming package - this time on SMS and data roaming."
"Parliament will remember very well that this analysis of the market was done at the request of Parliament which, during the voice roaming package in June last year, put in Article 11 of the Regulation that the Commission should come back to SMS and data roaming in due course in 2008."
"That is what the Commission did, and you know that we have proposed price caps."
"That brings me to the question of price fixing."
"No, we do not fix prices."
"We fix ceilings under which operators have the flexibility to compete and to innovate, either with roaming offers below the maximum oral tariff ceilings or with other packages which customers might then chose."
"So, flexibility is given."
"As regards SMS, the evidence suggests that prices have been more or less static over the last year and remain at levels that cannot be justified by reference to the underlying cost, and the SMS market presents roughly the same problems as the market in voice roaming."
"In February this year, I went to the GSM Association World Congress in Barcelona and warned the industry."
"I spoke personally with industry leaders to tell them that they had time to bring down prices by themselves and that the deadline was 1 July."
"What we saw is that the prices between last year and this year for SMS roaming did not move at all."
"Our proposal therefore is to cap the retail charge at a maximum of 11 cents and the wholesale charge at a maximum of 4 cents."
"Turning to data roaming, we have included actions to deal with the very famous cases of bill shocks where customers have to pay several thousand euros when they come back from one or two weeks abroad, because they used their mobile phone for data downloading in the same way as at home where a data download per megabyte could cost between 5 and 15 cents."
"Abroad, it can go up to 16 euros per megabyte so you can imagine what kind of bills you can receive if you are now aware of what is happening."
"That is why we have proposed several measures."
"The first is a transparency measure to inform citizens crossing a border what data roaming will cost."
"The second is a measure where the consumer can fix, together with his operator, a ceiling over which he does not want to pay any more so that communications are then cut; and the third is because we have seen that the whole problem here comes from highly overpriced wholesale costs which one operator imposes on another."
"That is why we propose a wholesale cap at one euro per megabyte, hoping that normal price structures can then be developed and offered to consumers."
"(EL) Madam President, before submitting my supplementary question, let me congratulate Commissioner Reding on today's vote in the European Parliament in favour of the electronic communications package."
"This is yet another initiative that bears your stamp, Commissioner, like the policy you have decisively promoted on roaming charges."
"Perhaps, however, this policy on roaming risks prompting European mobile phone companies to implement a practice followed in non-European, third countries, where consumers pay not only when they make calls, but also when they receive them?"
"Firstly I would like to congratulate the Commissioner on the roaming package."
"I think it will be positive news for many EU phone users."
"My particular question referred to inadvertent roaming charges, when people are travelling close to a border - and indeed I have plenty of experience of that myself. I heard what you said about the transparency initiative, namely that, when crossing borders, users would be informed as to what the cost would be."
"That was not in reference to telephone calls, but I just want to ask if you have any initiatives in that area and, if you have not, would you consider the transparency initiative that you mentioned a few moments ago in your reply?"
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, first I would like to thank the honourable Member of Parliament for his congratulations, but I would like to pass his congratulations on to Parliament, because Parliament, in a very difficult situation with five directives on the table on very complicated matters, has done a wonderful job."
"I might not agree 100% on everything Parliament has voted, but what Parliament has done today is put the single market for telecoms on the agenda."
"Now the Council has to look at what Parliament has proposed and try to find a common way in order to make this telecom package become a reality for industry and consumers."
"With regard to the question on roaming, is there not a risk that, because we bring down prices on roaming, the operators try to raise prices in another way? We already heard last year, when we introduced the voice roaming package, that the operators would be forced to raise the national cost for voice mobiles, but what we saw was just the contrary."
"So what happened? Firstly, citizens, instead of switching off their phones when they are abroad, are now using them."
"So the volume on voice has gone up tremendously, by 34% in one year only."
"Secondly, because there is competition at national level, national prices have not risen but have gone down by 10-12%."
"The honourable Member recalls the polemics which were going on at a certain time about 'bill and keep'."
"It is up to the operators what kind of billing system they want to adopt."
"Our European way of doing it is not to use 'bill and keep'."
"That is the American way of doing it."
"I have just seen that prices in the United States are lower than prices here, and I told the operator very clearly that they should choose their business model."
"It is not for the Commissioner to do that, but they have to be on terms with their customers."
"The only thing that concerns me is that there is transparency, that prices do not go above price limits which are unacceptable, and that all European consumers can feel at home when they are travelling in Europe and when they are communicating in Europe."
"Regarding the question on inadvertent roaming: yes, we are aware of this."
"That is why we have raised this question with the national regulators, and we are monitoring this problem with the European Regulators Group."
"We will also continue to do so with the national regulators."
"We have also increased the transparency initiatives for data and SMS on the package which is now on the table in the European Parliament."
"There have already been some positive developments concerning this inadvertent roaming, for instance in Ireland, with good work done on both sides of the border."
"I think that is a positive way to see it, and I think that the operators also should be very conscious of the fact of inadvertent roaming."
"Even if it is only a very small percentage of the population which suffers as a result of this question, it is the responsibility of the operators to try to solve the problem."
"(DE) I would also like to express my congratulations on the outcome of today's vote."
"I would be interested to hear whether you have any plans to draft a work programme for BERT with agreed objectives and an agreed timetable so that we can make clear progress as regards inter-state cooperation as well."
"After all, we recently read in New Europe, the news source for Europe, that roaming has allegedly cost European consumers 30 billion euro."
"I would like to thank you for addressing the roaming issue pro-actively."
"In your view, is it also necessary to draw up an action programme for the Member States to deal with some of the tasks identified by the European Parliament?"
"Is a new institution required here?"
"(DE) Madam Commissioner, as you have heard, you have rightly been praised, and citizens applaud you, for the fact that telecoms in Europe have become cheaper, with prices likely to fall even further in future."
"In this context, I would like, if I may, to pass on a question which is often put to me."
"I am not certain whether you are responsible for this area, so I would ask you to pass it on if necessary."
"In the telecoms sphere, the Commission and the Commissioner can ensure that competition operates effectively, and that services become cheaper through caps and other measures."
"That being the case, why is this not possible when it comes to oil and related products?"
"Why do we have a situation in which prices generally only move in one direction, namely upwards?"
"Member of the Commission. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner Piebalgs should really answer that question, but I will pass it on to him."
"A roaming system for oil products: that would be quite something!"
"As regards the timetable which Mr Rübig asked about: we now have what I believe is the second roaming package on the table."
"I can imagine that Parliament will act very fast to produce its opinion on this roaming package so that it can be concluded swiftly before the end of the French Presidency."
"I have also spoken to the French Presidency of the Council this afternoon; the Council Presidency will address the issue and ensure that the Council produces an analysis of the Commission's proposals as quickly as possible so that the new provisions can enter into force on schedule on 1 July 2009."
"That is what the citizens - the consumers - expect from both Parliament and the Council."
"Madam President, I just want to apologise for not being here when the Commissioner was answering my question."
"I was stuck at another meeting. I am very sorry."
"Thank you Mr Crowley, and thanks too for not insisting on a supplementary."
"Subject: Break in transmission of the Chinese TV channel NTDTV"
"On 16 June transmission of New Tang Dynasty Television (NTDTV) to mainland China was suddenly halted by the operating firm Eutelsat."
"The reason given was 'an irregularity in the power supply' to the satellite."
"Since then Eutelsat has given no satisfactory explanation of the causes."
"NTDTV has not been informed whether efforts are being made to remedy the technical faults."
"NTDTV is the largest independent TV broadcaster in Chinese and, before 16 June, the only one which could be received in uncensored form in China."
"NTDTV broadcasts programmes in Chinese and English."
"Eutelsat did not want to renew the contract with NTDTV for transmission to Asia in 2005, but the cancellation of the contract was prevented by international intervention."
"What measures will the Commission be taking to ensure the continued transmission of independent TV channels in China?"
"Member of the Commission. - I am at the disposal of the honourable Mr Crowley if he would like to speak with me later on and has a supplementary question."
"As for the question concerning the break in transmission of the Chinese TV Channel NTDTV, The Commission was very much aware of this problem, and therefore asked Eutelsat to clarify the situation."
"We received a letter from Eutelsat which answered that the irreversible loss of one of the V5's two solar panels has been confirmed both by Eutelsat and by the satellite manufacturer, Thales Space."
"To safeguard the satellite's operation, Eutelsat switched off the four transponders providing direct-to-home television services while keeping the 20 remaining transponders used for telecommunication services."
"As Eutelsat does not operate any other satellite with coverage of Asia, they have provided their customers, including the service provider of NTDTV, with a list of competitor satellites with appropriate coverage and availability capacity."
"Eutelsat also pointed out that their satellites carried channels representing all channels, cultures and political viewpoints."
"They refrain from indulging in the slightest judgement as to the ideological and political positioning of the channels."
"Eutelsat reaffirmed to the Commission that they had not taken any action against NTDTV at the behest of the Government of China or anyone else."
"NTDTV is actually still carried by one of their European satellites."
"Eutelsat also supplied technical information showing that, in order to receive NTDTV, rather large satellite dishes were necessary, which made it unlikely that a significant part of the population of the People's Republic of China could receive it."
"(DE) Can you give an estimate as to when the service provision and the broadcasting capacity will be restored?"
"My second question is related to that: do you think we will be able to create a 'Europe without borders' for television as well, with all the national broadcasting services being received throughout Europe?"
"Member of the Commission. - Concerning the first question, Eutelsat has told us that the breakdown is irreversible and that the transmission of TV services cannot be resumed."
"So it is a purely technical question."
"Unfortunately, the capacity is only 50%, so the energy which can be taken up is only 50%."
"It is a technical question which, unfortunately, cannot be solved."
"Now to the more fundamental question from the honourable Member as to whether we should, some day, have a 'Europe without borders' for television. We are not yet there."
"We have our Television without Frontiers Directive, which is now implemented in an Audiovisual Services without Frontiers Directive, where I hope very much that the video-on-demand services can become Europe-wide services."
"The dream, of course, is that one day there will no longer be any borders and that citizens, wherever they are, can receive whatever TV channels they want."
"We are not yet there because the selling of rights is still done under a national system."
"One day, Europe will arrive at a situation where the selling of rights can also be done at a European level."
"I favour this."
"I cannot impose it, but I favour it, and I believe that slowly but surely we will move beyond the national selling of rights to the European selling of rights."
"I apologise to the remaining two questioners for Commissioner Reding, but Questions Nos 51 and 52 will be answered in writing."
"Subject: Irish as an official working language of the European Union"
"How does the Commission intend to implement its new strategy for multilingualism, particularly with regard to the strengthening of the Irish language as an official working language of the European Union?"
"Commission Member. - (RO) The European Commission's new strategy on multilingualism, entitled ”Multilingualism - An asset for Europe - A shared commitment”, was adopted on 18 September 2008."
"The main topic of the strategy is linguistic diversity and the best way of using and developing it in order to foster intercultural dialogue, to stimulate the competitiveness of European companies, and to improve the skills and work-finding abilities of European citizens."
"The strategy focuses on encouraging the learning and use of foreign languages in the Member States, not on the in-house linguistic state of affairs of European institutions."
"We reassert our commitment to developing the citizens' ability of communicating in two languages other than their native languages; at the same time, we stress the need of making available a wider range of languages for citizens to choose from according to their interest."
"The Commission will rely on existing community programs, particularly on the Lifelong Learning Programme, to support Member States in promoting foreign languages by enforcing this strategy."
"Through Regulation 1 of the Council of 15 April 1958, amended by article 1 of Regulation 920/2005(EC) of the Council of 13 June 2005, Irish became an official working language of European Union institutions as of 1 January 2007."
"However, articles 2 and 3 of the Regulation provide for a partial derogation, renewable every 5 years, concerning the use of Irish by European Union institutions."
"Basically, this derogation implies that for the time being only proposals for regulations within the codecision procedure and certain related documents, as well as direct communication with the public, are translated from or into Irish."
"Therefore, according to the above-mentioned provisions, the Commission performed all the Irish translations required for the legislative process, and succeeded in transmitting them on time."
"Moreover, answers were given in Irish to the questions addressed to the Commission by citizens or by legal entities."
"The Commission also started to make available Irish versions of its most important web pages, with priority to content of particular interest to Irish speakers."
"As far as interpretation is concerned, DG Interpretation is capable of meeting all interpretation demands, from and into Irish, coming from the Council, the Commission or the Committees, and will endeavour to do so in the future, making sure it has the necessary resources."
"(GA) Madam President, I am very grateful to the Commission for its support, and for the progress the Commission has made, in relation to the Irish language."
"There is a saying in Irish that ""its lack of use is to its detriment”."
"I only have thirty seconds left so I cannot waste any time."
"One minute is the maximum amount of time I am normally allowed in Parliament to express myself in my own language."
"I would like to inquire of the Commissioner, if the Commission would be happy to see the Irish language develop and if it would be possible to use it to a greater extent here in Parliament and in the other Institutions, especially, at committee level where the language could be spoken for longer periods."
"A language will not survive on a few seconds alone."
"Commission Member. - (RO) Looking at the demands faced by the European Commission, we are pleased to say that they were not only met, but also exceeded."
"The European Commission went above and beyond."
"On the other hand, further joint effort is needed in order to promote the Irish language on a wider scale."
"These efforts should come both from community institutions and from Irish authorities and the Irish society at large."
"For instance, we need more Irish interpreters, more translators, and this objective is hard to achieve unless significant resources are allocated at country level, that is, in Ireland."
"This is why I am working closely with the Irish authorities to encourage and stimulate those who want to train and acquire the necessary skills that would enable them to do linguistic work for community institutions."
"I would also like to stress that we are working closely with the Irish authorities with respect to the various developments of the Irish language, not only its institutional aspects."
"We want to do our best to help Irish terminology and, as I said, we have a close cooperation with all the stakeholders."
"Question No 54 from Mr Higgins has been withdrawn."
"Subject: Multilingualism in the EU institutions"
"The Commission organises traineeship programmes which it publicises only in English, French and German."
"Equally, it publishes EIDHR announcements only in English, French and Spanish, stating that only in those languages will it accept projects from European organisations, whatever their national origin."
"Indeed, the website of the Commission's own anti-discrimination campaign is, like many others, registered only in English, and its homepage displays logos in that language only."
"What policies does the Commission intend to introduce in order to ensure that the multilingualism which is always defended in public and is officially promoted in all its own documents is implemented in reality in its day-to-day activities?"
"Commission Member. - (RO) The European Commission's internship program is aimed at any university graduate who has not been through such a European internship before and who is proficient in at least one of the working languages of the European Commission: German, English, or French."
"This is a practical necessity which enables an intern to take part in the activities carried out by our services, taking full advantage of his/her internship."
"All the practical information and explanations to the applicants are available only in these three languages."
"On the other hand, the rules governing the internship program are available in all the official languages of the Union in force on the day of adoption of the Commission's decision."
"In order to fulfil the mission described in Article 177 of the Treaty, the number of admissible languages for the proposals of the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights must be limited to those languages which are currently used and understood in the respective third countries."
"Nonetheless, the documents sent by non-governmental organisations in support of their applications for external aid are now accepted in all of the official languages of the European Union, via PADOR, the online system for NGOs."
"Concerning awareness-raising or coordination actions taking place within the EU only, which are aimed at European citizens only, we will assess the applications submitted in the language(s) of the respective Member State(s)."
"Indeed, the front page of the online campaign against discrimination does use a logo written in English, but this provides access to webpages in almost all of the official languages of the EU."
"According to the action plan for improved communication with the citizens, in 2006 the Commission set up a web translation service within DG Translation, thus increasing its capacity for multilingual communication."
"However, given the rapid evolution of the internet, as well as the necessity of ensuring legal translations first and foremost, according to Regulation 1, the Commission must always be on the lookout for the right balance between providing relevant and up-to-date information to the stakeholders within the EU, and ensuring the fully multilingual character of all of the Commission's websites."
"The general principle governing the use of languages on the webpages is to adapt the language of each site to the target audience."
"Therefore, the Commission ensures the translation in as many languages as possible of those websites or website sections which are of interest to all citizens, whereas more technical subjects, which are of interest to specialists, are available either in a limited number of languages or in their original language only."
"Likewise, the information expected to be valid for longer is available in more languages than ephemeral content."
"The Commission's obligations according to Regulation 1 include the translation of all regulations, directives, legislative proposals and officially approved communications sent by the Commission to the institutions into all of the official languages; on the other hand, the answers to letters from the citizens are given in the language of the addressee(s)."
"Apart from discharging these duties, and in accordance with the principle of multilinguism and multiculturalism, the Commission undertakes to make every effort in order to ensure the equal treatment of citizens, cultures and languages."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would say first of all that the distinction you have suggested drawing between documents of a technical nature and - if I have correctly understood the interpretation - documents of public interest strikes me as a particularly dangerous and slippery distinction, since documents of a technical nature may in actual fact be of considerable public interest."
"The problem is quite straightforward: texts which are purely working documents are subject to linguistic constraints, but all documents which might potentially be addressed to the public, even if of a technical nature, must be handled on a fully multilingual basis: they must be translated into all languages."
"In particular, I find it absolutely incomprehensible that calls for tender relating to projects to promote democracy and human rights should be accessible only in English, French and Spanish."
"The websites must be not only multilingual but registered in all languages."
"Finally, I fail to understand why even the internal newsletter Commission en direct should appear almost exclusively in English."
"Commission Member. - (RO) As I said, the European Commission is bound, on the one hand, by legal obligations under Regulation 1 of 1958, and there is no hesitation whatsoever in the fulfillment of these obligations; on the other hand, there are certain matters, such as the ones you mentioned, related to the translations available on European Commission websites, in which case the Commission and the other community institutions are facing a major dilemma."
"One the one hand, the fully multilingual content of these websites cannot be provided; it is simply impossible to ensure full multilinguism for all the documents found on the Commission websites, due to the Commission's limitations in terms of financial and human resources."
"On the other hand, what we are doing right now is to increase the number of documents that can be translated in as many official EU languages as possible, without prejudice to our legal obligations, and within the resource limitations that I've mentioned."
"We have proved ourselves to be flexible when various requests to to the Commission were made, and, to the extent that we can physically meet these demands, we are ready to show the same flexibility again."
"I am sorry to have to disappoint further questioners, but in view of the time I am afraid we are going to have to leave it there."
"Questions which have not been answered for lack of time will be answered in writing (see Annex)."
"It is a point of order in a roundabout sort of way."
"Mr Orban and I go back a long time, so I hope he will take this in the spirit that it is intended, because one of his answers did actually take six minutes, and I think, as we are trying to get many questions up in future, I wonder if he could perhaps try and make his answers a little bit more focused or succinct in future for the benefit of all Members."
"Mr Evans, we have discussed the matter with Vice-President Wallström."
"On the one hand, we know the Commission is trying to give us answers that are as full as we would like them to be, but then that obviously curtails the number of Members able to participate."
"Thank you all, and I am sure that you will receive full answers in writing."
"(The sitting was suspended at 19.15 and resumed at 21.00.)"
"White Paper on Nutrition, Overweight and Obesity-related health issues (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr A. Foglietta, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the White Paper on 'A Strategy for Europe on Nutrition, Overweight and Obesity related health issues'."
"rapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, before opening the debate about the report on which we will be voting tomorrow, I should like to take this opportunity to say some words of thanks. I would begin by thanking my colleague Adriana Poli Bortone, now a senator of the Italian Republic, from whom I inherited the draft report and an already detailed, meticulous study of the topic; next my staff, who have supported me enthusiastically and conscientiously in furthering my exploration and analysis of the phenomenon; and finally the shadow rapporteurs, whose commitment undoubtedly contributed to the adoption of the text in the Committee on the Environment, with a virtually unanimous cross-party consensus."
"Ladies and gentlemen, when this draft text was entrusted to me, I asked myself what my aim should be as rapporteur in carrying forward a study of this kind."
"I found an answer in the strategic nature of the document, which showed me the two pillars on which I came to base my work: firstly completeness, so as not to leave any gaps or underestimate the importance of any of the numerous aspects of the subject in hand; and practicality, so as to be able to draw up a genuinely future-oriented document identifying effective instruments and solutions."
"In adopting this approach I relied on the data, statistics and percentages already widely available on the topic."
"The percentages are discomfiting once we look into them since, according to the World Health Organisation, more than 1 billion people are overweight and over 300 million are obese."
"Child obesity is growing rapidly, and we should bear in mind that diseases related to obesity and overweight absorb up to 6% of national health expenditure in certain Member States."
"In seeking possible solutions we took care not to demonise certain types of food as being solely responsible for the problem of obesity."
"The problem will not be solved by eliminating such foods from our diet, but rather by educating consumers, and especially young people and children, to eat sensibly."
"Fats are an essential part of a correct nutritional intake, but in the right quantities and at the right times of the day."
"Lessons on diet, on which I lay great emphasis, are not about the ability to distinguish good foods from bad; nothing is harmful in absolute terms, and nothing needs to be excluded from the diet of healthy people not suffering from an eating disorder."
"Another issue to which I would draw your attention is that obesity certainly does constitute a disease."
"It is a disease whose causes are not only physical but often social or psychological, but it nevertheless remains a disease which costs our national health systems huge sums of money every year. It is a disease which, as such, must be tackled by means of practical, multi-layered solutions."
"During these months of study, however, I have realised that all too often this aspect is underestimated by public opinion, which indulges in wholly justified alarmism and awareness-raising campaigns about anorexia but also takes an equally unjustified consolatory approach towards overweight, with slogans such as 'big is beautiful', and so on. This is misguided; it sends out the wrong message."
"We are not discussing aesthetics or appearance; we are talking about health."
"Therefore, just as the scourge of anorexia needs to be fought energetically, we wish to try and combat obesity in the same manner, working on the various fronts set out in this report, which calls for parallel and consistent efforts."
"Efforts are required from educators, health professionals, the food industry and the media, especially television. All of them must exercise the strong sense of responsibility deriving from their potential to guide public opinion."
"Public authorities, especially local ones, must play their part too."
"I wish to close, ladies and gentlemen, with a news item which has made waves in the past few days: namely, one of the two candidates in the race for the White House has stated that it would be useful, right and proper to tax obese citizens as well as alcoholics and smokers."
"This, in my opinion, is absurd as a principle, but I do believe that this serious problem must be addressed in an appropriate manner, because only by tackling it head-on will positive results be achieved."
"I am going to ask all speakers to pay close attention to the time as we cannot overrun on this debate, given that it is an evening debate and we have very limited time, particularly in terms of logistics, for example the interpreting service."
"Please ensure that I do not have to cut you off because I regard this as very awkward for the Presidency and I would prefer that you all took individual responsibility."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I very much welcome Parliament's report in response to the Commission White Paper on nutrition, overweight and obesity-related health issues."
"In particular, allow me to congratulate Mr Alessandro Foglietta on his excellent work."
"I am happy to note that Parliament shares the Commission's view that the obesity epidemic can only be halted by means of an integrated approach and that Parliament welcomes the Commission's White Paper as an important step towards stemming the rise in obesity and overweight across Europe."
"I also take note of Parliament's request for a number of further actions - including more regulatory measures - beyond those currently envisaged by the Commission."
"The Commission will, in 2010, hold a first review of achievements against the objectives set out in the White Paper of 2007."
"If monitoring shows that progress is not adequate, further actions, including a possible regulatory approach, will of course need to be considered."
"With regard to the monitoring process, I wish to draw your attention to the important role being played by the World Health Organisation."
"We are working together in line with the conclusions of the WHO Ministerial Conference in Istanbul, with a focus on monitoring actions in Member States to implement both the Commission's White Paper and the WHO strategy."
"Finally, I wish to share with you today some of the most recent developments in the implementation of the strategy for Europe on nutrition, overweight and obesity-related health issues, which respond to some of the actions called for in your report."
"As you know, to strengthen actions at the European level the Commission has to set up a high-level group focused on nutrition and physical-activity-related health issues."
"The group is ensuring the rapid exchange of ideas and practices between Member States, with an overview of all government policies."
"Looking at the engagement of the stakeholders to date, the pan-European organisations, members of the European Platform on Diet, Physical Activity and Health, are currently implementing more than 200 commitments in key areas such as product reformulation, labelling and responsible advertising."
"Monitoring is ongoing and annual reports are publicly available on the Commission's website."
"Complementary to the EU Platform, to date Public-Private Partnerships between governments and the private sector are reported in 17 EU Member States and I consider that this is going in the right direction."
"In July, the high-level group met with the European Platform on Diet, Physical Activity and Health in order to discuss potential for synergies and partnerships, focusing in particular on salt reduction - the agreed initial priority for joint action with Member States."
"This joint meeting was positive and I am certain that such gatherings involving both high-level officials from Member States and Platform members will increase the impact of actions taken both by government authorities and by Platform members in the future."
"Let me also draw your attention to the Commission's proposal last July to reserve EUR 90 million every year for the purchase and distribution of free fruit and vegetables to schools."
"Turning the tide on obesity is one of the most important public health challenges we are faced with in Europe today."
"I am grateful for your continued support and look forward to continuing dialogue with Parliament on how best to proceed so that the European Union can play its role to the full in addressing this issue."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. - (PL) Mr President, obesity and overweight represent challenges for contemporary society."
"They lead to many chronic conditions such as circulatory diseases, hypertension, Type 2 diabetes, strokes and certain types of cancer."
"Combating obesity and overweight should be a priority for the Union's health policy."
"The greatest possible number of partners should be involved."
"I am thinking of local authorities, the Member States, the European Commission as well as representatives of industry."
"We should not, however, overlook consumers, who make their own choices about food."
"Educational campaigns and promotion of physical activity seem to constitute the best approach."
"The consumers would then have clear and comprehensible information on the basis of which they could make wise food choices."
"I do not believe, however, that imposing restrictions on the food producers alone will result in a reduction in the number of overweight individuals."
"I am thinking of advertising, for example."
"I should also like to draw attention to another somewhat neglected aspect of this debate: appropriate training for health service professionals, notably as regards caring for diabetics and the treatment of diabetes."
"Such training has been somewhat neglected, especially in the new Member States."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. - (PL) Mr President, I could almost have drafted this document myself."
"I support the measures contained in the White Paper."
"It refers to the adoption of a healthier lifestyle and to physical activity of all kinds as being the most effective methods of treatment."
"The White Paper also contains preventive measures in the form of far-reaching recommendations for food producers, consumers, restaurant owners, food outlet chains and the advertising industry."
"Information campaigns are also mentioned."
"Coordination between the various policy areas and levels of management along with the involvement of the private sector are crucial for the effective implementation of these measures."
"We need to face this problem together."
"Particular emphasis must be placed on implementing those actions intended to prevent obesity in children."
"Adults are responsible for drumming sensible eating habits into children."
"It is often the case, however, that we adults ourselves are not fully aware of what is and is not advisable."
"That is why it is so important to organise information campaigns aimed at parents, so that they can ensure that their offspring enjoy a balanced diet."
"Programmes promoting the principles of healthy eating and physical activity should also be directed at children and young people."
"It is certainly the case that widespread obesity exists."
"It is also true, however, that there is a strong obsession, insistence and indeed a requirement to be thin."
"Eighty per cent of teenage girls under the age of 18 have tried to lose weight at least once in their life."
"Trying to lose weight in the wrong way can be dangerous."
"It follows that just as it is important to impart knowledge about the world wisely to young people, so too must young people be taught about sensible nutrition that results in a hunger for knowledge."
"That type of hunger is highly desirable."
"Every effort should be made to implement the pan-European programme known as the School Fruit Scheme."
"The European Commission proposed allocating a mere EUR 90 million to this programme."
"I believe that this amount should be increased several times over so that the ubiquitous school vending machines filled with crisps, chocolate bars and fizzy drinks can be replaced with others selling fresh fruit, vegetables and dairy products."
"We should always remember that our children's diet will determine their health in later life."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality. - (SK) Thank you, Mr President, I do not have much time so I just want to mention a few points."
"As always, I am in favour of prevention and prevention from childhood."
"Prevention is closely linked to the promotion of parental responsibility."
"The best way of preventing childhood obesity is not to use the television, video games and the Internet as babysitting services."
"Without creative activities, children and adults do not get enough exercise."
"Children must get to grips with proper eating habits in terms of the quality and quantity of food and laying the table."
"It is essential to promote family meals, with parents and children eating together."
"There is nothing better than when a family can eat at least one meal together."
"In order to make this possible, it is essential to facilitate a work-life balance."
"Teaching children to cook is another good way of preventing obesity."
"Children like to help with cooking and it would be a good idea to encourage this."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, obesity is one of Europe's greatest health challenges, but some may say what has it got to do with us here in the European Parliament?"
"Or indeed within the EU?"
"There are at least two reasons."
"One is, as the rapporteur has already said, obesity-related diseases account for more than 6% of taxpayer-funded national health budgets in the EU."
"We all have to pay for it."
"Secondly, different EU countries are tackling the issue differently, and all have much to learn from each other."
"So may I congratulate the Commission for their White Paper in triggering this debate, and I would just highlight a few key points."
"We generally welcome the Commission's proposal on food labelling, but felt it would be inappropriate for this report to pre-empt the detailed discussions which will be necessary on this specific issue."
"On obesity, evidence shows that the problem is much more about how much exercise people take rather than just how much food they eat."
"It is about calorie output, not just about calorie input."
"So it would be totally wrong to blame the food and drink industry for causing the problem, or indeed for failing to provide a sufficient solution."
"The reality is in fact much more complicated."
"We need more activity-friendly communities offering more bicycle routes, better town planning, more promotion of public transport, more parks and sports facilities, more school playing fields and yes, better education."
"We need many aspects of our lives to change."
"So may I congratulate the rapporteur on his wide-ranging report and his very difficult task, picking up from his predecessor, and dealing with so many shadows with so many ideas of their own."
"I particularly thank him for accepting some of my amendments including those concerning the problem of malnourishment, particularly in hospitals and care homes for the elderly."
"It is most important that we look after the more vulnerable in our society."
"Some people make themselves vulnerable, and, if I may conclude with a sweeping generalisation, one of the problems of society today is a lack of personal responsibility, a belief that every failing is someone else's problem, that someone else will solve it."
"More regulation simply feeds this perception; more self-regulation and self-discipline is the answer."
"We need to encourage greater personal responsibility, and that way we will all make greater progress as a society."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, this is a long report."
"There were 400 amendments, and I would like to thank the rapporteur because he has tried to make some sense of it."
"I hope the key messages will not be lost because it is so long."
"For us in the Socialist Group the key messages - and there are some very positive points here - are that we need good food-labelling regulation and we want to see front-of-pack labelling, if possible using colour coding, included in the forthcoming discussions."
"We know the Commission is looking at this and that is what we want to see."
"We are pleased that there is now support across the Parliament for a ban on artificial trans-fatty acids."
"When I first raised this two years ago there was no support in the Parliament - in fact the Commission was taking Denmark to court and there was nothing happening."
"We have now had a written declaration and we have a consensus, so I hope the Commission will do something like this."
"Commissioner, you spoke about product reformulation."
"I think this is crucial."
"It is true what Philip Bushill-Matthews says that obviously people have to take some responsibility, but manufacturers have a responsibility in terms of how they make products."
"Many of them are now making great efforts to cut salt, fat and sugar."
"Often these things are hidden in foods."
"It is not obvious to consumers when they buy ketchup or yoghurt that they contain lots of sugar."
"In fact the labelling system often disguises what is in the product, such as yoghurts which are labelled 'low fat' when they have very high levels of sugar."
"We do not believe that self-regulation is the answer to everything."
"We think there has to be a degree of regulation, in particular in relation to children."
"Yes, adults can make choices but children need to be protected by the law and that is why we want to see independent monitoring of any voluntary agreements by industry."
"We know that you are taking the first steps in this direction."
"Finally, this is a huge issue for Europe."
"It is going to cost the public purse a lot of money if we do not tackle it and we now need some concrete proposals to come from the Commission - not on issues which are to do with national responsibility, but in those areas where the EU has responsibility we need clear policies which help national governments to reduce obesity."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FR) Mr President, a sedentary lifestyle ailment and now increasingly a young person's disease, it has been said that the problem of obesity is central to the work of this House and has been since the start of the current legislative term."
"Every year more than 400 000 young people are added to the long list of those who are destined to know all about the yo-yo effect of dieting."
"Europe has therefore done well to tackle this problem head-on."
"It also adopted a clear strategy in this area in March 2005 when it launched the European platform that was to unite all those involved, including the agro-food industry, the retail and distribution sector, medical professionals and consumer associations."
"It has to be recognised - and people have said as much here today - that it is not easy to convince people that Europe should have more than a say in this fight against obesity."
"To do this we have to start by clarifying the levels of authority, which does not prevent us - and indeed we are doing this - from reminding the Member States just what their powers and responsibilities are."
"I am thinking here of two hard-hitting proposals that we have made in the report: the first is to prevent discrimination and the stigmatisation of obese people by officially recognising obesity as a chronic disease, as has been done for example by the WHO and Portugal; the second is to ensure that all schoolchildren have access to physical exercise and sport - two hours a week would be the minimum requirement in my opinion - along with better funding of school canteens so that fresh products are put on the children's menu, and here I welcome the Commission's initiative for the free distribution of fruit at school, as referred to by the Commissioner."
"I would also add that it is through simple, tangible and sensible actions such as this that people will learn to like Europe again."
"I now come to Mr Foglietta's report, and I wish to thank him for all the effort that he has put in."
"I would like to highlight two proposals that have been made here."
"The first concerns opting for a political incentive - such as lower prices and tax concessions - rather than a system that is based on increasing the tax on high-calorie products, namely the famous 'fat tax', which at the end of the day will penalise low-income households the most."
"The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, which I represent here today, is therefore opposed to Amendment 6 by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and prefers to stand by the proposal for a substantial cut in VAT on fruit and vegetables, as laid down in paragraph 28."
"My Group also supports the banning of artificial trans-fatty acids, which are recognised as being linked to a significant increase in cardiovascular problems."
"We are therefore opposed to the amendments proposed by Mr Blokland, which are aimed at softening the impact of paragraphs 32, 34 and 35 and at clearing the way for, if not to say whitewashing, these hydrogenated fats."
"Our message to manufacturers is quite clear: show goodwill and make innovations for the sake of consumers' health and also in your own best interest."
"As time is short I would like to conclude by mentioning the first parliamentary meetings on nutrition and health issues that I set up in this Chamber a year ago."
"This was the start of a major debate for all the parties involved and one that was centred on four key priorities: getting through to people from a very early age, eating a varied and balanced diet, treating obesity as a chronic disease and legislating if necessary."
"This is more than just a slogan, it is the moral duty of this European Union of ours and we need to commit ourselves fully to the fight against obesity and the sedentary lifestyle."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, over 50% of Europe's citizens are either obese or overweight."
"Three million children are obese and 22 million overweight."
"Obesity places a great strain on the bone structure with all the negative consequences that entails."
"It also causes metabolic disorders and a consequent propensity to diabetes, circulatory diseases, hypertension and high cholesterol levels."
"The problem is partly due to inappropriate nutrition and partly to a sedentary lifestyle that does not involve any physical effort."
"Certain features of our civilisation, notably stress, play their part too."
"The social dimension of the problem calls for determined action, in particular as regards protecting children."
"Children are eating too many sweet things instead of well-balanced meals, and spending whole days in front of the television or computer."
"This is because adults are failing to guide children's lifestyle appropriately and provide good models of behaviour."
"The White Paper on nutrition is a useful document in terms of action to control obesity, especially amongst children."
"The selection of healthy products should be facilitated by a promotion and information policy focused on children but above all on their parents."
"In particular, we support the School Fruit Scheme."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (NL) Mr President, today we are discussing overweight and obesity and I think it is important - as several people have already said - not to talk too much about diet and waste, but to talk mainly about the need to eat healthily."
"A couple of months ago I was very shocked when my daughter, an extremely slim daughter, came home and did not want to eat her second slice of bread because she would get fat."
"She had heard a lot at school about how above all you must not be fat, but she was not sufficiently aware of how you should eat healthily and what a normal helping is."
"A child of eight does not really understand when you are too fat."
"Thus it is very important to talk mainly about healthy eating and not about whether a person is too fat."
"In fact, it is mainly the responsibility of parents to show children what is healthy and what it means to eat a balanced helping, and the responsibility of schools to pass this on and set an example."
"Parents themselves must learn more about food values and the fat content of products and so I agree with what was said earlier about labelling."
"We should therefore review that point in the legislation on labelling."
"I also think that it is a good idea to talk a lot about sport and about the fact that children must be able to play happily outside."
"Therefore, we must in any case make a recommendation that in town and country planning more attention is paid to the wishes of children to have plenty of freedom."
"As far as eating is concerned, the European Commission has a very good EU MiniChefs website."
"The website has already been improved. It now has vegetarian dishes as well, which it did not have many of before, but nearly all the recipes contain meat."
"Let us be honest about that, animal proteins are a major contributor to overweight."
"Apart from animal welfare, the European Commission should not be explicitly promoting meat consumption."
"I just want to say a final word on VAT."
"Mrs Ries has just said that she is against our Amendment 6 because she wants to reward people, not penalise them."
"Therefore, she wants not a fat tax or higher taxes on unhealthy products and imports, but, in particular, lower taxes on healthy products."
"I certainly agree with that, but now it appears that, in the Netherlands too for example, all foodstuffs now fall into the low category."
"Crisps, lollies and the like all have a low VAT rating at the moment, but surely it cannot be the intention that you make that special exception for unhealthy products."
"Thus it is not a question of penalising; you should not reward products that are not healthy by giving them a lower VAT rating."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (SV) A third of Europeans suffer from overweight and obesity."
"A substantial share of the Member States' health budgets has to be allocated to combating the problems raised by overweight."
"Furthermore, the overweight problem reflects socio-economic inequity."
"People on low incomes are worst affected since they consume more sugar and saturated fats."
"Quite simply, they have a poorer diet."
"It is clearly the task of policy to create the best possible conditions for people to eat more healthily."
"That is exactly what Mr Foglietta sets out to do in this report."
"He therefore has the support of the Group of the European United Left."
"The report calls for the EU to be more flexible in allowing the Member States to apply lower VAT rates for healthy food and higher rates for what we should eat less of."
"It is an important demand which I hope EU leaders will listen to."
"What does the Commission have to say about this?"
"Can the Commission come back with a review of the EU VAT Directive allowing more flexibility in the Member States, so that we can get to pay less VAT on healthy food, for example?"
"Another question to the Commission concerns trans-fats."
"We know that trans-fats are bad for us."
"That has been established by authorities in the Member States, as well as by EFSA, the EU's own Food Safety Authority."
"At a hearing in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety on 1 April this year, Commissioner Androulla Vassiliou said that trans-fat is definitely not good for health, there is no doubt about it."
"In this report we call for a ban on trans-fats, but the Commission refuses to propose it."
"Mrs Vassiliou will not even allow individual Member States to go further and introduce national bans."
"Now the Commission has a chance to withdraw from this unhealthy position."
"When shall we get a ban on trans-fats?"
"Can the Commission at least guarantee Member States freedom to ban trans-fats if they wish to?"
"Meat is another dimension of the public health problem, as the previous speaker, Mrs Buitenweg, pointed out."
"Meat consumption is soaring across the world."
"If nothing is done, the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) warns that the already high consumption of meat will double by 2050."
"Meat contains saturated fats and contributes to obesity."
"Furthermore, the meat industry is seriously helping to hasten climate change."
"The EU should phase out subsidies to the meat industry; yet, in the budget for 2007 alone, over 45 million euros were appropriated just for the marketing costs of the meat industry."
"It is counter-productive and, besides, a bizarre waste of taxpayers' money."
"The phasing out of these meat subsidies and a strategy for reduced meat consumption should be self-evident measures for better health in the EU."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, trans-fatty acids are not the healthiest fatty acids."
"These fatty acids exist in natural and industrial form and are found in many food products."
"Although the results of scientific research vary, most research shows that the trans- fatty acids naturally found in foodstuffs and artificially added industrial trans-fatty acids present an equal risk."
"Both types of trans-fatty acid are in fact equally harmful if too much is consumed."
"It therefore does not seem to me appropriate to maintain that distinction in the present proposal; hence my amendment."
"Furthermore, it is very difficult to ban all trans-fatty acids completely without creating other risks to public health."
"According to the UK Food Standards Agency for instance, a ban on trans-fatty acids in fact leads to a concentration of saturated fatty acids."
"Saturated fatty acids are at least as harmful as trans-fatty acids."
"On average the total intake of saturated fatty acids is considerably higher than the World Health Organisation recommends."
"I have therefore tabled amendments to limit the quantity of saturated fatty acids as well and at the same time I suggest that we do not call for a ban on trans-fatty acids, as indicated now in paragraph 32 of the report."
"What might be a possibility is for us to set a limit of, for example, a 2% proportion of trans-fatty acids in total energy intake."
"That appears to be technically very feasible and to some extent it is already being done."
"We have to ensure that we do not have a trade-off between trans-fatty acids and saturated fatty acids, with consumer health not being improved at all as a result."
"(SK) The deteriorating trend towards unhealthy eating and insufficient physical exercise in Europe is alarming."
"I am therefore very pleased that we are looking at this problem here in the European Parliament."
"We know that obesity is one of the factors responsible for 'civilisation diseases', such as high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes and consequent diseases of the musculoskeletal system."
"On 17 September I organised a working lunch here in the European Parliament devoted to the problem of the relationship between obesity and diabetes in pregnancy."
"The Members and assistants present were able to listen to the top experts in Europe, such as Dr Rosa Corcoy Pla, chair of the working group for diabetes in pregnancy, and Professor F. Andre Van Assche, former President of the European Association of Gynaecologists and Obstetricians and Professor Dr Pera Ovesena."
"Obesity and maternal diabetes represent an increased risk of maternal and also neonatal morbidity and mortality."
"We must realise that this involves not just disease in the mother, someone who often may not follow a proper diet, but also responsibility for the healthy development of the future population."
"An obese diabetic mother will have obese children, and so it goes on from generation to generation."
"I should therefore like to draw your attention to the written declaration I and my colleagues have prepared on this problem, the relationship between diabetes and obesity in pregnancy."
"The EU Member States should devote more attention to preventing and screening for diabetes in pregnancy and make the population more aware of the risk and consequences of obesity."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with the White Paper, the Commission intends to present an integrated strategy for the EU which aims to reduce diseases related to poor nutrition and the overweight and obesity-related health issues with which it is associated. That is right and proper, for the increase in diseases related to poor nutrition and lack of exercise forces us to act."
"The Commission's aim of adopting an integrated approach across government policy areas is the right one."
"This is the only way to tackle the causes of obesity-related diseases."
"A balanced diet is important, as are nutritional education and promoting sports in schools, and it is important that we provide guidance and support so that people in the European Union can move in this direction."
"Various positive initiatives have already been launched."
"The EU Platform for Action on Diet, Physical Activity and Health is one of them, and supports this objective."
"It is a Europe-wide initiative which attempts to encourage citizens to make the necessary changes."
"The Commission's school fruit programme is another example."
"However, if we resort to populist demands again, as advocated in the proposal, we will simply distract attention from the real problem."
"What is the point of demanding, yet again, a restriction on advertising?"
"We have only just adopted the Television without Frontiers Directive."
"It contains very clear rules, and yet here we are coming up with new ideas and demands again."
"I lived for 40 years in an area of Europe where advertising was banned."
"The result was not that we all slimmed down in the communist part of Europe."
"What are the Greens doing, calling for taxes on foods with a particular type of nutritional content?"
"Do we want the poor in the European Union to be unable to eat certain types of food because they can no longer afford them?"
"Which strategy, then, do we want to adopt?"
"The strategy that we should be adopting starts with education and training."
"That is where we should be investing."
"We should not be restricting our citizens' freedom of choice with punitive measures or restricting their access to food."
"(PT) Mr President, this debate is very important."
"I therefore want to start by welcoming the Commission's initiative and Mr Foglietta's report."
"More has been said about anorexia than obesity, despite obesity having become a truly global epidemic."
"More than 50% of Europeans are overweight and around 6% of health expenditure is spent on obesity, as already mentioned here today."
"Child obesity is continuing to grow, with 22 million European children now being overweight."
"The fight against obesity must be a political priority of the European Union."
"I therefore agree with most of the measures proposed: consumer information, restriction on television advertising, nutritional and health information on food labelling."
"People must realise that obesity is one of the main causes of death and is associated with many chronic diseases such as diabetes, high blood pressure, cardiovascular disorders, bone and joint problems, respiratory diseases and cancer."
"We must act, and we must act quickly."
"There is no secret to the solution: more physical exercise and greater care with food, which is totally the opposite to what most people are doing."
"Sandwiches and soft drinks, sweets and snacks should not be consumed every day and a sedentary lifestyle does nothing for your health."
"Physical exercise can simply involve walking for at least half an hour a day."
"It does not take much effort or cost a lot, but it works."
"It is important for adults and vital for children."
"Many parents do not even realise the harm they are doing to their children by allowing them to spend their free time in front of the television or computer, eating what they should not be eating, without any kind of monitoring or control."
"We need to join forces to combat obesity which is why the actions must be concerted and involve schools, families and operators in the productive, health and social sectors."
"Everyone has a responsibility."
"The role of the family in changing habits is decisive."
"Schools should be responsible for the qualitative and nutritional control of school meals, prohibiting the sale of high-fat, high-salt or high-sugar products in bars and vending machines."
"At the same time they should facilitate and promote physical activity for students."
"(DE) Mr President, I very much welcome the strategy set out in the White Paper, which will enable us to tackle the causes of poor nutrition and obesity and the diseases with which they are associated."
"Unfortunately, in Europe's food policy, whether we are talking about nutrient profiles or food labelling, or indeed in some aspects of the White Paper, we tend to resort to a very one-sided approach."
"We generally try to resolve Europe's problems through product policy."
"In my view, assuming that there are good and bad foods is fundamentally the wrong approach."
"As many of the amendments show, this is not the case."
"There are only good and bad, or balanced and unbalanced, types of diet."
"That should be our approach."
"There are many reasons why people eat the wrong type of diet."
"Addressing this problem by attempting to steer consumers in a particular direction with product labelling or even by introducing advertising bans or regulations or applying different VAT rates, will not bring us closer to our desired objective."
"I do not want to pre-empt the debate on the Food Labelling Directive, but I do believe that whatever action we take here should be guided by the principle that we should be motivating consumers to think about their eating habits."
"Traffic-light labelling - which is supposed to make the consumer stop and think whether he or she is about to choose a good or a bad product - is an approach which patronises consumers rather educating them and raising awareness."
"I would like to see a more balanced approach, along with the recognition that pursuing a solely product policy-oriented approach will not take us very far."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by complimenting the rapporteur on her excellent work."
"I am obviously about to repeat many of the remarks already made by my colleagues, but I do not think that we should mince our words: obesity affects approximately 25% of European children and is therefore a serious threat to their future health."
"The causes include inadequate information, poor eating habits, a lack of physical activity and even a shortage of sports facilities."
"Nor should we underestimate the social and psychological problems involved, partly because overweight children are often victims of bullying."
"I believe, for this reason, that the proposed increase in funding for the school fruit programme, whereby fruit and vegetables are made available free of charge in the classroom, is a good idea."
"Indeed, 2009 should see a revival of the Mediterranean diet and the production of fruit and vegetables, especially in view of the latest WHO data indicating that the consumption of these foods is falling even in Mediterranean countries."
"Under this initiative, rather than being destroyed to keep prices high, fruit will be used to ensure a healthier diet, especially for our children, and therefore a healthier future for Europe's citizens."
"(PT) Mr President, it is vital to have a comprehensive and integrated approach to nutrition, overweight and obesity given that there are many factors involved, with the issues of food poverty, malnutrition and lack of information on healthy diets being of particular importance."
"The issue of guaranteeing healthy food is therefore of key significance."
"We must guarantee, through public policies, that everyone has access to healthy food."
"This means implementing a range of measures to ensure local and high-quality agricultural production of high-quality foodstuffs, including milk, fruit and vegetables, and their distribution to people on low incomes."
"Furthermore, another common agricultural policy, which involves protecting family-based agriculture and creating local markets with fruit, vegetables and other essential foodstuffs, with production being duly supported, can guarantee healthy food, at accessible prices, for the general population."
"As there are proposals to provide support for the distribution of fruit and vegetables in schools, it is vital to increase the amount that the European Commission is proposing for this programme in order to guarantee their free and daily distribution to all school-age children, and not just once a week as is currently happening."
"However, it is equally important to implement a whole series of public health policies and programmes which have nutrition as one of their priorities, including campaigns on health education and information and on the promotion of healthy lifestyles and diets."
"These must include physical education and sport with guaranteed access for the general population, particularly children and youngsters, and specifically in schools."
"(PL) Mr President, the text on the health issues related to nutrition, obesity and overweight contains many important observations."
"There are alarming indicators showing how common being overweight has become."
"Accordingly, it is essential to combat this by paying particular attention to the promotion of organic food, sport and physical exercise from an early age."
"It is also important to raise awareness of harmful adverts that deliberately encourage overeating."
"Other positive features of the document are the promotion of breastfeeding, measures to improve the quality of school meals, the provision of fruit, and the ban on the sale of food and drink containing high levels of fat, salt and sugar on school premises."
"There are further causes of obesity and overweight, however."
"These include trauma and psychological conditions, which play an important role."
"A range of psychological disorders lead to irrational eating disorders."
"Anorexia and bulimia are obvious examples of this."
"Biological responses created by the general availability of fast food can be much stronger than usual when there is inadequate personal development, a lack of respect for values, widespread depression and nervous conditions."
"Contempt for ethical and moral principles and disregard of the meaning of fasting can even stunt personal development by making a person dependent on his or her blood sugar level and on visual and taste sensations."
"It is surprising that there has been no mention of the significance of saturated fatty acids in the e-mail discussions and in the amendments tabled."
"Consumption of these substances is increasing."
"The problem of the different effect of artificial trans-fatty acids compared to that of the rest seems, however, to have been settled."
"In their natural form trans-fatty acids only occur in a few products, in particular in milk, which contains a small percentage of these acids."
"Mr President, more than half of the European population is overweight, and the World Health Organisation tells us that a billion people worldwide are overweight, 300 million of them obese."
"As many as 50% of Europeans take no exercise at all."
"Cardio-metabolic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and heart disease are growing at an alarming rate, and those with high levels of obesity are extremely prone to develop type-two diabetes with all the consequent morbidity issues, as witness the alarming increases in this type of diabetes among very young teenagers."
"Doctors are now also telling us there is a serious connection between obesity and dementia/Alzheimer's disease."
"Critically this is a huge challenge for policymakers, especially when it comes to our children, 22 million of whom are overweight in Europe."
"We have reached a stage in this strange world of ours today where there are more people overweight than there are hungry."
"On top of all of this, particularly in wealthier countries, we have an increasingly problematic relationship with food, with increasing anorexia and bulimia, diseases of countries where there is plenty to eat."
"Although health matters largely fall within the Member States' area of competence, there are many ways in which issues around obesity can be tackled at EU level: exchange of best practice, promoting healthier lifestyles in relevant EU policies and cross-border epidemiological cooperation."
"Last week I hosted a breakfast week here in Parliament, where we underlined the fact that 61% of Europeans skip breakfast regularly during the week."
"This fact can be directly linked to excess weight gain by our doctors."
"The Harvard Medical School recently conducted a study which found that people who ate breakfast every day were 35% less likely to be obese."
"Research has also found that these people who skip breakfast are likely to be more tired, irritable and restless in the morning."
"Starting the day with a proper blood-sugar level is the best antidote to snacking and sugar cravings."
"So while citizens are ultimately personally responsible for their own diets, the ongoing promotion of healthier lifestyles is a must."
"I support this report strongly, except for paragraph 28, with which I cannot agree: I do not believe tax measures should be raised in a health-based report."
"(SV) Mr President, as many have said, the matter we are discussing here today is an important one."
"It is an immensely important subject on which we can learn from one another, the Member States together, but it is also immensely important for us to respect the subsidiarity principle when we discuss this issue."
"There is much the EU can do to reduce the problem of obesity and on which we should focus attention here in Parliament."
"Advertising and consumer information are areas on which we take decisions here in Parliament and which should be our focus."
"I think we have failed to some extent in this respect."
"We have, for example, failed to ban advertising directed at children, a group which cannot differentiate between advertising and facts, and any information presented to them in this way is therefore by definition misleading for precisely those consumers."
"A great deal of the advertising directed at children does in fact relate to food which contains a lot of fat, salt or sugar."
"A ban on advertising directed at children would be an effective way of reducing the obesity problem in Europe."
"The second point I wanted to take up was that of trans-fats."
"I am extremely glad that we shall perhaps be able to call on the Commission tomorrow to propose a ban on trans-fats."
"The usual argument against such a ban is that it is actually saturated fats that are the biggest problem for public health in Europe."
"Strictly speaking, that is so, but why not reason as they do in Denmark?"
"While we do have a huge problem with saturated fats, why do we have to put up with the additional problem of trans-fats as well?"
"I cannot understand why."
"We cannot remove all saturated fats, but we can effectively remove the industrialised production of trans-fats, which is just a cheap and bad way to produce food."
"I am also extremely glad that we addressed the question of glutamates in the report."
"Finally, I want to reiterate the importance of subsidiarity."
"We could have had a lot less to say about what schools should do and what food they should serve."
"I actually think that there are better political levels on which to take such decisions than here in the European Parliament."
"(RO) We have all heard the statistics concerning obese children and adults, so there would be no point in repeating them."
"What is worrying is that the prospects after 2010 are even gloomier."
"This is why excess weight and obesity should concern us; therefore, I welcome the Commission's White Paper, as well as Mr. Foglietta's report."
"Unfortunately, obesity affects mainly people from disadvantaged categories, all the more so as the price of staple foods has risen considerably; however, promoting a healthy lifestyle and healthy eating could prevent obesity and lead to a decrease in the number of obese persons, at the same time cutting costs in the health system by eliminating the need to treat all the complications related to obesity."
"I, too, believe that coercive measures are not a solution."
"European citizens have the freedom of choice."
"The solution is better nutritional information, with appropriate labels specifying the contents, as well as information campaigns funded by the European Commission and the governments of Member States."
"We should not forget campaigns targeted at parents, who have a very important role, and at children."
"Moreover, Member States should supervise the content of vending machines placed in schools, they should monitor the food provided by schools and kindergartens, and they should encourage the consumption of fruit and vegetables."
"Physical education classes are also very important."
"Not last, the Commission should pay particular attention to industry initiatives concerning responsible advertising and the reduction of salt, sugar and fats."
"(PL) Mr President, according to WHO statistics, over 1 billion people are overweight, and over 300 million are obese."
"The situation in Europe is even more dramatic."
"Obesity is no longer just a problem; it has become an epidemic involving diabetes, hypertension, heart attacks and certain types of cancer."
"Combating overweight and obesity calls for a complex range of actions."
"These include the production of healthy food, sensible nutrition, improving the financial situation of the poorest people, raising awareness in society, developing research, monitoring children's diet, leading a healthy lifestyle and promoting active leisure time."
"Unfortunately, in addition to the generally recognised causes of obesity and overweight there are contributory factors linked to irresponsibility and the desire to make a profit."
"A good example of this is the spread of genetically modified organisms."
"Planting and cultivating the latter is detrimental to biodiversity and takes the place of healthy food."
"In the interests of human welfare, development and health, we should take concerted action to make Europe GMO-free."
"Doing so will also protect the natural environment."
"We must remember that healthy natural food is the best way to combat diseases, including obesity and overweight."
"(DE) Mr President, overweight and obesity are a major problem for our society."
"We know that we cannot change consumer behaviour with legislation."
"Rather, changed behaviour throughout society has an impact on the individual: after all, who wants to be an outsider?"
"Our health behaviour and diet are influenced by our social environment."
"There have been complaints that meat consumption is on the increase."
"However, it is on the increase because more people in society can afford to eat meat, not because per capita meat consumption itself is rising."
"A healthy relationship with food and drink is particularly important."
"An obsession with being thin is as bad for health as compulsive eating."
"Eating habits cannot be regulated by law."
"People's dietary needs vary, and there is no 'one size fits all' requirement in terms of people's calorific or fat intake."
"People are different, and their individual energy needs differ too, depending on age, gender, occupation, and activity levels."
"Bans are a poor substitute for common sense."
"We do not need new legislation: what we need are information campaigns to impart knowledge."
"We need freedom, not nannying."
"Freedom also implies responsibility."
"Our citizens are intelligent adults who can think for themselves."
"Traffic-light labelling is not representative as it only shows certain aspects in isolation, so it confuses consumers."
"What should I choose if a product label shows that a specific food has red, yellow and green nutritional elements?"
"The food industry will pass the costs of the new labelling on to the consumer, driving up prices even further."
"I am against a 'nannying' approach and mandatory front-of-pack nutritional labelling using colour coding, and I would therefore ask my fellow Members to vote against paragraph 37 of the report."
"If necessary, we can deal with this later in a different context, when we look at the issue of labelling."
"Let us take the White Paper on nutrition, overweight and obesity-related health issues as an opinion-forming tool which provides food for thought for society, not as an opportunity to impose even more conditions and create new legislation!"
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for successfully tackling such an oversized topic."
"Firstly, I should stress the importance of providing free lunches for schoolchildren, which is the practice in my home country of Lithuania but is far from that of all Member States."
"Of course there are objections relating to insufficient funding and generally about the quality of food which is actually on the plate, but it helps children - especially from the poorest families - to have proper and decent-quality meals."
"I also welcome an initiative to distribute fruit and vegetables free in schools."
"It should be considered as an example of best practice."
"I believe EU funding could be helpful in assisting Member States with the financial burden."
"The importance of this is that such projects take the EU directly to citizens."
"Last but certainly not least, the report fails to mention consumption in the sense of over-consumption."
"These days, changing consumption patterns equal a change in our lifestyles."
"It is perhaps hard to imagine a parallel between obesity and climate change but, indeed, such dependency exists."
"If we started to think about both topics at the same time, perhaps we would fly fewer of our apples and strawberries from abroad and grow more of them at home, selling them at local food markets instead of supermarkets - which is exactly one of the points that the current report proposes."
"(ET) Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the number of people who are overweight and obese has been discussed here several times already but, according to the experts, a further 1.3 million people will join their ranks next year."
"This is the equivalent of the entire population of my homeland, Estonia, a terrifying thought."
"There are many factors behind poor diet and obesity, although doubtless we must take the cost, availability and awareness of food into account in our assessment."
"Sixteen European Union countries have kept VAT on food below the standard rate, a laudable decision."
"The proposal included in the report to reduce VAT on fruit and vegetables to below five per cent is welcome."
"The WHO health report refers to a low intake of fruit and vegetables as one of seven health risks."
"In that context it would be commendable to start providing fruit in schools, and European Union support would be necessary if we are to introduce the measure in all 27 Member States."
"One cannot say much in one minute but I would like to add a couple of words on advertising and the media."
"Their help and ideas are needed to advertise carrots, not Pepsi-Cola, and on the kinds of stereotypes and body images to advertise, as these play a very important role in raising people's awareness."
"Allow me, as I finish, to thank the Committee and the rapporteur for their efforts."
"(PL) Mr President, we are today debating the growing number of obese people."
"At the same time, the Committee on Agriculture is debating the future agricultural policy."
"In a sense, both these debates concern the same issue, namely the health of our society and of young people in particular."
"It sometimes seems to me that in certain documents we lament health problems whilst in others we promote GMOs, cloning and importing food from regions where it is produced using methods far removed from natural ones."
"In the framework of the WTO, our negotiators want further opening to markets outside Europe."
"We should ask ourselves whether we really care about our society or whether we are simply paying lip service."
"Most of the direct payments to agriculture go to large agri-business concerns that produce food with a high chemical content rather than to family farms producing healthy food."
"Clearly, this report is sorely needed, but the main findings it contains must be implemented."
"In the light of the Commission's current priorities, I seriously doubt that this will be the case."
"(FR) Mr President, 27% of men, 38% of women and one child in four are now considered to be either overweight or obese in Europe, and there are some 400 000 new cases a year."
"This is a blight that is taking hold on European society."
"Information campaigns and preventive measures are certainly an effective response because, unfortunately, we are now confronted with a public health issue that is also developing into a social problem."
"Regrettably, obesity is also frequently associated with poverty and exclusion."
"Much has been talked about information campaigns and prevention."
"I do not wish to go back over what has been said about food labelling, the role of the public authorities, school canteens, sports facilities, proper information, a healthy diet and the need for daily physical exercise."
"However, I would draw attention to the important role played by health professionals, who are there to identify chronic health risks linked to obesity, including diabetes and cardiovascular disease and of course the consequences that such ailments have for overweight people."
"Prevention is achieved by exchanging best practices while at the same time respecting the principle of subsidiarity."
"Studies have shown, for example, that a waist measurement greater than 88 cm for women, apart from during pregnancy, and above 102 cm for men is the definition of abdominal obesity and constitutes a health risk, and this applies irrespective of the person's height."
"This very simple benchmark is still not being sufficiently recognised by GPs."
"Waistline measurement should therefore be made a simple point of reference for all patients and should trigger an immediate investigation of the associated risk factors, including glucose intolerance, which is a sign of pre-diabetes, excess cholesterol, triglycerides and arterial hypertension, and we also know, unfortunately, that all these symptoms point to the development of Alzheimer's disease."
"This is why we really need to accentuate the role that health professionals have to play in this area."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur: this report is very timely and deserves the full attention of policymakers."
"The facts on obesity are startling and have already been quoted."
"Yesterday at a major conference in Dublin a nutrition expert claimed that Ireland was on the cusp of an obesity crisis, and, indeed, a similar situation pertains across Europe."
"I want to briefly mention just one issue: self-regulation versus legislation."
"We have a voluntary code for the advertising of food of poor nutritional value to children, but there is a large question mark over whether this is working or not."
"According to the Irish Heart Alliance, this voluntary code is not effective."
"I believe we need to monitor it very carefully and take immediate action if necessary."
"Mr Bushill-Matthews mentioned personal responsibility."
"That is fine at one level, but we need clear, understandable food labelling - colour coding is a positive step."
"We live in a world where we consume greater and greater amounts of processed foods."
"Indeed, certain EU policies promote this - the Lisbon Agenda: more people at work, less time for food preparation."
"I fully support the Lisbon Agenda, but, alongside that, we as EU policymakers have a duty to ensure that food manufacturers make it very clear what is contained in the processed foods they manufacture."
"(PL) Mr President, the subject of the health issues related to nutrition, overweight and obesity is a matter of current concern and it is right that we should be dealing with it now."
"The whole world, not just Europe, is currently facing a tremendous challenge involving obesity and the diseases directly and indirectly related to it."
"Expenditure on their treatment is increasing at an alarming rate."
"Sixty per cent of the population of the United States is overweight, and one third now suffers from obesity."
"The most recent data from that country indicates that expenditure on the aforementioned conditions is in excess of USD 100 billion."
"This is more than 10% of the healthcare budget."
"Europe is slowly catching up with its neighbours as regards these infamous statistics."
"More and more children and young people are suffering from hypertension and diabetes."
"These conditions are often due to poor nutrition and lack of exercise."
"In the interests of the future of Europe and of its inhabitants, we must pay more attention to the problems raised in the report by Mr Foglietta."
"The health disaster threatening Europe and the entire globalised world can only be avoided by swift, determined and joint action."
"The European Parliament is currently dealing with many issues relating to economic and social matters."
"If we are to carry them through successfully, though, we must not forget that only healthy societies are able to derive full benefit from the advantages made available to them."
"Action to promote a healthy lifestyle must be taken."
"At the same time, however, it is necessary to introduce legal measures which make every Member State responsible for making more determined efforts to improve the physical condition of its citizens through healthy eating and sport."
"It should of course be borne in mind that the specific actions and policies to combat this phenomenon fall within the competence of the Member States."
"(LT) The White Paper suggests considering three factors when determining a strategy for Europe on nutrition-, overweight- and obesity-related health issues."
"First of all, every individual is responsible for their way of life."
"Secondly, only a well-informed individual is able to make right decisions."
"Thirdly, the Paper suggests coordination between a number of fields - food, consumers, sports activities, education, transport, etc."
"However, all these factors are influenced by advertising."
"What are we eating?"
"Where are we seeing these products?"
"How do we get to know about them?"
"Unhealthy products account for 89% of the food products advertised on television."
"More than 70% of children ask their parents to buy them the foods they have seen advertised on television."
"In discussions on health issues I think one more participant is missing - representatives of the food production industry."
"We would like them to realise the harm caused by unhealthy food products and the resulting costs that society has to bear."
"We would like them not only to stop advertising unhealthy foods, but also to produce more healthy food products."
"(SK) More than half of the population of Europe is overweight."
"According to the statistics, almost 27% of men and 38% of women are considered overweight and more than 5 million children are obese."
"A total of 5-7% of expenditure on healthcare is directly associated with obesity and this represents billions."
"It is this worrying fact that makes it essential to adopt resolute initiatives at all levels to curtail this phenomenon."
"I welcome the Commission's steps to adopt the White Paper, clearly shifting the field of diet, excessive weight and obesity to the level of a political priority for the European Union, and I am of the opinion that we can achieve progress in the fight against obesity by coordinating the different sectoral policies at European level."
"I should like to draw attention to the problem of overweight children and young people: this age group should be one of the priorities."
"Correct diet and physical exercise are prerequisites for normal growth and healthy development in children."
"Education in healthy eating is mainly the responsibility of parents, but schools can also play a part in this regard."
"They should constitute another centre of activities in the fight against obesity."
"I agree with the rapporteur's view that schools should have a doctor, a nutrition specialist, on the premises."
"I also favour a ban on the sale of excessively fatty, salty and sugary products in schools, where they are available in particular in vending machines."
"According to the statistics, young people today spend more than five hours a day in sedentary activities, mainly watching television and playing on computers."
"Exercise, on the other hand, increases the deposition of calcium in the bones, develops children's social skills and is an important factor in the fight against stress."
"It is important to create school conditions whereby sufficient time can be set aside every day for physical education and to encourage children to take part in sport, for example through the construction of playing fields and sports halls."
"These steps are essential if we wish to prepare a healthy future for our young generations."
"I shall conclude by saying that the prevention of obesity requires at least one peaceful healthy meal in the family circle cultivating, above all, healthy habits."
"(HU) Thank you, Mr President."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, obesity and being overweight are not only fed by health reasons, but by social reasons in the broadest sense."
"I was delighted to see that the White Paper and report point out that the question of obesity and being overweight must not be examined at the stage when it has already grown into a real health problem, but we must reach back to the root causes."
"I consider it important to emphasise that the White Paper and the Parliament's opinion must not address the health sector but citizens and communities; society, in other words."
"This extremely important question must be handled in harmony with the European Union's other documents, since the causes of the problem are multi-faceted so the solution must come from many different directions, and yet be coordinated, in order to succeed."
"Making a healthy lifestyle more popular must be supported in every possible way, at European Union, Member State, regional and local level."
"We must place particularly great emphasis on the programmes and actions that aim to bring school-age children and young people up with a healthy lifestyle."
"Here I must stress the role of local governments, since it is mainly they that run schools."
"Programmes that work well must be publicised widely."
"We all know that the role of the media in formulating knowledge is gaining ever more ground: the power of advertising can conjure healthy eating, sport, regular exercise, basically a healthy lifestyle, into a fashionable model to follow."
"In preventing obesity, the importance of exercise and sport must be closely linked to the requirements of healthy eating, but it is not at all sufficient to focus on only these two aspects: encouraging people to lead a healthy lifestyle must become top priority in all relevant policy areas."
"The aim is for people to understand that healthy, balanced eating does not mean that we can never consume certain foods."
"Regular exercise does not mean that we have to take exercise in every free minute."
"The emphasis is on moderation, and in this way our diets and lives will become more balanced."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur for his work, and you for listening. Thank you very much."
"(PL) Mr President, we are today dealing with two food-related disorders."
"One of these is anorexia, which generally has a psychological basis linked to the fact that thin bodies tend to be presented as more attractive."
"We are all aware of extreme cases in which this disorder has resulted in death."
"Fortunately, however, fashion is changing and the disorder is now less widespread."
"The other disorder is obesity, which can also have a psychological basis."
"Food can be perceived as a way of coping with stress and as an escape from life's problems."
"Against this background, I believe that the key issue is nutrition."
"Food producers and distributors bear a much greater share of the blame in this respect."
"The report before us is very welcome and should serve as a warning."
"The so-called fast food provided for school pupils on outings and trips is a danger."
"After all, it amounts to a lesson on eating."
"Appropriate education and food control are needed."
"In my view, our efforts represent a step in the right direction and I therefore support this report."
"(RO) I believe we should focus our attention on overweight children and that we should try to create new programs for fighting obesity in early life, when we acquire our feeding habits."
"We should promote feeding education both in primary school and after."
"All the Member States should include in their school curricula the basics of a balanced diet and exercise."
"According to certain statistics, in ten years' time there will be over 30 million overweight children in Europe."
"I am deeply worried about this major problem."
"Consequently, I started a series of written statements proposing the creation of special programs in schools, including free regular health check-ups and counselling."
"I endorse the proposals in the White Paper, such as the appropriate labelling of foods, restrictions on advertising in the case of products that are harmful to children, decreased VAT on fruit and vegetables, and foods for children only."
"In conclusion, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for this accomplishment."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I am really pleased that the Members of Parliament who took the floor basically agreed with the Commission White Paper."
"They not only shared its views, but also expressed support for the Commission's initiatives."
"I appreciate the complex approach of the speakers."
"This is fully in compliance with the complex nature of the problem of obesity."
"Many of the speakers urge raising public awareness and cooperation with the food industry, which is also fully in line with the text of the White Paper both in spirit and letter."
"The Commission's commitment is reflected in the proposal on food information to consumers which we will soon be discussing with the Parliament and also with the Council."
"I want to stress that there are various programmes and projects in the European Union which mutually reinforce the White Paper on nutrition, overweight and obesity - such as the Green Paper on urban mobility or the White Paper on sport, both aimed at a healthier lifestyle and a healthier environment."
"Others include the common agricultural policy health check - which would, for example, decrease consumption aid for butter - or the schemes for school milk and fruit, the Community legislation on advertising and marketing to promote responsible advertising, or the Directive on Unfair Commercial Practices."
"These are very important initiatives in full harmony with the Commission's position."
"The Commission will continue to work with the EU Platform for Action on Diet, Physical Activity and Health and with the high-level group of Member State experts."
"I also want to stress that the Commission is encouraging initiatives that help prevent the development of cardiovascular disease in Europe, for which trans-fatty-acid consumption is a risk factor in addition to overall fat intake and the intake of saturated-fat acids."
"Voluntary reformulation can deliver results."
"Commitments have been made within the European Platform for Action on Diet, Physical Activity and Health to reformulate products and reduce the amount of trans-fats and saturated fats in them."
"There is just one more issue which I want to mention because it touches my portfolio - taxation."
"There was a proposal to examine the possibility of applying reduced VAT rates for vegetables and fruits."
"I do feel sympathy with this proposal because it shows exactly how tax policy can promote the attainment of other important policy purposes."
"To conclude, I want to underline that Parliament is one of the founding members of the Platform, and the European Commission is prepared to regularly update Parliament on the activities of the Platform."
"Parliament is expected to discuss the monitoring report in 2010."
"We will end this debate with a speech by the rapporteur, Mr Foglietta, who I urge to keep within his allotted two minutes."
"rapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to emphasise one aspect of the Commissioner's statement which I consider very important."
"Close attention should be paid to an issue that deserves serious consideration while we endeavour at the same time to create new opportunities."
"This subject is, I believe, one that concerns many of us, since several well-focused speeches have explored it and sought to spur the Commission into action."
"Above all, however, the report itself aims to make clear that we are dealing with a highly critical condition: obesity."
"As far as health problems are concerned, obesity is now becoming an extremely complex problem that has to be solved."
"Help must be provided and we must produce a report which helps us to achieve our objectives."
"Commissioner, the Commission has indeed underscored the role of the World Health Organisation, but let us not forget that the WHO itself is calling for the trend of rising child obesity to be reversed by 2015."
"Another important date will be 2010, which is when we will be in a position to judge the outcome of this strategy."
"I should therefore like to thank all those who have spoken in the debate and the shadow rapporteurs."
"I am grateful for all the suggestions made and believe that we must be very alert and careful to draw up a significant report which will really enable us to think in terms of prevention and well-balanced healthy eating, for the sake not only of the body but also the mind and soul."
"I believe that we certainly can attain this goal thanks to everyone's cooperation."
"Once again, my thanks go to all those who have spoken in favour of this report. Thank you, Commissioner."
"Thank you for your work, Mr Foglietta, which everyone here has recognised."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (PL) Overweight and obesity are something of a contemporary epidemic with dangerous consequences for the health and even the life of human beings."
"Diabetes, circulatory disorders, hypertension, heart attacks and certain types of cancer are just some of the dangerous outcomes of obesity and overweight."
"It is therefore entirely appropriate for the European Parliament to have become involved in combating overweight and obesity."
"It is also right that Parliament should be encouraging the bodies responsible for the health of EU citizens to become involved in this battle."
"I am referring to the bodies at every level of national and European administration."
"Childhood obesity is a particular concern."
"There are already 22 million overweight children in Europe and their number is steadily increasing."
"If we do not reverse this trend, our society will soon be even more obese, less healthy and markedly less productive."
"That is why I fully support this report."
"I believe that the time has come for us to pool our efforts and launch a determined and sustained attack on overweight and obesity."
"We must focus on the most sensitive sectors of society, such as children and the elderly, especially women and people living on their own."
"If we succeed in convincing society that it is worth controlling our body weight and combating overweight, and if we manage to set up mechanisms to promote a healthy lifestyle, we shall be able to avoid a great many problems."
"Preventing obesity is therefore not just a health and beauty issue; it also has social and cultural implications."
"in writing. - The problem of obesity and diet-related diseases has taken dramatic proportions worldwide."
"In my view, sophisticated and aggressive marketing techniques have prevented consumers from making informed choices in regards to their diet."
"In this respect children are particularly vulnerable."
"The AVMS Directive foresees that media service providers would adopt voluntarily a code of conduct regarding commercial communication on food and beverages."
"While I appreciate the self-regulation aspirations of industry and media, I would have preferred to see concrete restrictions on the volume and type of advertising aimed at children."
"The destructive effects of low quality food on society are comparable to that of alcohol and tobacco, whose advertising is heavily regulated."
"A similar approach can be applied to foods that have been established as harmful to human health."
"Consumers need clear and objective information, which can be provided by requiring higher standards on food labelling and placing more restrictions on advertising."
"The current financial crisis has exposed one more time the results from mixing greed and lack of regulation."
"Whether you stand to loose your house or your health, I think the stakes are too high for an indifferent marketing approach."
"As regulators we need to step in and do our job."
"in writing. - (PL) I welcome the report on nutrition, overweight and obesity related health issues, presented by Mr Foglietta."
"It is quite right for Parliament to take up the important issue of the promotion of healthy eating once again."
"We would do well to remember that sound nutrition is one of the 12 factors contributing to good health highlighted by the World Health Organisation."
"A healthy individual is a sine qua non for a healthy society."
"Food safety is crucial in this context."
"The latest cases involving contaminated Chinese baby formula milk prove just how important this is."
"Poor nutrition is the cause of many afflictions, including overweight and obesity."
"Obesity is understood to mean excessive deposits of fat in the body."
"It increases the risk of heart disease, hypertension, atherosclerosis, diabetes, gallstones, kidney and urinary tract stones, bone and joint degeneration, and certain types of cancer."
"In Poland, 65% of people aged between 35 and 65 are overweight or obese."
"The incidence of obesity amongst our youngest citizens has reached epidemic proportions."
"Twenty-two million European children are affected."
"The negative impact of advertisements for foodstuffs with a high fat, sugar or salt content is very serious."
"It is important to make schools and families aware of the efforts to promote properly prepared, good quality food."
"Schools and families should encourage young people to adopt a healthy lifestyle, which includes sport and other recreational activities."
"in writing. - (PL) Overweight and obesity are problems which have reached epidemic proportions in recent times due to their negative impact on human health."
"World Health Organisation data reveals that 50% of Europe's population is overweight or obese."
"The fact that over 5 million children are obese and 22 million children are overweight is cause for particular concern."
"The numbers are increasing at an alarming rate."
"Obesity is one of the main causes of mortality and chronic disease such as Type 2 diabetes, circulatory disorders, hypertension, heart attacks and certain types of cancer."
"The treatment of obesity is very costly indeed."
"It represents some 7% of national healthcare budgets in the Union and up to 6% of government expenditure on healthcare."
"In order to combat this problem, European consumers should have better access to information on the best food sources so that they can choose an appropriate diet."
"Food should be clearly labelled."
"Certain ingredients such as artificial trans-fatty acids and trans isomers should be taken out of use."
"It is also important to bear in mind that television advertising affects the so-called short-term consumption habits of children between 2 and 11 years of age."
"It has a negative impact on the development of eating habits."
"Combating overweight, particularly amongst children, should be a priority at international, European, national and local level."
"in writing. - (RO) Obesity and weight gain due to inappropriate eating habits and to the lack of exercise are increasing everywhere in the EU, with major economic and social consequences."
"In order to promote a healthier society, the Commission should get involved in an active manner, by supporting Member States to reduce the harmful effects of nutritional imbalance and sedentarism."
"However, it does not suffice to promote a healthy lifestyle among EU citizens; we must also provide the motivation and infrastructure they need."
"There should be local measures for decreasing the use of cars and promoting walking; there should be parks and cycling lanes."
"Policies for fighting obesity should be correlated with urban development and transport policies, such as the Green Card on Urban Mobility, and these policies should all complement those policies encouraging exercise."
"We should pay more attention to socially and economically disadvantaged groups which are affected by the increase in the price of raw materials and foods, as well as to vulnerable groups, such as children and pregnant women."
"Promoting health education in schools and prohibiting the sale of foods with a high content of fats, sugar and salt in schools and kindergartens will ensure the health of the future generation."
"in writing. - (DE) In view of the alarming health trend among Europe's children - more than five million children are obese and 22 million are overweight - the development of a Strategy for Europe on Nutrition is a very welcome step."
"Conscientious labelling of foods with nutritional information is a sound tool which enables consumers to make informed choices to improve their diets."
"Comprehensive awareness-raising from early childhood will also undoubtedly help to reverse the trend in the coming years."
"In the medium term, interim campaigns such as the provision of fresh fruit in schools are essential."
"Europe's schools must also face up to their responsibility for sports in schools and daily exercise to a greater extent, given that children and young people spend much of their day at school."
"Nonetheless, regulations at European level can only create an environment for healthy eating and should not make the mistake of denying citizens' fundamental responsibility."
"If a healthier Europe is to be achieved in the long term, the European Union must seek partnerships at all levels: in the political arena, the business sector and in civil society."
"VAT on insurance and financial services (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr J. Muscat, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax, as regards the treatment of insurance and financial services - C6-0473/2007 -."
"I should like to take this opportunity to welcome my friend, Mr Muscat, and to congratulate him on the recent and very important success in his political life."
"This will perhaps at some point cause him to leave this House but, for the time being, it is a cause for celebration, both for himself and certainly for many of us."
"We are discussing new and more transparent rules in the financial services sector at a time when we are going through one of the biggest crises in this sector."
"The current situation shows that we cannot let things run their own course and there is a need for regulation."
"'Regulation' does not mean bureaucracy - certainly not excessive bureaucracy - but assurance that things are being done in the best possible way, and not by means of formulas and papers that lead nowhere."
"When my fellow Members and I prepared this report we had two priorities."
"Firstly, to ensure that any changes that take place do not have negative repercussions for the consumer."
"In other words, there should be no additional burdens on the consumer, and that is why we are saying that the possibility of introducing VAT on financial services should apply only to transactions between one business and another and should therefore be recoverable."
"At no stage should our text propose that VAT on a financial service that is not taxable be passed on to an individual - that is, the consumer."
"This is stated clearly and directly in the proposed text, despite possible reservations on the part of other institutions."
"Some people criticise the fact that the industry will save on expenses and that Member States' income may be reduced - an interesting argument which, however, quite frankly I think comes most of the time from those with a restricted view of the economy and fiscal policy."
"Firstly, in a competitive sector like that of financial services and in a system where you have safeguards against agreements between companies, any expenses not incurred by companies should either be passed on as benefits to the consumer or else be used to compensate for other existent expenses."
"Secondly, as Europe we should understand once and for all that we are not competing alone on the market; we have to ensure that the systems used by other Member States - and by the European Union as a whole - are attractive to serious companies wishing to enter the market and establish themselves as true European operators."
"Facilitating the systems is a way of offering an incentive in this sector, generating market potential and creating work, productive work."
"Through this report we are helping to create a European market by removing obstacles."
"We are doing what has been talked about for many years; we are fulfilling one of the aims of the action plan in this sector."
"We are proving that we can be proactive, solve problems and act on new ideas."
"Perhaps we may disagree on technicalities, perhaps some may say that we can use one system and not another, but I believe that this Parliament must give an indication that this is our ultimate aim."
"Obviously there are certain points on which we are not all agreed, myself included: for example, broadening the definitions."
"I believe that it would have been better if the committee had followed my recommendations on this, which were always either to keep to the Commission's text, or else to further restrict the definitions."
"In spite of this, we should also note that the committee chose to proceed strategically, and so this report was approved with just one vote against."
"I await the reactions of my friends as well as those of the Commission."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I would like to start by thanking Mr Muscat for his work and the support he has given to the Commission's proposal, and I wish him success in his future role in Malta."
"The Commission proposal addresses three major issues."
"First, the existing provisions are increasingly subject to legal challenge in the European Court of Justice."
"Something needs to be done about this."
"Second, we need more consistent application of the VAT rules on financial services and a more level playing field in the internal market."
"Third, we must take steps to improve competitiveness in the sector."
"There are concerns that the financial services and insurance industries in the European Union are less efficient than they should be, and consequently EU industry faces higher costs for financial services and insurance than its competitors in third countries."
"This is not solely a result of the EU's VAT rules, but they do have a role in contributing to this situation."
"I have to add that VAT exemption is not applied uniformly in the different Member States, and this causes competitive distortions within the European Union."
"For example, the possibility of recovering tax paid to specialist third-party service providers (outsourcers) varies depending on national interpretation of the VAT rules."
"For the Commission, improving the competitiveness of our European financial and insurance companies was therefore a factor in making this proposal, but the reality is that this must be balanced against the need of the Member States to ensure stable tax revenues."
"The proposal has three elements."
"First, to increase legal certainty for all concerned, we propose a modernised definition of the exempt services."
"Second, to avoid their business customers incurring non-deductible 'hidden' VAT, the proposal aims at allowing all banking and insurance companies to opt to tax their services."
"Third, the proposal contains an exemption from VAT on cost-sharing arrangements, including those which operate across borders."
"These proposals could result in some limited initial VAT revenue reductions for the Member States, but these can be justified if, as we expect, the proposed changes lead to increased competitiveness."
"I therefore welcome the observation in the report on the problems of non-recoverable VAT and its relevance to business efficiency and the Lisbon strategy."
"I also welcome the fact that the rapporteur recognises that change may result in a reduction in VAT receipts."
"For consumers, I agree that the implications are not always clear-cut, but I believe they will eventually benefit from cost savings achieved within the industry."
"I also welcome the positive remarks about the scope of the proposal and the creation of legal certainty."
"The new definitions proposed by the Commission are necessary to bring the legislation into line with economic realities."
"I sympathise with the remarks on the need for prudence and the absence of reliable figures which would allow the impact of change to be fully assessed."
"This latter lacuna should not, however, be laid at the feet of the Commission, as neither the industries concerned nor national administrations could provide the necessary data."
"Like Mr Muscat, I am conscious that cross-border consolidation in the finance industry increasingly results in VAT revenue accruing to the Member State where the service is created, rather than where the consumer of the service is established."
"A move from exemption to taxation, which would result from greater access to the option to tax as we have advocated in this proposal, would correct this trend."
"I think this is the best way to deal with the concerns which have been raised."
"Finally, I would like to inform you that detailed discussions on this proposal already started in the Council under the recent Slovenian presidency."
"The current French Presidency is also committed to making progress on this particular dossier, and I therefore welcome the positive engagement by Parliament which can further encourage the Council to make progress."
"The report we have before us is particularly significant, especially when you consider that in the last few years the economy has taken a slightly different turn from previous years."
"Without doubt, this report aims to better reflect the current situation."
"That is why it is important to guarantee the legal basis so that the companies concerned can operate with less bureaucracy, as the rapporteur rightly pointed out."
"This could be achieved by removing the anomalies in the current law regulating VAT on financial services: a law that has been in existence for the last 30 years and is not clear enough."
"This is a report that will help as much as possible to provide more stability and we must ensure as far as possible that all the countries are harmonised with regard to the applicable rates to reduce discrepancies as much as possible."
"It has long been felt that there is a need for change in this situation and I think that the rapporteur was right when, while keeping in mind the need to simplify the work for financial companies, he also took care - and I think that this is the most important thing - to ensure that consumers would benefit from this proposed change."
"Today is the last day that my fellow Member from Malta will attend this plenary and I think that I too would like to wish him well in his work in the coming years."
"He has gained four years' experience in this Parliament, and this experience has, I believe, transformed his character from that of a politician who did not really believe in the European Union and the benefits it could offer Malta, to that of one who, through this report, has shown us that he truly believes that from here we can change politics not only in our own country, but also in the European Union."
"Today we have a transformation that I would like him to take back to my country because I believe that the experience he has gained in this Parliament can be taken back to my country and the way we do politics there can resemble the way we work in this Parliament: that is, the national interest remains important, as well as the interest of the European Union, because today we form part of it."
"I wish him well in his work, I wish him success in his role as leader of the opposition;"
"I am not going to say I hope he has a long career as leader of the opposition, because I do not think that that is the way I should talk about my fellow Member, but I hope that he transfers the positive experience gained in this Parliament firstly to his party, and lastly to our country."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Since 1977, most financial services, including insurance and investment fund management, have been exempt from VAT."
"During this period, two problems have essentially arisen: the definition of the scope of the exemption and the impossibility of recovering VAT incurred in order to provide exempt services, giving rise to the phenomenon of hidden VAT."
"Globalisation, European financial integration and market consolidation, which have affected the organisation and outsourcing of operations to provide these services, have further added to the complexities."
"This report is the first attempt to update a directive which, in addition to being confusing - leading to the intervention of the European Court of Justice - is obsolete."
"I want to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Muscat, on his excellent work in producing this report on an issue which is so economically sensitive and technically complex."
"His proposals to modernise the definition of insurance and financial services, which are consistent with the Financial Services Action Plan and strict in dealing with exemptions, have merited general acceptance."
"His commitment to preventing price rises for consumers as a result of taxable persons opting for taxation has also merited general approval."
"The final result, encompassing a specific exemption from VAT for businesses involved in cost-sharing arrangements, will increase certainty for the industry and budgetary security for the Member States, prevent competition distortions and improve competitiveness for the banks and insurers without increasing the costs to consumers."
"I want to express my satisfaction at the incorporation of two aspects contained in these amendments: the reference to co-insurance, and the improved definition of the concept of intermediation, which is restricted to professional activities rendered as a distinct, direct or indirect act of mediation and which specifies that intermediaries are not counterparties to the subsequent transactions."
"I want to end by wishing Mr Muscat great success."
"I am confident that he will soon be enjoying this success through his participation in European integration from the Council."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, as I take the floor on behalf of the UEN Group in this debate, I should like to draw attention to three issues."
"Firstly, the European Commission's proposals on changes to VAT on financial and insurance services improve legal certainty not only for economic entities providing these services but also for fiscal entities in the individual Member States."
"Secondly, the solution whereby Member States commit to allowing taxpayers a choice regarding VAT on financial and insurance services, whilst leaving many detailed arrangements applicable in this area within the scope of activity of the Member States is a good one."
"It amounts to decentralisation of taxation powers, and therefore to implementation of the principle of subsidiarity."
"Thirdly, ongoing analysis of the financial implications of the proposed changes is essential."
"In particular this should concern reduced VAT income in the individual Member States as a result of increased levels of deductions by entrepreneurs."
"The impact of these changes on the cost of financial and insurance services for consumers should also be studied."
"(MT) The rapporteur has upheld the framework of the Commission's proposal so that we are confronted with the problem that we have been putting off for more than 30 years."
"This sector is very important for an ever increasing number of countries, Malta being one of them."
"In the report we find regulations that facilitate the work of important companies and facilitate a true free market without borders, leading to the creation of wealth, jobs and more choice."
"One of the priorities is that there are provisions in place so that consumers are protected and by no means have to pay additional taxes."
"In fact, consumers should benefit from every reduction in expenses and from every increase in the efficiency of the system."
"If the need arises, further analysis should be made in the future to include other safeguards."
"Mr Muscat's report leads to more clarity and legal certainty in the area of taxation in the field of financial services, especially at this time, when we are going through a major change in the financial markets."
"To conclude, I would like to thank Mr Muscat, who has made a significant contribution in the last four and a half years."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I would like to thank you for your comments and the valuable views you expressed during the debate."
"As I said in my opening remarks, obtaining a positive opinion by Parliament on the Commission's proposal for VAT on insurance and financial services is very important."
"We have taken note of the concerns raised in the report, in particular the lack of neutrality in recovery rates, the difficulties with statistics and the risk of diversion of tax revenue from non-recoverable VAT on inputs."
"While the Commission could in principle look favourably at some of the amendments, such as those on derivatives, we will not formally amend our proposal."
"We will, however, endeavour to take the amendments suggested by Parliament into consideration as much as possible during deliberations in the Council."
"I would like to express my gratitude for your positive endorsement of our proposal."
"A positive opinion from Parliament will be a good signal serving to raise awareness on the part of the Member States of the need to act."
"Firstly, I would like to thank Parliament's services and the Commission for all their help with this delicate dossier, even though the work is not yet finished."
"However, as far as Parliament is concerned, like the Commissioner, I too hope that our message is very clear."
"I think what we have to agree upon - and there is unanimous agreement in Parliament - is that, yes, let us make regulations, let us make changes where changes are needed, let us ensure that the system is simpler, but let us be careful that the consumer does not have to foot the entire bill."
"I believe that this is the main message for the Commission, and even for the Council, from us in Parliament."
"I wish everyone well with the work until this dossier is finished."
"I thank my friends for their good wishes, especially Mr Casa, who has given us a fine acknowledgement of a new political season for the Labour Party and for the nation."
"Thank you very much, Mr Muscat."
"I too hope that your work will be successful and will make Europe stronger and stronger."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 25 September 2008."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - Firstly, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Joseph Muscat, for a very comprehensive report allowing for the issue of a common system of value added tax for insurance and financial services from the point of view of businesses, tax administrations and consumers."
"I believe that, although it is difficult - on the basis of this proposal - to clearly assess what will be the extent of the benefits for consumers in terms of efficiency and cost reduction, we ought to ensure the legal certainty and consistency of insurance and financial service- VAT related issues."
"As a matter of fact, it is essential to ensure that VAT facilitation measures for businesses would not be implemented at the cost of the consumers."
"However, it is worth noticing, together with the rapporteur, that much flexibility is given to the Member States, which might lead to uneven implementation results from one Member State to the other."
"Finally, I would like to put the emphasis on the fact that, given the uncertainty of the impact of the implementation of these measures, we ought to remain vigilant and therefore support the obligation for the Commission to report on the issue to both the Council and Parliament."
"Collective management of copyrights on-line (debate)"
"The next item is the oral question by Giuseppe Gargani on the collective management of copyrights on-line - B6-0459/2008)."
"Madam President, this question is central to the future cultural economy of Europe."
"Despite the existence of the Directive on copyright in the information society the situation in terms of the collective management of copyright and related rights for online services is extremely complex, particularly because of the territorial nature of copyright law and the absence of a pan-European licensing system."
"This situation has been made even more complicated by the lack of a coherent policy on the part of the European Commission, with the Directorate-General responsible for the single market and copyright, on the one hand, and the DG for competition policy, on the other, often acting for their own account and without any overall view of the sector concerned, especially as regards the interests of the creative talents of Europe."
"In fact, by refusing to legislate and also by ignoring the different resolutions adopted by Parliament and opting instead to attempt to regulate this sector by way of recommendations and administrative decisions the Internal Market and Services Directorate-General has created a climate of legal uncertainty."
"Against this background we now have the Directorate-General for Competition starting legal proceedings against a player in this sector that was only trying to act in compliance with the Commission recommendation of 2005."
"Thus the Commission took this decision against CISAC in July."
"It did not impose financial penalties but rather sought to change the way that CISAC and its member associations operated."
"This situation reflects the fact that the European Commission chose to ignore the warnings that had been expressed by Parliament, particularly in its resolution of 13 March 2007, which also contained concrete proposals for controlled competition as well as for the protection and encouragement of minority cultures within the European Union."
"Moreover, since then we have seen a whole series of initiatives, only one of which has been legislative in nature: a far-fetched appraisal of the recommendation on collecting societies, an assessment report and Green Paper on the 2001 Directive, questions about home copying, free access by way of a decision of the Directorate-General for Research to 20% of the calls for tender under the Seventh Framework Programme, a time extension to the rights of performing artists, for which a directive is to be considered, and so on."
"This is why the Committee on Legal Affairs has posed the following question: does the Commission not think that it would be preferable to make sure that any changes imposed, for example on CISAC members, should be subject to a broad consultation of all the interested parties so as to put an end to the incongruity of the present legal situation that has resulted from the divergent positions adopted by the Commission?"
"Does the European Commission intend to reconsider its policy in this sector in the light of Parliament's resolution of 13 March 2007 so that a global approach may be found that takes into account not only the interests of the users but also the interests of the licence holders and of the creative community?"
"We are convinced that the CISAC case demonstrates that the approach the Commission has taken by adopting non-mandatory provisions, or 'soft law' as it is called, or by way of purely administrative decisions, is inconsistent and contrary to the principle of legal certainty because the parties affected by it have no means of appeal or discussion."
"Tomorrow the Commission intends to continue with this 'soft law' approach by adopting another recommendation, this time on creative content online, which will also deal with the issue of multi-territory licensing."
"This will not be a recommendation under the codecision procedure."
"Does the Commission plan to involve Parliament in drawing up this recommendation in an effective manner?"
"Or, in this sector that is so crucial for the future economy and culture of Europe, is the Commission once again going to ignore those who represent the Member States and their citizens?"
"For this reason I have two suggestions to make."
"Firstly, as it has done for home copying, the Commission should put in place a platform for all the stakeholders so that this dossier can be opened and examined by all those who have a need to know."
"Parliament, for its part, will give its opinion either way."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs has now set up an ad hoc working group on copyright issues with a remit to present all the stakeholders with a clear long-term global vision of intellectual and artistic property and of its role in the knowledge and cultural economy."
"This group is to hold its first meeting tomorrow morning."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I believe that these questions should be placed in a wider context, as the debate on how to license music on the internet is gaining momentum."
"There is more music available to consumers on the internet than ever before, yet hardly any of it is properly licensed."
"Almost none of it, therefore, produces any revenue for artists or music producers."
"In 2006, the ratio of illegal to legal song downloads was 40 to 1, and over 20 billion recordings are illegally downloaded every single year."
"So something is wrong here."
"Online operators say that licensing of music in Europe is too complicated, which is why there is still no legal online service available in any of the new Member States."
"This is the background to the series of questions we have received from Mr Gargani."
"Everybody agrees that we need to simplify the licensing of music for internet downloads and mobile phones."
"But nobody wants to lose out in the process."
"Is there a simple way to achieve licences that cover all rights all over Europe?"
"In answering this question, we must bear in mind that most authors, composers and performers live off the revenue they generate with copyright."
"This is how they make ends meet every month."
"How, then, do we balance efficiency and fairness?"
"The Commission made its recommendations in 2005."
"As the 2008 evaluation report on these recommendations shows, some owners of copyright, such as the music publishers, have followed our advice and set up Europe-wide licences."
"While small collecting societies fear that these platforms leave no room for niche repertoire, we now have to make sure that they do."
"The signs are encouraging."
"There are already EU licences for small music publishers."
"While these efforts are ongoing, we should not legislate prematurely."
"The ongoing restructuring should be given a chance. But we should remain vigilant so that small repertoire does not lose out."
"Let me now say a word on the antitrust decision that the Commission recently adopted in the CISAC case."
"The decision prohibits anti-competitive practices by European collecting societies which limit their ability to offer their services to authors and online operators."
"The removal of the restrictions will allow authors to choose which collecting society manages their copyright."
"It will also make it easier for online operators to obtain licences for exploitation in several countries from a single collecting society of their choice."
"The 2005 Recommendation and the CISAC Decision are governed by the same principles: they both encourage the removal of restrictions which prevent authors and composers from freely choosing their collecting societies, and rights managers from delivering multi-territorial licences."
"Concerning the preparation of the recommendation on creative content online, the Commission plans to adopt this recommendation during the first quarter of 2009."
"The 2008 public consultation on creative content online has shown that the topic of multi-territory licensing for audiovisual works is not ripe to be dealt with in the planned recommendation."
"The Commission has published a call for tender for an independent study on multi-territory licensing of audiovisual works, with the aim of analysing both the economic and cultural aspects of such practices."
"The Commission is currently analysing the tenders and the results of the study should become available by the end of 2009."
"We are working closely with both the European Parliament and the Member States on developments concerning creative content online, in particular by participating in the various hearings organised by the European Parliament and the discussions in the audiovisual working group of the Council of Ministers."
"Since the developments concerning creative content online take place at a rapid pace, there are no consolidated practices on which to base compulsory legislation at this stage."
"At this point in time, such legislation at a European level would possibly jeopardise the development of new business models and the cooperation processes among stakeholders."
"For this reason, a recommendation seems the most appropriate means to facilitate the shift of the creative content sector to the online environment."
"Mr Toubon made the interesting suggestion that maybe there should be a working group on small collecting societies, and I think that this is a very excellent idea."
"The Commission would be prepared to be a facilitator and try to find a role for small societies in the online world so we will take up his suggestion."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr Toubon has given a magnificent exposé on the problem in legal terms."
"This saves me from having to tackle this aspect."
"I should therefore like to look at this issue on a much more practical level."
"On the matter of copyright, the Directorate-General for Competition starts from the basis that authors have the same weight as the large multinational companies that manage the world of media."
"This is not true."
"Authors and performers are in fact workers."
"There may indeed be some stars - such as those who appear in magazines - who have some choice."
"However, the vast majority of authors, performers and creators do not have this choice."
"Their position is virtually the same as that of workers organised through their copyright societies."
"To claim that these thousands, tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands of authors, who work in Europe on a daily basis and who obtain their income through their societies of authors, operate as if they were multinational companies is a fiction that has nothing to do with reality."
"If we fail to start from the basis that the current European societies of authors each represent the specific interests of thousands of members and that they act as such, we will never grasp the reality."
"I believe that the Commission is probably just doing its job, but when it talks about studies, I start to feel rather concerned, because who is carrying out these studies, who is paying for these studies and what pressure groups are having an influence on them?"
"That is why, in the European Union, we have a democratic system between the Member States and within the Member States."
"It is the responsibility of the Members of the European Parliament to humbly assume the role of expressing, in this House, the social reality which is perhaps not found in offices or in major economic studies."
"We find ourselves in a situation whereby, if we are not careful, if we try to deregulate this sector as has been done in others, we will end up killing creation, which is one of our unique assets."
"Despite all its problems, Europe is characterised by great creation."
"We will end up with an audiovisual industry that is absolutely devoid of content; you can already see this in other countries."
"I therefore believe that, at this moment in time, some of our efforts must be devoted to providing these creators with an institutional system that allows them to take action."
"I believe that acting in the abstract, thinking that the little musician, the little composer can defend himself is absurd."
"If Beethoven were alive today and creating symphonies and if he were obliged to enter the international market in order to compete with the major music multinationals, he would die of hunger."
"His financial situation would be much worse than it was in the 18th and 19th centuries."
"I believe that this is a vital point that must be conveyed."
"Mr Toubon referred to our committee's decision to set up a working group on the protection of intellectual property."
"We hope that the Commission, and in particular Mr McCreevy, who has always been a great friend of this Committee on Legal Affairs, will be ready to cooperate with us, to convey their concerns, but also to listen."
"This working group will also listen to the viewpoints of the thousands of people who, at this moment in time, are humbly engaged in great intellectual work and who are allowing these audiovisual media that we are creating to be filled with content."
"If not, there is a real danger, as I have said, that we will create a great audiovisual system that is absolutely empty, that can only be occupied by advertisements and that has no specific content."
"As a result, Madam President, I believe that the proposal, the oral question and the motion for a resolution that we plan to table are aimed at reinforcing this independence and this unique identity of European culture, which cannot be replaced by any abstraction based on free competition."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, in 2004 the Committee on Legal Affairs held a hearing which focused, among other things, on the role of collecting societies."
"Some artistes presented a very impressive case to demonstrate the problems facing them under the current system which operates via collecting societies."
"You then opted for the 'soft law' legislative - or rather non-legislative - approach, which has simply created more legal uncertainty in the interim, with the result that we face increasing complaints and irritations due to the lack of clarity in the situation."
"This is a real problem, Commissioner."
"The system which you have proposed will result in market concentration, benefiting the strong and ignoring, for example, the Convention on cultural diversity when it comes to Europe's art and culture."
"In this system, minority cultures, those that are not part of the mainstream or those that use minority languages will inevitably be damaged because the system simply does not take account of them."
"When we asked you, in the Committee on Legal Affairs, why you had not presented proposals such as those as outlined in the Lévai report in Parliament, you said that the market would move in this direction anyway and you therefore saw no need for any change here."
"Commissioner, the conflicting judgments that we have recently witnessed demonstrates that this was not the right approach."
"What we need now, if we want to protect creative potential, is a future-oriented solution."
"I think that we will also have to give more thought to the binding of rights generally."
"Is this still sustainable in the long term in its old form, in this hardware-oriented form?"
"Will we still achieve the necessary goals, or will this not work?"
"Commissioner, I do not believe that further studies and hearings are the way forward."
"Unfortunately, we have seen that it is always the same people who are invited, and that they represent the giants in the market, not the small players whose opinion is consequently ignored."
"We need a different approach and a clear legislative proposal as to how the collecting societies can and should protect these rights and assets."
"(PL) Madam President, last year the European Parliament responded by way of a resolution to the Commission's 2005 recommendation concerning cross-border collective management of copyright."
"In its resolution Parliament called for it to be made quite clear that this recommendation only applies to the sale of music recordings on the Internet."
"We also called for immediate appropriate consultation with the interested parties."
"In addition, we asked for a draft flexible framework text to be submitted to Parliament and to the Council concerning collective management of copyright and associated rights in relation to cross-border on-line music services."
"The management of copyright and associated rights in relation to online music services remains a complicated and problematic issue, in spite of the binding directive on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright in the information society."
"The difficulties are mainly due to the lack of European licences."
"The unclear drafting of the recommendation is a particular concern."
"This means that the recommendation could perhaps also be applied to other online services containing recordings, such as broadcasting services."
"The consequent lack of clarity regarding the use of different licensing systems creates legal uncertainty and leads to undesirable consequences, notably for online broadcasting services."
"I am also sorry to note that the Commission has not taken account of Parliament's recommendations."
"The Commission has limited itself exclusively to monitoring and implementing the 2005 recommendations."
"In no way does this deal with the ongoing problems in the sector."
"Among other aspects, the Commission's policy reflects the decision taken in respect of the International Confederation of Societies of Authors and Composers."
"The Commission has excluded the possibility of any type of joint action by the societies, for instance regarding the proposal to create a transparent copyright system in Europe."
"This equates to leaving power in the hands of the oligarchy composed of the major companies that have entered into bilateral agreements with leading performers."
"It is to be expected that the result of this decision will be further restriction of choice and the disappearance of small firms from the market, to the detriment of cultural diversity."
"(CS) The current state of the digital content market is unsustainable, fragmented and rigid owing to monopolies."
"I am therefore pleased how in July the Commission at least shed some light on collective management."
"I am concerned about the unfair contractual terms and conditions not only for authors, but also for users."
"I should like to believe now that Czechs and other citizens of smaller countries will be able to purchase their favourite songs, digital books or television series over the Internet, for example from iTunes and other virtual trading houses, across borders, which is actually impossible today."
"I should like to believe that authors will be able freely to choose collective management from any Member State and compel the management to improve the quality of services and reduce operating costs."
"I hope that the collective management will be able in return to offer licenses unrestricted by the borders of the home state, including European licenses, but it is not so easy."
"I do not believe that the Commission's July foray into the wasps' nest will really produce systemic changes in the digital content market."
"I would now like to ask the Commission to request an independent study of collective management as a whole and to submit a legislative text to Parliament containing an overhaul of the entire system on the basis of a proper analysis of all the specific aspects of this problem."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, you have shown that you are ready to listen and to pay attention to these issues."
"However, I would just like to put one question to you and to make a request."
"The question concerns the manner in which Parliament is to be involved with the work you are proposing to undertake. The request is that if a platform is put in place it seems essential to me that the findings, its findings, should not be decided in advance but should be the product of a true debate and I also think that the members of this platform should be representative of our economic and cultural diversity."
"Member of the Commission. - I would like to thank the honourable Members for the range of their discussions."
"The regulators should not take all the decisions."
"The Commission actively encourages the development of the online licensing market for music, but premature legislative intervention, without full analysis of market needs and trends, would not appear the best way of developing a healthy online retail market in Europe."
"However, if it becomes apparent that the Commission's current interventions cannot deliver an online licensing model fit for the 21st century, then we will consider a different approach."
"It is now essential that all stakeholders, authors, performers, publishers, collecting societies and the record companies, get together and find a licensing structure that will enable the emergence of more legal online services while preserving a decent outcome for authors."
"Mr Medina Ortega has alluded to the fact that it is in everybody's interest that we have a healthy cultural industry throughout Europe."
"I think I speak for everybody in the Commission when I say that is our goal."
"I think it is also proper to try to introduce a system whereby everybody benefits from creativity and culture - including the artists - and everybody can enjoy it at a reasonable cost."
"So that is what we are all trying to achieve."
"We can have differences of opinion as to how we go about it."
"Over the last number of years I have heard expressions of different viewpoints, both inside this House and from groups outside Parliament."
"We do not always agree on how we could achieve those objectives, but I think we all know what we want to try and do."
"When I suggested the platform - and it was referred to by Mr Gauzès and others - it was the need to bring together the small and big players in a particular forum, and particularly the smaller collecting societies who, I understand, feel left out in this particular debate."
"So that is what I was proposing there."
"I think our goals are the same."
"We certainly want to take all interests into account and arrive at a proper licensing system that is a model which is fit for the world of today, not the world of maybe 40 or 50 years ago."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 25 September 2008."
"'IASCF: Review of the constitution - Public Accountability and the Composition of the IASB Proposals for Change' (debate)"
"The next item is the oral question by Pervenche Berès on IASCF: 'Review of the constitution - Public Accountability and the Composition of the IASB Proposals for Change' (B6-0463/2008)."
"Madam President, Commissioner, when it comes to financial reporting standards this Parliament now knows that you have a certain capacity for creativity, for setting up 'do nothing' committees."
"When at the start of this legislative term we questioned you about the statutes and role of EFRAG you invented the Roundtable and everybody now knows that it has not fulfilled its remit."
"Faced with proposals from the IASCF trustees about establishing a monitoring group, and as soon as some of the members failed to agree with your plans, you put forward the idea of setting up an international accounting advisory group."
"Parliament has now got used to your practices."
"When we informed you of this, by taking the initiative for a report on questions relating to IASCF governance, you rushed off to officiate, with your Japanese and American colleagues and with IOSCO, by preparing a press release on 7 November 2007 in which you claimed to be arbitrating in all the problems of governance, rather than awaiting the opportunity to be able to act on the legitimacy and authority of a position taken by the democratic representation of the European Union, or to spell it out the European Parliament."
"When Parliament drew up this position on the initiative of our rapporteur, Mr Radwan, you preferred in March to put the debate back to April for reasons that concern you and for which you take sole responsibility."
"When, on the strength of the April proposals, you had the momentum and the opportunity to officiate on what could have been the European Union's position on the international stage, and to do so on the basis of paragraph 9 of this resolution, which I now read: 'notes that in the abovementioned combined statement of 7 November 2007 the Commission seeks - as it did when it concluded a roadmap with the US authorities in April 2006 - to preempt solutions where it would be preferable, in the interests of effectiveness and legitimacy, to have an open consultation process and debate, to which this resolution could be a contribution', you preferred, in the secrecy of your private cabinets and departmental offices, to devise a solution without consulting either the Council or this Parliament."
"Commissioner, what have you been doing since 24 April, when we voted on this resolution?"
"Back then we asked you about the role of the IMF and the World Bank."
"Other Members since have questioned you about the activities of the Basel Committee, the European supervisors, in the monitoring-group structures for the IASCF."
"Faced with such a problem you have yet again come up with a 'do nothing' committee, namely the international accounting advisory group."
"You tell us that this monitoring group should not be increased in size because that would dilute its authority and we would no longer have the power to guide the trustees."
"The proposal from the trustees rests on a line-up of seven members."
"Your proposal is based on a team of five, plus one observer and two members whom you would put on this consultative body, this international committee of auditors."
"Our proposal is to consolidate the group of seven being suggested by the trustees by including what is necessary."
"The argument as to the number is irrelevant since, at the same time, there is a further proposal to increase the number of members on the International Accounting Standards Board itself, thereby taking it from 14 to 16."
"We therefore have two things to say to you today, Commissioner."
"Firstly, if you really want to reform the governance of the IASB then we are in agreement, for we were the ones that asked you to do it, but please consult us, involve us, and do it from the start, not at the last moment."
"Do not tell us that you had urgent work to do in August, when we have been asking you for this since last autumn and you have been aware of Parliament's position since April."
"What is more, we are telling you that the IASB and IASCF work programmes include a second phase in which the entire instrument has to be reviewed, including the conditions under which the IASCF is to be set up, and we would suggest that you make the most of this moment to lay down clear conditions for the stability and governance of this entire mechanism so that we will finally have a system of governance that is equal to the issues that we are faced with today."
"Or to put it in clearer terms, what accounting standards do we need in order to establish a financial market where the interpretation of the financial reporting standards is on the same wavelength as the economic reality of the situation that is facing us here and elsewhere?"
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, the need to improve the governance of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) is something that has long been recognised by the Commission, Parliament and the Council of Ministers."
"I have highlighted the importance of this on numerous occasions."
"I have been critical of the IASB's lack of adequate consultation and feedback procedures, as well as the lack of impact assessments for new standards."
"Given the IASB's de facto role as a global standards setter, it is imperative its governance procedures are up to the highest standards."
"I want to get to the situation where we can adopt IFRS standards in the EU with full confidence that the process and content of these standards are exemplary."
"That is why, when I learnt that a revision of the constitution of the IASCF was envisaged, I set as a priority the improvement of governance."
"You will recall last November, with my counterparts in the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Financial Services Agency of Japan and the International Organisation for Securities Commissions, I proposed the creation of a monitoring board to ensure the public accountability of the IASCF."
"We have made some good progress on this."
"The IASCF has recently proposed modifying its constitution in order to enter into a formal relationship with the proposed monitoring board."
"It accepts that this Board must have the power to participate in the nomination process of the IASCF Trustees and have the ultimate power to approve their appointment."
"It also accepts that the monitoring board will be able to address any area of work of either the Trustees or the IASB and refer them for consideration by the IASCF Board of Trustees or by the IASB."
"The IASCF intends to reach a conclusion about these matters in early October, with changes to the IASCF constitution entering into force from 1 January 2009."
"This will, in particular, allow the monitoring board to become operational early in 2009."
"That is why I consider the time is now ripe to firm up on these proposals."
"If we leave it too late, we will not be able to reopen the governance issues."
"The ongoing financial turmoil emphasises the need to ensure that accounting standards reflect the objectives of prudential supervision and financial stability."
"It has not proven possible to get agreement to have bodies such as the ECB in the monitoring board."
"As a compromise, we could envisage, in these new arrangements, that there would be an international accounting advisory group to advise the monitoring group on prudential and financial stability matters."
"This group should include both the European Central Bank and the Committee of European Securities Regulators and, no doubt, other relevant international bodies."
"Again, I am grateful to this House for having emphasised the importance of prudential supervision and financial stability in its resolution of 24 April."
"In exercising its eventual role in the monitoring board, the Commission must also represent the other European institutions, in particular this House."
"To do so effectively, I would propose to draw up consultation procedures with the European Parliament."
"These procedures could, if necessary, be formalised in an appropriate form."
"I have endeavoured to ensure that key MEPs were kept informed by my services about the evolution of this debate."
"It was, however, brought to my attention today that there was a lapse in this communication."
"Apparently, in preparing our position, events that took place towards the end of July were not communicated by my services in the usual manner, because of the holiday period."
"I know that there is widespread dissatisfaction in this House about the fact that you were not properly consulted during the elaboration of our proposals."
"I am also dissatisfied by this fact and have given clear and firm instructions to my services not to repeat such a mistake again."
"I believe my Director-General has been in contact with Mrs Berès to try and explain this omission."
"I hope that this oversight will not jeopardise the common goal we have both been striving for, namely, a better governance regime for the IASB."
"With some further improvements, I am confident that these enhancements to the IASCF's governance will improve the quality of accounting standards and ensure that they meet the needs of all stakeholders - including the European Union, which to this date remains the largest user of IFRS."
"The reform of the IASCF governance currently being contemplated represents a step change in the accountability of this body to public authorities, something this House has repeatedly called for."
"I appeal to the European Parliament to support our proposals as the best way to ensure that this reform achieves real influence."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have just heard the Chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs express the real views of those Members who are interested in this issue."
"As has been underlined, everyone is aware of the importance of financial accounting standards and of the reforms that have been announced."
"The time has now come, Commissioner, to clarify and put into action the comments that you have made."
"I have a suggestion to make: this resolution is a rigorous one and it needs to be, but there is no need to kill the sinner."
"What we could in fact do is to take a few days respite in order to establish a protocol between the Commission and Parliament that would clearly define the extent to which Parliament has to be kept informed, its level of involvement in this matter and the positions that it takes up, and to this end we need to postpone the vote for a few days."
"This is the proposal that the Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats will put forward tomorrow, namely that the vote on the resolution be postponed in order that Parliament and the Commission might be able to cooperate properly on this important subject."
"Obviously if nothing is forthcoming during this interval, and in order to make up for lost time and the possible lack of information, we shall be obliged to vote on the resolution that is being tabled today, with all the tough decisions that this will entail."
"In the midst of the difficult circumstances that are now being imposed on us by the current financial crisis, which is not something totally unfamiliar as far as accounting standards are concerned, I hope that everyone of us will understand that we have to find a quick and practical solution that will help steer developments in the required direction."
"Madam President, I have to admit to the Commissioner that I am really quite confused by what has been going on with this case."
"I had heard nothing about it until literally this week and suddenly I get deluged with approaches, both from the IASCF and from the Commission, trying to persuade me one way or the other as to whether the IMF should be included in the monitoring group."
"I think this is a rather unsatisfactory way to proceed with what is essentially almost a piece of legislation, so I would ask the Commissioner if we could not delay this a little, get it sorted out and come back to it perhaps at the October mini-plenary."
"I would like to suggest that I do not see that adding the IMF and the World Bank to this monitoring group would make it that unwieldy."
"It seems to me they would cover the rest of the world in a rather satisfactory manner."
"I do not really see that there is a need then to have yet another accounting advisory group that advises the monitors that monitor things."
"It is like the house that Jack built."
"I wonder whether they could not in any case consult quite readily, unofficially, if they ever need to do so."
"I wonder if we could have some discussions over the next couple of weeks and end up with a vote, possibly in a more satisfactory manner, at the mini-plenary in October."
"(CS) Commissioner, today's world financial crisis reveals how important fair value, the real value of a company, is for the healthy functioning of financial markets."
"This is vital information for shareholders and creditors."
"A monitoring committee could make a contribution to better transparency and comparability of financial reporting and thus to the personal responsibility of shareholders for correct economic decisions."
"International standardisation clearly leads to the development of cross-border capital markets and, therefore, in the interests of stability, the monitoring group should also implement preventive measures against cyclical trends and help to prevent systemic risk."
"Of course, the proposal to establish the group has not been subject to questioning."
"Its powers have not been explained, for example whether it will also have a supervisory function."
"I also consider it important that every country should have a delegate in the proposed monitoring group, which must also include representatives of important institutions so as to reflect the size of the most important world monetary areas, cultural diversity and the interests of the developed and developing economies and international institutions that are answerable to public bodies."
"It is a pity that Parliament was not consulted in advance as a matter of course."
"author. - (FR) Madam President, Commissioner, what have you done since 24 April about taking account of Parliament's position?"
"What have you done since 24 April about debating with Parliament on finding effective solutions for handling the governance of the trustees?"
"We know full well that the IASB is a drunken boat at the hands of auditors who have produced these so-called 'fair values', and no one knows how they have been elected when there is no longer a market to supervise."
"As a result, today we are being asked to discuss the subject of IASCF governance."
"You are proposing to us in haste - and at a time when we are putting to you quite reasonable solutions whereby the governance of these structures might be incorporated into a global and accountable system of governance - that advisory committees should be set up."
"Is this reasonable?"
"I do not believe that this question will be solved simply by involving Parliament in this or that stage of the process."
"The proposal that you are putting to us for the governance of the IASCF is not satisfactory."
"We look forward to receiving another proposal from you and possibly will have to await the second phase of the consultation exercise and, if necessary, the review of this governance process."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, at my stage in life, I do not get very surprised too often, so I am not the least bit surprised at what goes on here in the European Parliament and the views of some people."
"Can I just say in all of this particular debate, let us just remember one small thing. The IASCF and its underlying constituent body, the IASB, is an independent organisation."
"(Inaudible interruption from the floor)"
"I just want to put the facts on the table."
"They are totally independent but they have de facto become the accounts-standard-setting body for the globe because IFRS, which came out of the IASB, has now become the de facto worldwide accountancy standard."
"I have to point out that this is an independent body; since we in Europe have adopted IFRS - a decision made before my time by the Commission and to the satisfaction of the European Parliament - we are the largest constituency that has IFRS today."
"This position may change as the world moves over more to IFRS."
"We might not then be the largest any more, but we certainly are the largest current user of IFRS."
"For some time, with the support of the European Parliament, we have been endeavouring to improve the governance arrangements of the IASCF trustees, noting that they are an independent organisation."
"We have made some progress in the past, and the IAS recently announced that they were going to have a review of their own constitution."
"So we are availing ourselves of that opportunity to make our submission."
"We have no right to impose our view on the IASCF - this is up to the independent trustees - but we are making it our submission to improve the governance arrangements."
"I would just point out this basic fact before everybody, as we might say in Ireland, 'loses the run of themselves' in this particular area."
"That is the de facto and de jure situation."
"The IAS trustees are intending to bring in their new governance arrangements, having considered all the submissions, in early October."
"The closing date for making our submission has actually passed by a few days. It was to be 20 September, and the date today is 24 September."
"We waited to submit our final result."
"We have been in informal consultations with them for some time, so they know, really, what we are going to propose, but we waited for Parliament's resolution for the courtesy of doing that."
"So we will have to submit our formal proposals in the next few days."
"It is entirely a matter for Parliament as to what you want to do with this particular recommendation."
"Mr Gauzès has put forward a reasonable approach about taking a few extra days perhaps to work out a protocol about Parliament's participation in the process which I am endeavouring to set up."
"As regards the monitoring board idea, which we announced last November, it is not possible for everybody to be represented on the monitoring board."
"It will not be acceptable to the trustees of the IASCF, and, if they say absolutely no, then that is that."
"So we proposed a kind of a way around this by having relevant people, relevant bodies, in this advisory group."
"I am not hung up on any particular strong views as to how it should be organised or who should be on it."
"I do not have any views about that."
"I only learned today that my services have not been in constant contact with relevant Members here in the European Parliament in the past month or so."
"This was news to me, because I thought my officials would have been keeping contact the whole time with the people here who take an interest in this particular subject, but I find out today that did not occur."
"In my former remarks, I said that I regretted this, and that I had given directions that it should not happen again; we want to cooperate."
"No more can I do."
"Mr Purvis, it is not as though Parliament can delay until any time it likes - mid-October or beyond - but if I want the European Commission to have a say, I have to submit our formal proposals regarding our ideas about governance to the IASF board forthwith."
"They will not agree with some of them."
"As Mr John Purvis says, he has been lobbied for the last two days by various actors in this particular scene as to what they want to achieve."
"From reading the resolution as it is drafted, there is one definite peculiarity about this, which I think should not go unnoticed, particularly by Mrs Berès who has long been an advocate of greater governance and accountability of this particular IASB body."
"The peculiarity of the resolution is that it would do exactly what the trustees actually want and reverse what we are trying to do in getting more governance."
"That is the peculiarity, but the matter of the resolution is entirely a matter for the European Parliament, not a matter for me."
"I would just make that particular comment in passing, because there are people among the IASB trustees who are not too anxious to accommodate some of the more far-reaching governance arrangements that we are proposing for them."
"There will be a fair degree of resistance."
"We are reliant on the existing trustees to take account of our concerns and to improve these governance arrangements as we think fit."
"We are not in the position, because we only submit these things, to make demands and say it has to be like this, but we have had contacts and they know what we are going to propose."
"They are not happy with some of what we are going to propose."
"I am aware of that, but we are trying to get this improved governance."
"Not that I am ever surprised by what happens in the political arena, as I have been well over 30 years in this field, but it will be ironic if, after we have got this far over the years in getting our way on two things - namely that the IFRS has become an international standard and that, now, as people here know, the United States is proposing that IFRS be available to US companies (something I predicted would happen about two years ago to the relevant members of the relevant Parliament committee and was more or less laughed at that this would ever occur, and it has) - this body that has been demanding with us and pressing us to get increased governance and accountability from this particular body is, at this particular stage and according to some people, actually going to do quite the opposite."
"I just think it is a little bit ironic, but I hope I have explained this as best I can."
"I have received one motion for a resolution pursuant to Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 25 September 2008."
"Agenda of the next sitting : see Minutes"
"Closure of the sitting"
"(The sitting was closed at 11.45 p.m.)"
"Opening of the sitting"
"(The sitting was opened at 10 a.m.)"
"Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (AFSJ) 2007 (motions for resolutions tabled): see Minutes"
"Transfers of appropriations: see Minutes"
"Social package (Second part: Cross-border healthcare) (debate)"
"The next item is the statements of the Council and of the Commission concerning the Social Package (Second part: Cross-border healthcare)."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner Vassiliou, Mr Bowis, co-rapporteurs, draftsmen of the opinion, ladies and gentlemen, I thank the European Parliament for agreeing to defer our working meeting originally scheduled for the beginning of this month."
"As you know, the French Presidency attaches great importance to consultation and dialogue on legislation."
"I felt it was essential to hold an initial exchange of views with my ministerial colleagues at the informal Angers Council on 8 and 9 September before coming before you to set out not, of course, the French position, but the position of the Council of 27 health ministers."
"That first exchange of views, like the initial work done in the Council's working group on health, will not enable me to answer all your questions on this highly complex and varied subject but I am certain our sitting today will give the Commissioner responsible for health a chance to explain the European Commission's major decisions and allow me to share the Council's first impressions with you."
"The Council supports the adoption of a directive on cross-border healthcare and patients' rights."
"It would be inconceivable to leave the decisions in this area solely in the hands of the Court of Justice of the European Communities."
"In my view, which I share with my colleagues, that should not be taken as a criticism of the Court or even of the content of its judgments, which often bring about major advances for patients."
"Nonetheless, it would be advisable for health policy in Europe to be developed by the two co-legislators, i.e. you and us, as the outcome of a political dialogue and a democratic process."
"It must be our common objective to build up a legislative framework that can contribute toward legal certainty."
"Second point: in Angers, the delegations from the 27 countries all praised the quality of the work done over these past months and agreed that they had been listened to during the recent consultations."
"Commissioner Vassiliou was warmly thanked for that at the informal Council meeting."
"Indeed, the Slovenian Presidency will no doubt have informed you that the Council was very hesitant about the initial version of the text, the broad lines of which had been presented to the EPSCO Council of 19 December 2007."
"Only a small minority of states had supported that version."
"In fact, there was similarly great opposition to it in your Parliament, as MEPs confirmed to me during my preparatory consultations with the French Presidency in Strasbourg, Brussels and Paris."
"There is no doubt that the political dialogue Commissioner Vassiliou started as soon as she took office helped establish a sound basis for negotiation and the Council welcomes that."
"Third point: with regard to the timetable, this proposal that the college of Commissioners adopted on 2 July came too late for us to be able to envisage a first reading during our Presidency, but we will press on with negotiations in the Council as far as we can, while entering into a political dialogue with the European Parliament."
"In that vein, the public health working group has already considered the directive on several occasions."
"It will be meeting again tomorrow to continue examining the text article by article."
"In this area as with our other political priorities, France will play its part in the presidential trio by working closely with the Czech Republic and Sweden."
"For the record, let me remind you that the subject of European health in the service of the patients has been a priority of our common 18-month programme."
"Fourth point: regarding the scope of the draft directive, I know from talking to MEPs on the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection when they were in Paris last May that many of you regret the decision to confine this text solely to patient mobility and not to address the question of the mobility of health professionals."
"Given that I myself was an MEP at the time of the vote on the report by Evelyne Gebhardt and left Parliament just a few days before the debate on Bernadette Vergnaud's report, I well understand the reasons for that regret."
"Excluding health services from the directive on services in the internal market leaves a grey area that is not entirely covered by the current proposal for a directive, which only addresses patient mobility."
"One could even say that the proposal for a directive has more to do with the wish to incorporate and adapt Court of Justice case law than with excluding health services from the services directive and therefore with the demands by some MEPs for a specific sectoral instrument covering health services."
"There was no debate on that subject by the health ministers."
"Yet, in that regard, it is all a question of timetables and the European Commission's decision can be explained by the need to respond as rapidly as possible to the challenges that exist in the area of patient mobility, which already covers a very wide field."
"It is certain that a more broadly-based directive that included the mobility of health professionals would have had no chance of being adopted before the elections next June."
"Fifth point: regarding the content of the text, we have not yet addressed all the proposed provisions."
"Nevertheless, the Presidency can say at this stage that in the Council's view prior authorisation for hospital care is a key question for EU Member States."
"It could even be described as the fundamental concern of health ministers."
"During the working lunch on the subject organised in Angers on 9 September, ministers who spoke were in favour of moving towards a better balance between the individual rights of patients to mobility and maintaining national regulatory and planning powers for the benefit of all."
"The text reflects that improved balance, in particular by restoring the need for prior authorisation for hospital care."
"It is not a question of calling into question the case law of the Court of Justice, which specified how the principles of free movement set out in the Treaty applied to the health field, but of the need to incorporate in positive legislation the balance that the Court has already established in its case law between the principle of free movement and Member States' regulatory capacity."
"In fact, it distinguished between outpatient care, where the affiliation system cannot require prior authorisation, and hospital treatment, where the requirement of prior authorisation appears to be a necessary and reasonable measure."
"At a time of serious budgetary constraints - ageing, technical progress - Member States must be able to be fully in charge of the care they provide in this respect, in particular hospital planning."
"As the Court itself recognised, one purpose of that planning is to ensure adequate and permanent access to a balanced range of quality hospital treatment throughout a national territory."
"It also forms part of the effort to control costs and to avoid, where possible, any waste of human, financial or technical resources."
"I also want to point out that the requirement of prior authorisation ensures that cross-border care can be provided as soon as it is medically justified."
"In fact, the regulation on the coordination of social security systems already recognises this: authorisation may not be refused in the event that the same treatment is not available within a reasonable time."
"Nor must we forget that prior authorisation is also a protective measure for patients, since it ensures that any care provided in another Member State will be reimbursed."
"Lastly, even if we keep to what we regard as the correct interpretation of the Court's case law, the directive would still offer great added value by clarifying the rights of patients, providing them with the necessary information and ensuring that this case law is interpreted in a uniform manner and is therefore applied universally and consistently in all the Member States of the European Union."
"Thank you for your attention. I will be taking the floor again at the end of the debate to answer your questions."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I have already had the opportunity to discuss this proposal at length with various stakeholders and players in the decision-making process."
"You may recall that I presented the proposal to the Committee on the Environment and Public Health upon its adoption by the college and had a fruitful exchange of views."
"And I have also had the chance to exchange views with various national parliaments and, of course, the Member States in the context of the recent informal Health Council in Angers."
"It now gives me great pleasure to have this discussion, and I am looking forward to it with you, the honourable Members, in plenary."
"I take this opportunity to thank Mrs Bachelot-Narquin for the support and the chance she gave me to discuss this issue at length with the ministers."
"I would like to put the proposal on patients' rights into context."
"Following the numerous discussions of the European Court of Justice on the question of the inherent right of European citizens under the Treaty to seek health care in the Member State of their choice and following the specific request by the European Council and the European Parliament alike to present a proposal to regulate the right after the health-care-related provisions had been taken out - and quite rightly so - of the Services Directive proposal, the Commission adopted the proposal on patients' rights in cross-border health care on 2 July."
"It is without doubt the most important initiative on health of this present Commission."
"Its aim is to provide patients with better opportunities and access to health care, regardless of their place of residence while fully respecting national responsibilities over health-care organisation."
"It has three main objectives: first, to clarify the conditions under which patients will be entitled to seek cross-border health care and be reimbursed and to make it effective, if this is the best solution for their particular situation; second, to ensure high-quality and safe cross-border health care throughout Europe; and, third, to foster European cooperation between health-care systems."
"It is based, as I said, on the Court of Justice jurisprudence."
"It is fully in line with the Treaty, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, with the competences of the Member States for the organisation and delivery of health services and medical care."
"The proposal is structured around three main areas."
"First, it clarifies and reaffirms the common principles of all EU health systems: universality, equity, access to good-quality health care, and solidarity."
"It recalls the overarching principle underlined by the Treaty and the Court that the Member State on whose territory the health care is provided is fully responsible for setting the rules and ensuring compliance with these common principles."
"To help the Member States translate this principle in more transparent terms, we have proposed to better clarify the objectives in terms of quality and safety standards for health care provided on their territory to patients from other Member States."
"We also introduced a provision so as to ensure that patients from other Member States shall enjoy equal treatment with the nationals of the Member State of treatment."
"Second, the directive clarifies the entitlements of patients and related conditions to receive health care in another Member State."
"For instance, for people in border regions, it may be easier to seek health care abroad rather than travelling long distances to the nearest relevant domestic health facility."
"The added value of cross-border health care is also evident for people seeking highly specialised treatment, which only a very limited number of practitioners in Europe can provide."
"This might be the case, for example, for rare diseases."
"The reality, however, is that most patients are simply unaware that they have the right to seek health care in another EU country, and that they are entitled to reimbursement for such treatment."
"And, even if they are aware of this right, the rules and procedures are often far from clear."
"This is what we aim to clarify with this new directive: patients will all get the same clear information and guarantees on cross-border health care."
"In practice, as long as the treatment is covered under their national health-care system, patients will be allowed to receive that treatment abroad and be reimbursed up to the cost of the same or similar treatment at home."
"We are also clarifying that, under specified circumstances, Member States are entitled to introduce limits on the reimbursement or payment of hospital health care obtained abroad through prior authorisation, if there is a clear risk - even potential - of undermining the national health system."
"In addition to this, the Directive clarifies the definitions of hospital and non-hospital care and in that way simplifies the procedures and conditions to access cross-border health care."
"In such a context, I would like to stress that we have maintained the possibility to expand the concept of 'hospital care' to some health care which does not necessarily require hospitalisation, but which is by nature costly or needs a heavy infrastructure to be properly delivered."
"Third, the directive establishes a new framework for European cooperation in areas that we have identified as key areas for the future and where we must act together at EU level to better meet the challenges ahead of us."
"This is done in line with the principles I mentioned earlier through streamlined and improved cooperation, through common technical guidance and through a systematic search for best practices."
"This framework will provide for developing enhanced future collaboration at European level in areas such as European reference networks, with a view to pooling together expertise, knowledge and medical skills, both for applied medical research and for diagnosis and treatment."
"In particular, this will be very important in the field of rare diseases, the provision of new therapies, as well as the rapid spread of new health technologies."
"The second area is health-technology assessment, whereby the most efficient therapies will be identified at EU level by the best experts from the Member States, and spread in order to promote their use."
"Indeed, as regards new therapies and their high costs, the resources available being limited, we must ensure that they will be chosen and used in the most efficient possible way."
"The third area is e-Health, where it is time to promote technical requirements to ensure interoperability at all levels and help to establish - at least - e-Health as an integral part of health-care services of tomorrow."
"Fourthly, there is a need for a wider approach at EU level on the collection of health data related to cross-border health care in order to better monitor the effects of the proposed measures and enhance our epidemiological surveillance."
"Finally, there is the facilitation of the recognition of medical prescriptions in all Member States."
"However, we must note that prescriptions issued in another Member State will be reimbursed by the patient's country of origin, only if the medicine is approved and eligible for reimbursement in his country of origin."
"Let us also be clear that this initiative is not about harmonising health-care systems."
"It is not about changing roles in the management of health care."
"Member States are responsible for deciding how to organise their respective systems, what benefits they provide to their citizens and what treatments and medicines they will pay for."
"This will remain the case."
"For now and for the future, what we want with this draft legislation is to grant patients the opportunities and information to access the safest, best-quality and most suitable treatment wherever that treatment is available in Europe."
"More cooperation between health systems will also create more solidarity and more health-care availability."
"The aim of the proposed legislation is, indeed, to pave the way for better health care across Europe."
"The directive is already being discussed, as was said by Mrs Bachelot-Narquin, in the Council, and I hope that the discussions will proceed swiftly in Parliament as well and that ultimately they will bear fruit."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, we all know that question on the doorstep: what does Europe do for me?"
"Here is an answer: Europe is providing a new opportunity for patients."
"That is good news; we just have to make sure it works, and we will work together - the three institutions, and certainly within this Parliament - to make it work."
"But we are talking about court judgments."
"We are not talking about a blank sheet of paper, so we are not starting from afresh."
"We have to take into account those judgments."
"Those judgments, in laymen's terms, are that, if you are facing undue delay for treatment, you have the right to go to another Member State, to have that treatment and have the bill sent back home, so long as the cost is comparable and so long as the treatment is normally available."
"That is straightforward."
"When I produced my patient mobility report in this Parliament, it was overwhelmingly accepted."
"Above all, we said, this must be a decision of politicians, and not of lawyers."
"Mrs Bachelot-Narquin, to quote Jean Giraudoux, 'No poet has ever interpreted nature as freely as a lawyer interprets the truth.'"
"That is why we want politicians and not lawyers interpreting this."
"That is why we want legal certainty, so that everyone knows where they stand: governments, health services, patients, doctors."
"And it is why we must make it work for patients and for health services."
"It must be an opportunity and not a nightmare back home for health-service managers."
"So we have questions."
"We have questions that the patient has the right to have answers to."
"Do I qualify?"
"If I do, how do I proceed?"
"What are the checks that I can carry out on where I might be going and who the doctor might be?"
"What is the choice?"
"What is the confidentiality requirement?"
"And what happens if something goes wrong?"
"Those are all questions for which we must find the answer."
"And then there are issues we have to discuss among ourselves; some of them have been raised already."
"Firstly, prior authorisation."
"My instinct is that, for in-patient hospital care, it is fair to have prior authorisation."
"The Court did not say that this was wrong in itself; it said it is wrong to refuse it under certain circumstances, so we need to look at that very carefully."
"We also need to look at the issue of prescriptions."
"Yes, I understand that the home state must have the decision on what is prescribed, but if you are prescribed a course of drugs as part of your treatment in another Member State and you go back home and they say you cannot have the rest of that course, where does that leave the patient?"
"That is the sort of question we have to answer."
"Another issue is reimbursement."
"The patient does not want to have to go with a pocketful of cash."
"There must be a way of having the bill sent back home, I believe through a central clearing house."
"But this is a measure for patients - not for services, that is for another day."
"It is patients who are at the centre of this - patients, not lawyers - and it is for all patients, not just for a few."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are speaking today about a proposal that truly does focus on people in the European Union, namely patients."
"I am very grateful to the Commissioner for her introduction, but I also wish to express my gratitude to Mr Kyprianou for all the groundwork he has done at a difficult time."
"Why do I call it a difficult time?"
"Because in many instances the Member States are still the last fossils left in this European Union, cast in stone, failing to understand that people are the focal point and believing that the world revolves around them and their systems."
"That is not the case."
"The focus is on patients, and they are the weakest links in our society, because they are ill and infirm."
"If we talk about patient mobility today, knowing that it is actually a right in the internal market, which means that it ought to have applied for more than twenty years, we should consider whether this is a timely debate and whether the Member States are abreast of the times."
"I tell you they are not!"
"If the Eurobarometer is showing us today that 30% of all people in the European Union are unaware of their right to obtain treatment outside their own country, this means that all the Member States have been getting it wrong."
"They have not informed people of their rights; they have not been telling them what they are entitled to do and which options are open to patients."
"Yes, I share the view of Mr Bowis and others here, and the Commissioner too, that the Member States should certainly retain their autonomous health systems."
"We have no wish to interfere with that, but we also want to ensure that patients have freedom of movement."
"In connection with Member States' autonomy, I also recognise the need to be able to plan ahead, particularly when it comes to in-patient treatment."
"For this reason, authorisation will have to be one of the main topics of our discussions."
"Mr Bowis has already made that point."
"Networks and information points must ensure that patients know what they are allowed to do, but they must also know where the best treatment is available - whether it be in Germany or in Cyprus - so that patients also have the opportunity to be cured."
"If we succeed in improving the quality of health care and people's access to health care close to home, that will surely be a marvellous achievement, and no one need shop around anymore."
"That is what we really want."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Mr President, Commissioner Vassiliou, Minister Bachelot-Narquin, last week I attended a presentation of a new website on patient rights in all the EU languages, organised by my Danish colleague in the ALDE Group, Karen Riis-Jørgensen."
"There was a lady there from Denmark who very nearly might not have been."
"She had breast cancer and was not getting anywhere under the Danish system because she had the wrong number of tumours."
"If she had had five tumours she would have been treated, but she had seven and did not qualify under the criteria."
"So somehow or other she needed to get rid of two tumours before she could be helped."
"In short, an unending struggle."
"In the end she found help in Germany."
"She did it - she borrowed money from friends and family and went to Germany where she was helped."
"Her secondaries have now disappeared."
"She is cured, to the extent that you can ever say you are cured of cancer."
"It is inhuman to make someone like that, an individual, battle against a system at a time when they are sick, at a time when they are as weak as they could possibly be."
"That is putting the system before the patient."
"I find it totally unacceptable!"
"The Danes did in the end pay for much of the treatment, and all was well in the end."
"But what that woman had to go through was not exceptional; it happens all too often."
"So the European Commission's proposal is a huge step forward to help these patients and my group is very keen to support it."
"We also need to ensure that this debate does not turn into an ideological debate."
"This is not just another directive about health services."
"This is not about how to reform health in the European Union."
"It is not about whether or not there should be a free market in healthcare."
"To my mind it is not really a matter of subsidiarity either."
"The question is not whether the Member States prevail or the Union."
"No, the question is whether or not the patient wins out."
"That is all that matters really."
"We shall definitely have to talk about all these other things, perhaps argue about them robustly during the election campaign, but in my view and that of my group they are not our concern today."
"We are not trying to harmonise health, now is not the right time for that and maybe it cannot be done anyway."
"But we must learn to make use of the opportunities which the European Union offers us, the economies of scale we can benefit from, so that real specialist help can be provided to people with rare medical conditions."
"That possibility has of course existed for years, but now we really can make use of it and we must."
"To conclude: last week Parliament also held a meeting hosted by Dagmar Roth-Behrendt at which the European Patient Forum outlined its manifesto."
"I am glad to see patients banging the drum, because it is patient input that we need."
"We are poised now to take a democratic decision, following the lead given by the lawyers."
"But the decision will now be taken by the right people, namely the elected representatives of the people."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, it is a shame that we did not have the opportunity to discuss this particular issue during the previous session, when we were discussing the two previous legislative proposals."
"But, as the saying goes, better late than never."
"We are pleased to see that the Commission's proposals really do go in the direction requested by the European Parliament, in the direction in which the European Parliament encouraged the Commission to go in this regard."
"If Europe is really to be a Europe without borders then this has, first of all, to be in the area of healthcare."
"Guaranteeing healthcare to the inhabitants of our Member States will show that we have really done something for European taxpayers and voters."
"After all, what the average Pole, as well as the average Hungarian, Cypriot, Englishman and Italian are interested in, much more than the Lisbon Treaty, is whether they will be able to access healthcare abroad during their holidays, or even if they can make a special trip to take advantage of a highly specialised hospital."
"Finally, I believe that the measures that we are discussing today could really improve healthcare for foreigners and at the same time increase the authority of the EU, an authority that has recently been shaken by ideological debates and by trying to impose unwanted institutional solutions onto EU citizens."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, I welcome very much the statement that has been made, certainly, by Council on this particular directive and the limits and context of it."
"As Parliament's rapporteur on the update of the coordination of social security, and indeed its rapporteur on the implementing regulation, I have a very specific interest in this because questions about reimbursement - how it is provided, what information is given, the speed and method of it etc. - come within the scope of that particular regulation."
"I think that when we are talking about issues such as health care for people who are on holiday elsewhere in the European Union, we should remember that comes under the European Health Card and under the coordination of social security."
"That is clear."
"What this directive is aiming to do is to pick up some of the issues which are not necessarily dealt with in that particular regulation, and I think we need to be careful where the dividing line is on that."
"The question of prior authorisation has of course been an extremely important one."
"I think we need to be clear that we are not talking necessarily about an absolute right of patients to move and be treated within the European Union under their national systems, in terms of their national systems reimbursing them."
"It is a qualified right and I think we need to be clear on that."
"I think we also need to be clear that what this directive is proposing, as I understand it, is that what will be paid for is care that will be available under the national system, not new or different treatments, so that again qualifies the right that we are talking about in terms of this particular directive."
"There is no question that prior authorisation needs to be managed better, and that not only the patients but also the administrations involved need to understand what that is and how it should operate speedily in terms of medical need."
"That is the criterion set down by the Court: medical need."
"Administrations therefore need to reflect that, not necessarily their own cost basis."
"There is a lot to be welcomed in this directive, and issues around best practice, issues about quality, legal certainty, who is responsible, are also important."
"As John Bowis has mentioned, we also need to take steps forward on questions, for example, about continuing care or prescriptions which may not be valid in one Member State because of their own systems."
"But we also need to be careful - and this applies to the implementing regulation on 883, as it does to this - that we should not be in the business of helping patients make a profit by playing different systems off against each other."
"I do not think that health-care systems benefit from that whatsoever."
"I want to make clear on behalf of my group that increasing the amount of cross-border care is not of itself a goal."
"Mrs Roth-Behrendt said that most patients wish to be treated at home and have the quality and speed of treatment there, so increasing the amount in itself, as I say, is not a goal."
"A lot of claims are being made about the effects of trying to increase the amount of cross-border care which I think we need to be wary of, and I am glad the debate has reflected that."
"There are people who are arguing that this introduces competition, that this drives up national standards, and that we even need to open the market as a reason for actually increasing and encouraging cross-border health care."
"However, this Parliament has made its position very clear: health is not a service like car insurance."
"It has a very particular role and its users are not simply consumers, but people in need and potentially vulnerable."
"Many of those who tell us that increasing cross-border health care is a good thing will also reassure us that it only covers 2-3%."
"I want to know what the estimates are for the future and what the effect of this will be on the 98% of people who do not move and currently do not want to."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am sorry that I cannot share the optimism of fellows Members, since I am convinced that this directive may well do more for business than for health: a kind of Bolkestein directive, but on health."
"The crucial point for Europe has to be that every citizen must have the right to the best possible treatment in his or her own country; the sacrosanct right to be treated anywhere will otherwise mask the fact that treatment is not available at home - something that cannot be put down to questions of subsidiarity."
"It also masks the interests of those keen to speculate on health, providing big business for insurance companies and increasing costs for citizens as well as European health spending."
"A directive which is, in my view, mistaken, because it pays no attention to harmonisation, to the universal nature of the service that Europe must ensure, and is not based on the notion that health is a right which has to be guaranteed by the public sector and not left to people's ability to take out private insurance."
"The unions are rightly very concerned and we are concerned with them."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, the central feature of this package - travelling for non-hospital treatment outside the home country - is funding by the home country, but limited to the amount it would have cost there."
"So there are benefits in going to a country where treatment is cheaper, as long as it is better."
"Health tourists will have to find the difference between the costs where treated and the home country's base of provision."
"Yes, travel costs are paid, ultimately by the home country, but at the home country's own level, leaving the health tourist to find the treatment top-up and probably travel cost excess."
"The poorest cannot afford to do this and they are left with the lowest standard of treatment."
"The rich can do it, but they will probably go for private care anyway."
"Regarding waiting lists, if a country's health care is poor and expensive they will not be troubled by health tourists, but where it is cheap and good they could soon be overburdened."
"This, therefore, produces a two-tier health care system."
"Is that what they call an unintended consequence?"
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, four out of every hundred citizens in Europe go abroad for treatment; in my view, however, health tourism is symptomatic of local shortcomings and a lack of services."
"The Italian health service spends some EUR 40 million a year on Italians who go for treatment in other countries, and that obviously does not include private insurance."
"What are the reasons for this?"
"Without a doubt the very long waiting lists for services."
"In Italy, for instance, people have to wait 300 days for a prostate operation and very often a month or more for a CAT scan."
"Secondly, services such as dental treatment and cosmetic surgery have to be paid for in Italy and not in other countries."
"Thirdly - and I draw everyone's attention to this - people go abroad to take advantage of techniques such as artificial fertilisation which are prohibited or partly prohibited in their own countries, or which are absolutely illegal as in the case of purchase of live organs - while India is a sad example, there may well have been equally sad examples in other countries before their accession to the Union."
"All in all, people decide to embark on health tourism because high-quality and less expensive services are on offer; in many cases, however, I feel that supervision by the Union needs to be tightened up both as a guarantee for consumers and to ensure that competition is on an equal footing."
"The social context in which services are provided is often a mixture of public and private, in those countries which have recently acceded as well, and, Mrs Vassiliou, I would therefore recommend, over and above the principles on which you have focused, strict supervision of compliance with existing regulations which make the use of raw materials, the CE mark and conformity documents compulsory, because the salubriousness of medical devices and treatments has to be guaranteed."
"Let us not forget that there is always someone ..."
"The President cut off the speaker"
"(SV) Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, now we European parliamentarians have a chance to show that we are just that, European parliamentarians."
"That we are standing up for the Treaty and the rights it gives us."
"That we are legislating with the patients' best interests at heart, not to protect and support the protectionism which sometimes informs the debate."
"That we are committed to finding added value in cooperating to give our patients the best possible care, wherever that may be."
"The proposal that Commissioner Vassiliou has presented is a good starting point and to be applauded."
"We must complete what she has begun and ensure that no unnecessary bureaucratic obstacles are introduced."
"To spell it out, that means that the Member States have no right to prevent free movement without reason."
"Requirements for prior authorisation may be imposed only in exceptional cases - if they are specified on the Commission's list or if there is a risk of a mass exodus of patients which would undermine the health system."
"The idea that it might be imposed because so few patients have chosen to seek care abroad is highly unlikely."
"Thus the starting point is: no prior authorisation."
"Anything else would be contrary to the Treaty."
"The next stage in this work on creating the conditions for optimum care is to implement the directive correctly."
"Sick people should not have to go to court in order to validate their rights and to get unjustified requirements for prior authorisation overruled."
"The Court of Justice will rule in favour of freedom of movement, but at what cost in terms of money and the health of patients who have to seek enforcement of their rights every time!"
"I really hope that we can escape that experience, and I call on my fellow Members and the President-in-Office to help us;"
"I am quite convinced that our Commissioner will help us."
"(FR) Mr President, Mrs Bachelot-Narquin, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, following my own-initiative report on health services that Parliament adopted on 23 May 2007, the Commission is now proposing, as part of the social package, a directive addressed solely at patients' rights in regard to cross-border health care."
"I am, therefore, very sorry this text shows so little ambition and does not take account of the many internal challenges that need to be resolved in order to combat the growing inequalities in the health sector, such as the ageing population, social inequalities, geographical segregation and medical demography problems."
"On an issue that is so vital to the citizens of Europe, the Council and Parliament cannot, therefore, simply codify the Court of Justice's rulings."
"We need to find a certain balance, which will safeguard both the rights of patients - who are not merely consumers - to cross-frontier care, and equal access for all to quality care, with solidarity-based responsibility; to ensure social and territorial cohesion and respect for the principle of subsidiarity."
"There is still a worrying grey area in relation to definitions, such as prior authorisation and the concept of hospital care."
"We need clarification here, so as not to open the door to discrimination that might give rise to a two-speed health system within Europe instead of creating added value in Europe."
"Health has no price but does have a cost; the directive, on the other hand - and that is a good thing - reaffirms both the principle of subsidiarity and the need for closer cooperation to bring the medical research networks and patient information centres closer together."
"The debate will begin; it must be an in-depth and fruitful debate, rather than a precipitate one, and must be shared by all the players involved, with the object of constructing a genuine European social model."
"Mr President, why should a patient have to lose their sight waiting for a cataract operation in the UK, for instance, when it could be done in another Member State?"
"And why should a person waiting in agony for a hip operation not be able to take advantage of the lack of waiting lists in some Member States, sometimes at a lesser cost to the country of origin?"
"And why do some heart patients have to wait months to have surgery to unblock arteries when there really is no need?"
"If a clinician advises treatment, and this cannot be provided at home, then we need a legal framework to ensure that we can seek it elsewhere."
"All too often it is the poorest people that face discrimination and inequality in access to health care."
"That is why we must ensure that Member States can authorise treatment in another country prior to that treatment."
"We must not restrict cross-border health care just to those who can afford it."
"Equally, this new directive must not compromise standards of care for those people who do chose to stay at home."
"We must also ensure that there are safeguards in place that put the rights and safety of the patients first."
"That is why it is vital that a mechanism is developed to share patients' records between the patients' home country and the country where they receive treatment."
"Apart from that, we need to develop a system of compensation for patients who suffer avoidable harm when being treated in another country EU country."
"And, with regards to the sharing of best practice, I welcome Article 15 in the draft directive which calls for a system of European reference networks."
"These centres of excellence could prove a useful way of sharing knowledge, training and the exchange of information."
"All too often we look at health-care-acquired infections or cancer-screening guidelines; the answer is on our doorstep, and it is about time that we started learning from each other more effectively."
"(PL) Mr President, the main healthcare challenges facing us today are improving the health of older people, preparing to deal with geriatric diseases in relation to the ageing population, universal access to a proper level of healthcare, ensuring financial stability for national healthcare systems, giving particular attention to access to healthcare for disabled people, children, the elderly, and those from poorer families, guaranteeing the rights of the patient in cross-border healthcare, establishing cross-border electronic interoperability for medical records, while at the same time ensuring protection for personal data and the provision of good working conditions for employees in the healthcare sector."
"The concrete measures proposed in the Social Package to meet these challenges, such as the preparation of a communiqué concerning meeting the needs of the ageing population, or the preparation of a green book as regards the issue of employees in the healthcare sector, give us some hope that we shall not remain only at the wish-making stage."
"I am glad to see that so much attention has been paid to the issue of cross-border healthcare, which is so important in this age of ever growing migration."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(SV) Mr President, the directive means that more power will be given to the EU over healthcare, and I am opposed to opening up this field to EU legislation."
"Healthcare is and must remain a national prerogative."
"The idea that patients should engage in a form of healthcare tourism is an incorrect prioritisation of our common healthcare resources."
"The new fundamental principle that we should have a right to care in another EU country without prior authorisation opens up a fast lane to care for young, linguistically talented and relatively healthy persons and poses the risk of diverting resources from those with greater care needs, such as our elderly and those with functional impairments."
"Clearly everyone should have the right to care if they are sick in another EU country, but we already have that right without the need for new EU legislation in the field."
"Healthcare remains a national policy area."
"(DA) Mr President, we all wish for the fastest, best treatment if we should fall seriously ill, but I do not want to see the American model, where well-off citizens receive the best treatment and vulnerable members of society second-class treatment - if they are lucky."
"If they are unlucky, they receive none at all."
"Therefore, we must lay down some basic principles."
"There should be free and equal access to healthcare services for all, and people should be treated in turn and according to need."
"That is to say, a public authority must carry out an assessment to ensure that a medical professional determines what constitutes 'turn' and 'need'."
"It is the sickest who should be treated first, not the richest."
"A way forward in terms of free and equal access to healthcare services for all citizens would be to scrutinise public contributions to treatment in private hospitals and tax credits for private health insurance."
"EU legislation should not be oriented towards an ideological school of thought based on the internal market, but should aim towards a flexible system in Europe, which guarantees minimum rights for all citizens in terms of treatment."
"(SK) The directive on the application of patients' rights in cross-border healthcare endeavours to solve an acute problem."
"This problem is the conflict between the subsidiarity of healthcare systems and the right of European Union citizens to free movement, and also their fundamental human right of access to health services."
"Free movement is the right of any citizen living in a Member State and his health moves with him."
"Should he not be able to approach health services, he would face a serious obstacle hindering his free movement."
"Complete equality of services is impossible because of different taxes paid in individual countries in respect of health services, as well as differing rates of treatment in individual countries."
"Although many politicians worry about the onset of health tourism, especially from the East, their fears are unsubstantiated."
"A very important thing for a patient is to be close to his relatives and not to face a language barrier."
"The patient-doctor relationship is very specific."
"The success of treatment partially depends on a patient's trust in his doctor or in the health establishment."
"A patient's readiness to travel abroad to get treatment depends on the seriousness of the illness."
"In cases of life-saving treatment or treatment of a serious illness, no other obstacles matter."
"I think it would be preferable for these issues to be dealt with by the European Parliament rather than by the European Court of Justice."
"It is sad that, although we are the citizens' representatives, we find making decisions more difficult than the European Court of Justice which, in each case so far, has found that the patient was right."
"I should like to mention one thing in conclusion."
"Many of my fellow Members talk about the rich and the poor."
"For me, as a doctor, there is only the patient."
"I do not care whether he owns a Ford or is homeless."
"(NL) Mr President, to begin with, may I say how delighted I am to see our erstwhile colleague, Roselyn Bachelot, here with us today and hear her telling us once again that the European citizen is all-important."
"This piece of legislation reflects that emphasis."
"My compliments also go to Commissioner Vassiliou, who has seen this very difficult item of legislation through."
"With this legislation we - the European Parliament, the European Commission and the Council - really are doing something for people."
"The directive provides legal safeguards for mobility and at the same time offers a statutory basis for existing initiatives in the area of cross-border healthcare."
"But when I compare this directive with the earlier versions, those which were opposed, I see that the focus is now more on patient mobility and less on health services, and the reason for that is to keep the Member States happy."
"I have a word or two of criticism about that."
"Border areas that have already taken some good initiatives on cross-border healthcare - for example the cooperative arrangement between the Universitätsklinikum Aachen and the Academisch Ziekenhuis Maastricht in my own province of Limburg, which as part of the Meuse-Rhine Euroregion would dearly love to be a pilot area - are becoming far too dependent on mobility alone and thus on the whims of insurers or the goodwill or otherwise of national authorities, because the focus is now no longer on the services themselves."
"We should take a good look at Article 13 to decide how we can get regions working together a lot more."
"And whilst I am on the subject, Commissioner, may I make the point that we in the Meuse-Rhine Euroregion are very keen to be a pilot area."
"Secondly, patient involvement in setting up national contact points."
"Mrs Schmidt in Germany has taken an excellent initiative on this and we should look at how we might tie that in more closely to our own wider plans."
"Another point is the 'list of treatments, other than those requiring overnight accommodation, to be subject to the same regime as hospital care', the purpose of which is to exclude certain functions from this directive."
"This needs careful consideration too, because we cannot have a situation where an overly strict interpretation of that list rules out cooperative ventures of the kind I mentioned just now."
"It is most important to know that effective cooperation makes centres of clinical excellence cheaper, not more expensive, and more readily accessible to people."
"That, after all, is what we are aiming for."
"(NL) Mr President, Commissioner Vassiliou, Minister Bachelot-Narquin, Europe has an important duty to help guarantee everyone high-quality and affordable healthcare, close to home if possible or abroad if necessary."
"So I am very grateful to you, Commissioner, for your initiative which unquestionably has many positive aspects in terms of guaranteeing quality and safety, information to the patient, more European cooperation, e-Health, reference networks and so on."
"I also agree with you, Minister, when you say that it is not a good thing to leave rulings on patient mobility to the Court of Justice and that there is a need for legislation here."
"I agree too with the view of Mr Bowis and Mrs Lambert that we ought perhaps to think about a better balance in the matter of prior authorisation of patient mobility, because that prior authorisation is an important instrument of Member States' planning and policy."
"A few other questions remain, Commissioner, about the fees to be charged, and mechanisms to prevent patient mobility leading to waiting lists in certain countries."
"But I am sure, ladies and gentlemen, that these are questions and concerns which we shall be able to resolve as we discuss this directive further."
"Once again, thank you for your initiative, Commissioner."
"And we look forward, Minister, to cooperating with you."
"Mr President, at the beginning of this year I conducted a number of consultation meetings throughout my constituency in the context of EU policy on social issues, and then these meetings fed into the Commission consultation on social reality stock-taking."
"It was very clear to me that citizens are very interested in the EU becoming more involved in social policy, and that certainly includes patient mobility."
"Indeed, the call for more social Europe was reinforced during the Lisbon Treaty campaign, and this response from the Commission, while not fully addressing the concerns of citizens, is timely and a step in the right direction."
"I certainly welcome the proposals on patient mobility, but agree with some of the previous speakers that very many issues still need to be clarified - in particular, the issue of prior authorisation."
"However, the bottom line is that patients must be at the core of any policy and should have no worries about costs, safety and quality."
"In the mean time, patients must be fully informed of their existing rights, since legal uncertainty always works to the disadvantage of individuals who do not have many personal resources."
"Finally, the French presidency referred to the fact earlier that some people will be disappointed that the issue of the mobility of health-care professionals has not been dealt with."
"I am one of those people."
"If we are to put patients at the core of any policy, then patient safety is paramount, so we must establish standardised accreditation systems for health-care professionals throughout the EU."
"(PL) Mr President, speaking in this debate I would like to say that, from the point of view of the new Member States, it is important to leave the possibility of introducing restrictions on the use of healthcare abroad to the national level, principally because of the insufficient funding allocated to healthcare in these countries."
"Similarly, it is essential to apply the principle that a patient has the right to a refund of costs up to the value of what would be paid if the patient had used healthcare in their own country until such a time as the differences in development between the old and the new Member States have become significantly less."
"Finally it is worth emphasising that the proposed solutions, particularly as regards the introduction of the European Reference Network, and also the European Network for Health Technology Assessment, provide an opportunity to raise the standards of medical care and also to make more effective use of healthcare resources in the European Union."
"(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, as I am sure you know, the slogan of the upcoming Czech Presidency is 'Europe without barriers'."
"In this context I am glad that the Commission, in cooperation with the European Court of Justice, was able to put forward a proposal that breaks through one of the barriers, namely healthcare provision."
"I approve of the fact that, thanks to the negotiations that have taken place so far, citizens are closer to a solution."
"Being a physician, I should like to see the necessary documents adopted as soon as possible, but I assume that the matter is so complex that the old Roman adage of 'hurry up slowly' applies here."
"At present, I think that the following fundamental issues should be debated. Firstly, we all agree that it is necessary to ensure legal protection for patients who have the right to healthcare within the European Union, in keeping with the judicial decisions of the European Court of Justice."
"Secondly, it is not possible for the directive to establish new competences for the Commission because they are not vital."
"Thirdly, I think it is erroneous that, although the basic purpose was to ensure free movement of medical services, the text of the directive itself concentrates, first and foremost, on movement of patients in need of non-urgent healthcare."
"Further debates represent an opportunity not only for the Czech Presidency but also for Europe."
"Mr President, I am both looking forward to and dreading the cross-border health directive."
"I am looking forward to it because I know so many people who are more disabled, and so many people who have died, as a result of a long wait for treatment in Irish public hospitals."
"So the thought that my constituents will be able to get their medical records and travel without the current prior authorisation obstacle presented by the E112 scheme, to go and get treatment promptly, is wonderful."
"I will certainly be advising those of my constituents who can travel to do so."
"However, I am also aware that this will further exacerbate the problems in the Irish health system, and for those who cannot travel, and who must rely on that health system, I am in dread."
"(SV) Mr President, this issue is about the right of the individual to seek healthcare where good care is available."
"The representative of the Group of the European United Left, Eva-Britt Svensson, said here earlier today that it will lead to healthcare tourism."
"I would like to inform her that, when sick people seek care, it is because they are in pain, they are suffering, they are damaged, and they need care."
"It is not about tourism."
"Ultimately, this question is about the power of bureaucracy versus the right of the individual."
"It is about whether old frontiers should be used as a barrier to people seeking healthcare or whether the openness of today's Europe should be used as a means for people throughout Europe to get the best healthcare they can."
"It was illuminating to hear what the Group of the Left thinks but, since I have the representative of the Social Democrats, Jan Andersson, in front of me and he is right after me on the speakers' list, it would be interesting to hear from him whether he shares Eva-Britt Svensson's view that sick people who seek care abroad are engaging in healthcare tourism."
"Does he, like her, want to erect barriers of various kinds or will you, will the Social Democrats, work to ensure that we have the greatest possible openness, in which patients do not need to ask permission from the authorities to get healthcare?"
"This question, Jan Andersson, is about Social Europe."
"It is not about how individual decision-makers should determine what others can do, but how the individual can get the best healthcare."
"Over to you, Jan Andersson."
"(SV) Mr President, Commissioner, let me especially welcome Mrs Bachelot-Narquin."
"We have worked well together in the past and I hope that we shall do so in the future."
"Welcome to Parliament."
"Briefly to Mr Hökmark, this is not a domestic debate."
"I do not check my opinions with Mrs Svensson, I prefer to form my own."
"I welcome this directive for several reasons."
"We need clarification in legal terms."
"I think it is better than the draft that we had previously."
"There are considerable advantages, particularly for people who live in border areas, as I do myself."
"That said, I would also point out that it is important to link the arrangements to the various systems around Europe, in terms of organisation, financing and similar aspects."
"There is one aspect that we must pay particular attention to."
"That is equality."
"We know that there is prioritisation in healthcare, but it is important that people are all treated equally and that some should not be able to take precedence because of their resources, and it is important that we should be able to combine these two aspects in cross-border care."
"The question of prior approval is also important."
"That is something to which we must devote further discussion."
"The limit specified in the directive is not good."
"Inpatient care, outpatient care: it varies considerably from one country to another, and the pattern changes over time."
"We must find other criteria."
"I look forward to cooperation."
"In our committee we shall be dealing with the financing of social security systems, which forms part of this cooperation."
"I look forward to cooperation with the other committees on this matter."
"(FI) Mr President, the most important thing is for patients to receive good, safe and cheap care, and more often than not they want to receive their care as close to home as possible."
"In other words, national healthcare services need to be delivered appropriately."
"The Commission's proposal before us should nevertheless be welcomed."
"It is important that care and treatment can also be available in another country."
"That would ensure more freedom of choice and that there were clearer guidelines and advice, whilst health and safety issues also become clearer."
"For patients, then, this would be a good thing."
"For the Member States the issue is slightly more complicated, because the directive cannot work well until the electronic social welfare and healthcare systems in the Member States of the Union are compatible."
"We know that they are not today, and the implementation of this directive would demand a lot from the Member States."
"We need to ensure that when the directive has been adopted it also means that patient's details can pass from one system to another, information security is guaranteed and the patient's safety is assured."
"The patient is what is most important."
"(DA) Mr President, the road to hell is paved with glittering promises, and one does not need to be a professor to foresee the result of this proposal in its current form."
"On the one hand there will be an 'A team' consisting of the wealthy, the well educated and those with the right connections - generally speaking, all of us in this Chamber."
"We are to be able to jump the waiting list in our home country and seek out the best experts in the EU - as we can afford to spend money on treatment, and we can afford the travel and other additional costs."
"On the other hand there will be the poor and underprivileged."
"They are allowed to join the back of the queue and, when it finally comes to their turn, they obtain the treatment that we, the richest, did not want."
"On special occasions, the EU presents itself as an alternative to the United States, but the point is that the EU is increasingly resembling the United States - including in the health field."
"Our group supports free and equal access to the treatment people need, so we reject this proposal."
"(SL) The social landscape of Europe has changed."
"We are faced with new challenges which require a modernisation of the European social model."
"The healthcare landscape of Europe is also changing."
"Success rates in the case of some diseases are on the increase, as is spending on running healthcare systems."
"However, citizens encounter huge differences in the quality of healthcare, both between the Member States and within them."
"Cancer survival rates differ by as much as 10% between the Member States."
"I welcome the European Commission's intention to look closely at the issue of healthcare within the framework of a renewed social agenda."
"At the same time, however, I regret that the increased attention paid to citizens' health-related rights has come about solely as a result of a judgment of Court of Justice."
"I speak as someone who has himself survived cancer and who knows of cases where patients have been told 'there is nothing more we can do for you' in one country and received effective care in another."
"Freedom of movement means the ability to choose."
"The ability to choose leads to greater competition and thus greater quality and possibly also lower costs."
"I am sure that the directive on patient mobility will enliven Europe and have many positive consequences."
"Our common goal is health for all."
"The directive on cross-border healthcare undoubtedly means greater closeness to citizens, who are not interested so much in debates on competences than in the shortest route to health - naturally one which is clearly signposted."
"The most successful European policy is policy which citizens feel in their pockets, as was the case with the roaming directive."
"In the case of the directive on cross-border healthcare, citizens will not feel it directly in their pockets, at least not initially, but they will have greater choice for the same money."
"And that is not a bad feeling, particularly where health is involved."
"(DE) Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, when we talk about a social Europe, we must always put people and their concerns at the forefront."
"Putting them at the forefront means that we must have a top priority, which is that the health system should provide people with the best possible care locally."
"That is the number one priority."
"That is the proviso which must underlie our approach to this directive."
"There are, however, many other considerations, for which we also need other solutions, be it because people are travelling or are working in other countries or be it because they have a rare disease or because they will receive better care in another country."
"This means that there is also a need to remove the obstacles to mobility in such cases and to ensure that legal certainty is created."
"That is the second priority."
"The third priority is that we must remember time and time again that, under the European treaties, healthcare in the Member States is a matter for the Member States, and we must respect that."
"In other words, the organisation and funding of healthcare systems are the responsibility of the Member States, and our legislation can do nothing to change that."
"It is not an option, we cannot do it, and we have no intention of doing it unless we were able to agree at some future date to create a common health policy."
"That would be the ideal scenario, but I am afraid we are still far from ready to take such a step."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we and the people of Europe are pleased that we can finally begin the parliamentary discussion of this proposal."
"I regret that the threats the PSE Group made to the Commission last December resulted in a deadlock lasting several months."
"The proposal is good and provides added value for the people of Europe."
"We want to see the political creation of cross-border legal certainty, so that individuals no longer have to resort to the Court of Justice to assert their fundamental right to personal freedom of movement."
"We are discussing a directive on patient mobility, not on health services."
"Primary responsibility for the assured delivery, the quality and the funding of health care continues to rest with the Member States."
"We know, however, that we need more cooperation among the Member States in the field of health care and more cross-border European input in research, in the key area of hospital provision and on the supply side."
"This question is the free movement of patients."
"We are not asking whether health-care systems and high-quality health services can be organised without unwanted side-effects; we are asking how it can be done."
"We are moving in an area between four poles: patients' rights, protection of the healthcare systems, protection of health insurance schemes and quality assurance with regard to health services, security of funding and legal certainty."
"Patients have a legitimate interest in seeking out what seems to be the best health service."
"To enable them to do so, we need a legislative framework and legal certainty."
"On the other hand, the great majority of the population want health services as close as possible to their own homes."
"We have the problem of funding the system of health care in the Member States."
"More mobility at the same cost is therefore the right way forward."
"We have the issue of quality assurance with regard to health services."
"We should launch the debate on European minimum standards in this area too."
"(NL) Mr President, Commissioner, I share the view of other Members that it is an important achievement to have this proposal on the table at last."
"It meets a need, a reality on the ground and it means we can really do something for people."
"Some members claim that only the well-off will be able to get themselves treated abroad."
"We must make sure that healthcare abroad is accessible not only to the most affluent, because they are able to use the law to obtain expensive procedures."
"Patients have a right to clarity and legal certainty and we can work on that, that is our job."
"The proposal is a distinct plus for EU citizens."
"It is not perfect, of course, there are a few improvements to be made."
"I am thinking of the definitions of 'hospital', 'non-hospital care' and so on and the identification of specific cases where prior authorisation may be warranted."
"These are things we shall certainly address in the debate."
"So I hope our debate will be calm and pragmatic and not an ideologically based debate."
"Other aspects will need to be dealt with by national legislation, but I absolutely cannot agree with those who say that this proposal undermines the ability of Member States to organise their healthcare."
"I think it most important that we discuss this proposal."
"(SK) Responsibility for the health systems in the Union rests first and foremost with Member States."
"Responsibility for the organisation and provision of healthcare and medical services in accordance with Article 152 of the Treaty is fully recognised."
"The proposal aims to introduce and ensure a transparent framework for the provision of safe, high-quality and effective cross-border healthcare within the Union, at the same time ensuring a high level of health protection while fully respecting the principle of subsidiarity."
"Although I wholeheartedly approve of the intention and goals set in the directive, I should like to point out certain shortcomings of the proposal that could be overcome."
"Some are afraid that this type of care might place the health insurance systems in some Member States under undue pressure."
"We need a more precise definition of procedures relating to providing care and reimbursement in respect of repeated hospitalisations and damages, as well as treating complications."
"We must set a time horizon for reimbursement of costs and at the same time clearly state that the directive neither will not wants to solve the long-term healthcare issues in such establishments where the health and social systems usually meet."
"The term 'beneficial for the patient' must be specified."
"The medical aspects should be taken into consideration in the first place, not subjective benefits."
"When specifying the terms 'hospital care' and 'outpatient care', it would also be good to specify the term 'specialised outpatient healthcare'."
"In addition to that, the problem of the method of reimbursement of prescriptions issued in other countries still remains."
"Ladies and gentlemen, just like on those other occasions when we witnessed the introduction of free movement in the past, certain worries exist."
"In my opinion, however, they are not insurmountable."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it has been said that health services are a major pillar of the European social model."
"For that reason, it seems entirely right that we should address the issue with a view to ensuring a high level of health protection and equal access to healthcare for all; unfortunately, the text under discussion does not seem to be moving in that direction."
"We need to avoid striking at the roots of the purpose for which the directive should be issued, and that is to guarantee, within the framework of free movement, the right of citizens to take advantage of health services within the Union."
"In practice, the text can be seen as an instrument geared towards opening up the health market at Community level, something which is quite different and could well lead to a right to health for the well-off."
"The text provides solely for the reimbursement of the costs paid by them and only the cost of the health service as compared with the cost in the country of origin, disregarding the costs of travelling to and staying in the host country."
"Further critical points have also been discussed, ranging from the need to guarantee standards of service at Community level to the important issue of information."
"For those reasons, I consider that more detailed thought is needed so that we can try together to provide European citizens with the answers that are still lacking in the directive itself."
"(RO) First of all, I would like to welcome the entire proposal made by the Commission regarding a new social package."
"The necessity of modernising the European social model is obvious in the specific context of the 21st century and of the objectives sought in the Lisbon Strategy concerning sustained economic growth and the prosperity of the population."
"The directive currently under debate is important in the enforcement of the renewed social agenda, particularly in the context of priorities related to the promotion of geographic and professional mobility, as well as to a longer and healthier life of European citizens."
"I hope that the provisions of the directive will bring healthcare services closer to home, and I am referring to all social categories, including emigrants, people working abroad and undergraduates studying abroad."
"It is essential that healthcare should provide secure, quality services, no matter where in Europe it is provided."
"In this regard, I would like to stress the importance of education and training of European professionals in the field, as well as the importance of facilitating European communication and the exchange of good practice."
"Given the crossborder nature of the directive, professional training should include knowledge of foreign languages and familiarity with the fundamentals of intercultural dialogue."
"Not least, adequate knowledge of information and communication technology is just as necessary for the success of the directive; moreover, it is crucial in strengthening the so-called field of e-health."
"(RO) The provision of healthcare services is a pillar of the European social model, and the creation of an internal market for these services should not encourage medical tourism, which will be available only to well-off patients who can speak many foreign languages and have access to information."
"What is required is a clarification of the conditions for the reimbursement and licensing of healthcare, as well as a clarification of the concept of healthcare."
"I am concerned about the effects that this directive will have on the new Member States."
"European citizens will not travel to countries where healthcare is very expensive; on the contrary, they will go to countries such as Romania, Bulgaria, or Poland, leading to an exodus of patients from Western Europe to Eastern Europe."
"Although healthcare provision in the new Member States in accordance with clearly defined standards of quality and security does not apply uniformly to all types of healthcare, the demand for dental services in Eastern Europe is constantly increasing."
"This will cause prices to soar in the host countries, rendering their citizens' access to healthcare more difficult, owing both to high prices and to the fact that certain companies will look for customers willing to pay more."
"Opening up the European market in healthcare services will have a severe impact on the healthcare system in Eastern Europe, leading to inequality."
"Increased freedom of choice in the manner and location of healthcare provision is a positive thing, as long as all citizens have access to services, irrespective of their social standing."
"(PL) Mr President, the aim of the social package should be to guarantee universal and equal access to high quality healthcare services to all EU citizens."
"To a certain extent, this objective can be reached by appropriate regulation at European Union level, but there are many problems that result from mistaken and ineffective solutions at the level of individual Member States."
"For this reason, the Commission should encourage Member States to reform their national healthcare systems, primarily through spreading good practice and through effective financing methods."
"A precondition for effective healthcare is the free movement of medical personnel between Member States."
"In this context I must draw your attention to the restrictions that continue to apply to Polish nurses and midwives wishing to work abroad."
"This is discrimination against Polish workers and is a blatant breach of the principle of free movement of labour and the principle of equal treatment."
"I call on the Commission to put an end to these discriminatory practices and to give back to Polish nurses the right to carry out their profession, without restrictions, in other European Union countries."
"(SK) The Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection held intensive discussions about the provision of cross-border healthcare back when the Services Directive was debated."
"The agreed compromise was reached only because healthcare services were excluded from the scope of the Directive due to their specific nature."
"Since this is a complex problem, I welcome this debate."
"Clear and understandable information must be available to the patient even before he requests healthcare in another EU Member State, in particular regarding the level of treatment costs, the possibility of being reimbursed by his health insurer and the need for prior authorisation."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have to adopt rules at European level that will enable the patient to make use of healthcare services anywhere within the EU, rather than make him a victim of the system."
"Mr President, many speakers stress the fact that all patients, whether they travel or stay at home, are entitled to high-quality, safe health care."
"Let us not forget that one of the biggest demographic challenges we have is an ageing population who will inevitably want health care in their own locality."
"So we need clarity to respect the right of patients to access health services, and at the same time we need to respect the Treaty provision stating that the organisation of health services, especially financing, is a competence of the Member States."
"We must recognise that 27 states have different systems, different funding systems."
"I regret that the directive is not clear on this point, but I have confidence that our rapporteurs can clarify these issues: if we want to keep out the lawyers we must have clarity, not just to avoid patients going to court, but to avoid them going to court on cross-border medical negligence issues."
"So we need to have more innovation in our approach."
"The ideal mix, I believe, is to have patient mobility and to encourage Member States to buy in expert services, not just to treat one patient but to treat groups suffering from the same condition."
"This could be more cost-efficient, and could enable patients to stay close to family and friends."
"Mr President, this directive is wonderful in theory, but it could turn out to be a nightmare in practice."
"I say this because it could lead to services getting better in some centres but worse in others."
"I will give you an example: if patients from a small country like Cyprus with a neurosurgical problem all go to Sweden or Britain to have their neurosurgical treatment, then what will happen to the neurosurgical services in Cyprus?"
"The standards will diminish, inevitably, and this holds for cardiovascular services, for orthopaedic services, for oncological services and for many others."
"So we must be very careful."
"I fully support this directive, but we must make sure that we do not make good centres better and bad centres worse."
"We must be careful to raise the health standards right across Europe, in large countries as well as in small countries."
"(PL) Mr President, the purpose of the new social agenda is, among other things, to reduce barriers to mobility in a society that accepts the principle of equality, where there should not be any barriers in anyone's way."
"A very important issue here is the proposal relating to the directive concerning the rights of patients in cross-border healthcare."
"This is needed for people to be able to function in today's fast-moving world, where people travel hundreds of kilometres to attend a specific meeting."
"For this reason it is very important that every European should know that if their lives are in danger, someone will save their life and safeguard their health without unnecessary regulations or other obstacles."
"We should make sure that every inhabitant of the EU knows that, in order to be able to access healthcare in an emergency, they must have a European Health Insurance Card."
"Patients must know that, in an emergency, they should be treated on the same basis as the citizens of the country where they are being treated."
"Quality, productivity and, above all, the safety of patients are the issues that, for us, should be the most important."
"(DA) Mr President, I should like to thank the Commission for presenting this Directive."
"I think it incredibly important that politicians have the opportunity to discuss patient rights, rather than it being left to the European Court of Justice to take decisions in such an important area."
"In my view, patients are of supreme importance."
"We must put the spotlight on patients, but for this reason we must also reflect on how to orient this Directive, so that the spotlight is on giving all patients the opportunity to receive good treatment."
"Therefore, I believe it is important to ensure that the Directive enables patients staying at home in their own Member State to have access to proper treatment too."
"Thus I believe that this prior authorisation should be the rule rather than the exception."
"This is what I believe we need to focus on."
"In addition, I would agree with my colleague Mrs Sârbu in what she said about the need for us to take care that this Directive does not create a divide between east and west, north and south in Europe."
"Mr President, I welcome the proposal from the Commission."
"The question that is being asked is 'What can Europe do for me?'."
"I think it is important that we make health care available if it is not available in the home country."
"As one of the people who has benefited from cross-border health care - but I could afford it - it is important that it is available to everyone right across the Community."
"However, the issue that arises is that there should not be a delay in making sure that treatment is available."
"That is one of the things that I think is important in developing this policy."
"Mr President, I believe there are a number of principles that have to be addressed in this issue."
"The first is that patients' health obviously has to be at the heart of it."
"We must not leave the issue of these rights to decision by the courts."
"We as lawmakers must make the law in this area."
"Thirdly, competition must not be encouraged, or be the outcome of this directive, between national health services; nor indeed should competition generally be encouraged in this area."
"(RO) The new Member States are facing a significant level of migration of highly skilled workers in the health services sector, a phenomenon which is leading to severe imbalances, correction of which will require a significant financial outlay."
"It is necessary that the new Member States benefit from extended European funding programmes to develop flexible healthcare provision for all patients, in a concrete, non-discriminatory manner."
"(RO) European mobility policy is one of the most important EU policies, allowing all citizens to establish themselves and work in those countries where they can benefit from an improved standard of living."
"However, free movement is significantly hampered by concerns about the possibility of recouping the cost of medical treatment abroad."
"Therefore, I move for the creation of a European health insurance scheme, recognised by all Member States, facilitating European cooperation in the field of crossborder healthcare."
"This will lead to the development of a modern social agenda which will contribute to fostering opportunities in the field of education and employment."
"(FR) Mr President, this proposal for a directive is concerned with the interest of patients and it is that human approach on the part of the Commissioner and the Minister that I welcome."
"I also appreciate the improved cooperation between Member States in terms of respect for national health systems and I hope this opportunity for Europeans will be enhanced by the provision of proper information, which is something they need."
"Effectiveness and humanity: that is what pleases me in this proposal for a directive."
"(EL) Mr President, I am proud that this directive has been created and promoted by two Cypriot Commissioners, Mr Kyprianou and Mrs Vassiliou."
"The directive is correct and necessary, and must be implemented."
"The main focus of this directive is the patient, who is entitled to the best possible medical care, particularly when it cannot be provided in the patient's own country."
"The practical difficulties have been correctly identified and need attention, because bad practice may end up nullifying an idea that is sound in other respects."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me start with a few personal comments and say how happy I was to meet up again with my colleagues from the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, Mr Andersson, its chairman, Anne Van Lancker, Ria Oomen-Ruijten, Jiří Maštálka and others."
"May I offer them my warmest greetings."
"John Bowis, speaking on behalf of the PPE, put the issue in its proper context by asking: 'What does Europe do for me?'"
"He reintroduced the question of a neighbourhood Europe, followed by numerous others such as Dagmar Roth-Behrendt on behalf of the Socialist Party and Jules Maaten for the ALDE Group."
"Many of those who spoke after John Bowis also emphasised that patients take precedence over states and systems."
"That is very true."
"Yet we must not end up by opposing patients, states and health insurance systems because any destabilisation of health insurance systems would have dreadful repercussions on the organisation of healthcare and, specifically, on the patients we want to protect."
"That is why I would reply to Dagmar Roth-Behrendt that the question is not of patients' right of movement within the European Union, which is a self-evident, fundamental right."
"The question the directive raises is of reimbursement and reimbursement terms, of the right or not to reimbursement."
"Article 152 of the Treaty makes it clear that Member States are free to organise and finance the healthcare they provide as they wish."
"At the heart of the issue of prior authorisation lies the question of balance, of the soundness of the accounts of the national health support and insurance systems, especially those of the poorest states."
"This text reminds us of that responsibility and under no circumstances can states use this directive as a means of evading those responsibilities."
"Basically, Jean Lambert was saying that cross-border care is not a goal in itself and Derek Roland Clark pointed out that perhaps we should make sure the provisions of the new directive did not ultimately benefit only a few of the wealthiest, most educated and best informed patients while the poorest patients would, of course, be treated unfairly."
"The key question here, however, the question under debate, which the Commission and the Council should look at in depth, is prior authorisation for hospital care because that is indeed where there is the greatest risk of deregulation of national systems."
"Jean Lambert asked whether the proposal for a directive was compatible with the regulation on social security coordination."
"The Court has found that those two reimbursement systems were compatible."
"We must ensure, therefore, that the two systems are properly structured."
"The proposal for a directive before us gives priority to implementing the regulation, which seems reasonable."
"Yet the principle of the patient's freedom of choice must continue to apply if, for any reason other than financial, a patient prefers to go down the road opened by ECJ case law."
"Like Bernadette Vergnaud, some MEPs regretted the fact that this text does not cover all the difficulties encountered by patients within the EU, and more specifically in their country of origin."
"When you look at the difficulties to be resolved by this text alone, you can see that it was unlikely that proposing a wider-ranging text would have been the best way of making progress in terms of resolving certain very practical problems, such as reimbursing healthcare for patients moving to another European country for the purpose of study, work or simply holidays."
"Similarly, this is not just a directive on health services, to be regretted or welcomed."
"So it serves no useful purpose to decry it as some kind of 'Bolkestein directive'."
"That really is not what this directive is about."
"Once its basic principles have been established - and I have noted them - this directive must therefore enable us to preserve a certain means of regulation, as it already exists between the Commission and the Council but also between many MEPs on all benches, in regard to respect for these options open to patients."
"As regards prior authorisation for cross-border healthcare, Member States must remain responsible for deciding on the range of care they offer."
"It is also important that when a state imposes certain conditions of access to care for public health reasons - such as the doctor's referral system or what is known as gate-keeping in English - its systems are respected and applied when patients turn to a health system in a country other than their own."
"Obviously, this discussion on the directive cannot be dissociated from the Commission's forthcoming communication or from the Council's proposal for a recommendation on Community action in the field of rare diseases."
"I believe it is entirely possible to hold those discussions at the same time."
"Another issue that many MEPs raised was the interoperability of health information systems."
"This directive may contribute to that in legislative terms."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, of course we are only at the start of this dialogue, of the discussion on this subject, which will have to cover such vast areas as data protection, transparent enacting terms and perimeters."
"Here again, however, with the directive creating legal certainty, we should be able to advance along the road of interoperability, which does not mean going it alone but, quite simply, harmonisation and greater compatibility."
"Thank you all for your deep and meaningful contributions, which have shed great light on our debate."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, this has been a very interesting discussion."
"Let me say that very often we hear the question: how can we bring the citizen nearer to the European Union?"
"This is one example of how we can make the citizen feel that the European Union is doing something for him or her."
"Under the present system, there are many inequalities."
"With the clear legal framework provided by the draft directive concerning citizens and the various issues we are trying to give clear information to the citizen about their rights and how they can exercise them."
"It is true that there are concerns."
"I listened very carefully to your concerns, and I am sure that during the course of the debate and the deliberations we shall have, we have to address these concerns so that the end result will be something which is really of benefit to the citizen."
"This is not a Bolkestein Directive II - far from it - and we should never think that this is so."
"It is about patients' rights and how to exercise those rights."
"We are not trying to harmonise health systems."
"Member States can continue to exercise and regulate their health systems, and they can decide for themselves what benefits they want to offer to their citizens, and to what extent."
"We are not trying to encourage health tourism."
"We are not trying to give citizens the chance to have their faces and their bodies fixed; rather, we are trying to give citizens the right to have proper health care when they are sick and they need it."
"Nor do we expect a big exodus of European citizens from their home state to another Member State."
"According to the calculations and to the impact assessment that we have, only a very small percentage of citizens wish to go abroad."
"Why?"
"Because they want to have the care that they need nearer to their families, they want to speak their own language and to be in a familiar environment."
"However, there are cases when they need some extra health care which their home state cannot provide."
"This is a right that we give them - this extra right to have an informed choice and decide for themselves where they go for their health treatment."
"Indeed, we have had encouragement from the European Court of Justice to legislate."
"We cannot leave it all the time to the Court to decide about the rights of the patient case by case."
"This is not just."
"How many European citizens can afford a lawyer and can afford to go to court?"
"Only a very few."
"Therefore, we must offer solutions to all the patients, give them the right information and let them decide for themselves what they need."
"This is a time for all of us to work together - the Council, the Commission and Members of Parliament - to find the best possible solutions for patients."
"(Applause)"
"Thank you, Commissioner, I think the applause in the Chamber reflect Parliament's satisfaction."
"I have received, pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure, six motions for resolution winding up this debate."
"I would inform you that the EPP-ED Group has now withdrawn its motion for a resolution."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place in a few minutes' time."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - Healthcare for Roma has been systematically denied or rarely taken into consideration across Europe, despite the fact that access to healthcare is a fundamental right for European citizens."
"The Renewed Social Agenda on cross-border healthcare must address the problems Roma encounter in their failure to have healthcare services within a short distance of their community."
"Most Roma live on the periphery of urban centres, and miles away from health facilities."
"Their segregation from these services results in the life expectancy of Roma being estimated at 10 years less than the national average."
"The prevention of and vaccination against diseases prevalent in Roma communities as well as the question of emergency situations and regular health checks have yet to be resolved."
"Another factor limiting the access of Roma to healthcare stems from their lack of identity cards, which would enable them to apply for insurance or social assistance."
"With the fall of the communist regimes, many Roma were not acknowledged, or were forgotten or erased from country citizenship records."
"Lastly, the health of Roma women must be addressed, as they are the caretakers of the Roma community."
"If the Commission is to help Europeans obtain healthcare services within the EU, they must ensure this is universally and equally applied."
"in writing. - (FI) In a properly functioning Europe, the patient must be able to apply for proper care and treatment wherever it is available."
"If there are waiting lists for a heart operation or a hip replacement in one country, access to treatment in another country must be possible without any protectionist jungle of legislation."
"The removal of barriers also means better use of existing resources."
"Most of the speeches opposing the movement of patients and services appeal to the worst aspects of Europeanness, xenophobia and mistrust."
"Properly functioning health services, both public and private, are part of the welfare society - the European welfare society."
"in writing. - Cross-border healthcare is a key element of the social package."
"While the EU has facilitated freedom of movement and the right to live and work in other EU countries, clarification regarding patients' rights to access healthcare in other Member States was urgently required."
"Despite numerous European Court of Justice rulings on this subject, citizens are not fully aware of their rights on this issue."
"Moreover, they are not adequately informed about their exact entitlements, how to go about arranging treatment, or indeed reimbursements."
"In Northern Ireland, projects have been piloted around the border counties which ensure that people can benefit from the most appropriately located healthcare services."
"These projects have been very successful and have been very much appreciated by the people who have benefited from them."
"In this regard, I would like commend the British Medical Association (NI) and the Irish Medical Association for their efforts in promoting cross-border healthcare between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland."
"While I welcome this work by the Commission, I cannot help feeling that it is overdue."
"Now that this issue has been clarified and given a legal framework, I sincerely hope that Member States will fully cooperate."
"in writing. - (NL) We are still glad that the European Parliament excluded heath care services from the general directive on services."
"Healthcare is after all a specific sector requiring a specific approach."
"The fundamental premise of the proposal, in line with established case-law, has to be that the organisation and funding of healthcare are the responsibility of Member States."
"This means on the one hand that patient mobility cannot be made an absolute right and on the other hand that there are no excuses for not investing in one's own health system."
"That premise also necessarily implies that Member States must be able to charge the real cost to the patient."
"There must be solidarity, but there must also be the possibility of differential treatment for patients who have contributed in their own country through the social security and tax system and foreign patients who have not."
"The fact that we have the directive is a good thing, but anyone familiar with the sector feels that it still needs a lot more work."
"To my mind the quality, accessibility and financial sustainability of healthcare on the basis of socially responsible solidarity remain the key criteria here."
"in writing. - (RO) I believe that access to quality healthcare is one of the essential values of a Social Europe."
"Patients' rights within the EU and crossborder cooperation in this field among the Member States constitute a significant part of the new social package."
"Patients must have access to quality health services in any Member State and they must have the possibility of being reimbursed with amounts that are equal to the amount they would receive in their own country."
"Today there are significant differences within the EU as regards both the quality of health services and the reimbursable amounts."
"I believe that an assessment of the European health system and of the medical technology in use is required as a matter of urgency."
"The appropriate equipment of all hospitals with the technology required to diagnose and treat various conditions is a prerequisite for the provision of quality healthcare."
"Physicians and nurses move from one Member State to another both in search of better wages and due to the availability of better diagnostic and treatment facilities."
"It is important that the directive on the patients' rights include, according to EU priorities, a minimal list of health services which should be fully covered by health insurance budgets."
"Welcome"
"Ladies and gentlemen, allow me, on behalf of you all, to welcome a delegation from the Knesset headed by Amira Dotan."
"In the framework of the regular contacts between the European Parliament and Israel, an interparliamentary meeting will take place during this part-session."
"This will be the 33rd such meeting between our two assemblies."
"I bid a warm welcome to Amira Dotan and the members of her delegation, with whom we have already had the opportunity - on Tuesday - to converse at greater length."
"We wish you success and hope that your work will be marked by a willingness to engage in dialogue and a desire for mutual understanding - qualities that are indispensable to a resolute quest for peace in the Middle East."
"The European Parliament is following that process very attentively and is determined to be an objective and active contributor to the pursuit of peace in the Middle East."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, this is about the building in Strasbourg and the decision to go back."
"The Secretary-General sent an e-mail on Tuesday morning saying we would go back in October."
"I understand there was no vote or decision by the Bureau, which is strange."
"Mr Rømer made no mention of the availability of the expert report."
"I had to rely on information from the Vice-President for Transparency to know that the Secretary-General had told the Bureau he would make it available to Members on request in the French and German versions in which it exists, although he would not translate it."
"I have now sent a total of three e-mails over the last two days asking for the report in French, with no response."
"I find this unacceptable and I am now raising the matter under Rule 28 of the Rules of Procedure on accountability and Rule 96 on transparency."
"I want to know the basis on which we are going back to Strasbourg."
"I have read the note which went to the Bureau on Monday, but it seems to me that the works only relate to the false ceilings."
"So, firstly, what do we know about the reasons for the collapse?"
"Is it the design, the materials, the quality of construction or the building inspection?"
"It has got to be one of those four."
"Secondly, what does it tell us about the rest of the building?"
"We do not know whether the whole building has been checked."
"Are there faulty materials?"
"One rumour is that the steel used in the building is the same as in the Charles de Gaulle airport roof which collapsed."
"Is that true or not?"
"(Protests)"
"Well, if you do not give us the truth, rumours will proliferate."
"This is all without prejudice to Mr Matsakis' concerns about asbestos in the building which he is pursuing with vigour, also with no response I think."
"I want to know, first of all, why I have not been given the report, what is the basis for the decision to go back to Strasbourg, is the building truly safe, and who has decided it is?"
"(Applause)"
"For my part, this is not, and should not be - and I hope it is not being - dealt with as a political issue."
"People could have died if they had been there in August, and they could die if anything goes wrong."
"Please could I have some answers?"
"(The President cut off the speaker.)"
"Baroness Ludford, as far as I am aware, you are a citizen of the United Kingdom."
"Citizens of the United Kingdom are noted for their pragmatism and their sang froid."
"May I therefore advise you to keep a cool head now."
"There was no reason to abuse the right to ask questions."
"We are preparing an e-mail for all Members."
"The technical details will be set out in that e-mail in the appropriate languages."
"Have confidence in the parliamentary administration!"
"We are doing what is necessary."
"There was no need to admonish us to tell the truth."
"We are always bound by honesty in all matters, including this one, Baroness."
"(Applause)"
"(DE) Mr President, on Tuesday five Members from four different political groups put up a large poster to publicise written declaration No 75."
"The requisite authorisation was obtained from the competent quaestor, Mr Fazakas, before the poster went on display."
"Someone removed the poster on Tuesday afternoon without informing any of the authors of the written declaration."
"Yesterday we could not find it at all."
"Today we discovered that it is with the security service."
"The reason given to us was that a political decision had been taken to the effect that this written declaration could not be advertised."
"Since when has the administration decided what is politically right and wrong, particularly after the competent quaestor has given his approval?"
"We are democratic Members of Parliament with the right to state our position."
"You do not have to agree with the content of the declaration, but removing the poster without informing the authors is wrong; it is a preposterous curtailment of Members' rights."
"I ask you to comment on this matter."
"(Applause)"
"Mr Alvaro, your intervention, which is entirely legitimate, is the first I have heard of this incident."
"I assure you that we shall look into this matter."
"Statement by the President"
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Conference of Presidents has asked me to deliver a brief statement about tomorrow, the European Day of Languages."
"I shall gladly do so, but please bear with me, because this statement is written in several languages, which makes it a daunting task for me too."
"I ask you to take note of this statement."
"On 26 September 2008 we are celebrating the European Day of Languages."
"In that framework, the European Union, together with the European Council, is supporting a series of European initiatives aimed at promoting the valuation of languages and cultures and at highlighting to the European public the importance of learning languages."
"(DE) The linguistic diversity of Europe is an essential element of our intellectual heritage and is one of our cultural treasures."
"In the course of European unification, linguistic diversity has gradually become less of a barrier and more of an opportunity."
"This is why the latest communication from the Commission on multilingualism rightly describes our linguistic diversity as a trump card."
"(FR) Multilingualism and promoting linguistic diversity are cornerstones of our day-to-day activities in the European Parliament."
"Our motto is 'no legislative work without translation'."
"(IT) Translation and interpreting of our work as representatives of the peoples of Europe play a vital part in ensuring its legitimacy and transparency and bringing our Parliament ever closer to European citizens."
"(ES) In that context it should be noted that the European Parliament is the only international organisation which has a website and web television in 23 different languages."
"(PL) A European Union that is united in diversity need have no concerns about its future."
"(DE) Thank you for your attention, ladies and gentlemen."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, I have a point of order."
"If you have the information to tell us that it is safe to go back to Strasbourg, why can you not make a statement now before we leave this plenary and risk going back to a building that some of us think is still unsafe?"
"Mrs Lynne, all the information given to me indicates that the building in Strasbourg is every bit as safe as this building here in Brussels."

"- Before the vote on Amendment 1"
"(DE) Mr President, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, may I move an oral amendment for the reformulation of Amendment 1."
"Before doing so, let me say that the report from Mr Deprez and the entire committee is excellent, and the PPE-DE Group would like to vote in favour of it."
"We do, however, have one key point, which is the question of voting rights for migrants in the European Union, not because we reject enfranchisement in general but because we take the view that subsidiarity should apply to such decisions."
"Electoral law is not a European matter."
"For this reason, we would like to build a bridge to the amendment by proposing that it be reworded."
"We ask our fellow Members in the other groups to support the new wording so that we can all approve this good report."
"The new wording reads as follows:"
"'a proposal concerning the integration of long-term residents into the political life at European and local level; a step forward which could help the social, cultural and political integration of these long-term residents;'."
"(DE) I ask for your support."
"I see there are objections."
"(The oral amendment was not adopted)"
"4."
"Concentration and pluralism in the media in the European Union ("
"- Before the vote"
"(ES) I have asked to speak pursuant to Rule 166 of the Rules of Procedure, in relation to Rule 45(2) of the Rules of this House."
"Rule 45(2) was recently amended to prohibit amendments to motions for resolutions contained in own-initiative reports."
"The result, as we shall see in the forthcoming vote, is that if a Parliamentary group wishes to amend one line or one paragraph of an own-initiative report, it is required to table a completely separate alternative motion for a resolution where the only difference is one comma, or the insertion or deletion of a single word."
"Perhaps at the time it seemed like a good idea when the rule was being amended but what is happening now is that it is making it difficult to reach agreements within this Chamber, and reaching agreements should be one of our main objectives."
"It is impossible to reach any agreement between political groups if the only thing we can do is table a separate text, as we will see in the vote shortly."
"Mr President, I request that the amendment to Rule 45(2) be reviewed because the effect it is having is absurd and it is interfering with the political relationships between groups in this Chamber."
"(Applause)"
"I must point out that the European Parliament, in its wisdom, took that decision."
"(Objection by Mrs Pack)"
"I am afraid so, Mrs Pack, but that cannot be altered."
"In the meantime, we must adhere to the letter of the law."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Guardans should perhaps ask his group as it was one of the proponents of this rule."
"I should nevertheless like to say this: the report on which we are voting today, the Mikko report on concentration and pluralism in the media, is the first report which we are approving under this procedure, which prevents us from having a full debate, which prevents us from tabling amendments, on a day when there has been a serious, very serious, attack on freedom of expression in Italy, with the announcement of the sacking of 25 journalists from the only television channel over which Berlusconi does not at present hold sway."
"I think that the way in which we are debating these problems is also indicative of a lack of will in this House to introduce rules, laws or directives on media concentration and pluralism which are increasingly urgently needed in the European Union."
"(Applause from the centre and the left)"
"Mr President, I would to thank everybody who contributed to this extremely important and high-profile report on media pluralism and concentration in the European Union."
"The report is about safeguarding democracy."
"We have tried to include everything that strengthens democracy in this report."
"That is why you should try to focus and think twice before you vote."
"What are you in favour of, and what are you opposing?"
"We are sending this message to our citizens today."
"Please think."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (HU) Mr President, as shadow rapporteur for this topic, I would like to join those who say that this system is not good as it is."
"I would have liked to express the opinion of the People's Party in the Parliamentary debate, but, as shadow rapporteur, I was not given the floor."
"I would like to ask why, if pluralism in the media is so important, pluralism of opinion is not so important?"
"I would have liked to explain the fact that we do not agree on some things, but I was not given the floor."
"Of the whole Parliament, two people were allowed to speak on this topic; the rapporteur and the Commissioner."
"We absolutely must consider whether this system is good, because we are curious about each other's opinions, and this is called pluralism of opinion."
"Please, Mr President, help us to bring this to fruition."
"(Applause from the right)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I give Mr Cohn-Bendit leave to speak, but then we must proceed to the vote."
"We can draw the appropriate conclusions about the consequences of our own decision."
"If we have made a questionable decision, we have the right to amend it ourselves, but the amendment must be made in accordance with the proper procedures."
"(DE) Mr President, this particular piece of nonsense you just referred to was adopted by the majority of this House in spite of our voting against it."
"It was your decision!"
"Give your chairman hell now so that he gets it amended!"
"(Applause from the centre and left)"
"We do not really want to give anyone hell, but conclusions can be drawn if the majority of the House so wishes."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have no intention of looking in any detail at the inaccurate statements that Mrs Frassoni has made, but I feel that I must make one clarification to the House."
"In Italy, it is not President Berlusconi but other groups which own television channels."
"Mr President, in Italy, there are three state television channels: Rai 1, Rai 2 and Rai 3, there is the Mediaset group and then in Italy there is LA7 ..."

"Ladies and gentlemen, there is no reason to get worked up."
"You took a decision."
"If Parliament has taken a decision that the majority may deem to have been unwise, it can be changed."

"That is the principle we follow in Parliament."

"We have been told that, because debate has been curtailed, we can now put in more written statements over the single written statement we were able to do before the new Rules came into effect."
"Today I tried to submit two written statements, and the internet site will not allow it."

"Certainly, the governance of the International Accounting Standards Board is not going to be solved in the next two weeks, so we have time to vote about this resolution in the next mini-plenary session here in Brussels."
"The reason for this is that we have got some new proposals from the European Commission and maybe it is possible to polish up some of the wordings of the resolution."
"The deadline was very tight and that is why we want to have more time and to have the vote on this during the next Brussels session."
"Mr President, I am speaking as Chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"In the current financial crisis, everybody realises that accounting standards and their potentially procyclical nature are a major issue."
"The governance of the structures that develop these accounting standards is a very important matter."
"The European Commission, already addressed on these issues in the Radwan report, has chosen to draft a proposal that does not involve those who are responsible for the stability of the financial markets, that was drawn up hastily with American authorities who are reaching the end of their mandate and have been disowned by all the candidates in the American presidential election, and without consulting the Council or the European Parliament."
"In a spirit of compromise and openness, we agree to reopen this discussion if the Commission for its part agrees to reconsider its proposal and to give a hearing to the European Parliament's proposals."
"That is why I would like the Commission to make a statement and undertake to reconsider its proposal."
"In that case we would be able to support Mrs Kauppi's proposal."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the Commission does not have a position on this point."
"The Commission has not expressed an opinion."

"We had a very full debate at the last part-session, at which all groups aired their views very fully."
"Meanwhile, our group has secured the rapporteurship on the renewed social agenda, which reflects the immense importance we give to social issues, and we look forward to getting the considered comments from all political groups over the coming months, so that together we can produce a report of which the whole House can be proud."

"(CS) Mr President, I only want it to be recorded that I voted for Mr Foglietta's report but my voting equipment failed."
"Oral explanations of vote"
"(MT) Naturally, it is difficult to be understood in this chaotic situation."
"I wanted to stand to explain my vote in favour of the resolution we have just passed, that we have just approved, on the annual debate on the progress made in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice."
"Today, the Council of Ministers of Justice and Home Affairs is meeting to discuss and approve the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum."
"This is a very important subject and it is a very important proposal that is being discussed in the Council, and I hope that, in the discussion being held in the Council today, a declaration on the need to share the burden of immigration more fairly and equally is inserted in the Pact."
"I hope that the Ministers adopt this Pact today and that it contains reference to this common responsibility."
"(NL) Mr President, for many reasons the resolution we have just voted on was unacceptable to me and certainly to my group too."
"The main reason of course is that I believe Europe absolutely does not need a new, 'illegal' wave of immigration."
"Absolutely not."
"It is all too easy for private-sector employers and governments to keep importing more and more foreign nationals from non-EU countries."
"That causes a brain drain from the developing world to Europe, and ultimately does not benefit either the developing countries or Europe, quite the contrary."
"We should at long last make a start - and I am looking primarily here to governments and to business and industry - on assimilating, re-educating and integrating into the regular labour market the huge, truly huge numbers of foreign nationals who are already here and who are not and never have been properly absorbed into our society."
"Mr President, I voted in favour of the Mikko report because I believe the media has a vital role to play in safeguarding democracy."
"With the expansion of the EU it is our role to ensure the convergence of standards for the protection of basic freedoms and democracy."
"I was involved in the opinion of the ITRE Committee on the Mikko report, and I would like to congratulate her because I think new technologies have led to the emergence of new media channels and new types of content, and the media remains an important political tool."
"In this context, a pluralistic media system is an essential requirement for the democratic social model."
"When media ownership is concentrated in just a few people's hands, this favours the monopolisation of the advertising market and represents a barrier to new entrants."
"Competition law has helped restrict media concentration, but these problems still remain in a number of Member States where the market is dominated by a few large players."
"So the report's suggestion of linking media law and competition law is therefore to be commended."
"(PL) Mr President, media pluralism means diversity in the dissemination of information and the characteristic nature of broadcasters."
"Both of these areas are currently under threat in the media sector."
"An ever-increasing concentration of ownership among media companies that are competing in this sector has led to a situation where information that is valuable from the social and cultural points of view is difficult to find in the maze of easily accessible and standardised news for everyone."
"It is difficult to predict what the worsening situation in this sector will lead to, not just for individual consumers, but for society as a whole."
"The rapporteur was right to emphasise the role of the public sector broadcasters as guardians of diversity, with a mission to broadcast high-quality information."
"She is also right to propose a model where there are strong public sector media outside the competitive media market coexisting with private media companies that are motivated by profit."
"There can be no doubt about the importance of balance between these two pillars."
"The text of the report, as well as the intentions of the rapporteur, seem to be clear and transparent."
"The compromise reached during the discussions of the Committee on Culture is a good one."
"In addition, the legal status of the new methods of disseminating information, such as Internet blogs, or other user-generated sites, should be clearly delineated so that the people creating these forms should be aware of their rights and responsibilities and any possible sanctions."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(NL) Mr President, I am happy to hear Parliament saying that all Member States must guarantee media pluralism and that public service broadcasters certainly have an important role there."
"That is quite right and proper."
"In a normal society that means democracy and freedom of information, and above all freedom of information for opposition groups."
"Measured against those criteria, Belgium and even Flanders are not democracies."
"My political party, for example, a big political party in that country, is routinely and openly discriminated against and boycotted by the Flemish public service broadcaster, and on the basis of official directives to boot."
"Why?"
"Because our ideas and attitudes are not 'politically correct' or deviate from the prevailing line."
"Not all that long ago the former head of the public service broadcaster openly admitted that the King of the Belgians had made him a baron to reward him for his discriminatory efforts against the opposition party."
"This report, otherwise not all that bad, might usefully have included a paragraph on the treatment of opposition parties which do not toe the accepted line."
"(NL) Mr President, I abstained from the vote on this report."
"It quite rightly highlights various difficulties over media pluralism and the concentration of ownership in a number of Member States."
"As a Fleming I can offer a word or two on the subject."
"Because there is no state in the European Union which has more need, for example, of a neutral media ombudsman to ensure freedom of expression and pluralism than Belgium."
"Here in Brussels, the institutional heart of the country, as my fellow Member has just said, not only the private media but also the organs of government shamelessly boycott the largest opposition party and deny people the right to free and balanced information."
"It may be that the charter for media freedom which the rapporteur advocates can make this kind of abuse impossible, otherwise the whole thing will just be pure window-dressing."
"I also wonder why it is that the rapporteur is keen on stricter regulation of the ultimate free medium - the Internet, and bloggers in particular - not to mention proper concern for authors' rights."
"Because it is precisely those states with no true media pluralism which most want tighter control over the Internet."
"This report furnishes them with additional arguments and that is regrettable."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (HU) Thank you, Mr President."
"I shall speak in Hungarian."
"Diversity of the media is a particularly important area for the European People's Party, so we have decided that, instead of rejecting the report, our group will submit an alternative draft decision."
"Whilst preserving the virtues of the original report, the parts that are unacceptable to us have been deleted from the text, and the recommendations that we felt it was important to emphasise have been inserted."
"Among other things to which the group objected, the report specifically mentioned individual Member States, whereas we are convinced that a report about media diversity must be neutral and have general application."
"The aim is not to shame certain countries as bad examples."
"Similarly, we have not been able to accept the fact that the report states that some media empires are motivated primarily by profit and material interests: this is an exaggerated generalisation and we cannot accept it."
"The report, which has produced fierce political debate, must in any event draw the attention of the European Commission to the fact that it should deal with this issue in a manner appropriate to the gravity of the topic, and examine what kind of Union or national measures need to be introduced in the interests of enforcing diversity. Thank you."

"The price volatility of recent months is clearly not in the interests of European Union citizens, while speculators/intermediaries make profits."
"What is more, we are seeing an absolutely unacceptable situation where energy prices are determining the prices of food."
"We cannot quietly accept the cynical argument that there is enough food on a global scale but not everyone has enough money to buy expensive food."
"In the opinion of World Bank experts, biomass energy is responsible for up to 80% of the sharp increase in food prices."
"In this context I have stressed, on many occasions, the need to increase food reserves and to regulate the use of food sources for energy purposes."
"This is a key problem related to food price control, and as such must be given much more specific attention."
"(PL) Mr President, we are currently facing rapid increases in the price of energy."
"This has a direct impact on the quality of life of the European Union's inhabitants and on increasing inflation."
"This means that we should create instruments to protect Europe's inhabitants from the consequences of these price rises."
"Even though we have recently seen reductions in oil prices, I believe that we should pay greater attention to mechanisms aimed at ensuring price stability."
"There is also the idea that there should be greater transparency in energy markets so that, in future, they should be less susceptible to speculation on world markets."
"While discussing the issue of energy, one cannot but emphasise the need, first of all, to intensify the work being done on increasing the proportion of energy obtained from renewable sources, including nuclear energy, secondly, the introduction of new coal technologies and thirdly, we must introduce a wide-reaching programme to improve energy efficiency."
"(DE) Mr President, I voted against the Foglietta report, and I would like to thank all my fellow Members who supported me in rejecting it."
"Although obesity is an increasing problem, this White Paper does not bring us any closer to a solution."
"On the contrary, it presents a random hotchpotch of diverse recommendations and demands for legislation."
"This makes us look ridiculous."
"I am pleased that at least the proposal on the red, amber and green colour-coding of food labels was thrown out, but other proposals survived, including some that pre-empted decisions which are in the process of being taken in the realm of food labelling, for which I am the Parliamentary rapporteur."
"We decided that we shall call for censorship of advertising, that we want to ban artificial trans-fatty acids but intend at the same time to indicate TFA content on food labels, that our waistline will be officially measured in future and that the salt content in food will be monitored, which is tantamount to demanding intervention in food recipes."
"A new definition of healthy eating has been initiated; one of the stipulations is that healthy eating is possible only with organic produce."
"This amounts to discrimination against those who engage in conventional farming."
"There is to be no such thing as bad food, which our legal regime would ban from the market."
"All consumers have the right to be informed, but they are also entitled to respect, which means that they must be allowed to make their own decisions."
"Written explanations of vote"
"in writing. - (SV) This report on non-profit local community media in Europe deals with an area which is considered to need additional funding under EU support programmes."
"This is yet another example of how various special interests in this Parliament seek to increase the number of EU support programmes and, in addition, increase the financial resources allocated to them, so that they can hand out appropriations right, left and centre."
"It is incomprehensible that support for non-profit local community media should be seen as an item of expenditure to be funded at EU level."
"The subsidiarity principle leads self-evidently to the conclusion that this is expenditure for the Member States or regional political bodies."
"They have the expertise on these media, and it is they who have the facilities to determine whether such expenditure should take precedence over the need for resources for such things as healthcare, schools, welfare etc."
"In the interests of subsidiarity, we have voted against this report in its entirety."
"in writing. - 'Community media' often plays an important role in local communities."
"It is an influential source of information amongst the local media; sometimes even the sole voice of local communities."
"That is why the European Union should focus more on these media, especially after the failure of the Lisbon Treaty, as they may serve as an efficient means to pass on EU related information to citizens."
"As rapporteur for the report on the active dialogue with citizens on Europe, I fully support any kind of communication tool which may help to bring closer the EU to the citizens."
"Nevertheless, I am convinced that an essential precondition for community media as well as any other local media financed, even partially, from public funds, is to be independent not only from national but also from local power."
"I know that community media, especially their financing, should be a primary concern of Member States, due to their various forms and local specialities."
"Where we may help at European level is in giving more visibility to the issue."
"This report is the first step in that direction."
"in writing. - The Resetarits report, which I supported, makes reference to the importance of media in strengthening cultural and linguistic diversity."
"This week saw the launch of the first ever Gaelic language television channel - a welcome development in the promotion of the linguistic diversity of both Scotland and Europe."
"in writing. - Community media has always had an important role to play in our society."
"Such media can promote intercultural dialogue by combating negative stereotypes."
"The EU must fully recognise this by improving Community media's legal recognition and access to radio spectrum for broadcasts."
"I voted in favour of the report."
"in writing. - I cannot support this report."
"While I agree with, and welcome, many of its proposals, I have concerns regarding the narrowing of the scope of the VAT exemption in respect of investment funds."
"I believe it is better to maintain the status quo."
"in writing. - The EPLP believes that the upgrading of VAT requirements for financial services has been long overdue."
"The rapporteur has shown great diligence in his application to this task."
"We believe his approach has been very sympathetic to the issue of passing on costs to consumers and that he understands the problems that could be faced."
"We are uncertain how some points can be properly managed at a practical level - in particular, on the discretion for companies to be allowed to apply VAT."
"So we have reservations which could not be expressed in the particular amendments, because it was an 'en bloc' vote 1-28."
"The EPLP support the rapporteur but would have voted against Amendments 6 and 21."
"I would personally like to thank Joseph Muscat for his work on this report and others and for his collegiate attitude in the European Parliament."
"I hope his career goes from strength to strength and that we can welcome him back as a future prime minister of Malta very soon."
"in writing. - Whilst in favour of cooperation between Member States in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (AFSJ), UK Conservatives are voting against this resolution as we remain consistently opposed to any calls for further harmonisation in the field of AFSJ."
"In particular we are against calls in the report for the adoption of those Lisbon Treaty provisions which can be adopted under current arrangements."
"in writing. - (FR) I welcome the adoption by a very large majority of the resolution on the annual debate on progress made in 2007 in the area of freedom, security and justice."
"It is a text of high quality that forcefully reminds us of the need for the rapid adoption of the Lisbon Treaty, which will strengthen the area of freedom, security and justice by providing for fundamental improvements in regard to the legitimacy and effectiveness of EU action."
"It also invites the Commission and the Council to define the new priorities of the next multiannual programme for the area of freedom, security and justice for the period 2010-2014."
"Lastly, it proposes a number of vital measures to be adopted in the area of fundamental rights and citizenship, in regard to border protection and to immigration and asylum."
"Those are the priorities advocated by our political group and most of them can also be found in the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum, which needs to be implemented on the basis of concrete action."
"in writing. - (PT) While we agree with several points in this resolution on the so-called 'Area of Freedom, Security and Justice' - a euphemism for the real process of bringing justice and home affairs, which are sovereign powers of the Member States, into the Community system - it includes a set of objectives, priorities and proposals that we firmly reject."
"In particular because it plays deaf to the rejection of the so-called 'Lisbon' Treaty - insisting on its imposition by the end of 2009 and calling for the process of bringing justice and home affairs into the Community system to be taken forward - bearing witness to the disrespect the EP majority shows towards the Irish people's sovereign and democratic decision."
"And also, among other reasons, because it sets as objectives the development of the Schengen Information System (including decisions relating to the Prüm Treaty), Frontex and EU immigration policy (which is selective and protective and which criminalises immigration)."
"And despite complaining that the 'Union is creating de facto police and judicial cooperation with third countries, notably the US, by means of bilateral agreements on a range of issues, thereby circumventing the formal democratic decision-making procedures and Parliamentary scrutiny', the EP does not call it into question."
"in writing. - (DE) 1."
"The motion describes the Treaty of Lisbon as 'an essential and urgent precondition for ensuring that the Union is an area of freedom, security and justice'."
"The Treaty of Lisbon has been rejected as a result of the Irish referendum."
"It is high time that was accepted."
"2."
"The motion calls for the full entry into use of the second-generation Schengen Information System (SIS II) and for the strengthening of Frontex."
"The border protection agency Frontex is responsible for the operational implementation of the inhuman policy of closing off the EU to people in distress."
"This policy is an affront to humanity and must therefore be rejected outright."
"in writing. - Generally speaking we support the idea of granting long-term residents the right to vote at European and local elections."
"However, we believe it is for the Member States to decide on the right to vote in local elections in accordance with the relevant international conventions."
"in writing. - (IT) I should like to stress the importance of safeguarding pluralism in the media (already cited in Article 11 of the Charter of Rights of the European Union) in order to underpin a democratic process through which the various citizens of Europe can be provided with information in a transparent manner."
"We know that political pressure too often influences the media, especially those within the public service, which need a sizeable and stable market share so that they can rise above inadequate funding and political lobbies."
"I will therefore vote in favour of this motion for a resolution, which seeks to entrust three European universities with the task of monitoring this pluralism using indicators of reliability and impartiality."
"I also agree on the need to create supervisory systems to guarantee editorial and journalistic freedom in all Member States."
"The time is ripe - given the coming 2009 European electoral campaign - for us to draft together a Charter of Media Freedoms to combat the current precarious working conditions of many publicists and journalists."
"Finally, the new media channels, relayed in Europe and worldwide, do indeed need funding, but must also be used responsibly (for example the status of weblog authors and editors should be defined) and greater media literacy should be encouraged throughout Europe."
"in writing. - (FR) I reaffirm that I attach great importance to freedom of expression and media pluralism."
"Blogs are tools that may be a threat to people's privacy and can be put in the same category as 'violation of the press laws' if they are untrue or malicious."
"in writing. - (DE) A pluralist media system is a fundamental prerequisite for the survival of the European model of a democratic society."
"The concentration of media ownership, however, creates an environment that is conducive to the emergence of monopolies, erects barriers to market entry and leads to uniformity of media content."
"The development of the media system is increasingly driven by the profit motive."
"If conflicts of interest between concentration of media ownership and political authority are to be avoided, competition and media law must be dovetailed."
"The fact is that such conflicts of interest damage free competition and pluralism."
"In order to strengthen pluralism, there is also a need to guarantee a balance between public and private broadcasters."
"In addition, I call for measures to improve the competitiveness of media groups in order to foster economic growth."
"European and national competition rules must be applied consistently so as to ensure keen competition and an open market."
"In particular, national media regulation must be transparent and efficient."
"For this reason I welcome the Commission's intention to develop indicators to measure the plurality of the media."
"I also call for the creation of additional indicators to measure factors such as democracy and codes of conduct for journalists."
"Moreover, I believe that the provisions on media concentration should also regulate the means of access to Internet content and its dissemination."
"in writing. - (SV) Marianne Mikko's report is a shining example of when good intentions go too far and end up in conflict with the independence of the media and the fundamental principles of freedom of expression."
"Mrs Mikko's original proposal - which, among other things, covered the possibility of registration, a right to reply and facilities to prosecute authors of blogs - was far removed from the conception I have of freedom of expression and opinion-forming."
"Fortunately the report was redrafted on these points before the proposal came before the plenary."
"However, this redrafting was not sufficient to enable me to support the report; on many points, the proposal is still in conflict with the independence of the media, free opinion-forming and freedom of expression."
"Amendment 5 - which was finally approved by Parliament - is a better alternative to the report."
"Better but not good."
"The issue of media concentration and diversity is important and should be discussed."
"But this resolution is not the right way to go."
"Questions concerning the media must always be handled in a responsible and considered manner."
"When it comes to media independence, freedom of opinion-forming and freedom of expression, I cannot compromise."
"These values are far too fundamental to tinker with."
"I therefore abstained in today's vote."
"By this action I seek to show my support for the debate, but also to express my concern over repeated attempts to regulate questions concerning the media and freedom of expression."
"in writing. - (PT) With the changes introduced into the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament, which in these circumstances does not accept specific proposals for amendments, what has just been voted on was not the Mikko report, but rather an overarching proposal for an alternative resolution."
"The final resolution approved is clearly better than the report, and we voted for it for that reason alone, but it retains certain aspects that we disagree with."
"Our principal disagreement concerns the way it addresses a pseudo-balance in interlinking so-called 'competition law' with media law, in that experience has shown that the interests of capital outweigh all rights and freedoms, including freedom of expression in the media, very often calling pluralism into question."
"Although it states elsewhere that 'the main objectives of public authorities should be to create conditions that ensure a high level of media quality (including those of the public media), secure media diversity and guarantee the full independence of journalists', we know that this is difficult to achieve when the democratic state's role is weak."
"The truth is that when the principal media outlets are owned by economic and financial groups, freedom of expression and journalistic independence are not guaranteed."
"in writing. - I congratulate my colleague Marianne Mikko on her report."
"I will be voting in favour of the joint alternative motion for a resolution tabled by my group jointly with the Liberals and Greens, which is the closest to my own position."
"I see no reason why something that is illegal in written or oral form should be legal on the internet."
"Of course, enforcement may be difficult, but that is not a reason for inaction."
"After all, we have speed limits on remote country roads, when policing it is very hard. Yet this is not used to justify a free-for-all."
"in writing. - (SV) This report and the alternative resolutions tabled with it fall outside the legislative procedure and are nothing more than an expression of the desire of the federalist majority in the European Parliament to get the EU even more involved in the field of culture and media policy."
"During the preparation of the report, the rapporteur went much too far in her ambition to control and supervise the blogging universe."
"As luck would have it, the committee backed down somewhat in its proposal to plenary, and the motions tabled by some of the political groups are better than the report itself."
"But the basic question remains: why should this report be debated in the European Parliament at all?"
"The question of media concentration is important - so important that it should continue to be handled in the Member States."
"We have therefore voted against this report in its entirety."
"in writing. - (DE) I am voting in favour of Marianne Mikko's report on concentration and pluralism in the media in the EU."
"Access to free and diverse media in all Member States is vitally important these days."
"The two-pillar model that was introduced for private and public television and audiovisual media services has developed very well."
"So that this development process can continue as fruitfully as possible, stable funding must be provided for public broadcasting corporations, enabling them to promote public interests and social values, to preserve pluralism in the media and to give people access to high-quality content."
"I also support the creation of a charter for media freedom."
"This would be a bridgehead for efforts to guarantee freedom of expression."
"Provision for the independence of journalists, however, must be made by means of specific legal and social guarantees."
"The concentration of media ownership is also a problem, since it encourages the emergence of monopolies."
"There is therefore a need to merge competition and media legislation in order to guarantee access, competition and quality."
"The report more or less covers all the main points, and for this reason I am backing the rapporteur."
"in writing. - (RO) As we all agree, pluralism should be a vital element of the mass media."
"Pluralism must be supported, and the adoption of the Mikko report constitutes a major step in this direction."
"The need for a balanced mass media market should be recognised and supported by the Member States, which should commit themselves, both individually and collectively, to giving European citizens the opportunity of obtaining accurate and diverse information."
"Cultural diversity, as well as the ever-increasing need for integration of the migrant population and of minorities, along with the importance of providing quality information to the active population, are the priority reasons for creating a Media Freedom Charter."
"I would like to express my full support for the European Parliament's recommendation that public media services should be encouraged to act as alternative providers of information to ones based exclusively on commercial criteria."
"Active exercise of rights and obligations by European citizens, and their being informed and capable of understanding and criticising the provision of information is a necessity which should bear on every measure to be adopted in the future both by European institutions and by each Member State."
"in writing. - New technology has led to the emergence of new media channels and changes in media content."
"A wide-spanning media system is essential for nurturing democracy and free thought."
"I broadly voted in support of Marianne Mikko's recommendations."
"in writing. - (DE) Concentration in the media is a widespread evil and must be combated."
"First of all, however, there are several countries in the EU where concentration in the media is a problem, and it is therefore unacceptable to mention only one country."
"Secondly, in several places the report calls on the European Commission to act in an area of activity that is covered by the subsidiarity principle."
"Had that been amended, or had I been able to vote for such an amendment, I would have approved the Mikko report."
"The increase in media ownership by the few makes for greater monopolies and stifles the essential diversity of opinion."
"Access to information today seems unrestricted and at the same time deficient."
"Business groups own a large proportion of the media and Internet services and are also their own best-advertised customers."
"It is essential to safeguard quality public television that is pluralistic, open and independent."
"As for freedom of expression on the Internet, the EU should place great emphasis on public dialogue to ensure both freedom of expression and the protection of personal data."
"The debate has only just begun."
"By cooperating with civil society, solutions can be found."
"The amendment of the Rules of Procedure, as adopted by us on 8 July 2008, resulted in new rules on own-initiative reports."
"During this second September part-session, we have had the opportunity to see how these rules work in practice."
"During the Monday evening debate on several own-initiative reports, it turned out, however, that this change was not the most felicitous."
"Only the rapporteur and a representative of the Commission were heard in the debate on each report."
"The debate lost its dynamism because the shadow rapporteurs were not allowed to speak either."
"Even the rule that members who took part in the preparation of the report can present their comments in writing is proving problematic."
"The rule in force is that, during the course of one part-session, each member can react in writing only once."
"The procedure for voting on own-initiative reports is also proving problematic."
"Under the new rule, amendments are not admissible for consideration in plenary."
"Only an alternative motion for a resolution may be tabled on behalf of a political group."
"In practical terms, the shortcomings of our decision affected this very report, by Mrs Mikko, on concentration and pluralism in the media in the European Union."
"The relatively balanced report contained some points concerning particular Member States."
"I think that the contents of a report touching on such a sensitive theme should remain neutral."
"I did not intend to vote against the report but we did not get the chance to vote on the motion for a resolution tabled by our political group, the PPE-DE Group."
"I am asking for this rule to be changed."
"in writing. - (PL) Mr President, pluralism in the media means diversity in the dissemination of information and the characteristic nature of broadcasters."
"Both of these areas are currently under threat in the media sector."
"An ever-increasing concentration of ownership among media companies that are competing in this sector has led to a situation where information that is valuable from the social and cultural points of view is difficult to find in the maze of easily accessible and standardised news for everyone."
"It is difficult to predict what the worsening situation in this sector will lead to, not just for individual consumers, but also for society as a whole."
"The rapporteur was right to emphasise the role of public sector broadcasters as the guardians of diversity, with a mission to broadcast high quality information."
"She is also right to propose a model where there are strong public sector media outside the competitive media market coexisting with private media companies that are motivated by profit."
"There can be no doubt about the importance of balance between these two pillars."
"The text of the report, as well as the intentions of the rapporteur, seem to be clear and transparent."
"The compromise reached during the discussions of the Committee on Culture is a good one."
"In addition, the legal status of the new methods of disseminating information, such as Internet blogs, or other user-generated sites, should be clearly delineated so that the people creating these forms should be aware of their rights and responsibilities and any possible sanctions."
"There will be more of this type of content."
"Basing these measures on a code of ethics is a step in the right direction."
"in writing. - (PL) In the resolution on concentration and pluralism in the media in the European Union that has been adopted, Members of the European Parliament, including myself, were right to speak in favour of guaranteeing freer access to diverse mass media as well as of freedom of expression."
"It should also, however, be pointed out that, as regards Internet blogs, the resolution differs significantly from the initial version of the report by Marianne Mikko and the Committee on Culture and Education."
"This report assumed there would be a clarification of the status of Internet blogs and user-generated sites such that they would be subject to regulations that are similar to those used for other publications."
"However, the resolution that was in fact adopted calls for an open discussion on the status of Internet blogs."
"For this reason I voted in favour of the resolution."
"In my view, the Internet and, specifically, Internet blogs, play an important role in promoting media pluralism and freedom of expression and, as such, should be free from any restrictions."
"Point 25 of the report in its previous version, if it were interpreted badly, constituted a threat to the freedom of expression of authors using this ever more popular medium."
"I would state in the strongest possible terms that any similar attempts at regulation and control in the future should be rejected by the European Parliament."
"in writing. - (PL) During today's vote, I supported the resolution on concentration and pluralism in the media in the European Union."
"I agree with the principle that motivates the rapporteur, namely that there has to be some equality as regards standards for the protection of democracy and basic freedoms."
"In today's world, the mass media have an enormous and ever-increasing influence."
"The appearance of ever-newer media is a positive development."
"It increases dynamism and variety in this sector."
"I believe that, in this regard, there is a need to create a system of monitoring and implementation based on indicators of media pluralism that are set in a reliable and impartial manner."
"We should defend media pluralism as an important aspect of democracy and freedom, in order to guarantee access to free and diverse mass media to all the inhabitants of the European Union."
"In addition, I can see that it would be worth creating a charter of media freedoms, which would provide guarantees not just for the social rights of broadcasters and journalists, but would also guarantee freedom of expression."
"in writing. - (RO) Continued increases in the price of oil is leading to major concerns as regards the impact of this phenomenon on economic growth within the EU, and in particular as regards its negative effect on consumer purchasing power and the quality of life."
"EU foreign policy is crucial in this regard."
"Since the EU economy still depends to a significant extent on energy imports, it is necessary to institute a common energy policy based on the principle of solidarity, security and diversification of sources and external supply routes."
"In my capacity as rapporteur on regional cooperation in the Black Sea area, I have constantly stressed the importance and urgency of these actions."
"Today, however, I urge the Commission and the Council to bring forward concrete measures to reduce EU energy dependence in the immediate future."
"My appeal concerns not only oil imports, but also gas imports, and includes the implementation of the Nabucco project."
"in writing. - (SV) We voted against Amendment 1 on the taxation of windfall profits, because we think that the text proposed is unclear and we question both how it is to be implemented and, more especially, what the ultimate purpose of the proposal is."
"However, we voted for the amendment advocating reduced VAT on energy-saving goods and services, since that is one of many possible ways of stimulating the switch to more energy-efficient alternatives."
"We would, however, point out that taxes are a national matter and decisions on them can only be taken by the Member States."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted for this resolution because, in stressing the discrepancy between the value of crude oil on the international markets and the final price of fuel, it manages to address this sensitive issue without taking the emotive approach adopted by some governments, such as the Portuguese Government, for example."
"In Portugal, Minister Manuel Pinho revealed not only his total confusion (and limited power to intervene), but also an unacceptable interference in the regulator's independence."
"This is no more than wishful thinking in the run-up to elections."
"I reject any administrative price-fixing or fiscal harmonisation of fuel at European level."
"I agree to tax intervention (VAT and production tax), provided it is temporary and selective in favour of the most seriously affected households and industrial sectors."
"To my mind, the solution essentially involves reinforcing current oil regulations."
"Rather than expecting it to fall into line behind the Minister's statements or consumer complaints, the Competition Authority should act within its powers of initiative to overcome the climate of mistrust surrounding its capacity to oversee the oil sector."
"Portuguese public opinion deserves a firm guarantee that anti-competitive practices are not a factor in the establishment of prices."
"If it is confirmed that they are, then the Competition Authority must intervene impartially and impose exemplary sanctions."
"in writing. - I am happy to support the practical ideas contained in most of this resolution on rising energy prices."
"National and regional authorities need to bring action plans as soon as possible to protect our most vulnerable citizens."
"In the medium term a shift to renewable sources of energy coupled with increased energy efficiency will help protect us from the inevitable swings in prices that come with reliance on fossil fuels, but in the here-and-now concrete action is needed to relieve and eradicate fuel poverty."
"I do not agree, however, that liberalisation of the energy markets is part of the solution to rising prices."
"in writing. - I voted for the joint motion for a resolution on 'Getting a grip on energy prices'."
"However, I voted against Amendment 1 calling for a windfall tax at European level."
"Rather, due to different levels of energy charges across the Union, this is something that must and should be done at national level."
"in writing. - I voted against the resolution on energy prices."
"Whilst I wholeheartedly agree that rising energy prices require affirmative political action, I reject the resolution's references to 'low carbon' energy."
"I reject the idea that increased nuclear energy can have a positive impact on the environment and believe that political attention should be focused on non-nuclear renewable energy sources."
"in writing. - I welcome the positive vote today on recognising energy poverty and reducing VAT for energy saving goods."
"in writing. - (SV) There is much that the EU can do to reduce the problem of obesity and on which we should focus attention in Parliament."
"It is good therefore that Parliament today voted for the report on nutrition, overweight and obesity."
"One of the consequences of that decision is that Parliament is now calling for a ban on trans-fats."
"At the same time, however, we think that the report could have said a lot less about what schools should do and what food they should serve."
"We think that is best decided at national or local level."
"in writing. - (PT) The fight against the serious public health problem of overweight- and obesity-related disease must be a priority from the early stages of life."
"This report asks Member States, local entities and school authorities to monitor and to improve the quality and nutritional standards of school meals."
"Nutritional information on food is important, particularly the difference between natural trans-fatty acids present in meat and dairy products and those produced during industrial processing (artificial)."
"The undifferentiated labelling of trans fats will only confuse consumers, create a negative image of healthy dairy products and have undesirable effects on consumption, undermining public health (reduced intake of important nutrients such as calcium and proteins, for example)."
"European indicators such as waist size are useful for monitoring the risk factors people are exposed to in relation to various obesity-related diseases."
"An understanding of the distribution of abdominal obesity facilitates the planning of more effective measures to minimise such problems."
"I agree with colour coding to label foods because, rather than clear and easily understandable labelling, what Europeans need are signs that they can interpret in order to make healthy choices."
"in writing. - (PT) Overweight and diet-related diseases are a serious public health problem, which means that the fight against obesity must be set as a priority from the early stages of life."
"The Foglietta report is highly relevant in calling on Member States, local entities and school authorities to monitor and improve the quality and nutritional standards of school meals."
"I believe that nutritional information must always be provided on food, particularly an indication of artificial trans-fats, because these have more negative effects on health."
"Failure to distinguish artificial trans-fats from natural fats would mislead consumers and only contribute towards a negative image of some animal foods that contain natural trans-fats, such as meat and dairy products."
"I also voted for the development of European indicators such as waist size and other obesity-related risk factors because I believe they may be useful in the future for assessing the risks facing the population, and for the success of the measures implemented."
"in writing. - I cannot support this report or Amendment 6 as I feel that it is inappropriate to include tax- or VAT-based issues in a health-based report such as this."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of the Foglietta report and welcome the White Paper on nutrition, overweight and obesity-related health issues."
"Obesity is a major problem across Europe and conditions related to obesity and bad nutrition have serious consequences across societies."
"In my own country, the Scottish Government has taken positive steps to improve the nutrition within public institutions such as schools and hospitals and such initiatives are to be encouraged across the EU."
"in writing. - (FI) I voted in favour of Mr Foglietta's own-initiative report adopted by the Committee on nutrition, overweight and obesity in our public health strategy."
"I applaud the basic view that industry should be given a chance to try and reduce health problems as a result of being overweight or obese through self-regulation, but where the Commission would also be empowered to ensure that attempts at reasonable and responsible advertising (especially in the case of children), for example, and reductions in the amount of salt, fat and sugar that people consume in food are actually realised."
"It is important to provide consumers with comprehensive information on food package labelling, so that they know how to choose between good, better and worse food."
"In my view, and in contrast with current practice, the content of artificial trans-fats should definitely be included in food product descriptions."
"I voted against the line our group adopted on this"
"I supported our group's opinion, however, on the use of colour coding in the labelling of food."
"Colour-coded labels, whose purpose it is to send a clear message on how good a product is for the health and which has provoked much debate in Europe, are often misleading, and so of no value whatsoever."
"Many UK supermarket chains for this reason have aimed to do away with a practice they have previously adopted."
"in writing. - (DE) I shall be voting for Alessandro Foglietta's report concerning the White Paper on a strategy for Europe on nutrition-, overweight- and obesity-related health issues."
"I agree with the rapporteur on the need for restructuring measures in health, sport and nutrition."
"Problems such as overweight and unhealthy eating habits occur most frequently among socially and economically deprived sections of the population."
"One of the first ways to solve the problem can be implemented in schools."
"More PE lessons and a balanced diet for children and young people would be among the first steps towards a healthier lifestyle, and nutritional science should be a compulsory subject in every European school."
"In addition, the labelling of food products would be welcome, since it would enable consumers to compare products and to distinguish between good and inferior food."
"The report does not offer a perfect solution, but it does propose some very good measures."
"These measures can change a few things for the better, which is why I judge them very favourably."
"in writing. - (FR) It is laudable of the European Commission to concern itself with healthy food and exercise for all citizens, to prevent them from becoming overweight, obese and chronically ill."
"I certainly support the intention to sound the alarm in face of the obesity epidemic that has struck three million children and 20-30% of adults, while 14 million children and half the adult population are overweight."
"I welcome the fact that the influence on consumer behaviour of flavour enhancers - such as glutamates, guanylates and inosinates, which are found in massive quantities in a great many prepared dishes and industrially prepared food - is being recognised and analysed."
"At the same time I regret that my amendment, which seeks to promote healthy eating habits by consulting Euro-Toques, an association of chefs that adheres to a code of honour and supports the intrinsic quality of products and the protection of local production, was not adopted."
"I believe we would be well-advised to draw on their know-how in order to promote best practice, in school dining halls among others, and to develop a taste in young people for quality food and healthy eating habits."
"in writing. - I welcome Alessandro Foglietta's report on the White Paper on nutrition, overweight and obesity-related health issues."
"The report contains a number of positive recommendations such as the proposal for an EU-wide ban on trans-fatty acids that have been found to be linked to heart disease and female infertility."
"However, I would join my colleagues in supporting measures that go further."
"Schools, for example, should not find themselves in the position where they have to consider the option of housing advertising of unhealthy foods on their premises."
"My vote reflects these views."
"Obesity has taken on epidemic proportions."
"The most obese people in Europe are to be found in Greece, where 3 in 4 are overweight and there has been a 956% increase in fast food."
"To combat obesity, drastic measures must be taken here and now:"
"VAT on fruit and vegetables must be reduced;"
"VAT on health-food products and protection of traditional products must be reduced;"
"Correct nutrition must be ensured from infancy;"
"In schools, food must be checked in canteens and there must be physical exercise;"
"Advertising and misleading information on products with a high fat, sugar or salt content should be banned;"
"Clear nutritional information on labels should be compulsory, so that consumers can make healthy diet choices;"
"Synthetic trans-fats and flavour enhancers in industrially produced convenience foods should be banned."
"At the beginning of 2009 the European Commission programme for free distribution of fruit and vegetables to schools comes into effect."
"This will be funded with European capital to a total of EUR 90 million annually and will be supplemented with national funding."
"The Greek Government must secure the capital to launch this programme immediately."
"in writing. - The need for clear labelling on food will help in our fight against obesity."
"I was very disappointed to see the rejection of mandatory front-of-pack labelling with colour coding in this report."
"This is a measure I strongly support."
"I welcome the calls for an EU-wide ban on artificial transfatty acids."
"in writing. - There are a number of basic principles that have to be applied to the right of EU patients to seek care in another member state other than their own."
"WE cannot allow the ECJ to make policy in this area on a case by case, piecemeal basis."
"They will decide purely on market grounds and not on the basis of the uniqueness of health care as a non-market universal service."
"The health and wellbeing of patients has to be at the core of the law we make in this area."
"Until such time as there is agreement that we can harmonise our national health services to the highest standards, then MS must be free to plan and fund and manage services to deliver high quality public health services within their borders."
"Competition between national health services must not be an objective or an outcome of this legislation."
"The best interests of patients will not be served by treating health as simply another commodity to be bought and sold."
"This in my view would drive standards down."
"in writing. - (SV) This resolution states views on appropriate policy measures covering such matters as employment protection, the fight against poverty, labour market measures, the integration of elderly people into the job market, professional mobility and differences in remuneration."
"Important labour market questions of this kind must on no account be regulated by way of lectures from the EU institutions."
"The Member States are better placed than the EU institutions to develop successful policy in these areas."
"Any international coordination that may be needed should be pursued within the framework of global organisations with broad democratic legitimacy, such as the ILO."
"We have therefore voted against this resolution in the final vote."
"in writing. - (NL) We are still glad that the European Parliament excluded heath care services from the general directive on services."
"Healthcare is after all a specific sector requiring a specific approach."
"The fundamental premise of the proposal, in line with established case-law, has to be that the organisation and funding of healthcare are the responsibility of Member States."
"This means on the one hand that patient mobility cannot be made an absolute right and on the other hand that there are no excuses for not investing in one's own health system."
"That premise also necessarily implies that Member States must be able to charge the real cost to the patient."
"There must be solidarity, but there must also be the possibility of different treatment for patients who have contributed in their own country through the social security and tax system and foreign patients who have not."
"The fact that we have the directive is a good thing, but anyone familiar with the sector feels that it still needs a lot more work."
"To my mind the quality, accessibility and financial sustainability of healthcare on the basis of socially responsible solidarity remain the key criteria here."

"Progress report on the reform of the European schools (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on the progress report on the reform of the European Schools, by Katerina Batzeli and Erna Hennicot-Schoepges - B6-0454/2008)."
"author. - (FR) Madam President, I thank the Commissioner for having agreed to address this question, which was tabled some four months ago."
"Let me remind you of the responsibilities of the EP Committee on Culture and Education, which, according to Annex VI, Section XV(2) of the Rules of Procedure, include 'promotion of the system of European schools.'"
"Those schools give priority to educating the children of Community officials."
"Those children, classed as category I, make up around 70% of the total, pay no enrolment fees and the Commission contributes about 60% of the funding."
"Category II children, who make up 5%, and category III, who make up 25%, pay school fees of between EUR 4 000 and 16 000."
"The 14 existing schools teach nearly 21 000 pupils, from nursery school to baccalaureate level, out of a total of 100 million in the Union of 27, in 14 official languages with an identical curriculum in all the language sections."
"Compared to the situation of all the other school children in the European Union, these pupils are, therefore, highly privileged."
"In 2006 the Commission promised to reform the system - a laudable undertaking - with a view to establishing a European education system applicable to all types of school that wished to award the European baccalaureate, based on a common curriculum and, where possible, tuition in the mother tongue."
"The school in Parma, which is approved by the Board of Governors of the European Schools, will be the first school of its kind to award a European baccalaureate in June 2009."
"For its part, the Board of Governors of the European Schools undertook an in-depth assessment of the baccalaureate with a view to the ongoing reform."
"A study commissioned by the European Parliament's Committee on Culture and Education, which will be available in October, shows that 94% of those who have passed the baccalaureate go on to higher education in the main European universities and that 62% of them study in a university outside their country of origin."
"There is, therefore, far greater mobility among these students than among others."
"That means we have at our disposal a European educational system that has proved its worth."
"In its resolutions of 2002 and 2005, the European Parliament advocated a profound reform of the schools system with a view to better governance and greater openness."
"Given the successive enlargements of the EU and the increasing number of EU agencies and places of work of its staff, surely it is urgently necessary to reform the model of the European schools system and to begin to transpose it into the general educational systems?"
"Is it not time to offer European citizens a well-tried, multilingual and flexible model of schooling that responds to their concern for mobility and to draw on the experience gained from the European schools?"
"Of course I know what the reply will be: that is not within our powers."
"At least we should work on this because surely the perception of the European schools as elitist and the categorisation of pupils within those schools are incompatible with the objectives of a single market, mobility and greater social cohesion?"
"What progress has been made in the process of reform and greater openness to ensure that the European schools system can move towards a system of European schooling, while maintaining everything that has been achieved to date?"
"What kind of Community funding systems could be envisaged to improve the running of the accredited schools?"
"Parma may show us a way forward."
"Lastly, I would like to ask the Commissioner what progress has been made in the field of education for children with special needs?"
"I am well aware that this subject is of interest to a large number of fellow Members and I thank the Commissioner and the President for this opportunity to hold a public debate on it."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, I thank the honourable Members for these questions and for this opportunity to discuss these issues in the European Parliament again."
"For the Commission, the reform of the European School system is a priority issue, and this is one of the most complicated items we are dealing with. The Commission has always strongly promoted the wider opening of the European School system, and progress has been achieved."
"Political agreement on this issue was marked at the ministerial meeting of November 2006, under the Dutch presidency of governors of European schools."
"Following formal approval by the Board of Governors in April 2008 of the concrete modalities to achieve this goal, any accredited school in the Member States can now teach the European curriculum and deliver the European Baccalaureate."
"It is up to the relevant authorities of the Member States to take initiatives to concretise this opening of the European School System in their national schools."
"The opening of the European School System is in line with the European Parliament's wish to ensure that this would be possible both in places where an EU decentralised agency is located (so-called 'type-II schools'), and in locations without a direct EU presence (so-called 'type-III schools')."
"After almost 50 years of existence, the European Baccalaureate has indeed acquired a high intrinsic value."
"The Commission wants to maintain the high quality of this diploma."
"The Board of Governors of the European Schools approved in April 2008 a revision of the European Baccalaureate Agreement."
"Accredited schools can now deliver the European Baccalaureate."
"In 2007, Parliament's Committee on Culture and Education initiated a study to analyse the academic and professional careers of former pupils of the European Schools, as the honourable Member just mentioned."
"This study will show the specific benefits and possible difficulties experienced by former pupils of the European Schools."
"The Secretary-General of the European Schools has also launched a study to make an external evaluation of the European Baccalaureate."
"I trust that the combined results of both studies will provide key elements to assess how to further improve the European School System in order to best adjust it to the changing needs of its pupils."
"Finally, I can inform you that the European School System has considerably increased its efforts to integrate children with special educational needs (SEN)."
"In the school year 2004/2005, the European Schools had 274 pupils with special educational needs."
"In the last school year, there were 411 such pupils enrolled in the European Schools."
"The SEN budget allocated for 2008 is EUR 3 123 000; in 2004, the SEN budget spent was a little over EUR 2 million."
"The Commission would like to thank the Disability Intergroup of the European Parliament for taking the initiative to set aside a reserve of EUR 200 000 for a pilot project for a SEN resource centre."
"This initiative gives the European School system the opportunity to better fulfil the needs of SEN children."
"The Board of Governors of the European Schools approved in July 2008 the proposal to use the European Parliament reserve of EUR 200 000 to make an evaluation of the existing SEN policy in the European Schools."
"This study will allow the European Schools to improve the quality of integration of SEN pupils."
"The European Commission launched in July 2008 the financial procedure for the liberation of the European Parliament reserve of EUR 200 000."
"The transfer to the budgetary authorities is currently being initiated."
"Progress has been achieved, but it is crucial that the European Parliament supports the reform process initiated by the Commission in order to finalise this reform and put it fully into practice as soon as possible."
"Again, the crucial role must be played by Member States."
"I would like to underline that we have good contacts with the Member States."
"I hope that the Swedish presidency - which is not the presidency of the European Union but the presidency in the European Schools Board - will develop these initiatives."
"I would like to stress that the report drawn up by Mr Bösch, a Member of the European Parliament, has been very useful and he has been very instrumental in this issue."
"I myself will do everything to develop the system of European Schools, because we are experiencing great difficulties with a system that was designed in 1953, and we must therefore implement some serious changes to make this system flexible and work well."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (NL) Madam President, I have asked to speak because I am concerned."
"We are talking about the European Schools today, and I am grateful to Mrs Hennicot for that."
"I should like to draw the attention of Commissioner Kallas to a specific aspect of the European Schools, namely religious education."
"During the course of last year a number of worrying reports reached me."
"As you all know, the Board of Governors of the European Schools ruled last year that a minimum of seven pupils of the same language was needed in order for a subject to be taught in the mother tongue."
"For general subjects such as geography and maths this is not a problem, but it is very different when it comes to religious education."
"This raising of the minimum number means that there are now European Schools where pupils are no longer able to receive religious education in their own language."
"I am most concerned by this, especially at primary level."
"I think that religion, talking and learning about the standards and values we all prize so greatly in Europe, is extremely important."
"In religion, feelings are very important and as we all know, children are best able to express feelings and emotions in their mother tongue."
"I find it unacceptable that, depending on their language and nationality, some pupils can and others cannot receive religious education in their own language."
"So I ask the Commissioner to give thought to this and to set clear guidelines."
"All pupils, whether their mother tongue is English, German or Dutch, must have the same opportunities and the same quality of instruction."
"Consideration should be given not only to the pupils but also to the position of teaching staff."
"The 'minimum of seven' rule means that every year the question arises of whether there are enough pupils, and teaching staff are not sure whether religious education will be provided in the following school year."
"This professional uncertainty has consequences when it comes to finding good teachers of religious education in all languages."
"I urge the Commission to emphasise the importance of religious education for European School parents and pupils and to hold out for the continuation of religious education in pupils' mother tongue at the European Schools."
"on behalf of the PSE. - (ES) Commissioner, we have already noted here that the European Schools were, as official centres of instruction, established jointly by the governments of the Member States of the Union to provide multilingual and multicultural education primarily to the children of the staff of the institutions and that for many reasons they now need to be reformed, essentially in the light of new needs."
"The Union's institutional development, enlargement, and the proliferation of agencies have led to changes in the profile of the pupils in the European Schools both as regards culture and language and in terms of numbers of pupils; applications to register have risen sharply."
"Moreover, increased flexibility in employment contracts has led to new family and employment circumstances which affect social and family profiles and families' needs."
"As Parliament has already noted in two resolutions, reform is necessary to modernise the schools so that they provide the required quality of service for which they were established, are accessible and overcome specific problems of access or segregation."
"To that end I welcome the Commissioner's announcement on the two studies now under way, we will see if they bear fruit."
"In short, despite the increase in the number of Community languages and the increased complexities we face on many fronts, progress must be made in the process of reform, openness and improvement of these schools while ensuring that their qualifications are recognised in all Member States of the Union."
"Having said that, I would like to put two specific questions to the Commissioner."
"The first relates to a number of complaints I have received from the parents of some pupils who have studied at the European School: it would appear that when they leave after taking the European Baccalaureate to continue their studies, one point is deducted from the average mark awarded; in other words they are penalised."
"I would like to know whether you are aware of this practice and the reason for it."
"The second question relates to the children of Parliamentary assistants."
"I have also received complaints from assistants who have to send their children as category three entries if they want them to attend these schools; in other words, they have to pay school fees."
"I have visited the page which sets out all the information on how the Euroschools work;"
"I have it here and shall read it in French because that is the language I found it in."
"It says, under category one:"
"(FR) 'The children of staff in the service of the Community institutions and of the organisations listed below employed directly and continuously for a minimum period of one year.'"
"(ES) A list of twelve points follows; point 4 says:"
"(FR) 'Persons with a directly binding contract of employment, governed by private law, with the European institutions'."
"(ES) This, then, is the situation for people or the group of people who we might well think of as falling within category one. I would like to ask you why the children of Parliamentary assistants have to register under category three and pay school fees."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FI) Madam President, firstly I would like to say on behalf of my group that it is true that the present system is fairly complicated."
"It needs to be simplified, and we know that matters of education basically fall within the competence of the Member States, though in the case of the European Schools it also lies with the Union. Wherever there are EU agencies there must also be European Schools."
"That is a basic principle, and we should also remember that our various strategies allow us to tell the citizens of Europe that education is always an investment in the future."
"It is on that basis that we should act in the case of the European Schools."
"I would next like to raise a few points concerning education."
"The first concerns the extent to which it is free."
"I think that we in Europe should have a debate on making all education free, whatever school we are talking about."
"Every child and young person should have the chance of a good education and the opportunity to benefit from good teaching, and not having to pay is one guarantee of that."
"I think that if the Member States want this and if we really believe that education is an investment in the future, we can achieve this goal."
"It is also important that teaching is done in the student's mother tongue, as that is the basis of identity."
"Children and young people at European schools come from different cultures and different nations."
"It is important that they are taught in their own language, but is also vital to remember that we need special teaching facilities and also that students need to be taught cultural awareness, as they are often rootless, coming as they do from one country to another, which is a new and alien environment."
"For that reason we should also make sure of their overall personal development and growth as human beings."
"This is also the basis for European human rights policy and the European notion of humanity."
"As for the special facilities I mentioned, class sizes are one thing that could be invested in."
"Class sizes must not be too large and every child should be given the chance to receive tailor-made options."
"I will end by saying that the real educational standards amongst us Europeans will be measured in terms of how we treat those close to us who are worse off and how we look after children and young people, and the European schools are a shop window for the world."
"What are our actual standards of education and how do we look after our young people?"
"Are we prepared to invest in them and their future?"
"I hope that Europe can afford to do that and that it does actually invest in children and young people and in the European schools."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, 50 years of experience in European Schools that are faced with the specific problem of different languages, cultural diversity and migration makes one consider whether this experience should be used to make this school model more widely available."
"It is not just the children of officials working in European institutions who need to be taught foreign languages at the highest level, as well as integration with their peers from other European countries."
"It is not just they, who, because their parents have taken up posts abroad, need a particular approach to schooling."
"We are opposed to discrimination."
"Why then should children other than the children of these officials be excluded from those schools?"
"I would also like to draw attention to the issue that is being considered by the Committee on Culture and Education, namely the need to reinstate the classics, Greek and Latin, in schools in Europe and also an emphasis on teaching Latin and Greek in the European Schools."
"I believe it is essential to give urgent consideration to the need to extend and reform European Schools as well as the principles according to which they operate."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, as a member of the Committee on Culture, allow me to extend my warm welcome to the initiative of Erna Hennicot-Schoepges and Katerina Batzeli, members of the Committee on Culture, to address an oral question to the European Commission and have this debate on the progress of the reform of the European schools."
"Speaking of multilingualism and its importance, let me use this opportunity to raise a serious concern we have in Romania, where the recent initiative of the Ministry of Regional Development to complete the translation of the EU's regional operational programme from Romanian into Hungarian met serious attacks from the Romanian Social Democratic Party run by several leaders of the former communist regime."
"Please note that this is happening in one of the 27 EU Member States in the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, at a time when Commissioner Leonard Orban issued a policy document entitled, 'Multilingualism: an asset for Europe and a shared commitment'."
"In the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, a debate on the reform of the European Schools could not be of greater importance, as we live in a multicultural and multilingual Europe, where different cultures and languages coexist."
"We need to encourage and enable such cultural interaction for successful European integration."
"Therefore, our European educational system needs to reflect this multicultural characteristic and allow a healthy and easy coexistence."
"European schools in particular were set up to meet these needs - to provide multicultural and multilingual education while also strengthening European identity."
"However, in an enlarged EU with greater citizen mobility and more agencies being created in different Member States, it has become a challenge to meet these needs."
"As the questions in today's debate underline, there is a great need to focus on reforms, as it has proved to be more and more complex to provide multilingual and flexible education of high quality."
"Allow me to stress the fact that only by allowing students to express and practice their own cultural identity and use their own mother tongue throughout their education and formation can we allow them to evolve as true European citizens."
"If students studying in European Schools are not able first to develop their national identity through the use of their mother tongue and culture, I believe that they will not have a strong basis to build their European identity."
"Thank you for your attention and I wish you good luck in the reform process of the European Schools."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Madam President, a number of years ago two problems were identified with the European Schools."
"One was that they were lagging far behind in inclusiveness and integrated policies for special education needs (SEN) children."
"The other was that when parents would make an application to the school for a child with special needs, they had a practice of saying that they were not really able to meet their needs and the parents should go and find something else."
"This really was not good enough."
"In December 2007, Parliament set money aside in its budget to 'contribute to the financing of first-class education for SEN children and to promote the concept of inclusive education and that this sum is to be released upon presentation of a proposal for the launch of a pilot project for the SEN resource centre comprising qualified personnel with relevant experience and appropriate teaching materials'."
"In the time I have I will not go through the negotiations, the back and forth, that have gone on about this pilot project."
"What has come about is that the pilot project has become several half-posts in psychology and some other resources, but it is not what I would see as a pilot project: actual classes, integrated classes throughout the European Schools."
"I feel it is time for us to be very clear about the goal."
"The goal is inclusion and the goal is to integrate children in a way that is possible for them."
"There are now 411 SEN pupils in the European Schools in the SEN project."
"This is 2%, and yet disability in the general population is 17%."
"We are still not allowing enough children with special education needs into the schools, so we are still missing out on 15%."
"I cannot believe the figure for the population of people entitled to those schools is different from that in the general population."
"We certainly need to have a project and assess the situation but we could do that for ever - we have been looking at the situation for ever!"
"It is time to move beyond the pilot schemes."
"It is time to make a real approach to children as standard practice in all the schools."
"We are a long way from doing that."
"This is the other meaning of diversity."
"It is not just about languages and cultures: it is about peoples' needs and their abilities and catering to the wide diversity of that as well."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, while there is no doubt that the attempts to develop a European School have to be welcomed, we must not forget that the strategic objective is in some ways to make Europe into a guide from the scientific and social points of view, and into a model of cohabitation."
"In that sense, we then have to build on Europe's cultural roots, for instance what Rome gave us in terms of law, what Greece gave us in terms of philosophy, and what Germany gave us in terms of music."
"However, it also has to be said that those languages considered to be dead, such as Latin and Greek, now need to be revived - and there is clear evidence of this - since they are languages that the most sophisticated American companies, such as General Motors or Yale University, consider fundamental for the modus operandi of entrepreneurs or, if you like, heads of family."
"It also has to be said that Christianity and the Christian values of our roots are fundamental elements in any genuine European School."
"(EL) Madam President, Commissioner, my fellow Members have presented you with a series of requests for more progress in European schools, which serve as examples for other schools in the Member States."
"Please answer my question about how much local legislation affects European schools."
"We have found that there are differences between the schools in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany and Luxembourg."
"We have identified these differences specifically in the approach to children with learning difficulties."
"They have received different treatment depending on whether they are in Brussels or in Luxembourg."
"While we are on the subject of pupils, why should they be separated into categories?"
"Why do they have to make a careful choice of Baccalaureate courses before they have any lessons?"
"Why do religious knowledge and classical languages have to be taught according to the number of pupils in the class?"
"Why are children not taught the history of their country of origin?"
"Why are children not taught in their national language?"
"Let us turn now to staff: meritocratic selection in all the countries will provide a uniform standard among teachers' associations."
"Do you check the selection process in all countries?"
"There is a turnover of administrative staff, but there are people who remain head teachers for more than 20 years."
"Why is there no selection of head teachers?"
"Flexibility, as you have said yourselves, will bring better results."
"The authorities of the Member States must take care to ensure that they do not have schools exclusively for 'elite' immigrants, but ones that serve as models for other immigrant schools."
"(PL) Madam President, I have come here not just as a Member of the European Parliament, but also as a person with practical experience of the European School, as I am the father of a child that attended the European School in Brussels for three years and who last year took the baccalaureate."
"From family experience, as well as from my occasional observations, for example, at parents' evenings at this, which is one of the four European Schools in Brussels, I feel that I know what we are talking about today."
"I wanted to say just one thing: the number of these schools is increasing."
"When my son went to this school three years ago, there were three schools in Brussels and now there is a fourth one."
"The permitted number of pupils in classes in European Schools is 32."
"It is worth noting that in many European countries the permitted number of pupils in a class is considerably lower than in the European Schools."
"Our interest in this subject is clear: we have to take an interest in something that, as the European Union, we pay for."
"More than 50% of the budgets of these schools comes from European Union funds."
"The conclusion, Madam President, is this: it is sensible to open up these schools, but this should not be at the cost of teaching quality or an excessive number of children and young people in these schools."
"(RO) European Schools are recognised in Europe as elite institutions that provide quality education to young people."
"In 1953, Jean Monnet said that the purpose of these schools was to bring together European children, irrespective of their nationality, and to instill in them the European spirit and sense of belonging, so that they may eventually create a united and prosperous Europe."
"The reform programme of these schools must take into account the following important issues."
"All of the 23 official languages of the European Union must exist within these schools, and children must be given the opportunity to speak their native language."
"Unfortunately, there are still some official EU languages which are not spoken in any of the European Schools."
"Furthermore, one of the objectives of European Schools is to foster unity within groups of children, to bring them together and to facilitate the development of a spirit of tolerance and communication among them."
"Therefore, I believe that dividing them into three categories is not a sound measure."
"Those falling into the last category, 'others', as it is called, get the opportunity to attend such a school only if there are places left after the children of European officials have been admitted."
"This categorisation is discriminatory and I suggest that it should be removed from the statute of European Schools."
"(PL) Madam President, the concept of the 'European School' is become increasingly popular."
"This is a result of globalisation, which affects everything, including education."
"For this reason we have a guiding principle that we try to observe."
"This is where the problems begin."
"Finding an answer to the question 'what should the school be like' is very difficult."
"Should it be an elite school or universal, should it impose its own style and curriculum on all pupils, or should it be a school that moves in certain directions, but takes into account national and regional traditions; should it be a school where pupils are taught to appreciate and respect their own traditions, culture, history, religion and language, or should it teach openness to the cultures of other nations through multilingualism and appreciation of the whole world?"
"There is one issue that, in principle, does not arouse any doubts."
"As there is a European Union, then diplomas issued by all the educational institutions of Member States should be recognised in the Schools."
"(RO) I believe European Schools to be the schools of the future in the EU, as they take into account increased mobility and the globalisation process and consequently give every student the opportunity to study in his/her mother tongue, thus promoting multilinguism."
"I have researched this schooling system myself."
"I visited the oldest European School in Brussels, which was established more than 50 years ago, and I met over 40 Romanian students who have the opportunity to study in their native language."
"It should be said that European Schools foster social inclusion, as students of different nationalities get to know and help one another."
"I would like to stress the effectiveness of the way in which the baccalaureate examination is organised, as it stimulates high performance and prepares students for their future lives as European citizens."
"I believe that the European School system should be extended to all the Member States, so as to become part of a common European policy in the field of education."
"Moreover, I move for the establishment and support of regional European Schools, which should take into account one basic principle of the European Union - regional policy in a mobile, knowledge-based Europe."
"(RO) European policies concerning the reform of traditional schools and their evolution towards the status of European Schools, with the involvement of local and national administrative structures, require, in my opinion, three major types of reform: systemic reform, including reform of the curriculum, based on quality and effectiveness; continual reform, involving evaluation of and capitalisation on previous results, adapting them to European Schools; and a third reform, based on the responsibility and ownership of all social actors."
"In this last regard, I believe that European schools should be taken as the model for a world school, where an 'after-school learning' component should come into play."
"Young people should have a special programme from 14.30 to 17.00 during term time, as well as during the summer holiday."
"(RO) In their 50 years of existence, European Schools have proven their quality as regards the education of future generations."
"However, I believe that in today's debate we should focus on the need to adapt European Schools to present-day requirements, taking into account the enlargement to the EU-27 as well as such phenomena as globalisation, migration, and increased professional and geographic mobility."
"There are two major issues that I would like to stress."
"First of all, we need to open up European Schools to a greater extent, so as to integrate all citizens in need of such assistance."
"Secondly, I believe that the recognition of degrees in all European countries is a priority."
"Madam President, a human being takes about one third of his or her life to get ready for mature life through education."
"The second observation that I want to make is that the construction of the European Union - what we are doing right now - also requires an adequate education."
"There are many technical aspects, like equipment, diplomas and so on, but the Commission, as executor, needs to uphold the idea of education based on more languages, on common principles and on respect for national values."
"This is very crucial."
"Education obviously requires the investment of money, but if you do not support making this investment, then you will have to accept ignorance, which I think will be more costly for us."
"So the European School is an admirable project, and I support it."
"(PL) Madam President, the European Schools exist on the basis of the Convention signed in 1957."
"There have been many changes in Europe over the past 50 years: a series of enlargements, an increase in the number of institutions and agencies and much more flexible employment contracts."
"There can be no doubt, therefore, that the European Schools system also needs change and reform."
"There are a number of important areas that need changing."
"The issue that interests me the most is pupil selection, that is, the division into categories: one, two or three."
"After all, on the one hand the EU is trying to increase the mobility of European citizens in the labour market and to eliminate barriers and, on the other, it is blocking access to the Schools to children of potential employees of various institutions and companies from the whole of the EU."
"A solution needs to be found to the problem of overcrowding in certain schools."
"Measures also need to be taken as regards children with special needs."
"Finally, I would like to ask for consideration to be given to the possibility of creating European Schools in the new Member States."
"(PL) Madam President, the education philosophy in European Schools and the teaching programme that leads to a European Baccalaureate should serve as an example of multilingual and multicultural education for all Member States."
"The growing number of student exchanges in European educational institutions and the globalisation of the world's economy mean that the true value of the European Baccalaureate would justify making it more widespread."
"It should also be recognised by institutions of higher education in Member States and also in third countries."
"Unfortunately this cannot be accomplished without a substantial increase in funding."
"At present European Schools are perceived as elite schools that often exclude children whose parents are not EU officials."
"The exclusion of the greater part of society from the possibility of benefiting from European Schools is contrary to the objective of increasing the mobility of European citizens in our labour market."
"Member States themselves often try to create a new education system that will prepare young people better for the challenges associated with globalisation and a flexible labour market, while the system of European Schools and the European Baccalaureate have already long been in existence and, what is most important, have had excellent results, so we should duplicate them as much as possible."
"Madam President, I rise not merely as a Member of this House but also as a former schoolmaster."
"I wonder whether I might ask Commissioner Kallas, at his next meeting with the Council of Ministers, to have a particular word with the British Minister of Education to see whether or not it is possible that he might learn some of the lessons of the successes of the European School model."
"Perhaps in particular he might consider reversing the disastrous decision of the British Government to make the teaching of languages voluntary, in other words dropping European languages from the British curriculum."
"Secondly, you might just remind him that Europe was divided for half a century, but that it has now been reunited for 20 years."
"Perhaps he might consider suggesting to his curriculum advisers that they remind the next generation of the history and the culture of Central and Eastern Europe, in which Britain traditionally was very much involved and did actually seek to support."
"(IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the stress should not just be on the criticism, from various sides, of the inadequacies of the current model of governance."
"I believe that we all have a duty to understand, after this debate, what is at stake, i.e. the model that the European Schools can represent for the European area of education; and since we want to overcome the challenge of the European area of education and are keen in this respect for good practices to win out, it is absurd and contradictory that we are sticking to a level and a model of governance unable to meet the challenges which we face."
"In my view, today's debate offers the Commission more than enough of a spur to realise that we have to undertake a radical overhaul of our schools."
"author. - (FR) Madam President, I would like to put two further questions to the Commissioner, who gave a figure but it is the current figure."
"Commissioner, are there also to be increases in appropriations for the next financial perspective; is there a system of funding in place that will ensure that these schools can continue to function?"
"Apparently at this very moment they are short of 40 English teachers, given the financial problems experienced by Her Majesty's Government."
"May I ask you what solution can be envisaged in view of that situation?"
"Secondly, the schools themselves would like more autonomy."
"Are you in favour of greater autonomy or would you prefer to keep to the present system, which is cumbersome and often ill-suited to local situations?"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, several very serious and important issues have been raised."
"First of all I would like to remind you that the European Schools system is a completely independent body."
"It is based not on the Treaty of 1958 but on the Statute of 1953, it has its own Board, its own Statute, and all rules are adopted by this Board."
"The Commission is only one voice on the Board."
"As for the content of the education, this is fully the responsibility of the Board, and all this, including the different proportions between the language sections, and the curriculum, is totally in the hands of the Board of Governors of the European Schools."
"So the Commission has not very much to say."
"As to financing, this is the second thing I would like to say in reply to one important question."
"The infrastructure is provided by the host countries."
"So the schools are built by Belgium, Germany, France etc. This gives us the full picture of the limits we have in developing the infrastructure."
"What about the content of education?"
"The honourable Member mentioned in her introductory remarks that the quality of the education is high - and it is high."
"This is one of the main priorities of the European Commission, to give every possible support so that this quality will be high."
"This will really be a benchmark for European educational systems, that European Schools give pupils an education which is highly appreciated everywhere."
"So I do not have any information that pupils with a European School education have any specific difficulties in getting to university after school if they so wish."
"Concerning teachers, they count as part of the infrastructure, so teachers are also provided by Member States."
"English teachers, for example, are provided by the United Kingdom; in other words, the burden for bigger languages is correspondingly much higher."
"We, the Commission - or the European budget - pay the operational costs for this."
"This gives us a combination that results in a rather cumbersome system, and one objective is therefore to reform the system and to bring more clarity to responsibility and financing."
"You can also see the problems with Belgium, where, it has been said, one of the four schools is still a temporary school."
"The construction of the fourth school has been postponed and postponed, and we are in intensive discussions with the Belgian Government about this."
"On the openness of European schools, in our view the key issue is the European Baccalaureate, and the certification of schools which want to award the European Baccalaureate."
"We promote this idea, which has basically been adopted by the Board of Governors, so the basic rules exist."
"Now the question is how to put this into practice in the Member States."
"Again, the leading role lies with the Member States."
"So this will to some extent settle the problem of different pupils."
"Today, as I said, I am meeting Parliament and I hear your observations that category III is something which must be excluded, but I also regularly meet our staff - it is the same size, comprising hundreds of people - and they of course have a clear demand, namely that education for their children must be guaranteed."
"So there is a requirement - and this is emphasised very strongly in the Treaty, in the Staff Regulations, in the regulation - to provide places in the schools and then, of course, the question arises who will distribute these other places which are to remain free and definitely in Brussels?"
"This is more and more difficult."
"This is for me a very complicated question."
"At the beginning of this Commission, we insisted on behalf of our staff that there must be more clarity, and so the Central Enrolment Authority has been established by the Board of Governors to settle these questions."
"So this is the overall picture, and I must just repeat that the Commission's attitude is that we must bring clarity to the financial issues and clearly share the burden, have clear responsibilities, clear obligations, and then we can also find better solutions to the infrastructure questions, but we cannot have any kind of reduction in the quality of education."
"About some specific questions, one honourable Member raised the question about disabled students."
"You said that there are many more of them but I do not know that anybody has been rejected when parents have asked for special treatment: it has always been provided."
"So, if you have facts that there are some hidden pupils with disabilities, please provide these facts and we will deal with them."
"Now, about parliamentary assistants, you know that at present parliamentary assistants are not covered by the Staff Regulations, they are a kind of special staff members in Parliament, but you know also that negotiations are ongoing to settle this and to have more precise rules, and then we can also consider what to do about access to the European Schools for the children of parliamentary assistants."
"So these are more or less the questions which were raised, and of course all these questions - religious education, languages - are clearly in the hands of the Board of Governors, and the Commission is just one voice on that Board."
"The Board of Governors is dealing with these issues very seriously."
"They have held long discussions about this, and I can assure you that the Secretariat-General of the European Schools is very attentive to all needs of the different languages and different religious aspects."
"So this is their responsibility."
"Just one thing more: if Parliament can draw Member States' attention, and especially if all Members of the European Parliament who have their own connections in their home countries can encourage the Member States' Ministers of Education, to promote this idea of the European Baccalaureate because this is their choice."
"We now have rules on how to go ahead with the European Baccalaureate."
"Now it is up to the national ministries to find interested schools."
"I know that there are a lot of interested schools, but the national authorities in many countries have not shown enough enthusiasm about this project, which can be a step forward and which can really then be a positive mark for the European Baccalaureate, so we can have European Schools not only in Brussels but everywhere - in new Member States and old Member States."
"This is a symbol of Europe."
"The Baccalaureate and European education is one element in our architecture."
"The debate is closed."
"I would wish everybody a happy Day of European Languages tomorrow."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (IT) I agree with the various solutions proposed for the reform of the European Schools: my privileged role as the Committee on Development's rapporteur on the Erasmus Community action programme leads me strongly to support the need for a multilingual and flexible European Schools model in which mother-tongue teaching is maintained (and is taught by teachers who are native speakers) but which is, at the same time, the same for all without class distinctions."
"The European Baccalaureate will be the first instrument, followed by the opportunities offered by Erasmus, to guarantee real mobility for students, in Europe and then throughout the world."
"Tutoring obviously has an important role to play in the social, cultural and linguistic integration of incoming students and the achievement of excellent linguistic skills needs to be encouraged, with support from intensive courses (as has been underscored from 2001 to today by the Day of European Languages held every 26 September)."
"I consider that cooperation between the current European Schools and regional (primary and secondary) schools is a sine qua non for the development of a new European Schools system, but I cannot hide my concern for the future of Italian regional schools which - as a result of the new 'Gelmini' reform - could well disappear in some smaller, geographically disadvantaged, communities."
"in writing. - The processes undertaken by the European Union in the last few decades and the ever-evolving educational system have meant that a new perspective on the role and importance of the European Schools has to be taken into consideration."
"Given the latest enlargement of the EU to 27 Member States and with the increase in EU staff that implies, the significance of a well-reformed European School has become an issue of high priority."
"In order to improve future expectations from the European Schools, we must approach the sensitive issues challenging the current system and identify the problems in order to design the foreseeable changes."
"Thus there is great demand for a newly drawn-up and comprehensive reform of the European Schools, so as to make them more competitive and transparent on a European level and to design their full-weight purpose in a more up-to-date way."
"The implementation of the principle of non-discrimination while granting fundamental freedoms to the pupils must be at the core of the new system in order to make it fully operational and in their own benefit."
"Nevertheless, the financing of the European Schools must be also reevaluated by taking into account indiscriminating measures for the pupils with regard to their division into categories."

"(The sitting closed at 16.05)"
"Formal sitting - Ingrid Betancourt"
"Ladies and gentlemen, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, it gives me great satisfaction and a great feeling of admiration to welcome Ingrid Betancourt to the European Parliament today."
"A warm welcome to you, Mrs Betancourt!"
"(Applause)"
"The fact that you are with us today is a testimony to the fact that courageous people never give up hope in the fight for freedom and human dignity."
"After your release on 2 June 2008 I had the honour of writing to you on behalf of the European Parliament and welcoming you back to freedom."
"Now the moment has come for you to be here as our guest."
"You were held captive for six years, four months and nine days."
"You alone know what you had to go through during those 2 321 days, but you have become a symbol of freedom throughout the world and a symbol of human resistance to enforced distress and the deprivation of fundamental human rights as well as a role model of dignity and courage for us all."
"Your children were with you all the way."
"I will never forget how your two children - your daughter and your son - sought me out several years ago when I was in a different role, and how they advocated for their mother."
"That was the love of children for their mother."
"You can be proud of your children!"
"(Applause)"
"Terrorism as practised by your kidnappers is a direct assault on our values, on freedom, on human dignity and on democracy."
"Mrs Betancourt, your example shows us very clearly, yet again, that democracies must never retreat in the face of terrorism."
"It is a political and moral duty to ensure that the rule of law is always upheld."
"During your captivity, many members of the European Parliament worked tirelessly for your release and I know that many representatives of the various Ingrid Betancourt committees are here today - active champions of your cause, people who are working for the freedom of all hostages in Colombia."
"I would like to greet and extend a warm welcome to all of you who spoke up on behalf of Ingrid Betancourt and are here in the European Parliament today."
"(Applause)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, we must tirelessly continue our efforts to secure the release of all those who are still being deprived of their freedom."
"This is another reason for your visit to us today."
"You yourself said: 'For a victim of terrorism, the greatest danger of all is to be forgotten."
"When I was in the jungle, I had a face and I had a name."
"I am now asking we do the same for those who stayed behind.'"
"Those were your words, and they still are."
"In the name of the European Parliament, we call today for this to happen."
"This year we are celebrating the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 10 December 1948."
"This declaration presented the first worldwide, formal obligation to protect the dignity of each and every person and the equality of all people, without regard to skin colour, religion or origin."
"Article 3 of the declaration states: 'Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person.'"
"Many, many people have been deprived of their freedom because they have defended human rights."
"At the conference entitled 'The defenders take the floor', which is being organised this week here at the European Parliament, we have heard numerous testimonies from people who have been oppressed, arbitrarily arrested or forced into exile because of their fight for fundamental rights and freedoms."
"We have also had the opportunity to discuss in detail how we can better protect these people and support their work."
"Mrs Betancourt, we are all honoured and delighted to ask you now to address the European Parliament."
"Ingrid Betancourt, you have shared your heart with us, the freely elected Members of the European Parliament and - ladies and gentlemen, I believe I can say this on behalf of you all - we have never before experienced such a deeply moving time in this Parliament as we did just now."
"Mrs Betancourt, you have given us a message of solidarity and expressed a desire that your experience - the suffering that you had to endure and the freedom that you now have - will also lead to all those who are still being held captive by terrorists obtaining the same freedom that you now have."
"That is the greatest sign of solidarity that you can offer all captives around the world, and for that we thank you from the bottom of our hearts."
"(Applause)"
"Mrs Betancourt, by your peaceful fight for freedom, for democracy, for human rights and for the dignity of every individual, you have encouraged us, the freely elected Members of the European Parliament, to continue the struggle by peaceful means, without easing up, and with great commitment."
"You have encouraged us to enter into dialogue, and you have described words as the most important thing in life."
"Words were at the beginning of human communication."
"You encourage us to continue along this path."
"Mrs Betancourt, let me say this in closing: we have been privileged to experience this deeply moving session with you, a time of deep human emotion, but at the same time a fervent call to action - a call to us, who have been elected in order to take action."
"Now that you have been given back your freedom and a new life, we hope you find peace in your native country, France - an important country in the European Union, which holds the Presidency of the European Union for this half of the year - and that you will find the happiness you wish for."
"Most of all, we wish you the love that you have spoken of."
"Merci, Ingrid Betancourt!"
"(Applause)"
"(The sitting was opened at 3.55 p.m.)"

"Preparation of the European Council, including the situation of the global financial system (debate)"
"(EL) The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the preparation of the European Council, including the situation of the global financial system."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Madam President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I am sure you will understand how difficult it is to speak to Parliament immediately after such a moment of emotion, humanity and solidarity as we have just experienced with the personal account and call for action by Ingrid Betancourt."
"However, we need to come back to reality."
"The European Council meets on 15 and 16 October."
"This new session assumes particular importance at this time of crisis and instability, which calls for the expression of political will, initiatives and decisions from the European Union."
"The economic and financial situation will dominate the work of the European Council."
"As I said to Parliament on 23 September, this crisis is not just an American crisis."
"It is now a European crisis."
"It is now an international crisis."
"The crisis of confidence in the markets and in our financial sector has got even worse over the last few days."
"The EU must shoulder its responsibilities."
"The Council Presidency is determined to spare no effort on improving the coordination and coherence of national initiatives."
"It did so on Saturday with the meeting of the European members of the G7, in the presence of the Commission President, the Eurogroup president and the president of the European Central Bank."
"It did so yesterday at the Council of ministers of the economy and finance. It will do so again at the European Council on 15 and 16 October."
"We have reached an agreement between Europeans on the need for close consultation about how each Member State manages the impact of the crisis on its own financial system."
"Dialogue within European is a concrete reality."
"There is permanent contact between governments, administrations, central banks, banking supervisors and the European Commission."
"As Jean-Claude Trichet reminded us, we respond to the crisis with our own resources and structures."
"We are not a federal government like the United States of America."
"We have nothing to be ashamed of; we have to work with the institutional context that is ours."
"It is time for action."
"The main thing is that Europeans work together and shoulder their responsibilities alongside the European Central Bank."
"In his declaration on Monday 6 October, the President of the European Council, Nicolas Sarkozy, recalled that EU leaders were unanimous in their desire to take all the necessary measures to ensure the stability of the financial system."
"We should welcome the role of the European Central Bank and the other central banks - American, British, Swedish and Canadian - which have just agreed to a concerted rate cut by half a point."
"We must continue to act without delay."
"As the finance ministers pointed out in their meeting yesterday, there is an urgent need to reassure depositors and to supply the interbank market."
"This is how we will restore confidence."
"We must also conduct a detailed review of financial governance towards a system that is more favourable to long-time finance for the economy, to encouraging Europeans to save and to reducing volatility and financial speculation."
"None of this is incompatible with maintaining a competitive and innovative finance industry."
"To improve governance, we are counting heavily on the European Commission's proposals. They need to be quick and daring."
"Yesterday the Member States reached agreement on an immediate response, firstly to guarantee the stability of financial institutions by injecting capital or by any other means dictated by circumstances."
"From this point of view, the measures announced this morning by the British Prime Minister are most welcome."
"They are clearly in line with the commitments made by the heads of State and government on 6 October."
"Meanwhile, France is looking into a legal structure that would allow the government, if need be, to take a financial stake when and where necessary."
"The President of the European Council will continue to use these various initiatives and proposals as a basis for taking appropriate initiatives aimed at strengthening European coordination."
"We also need to protect and guarantee the interests of depositors."
"The minimum level of protection for deposits in Europe is going to be raised, as you know, to EUR 50 000."
"Some Member States - very many in fact - have announced their decision to increase this protection to EUR 100 000."
"In the current exceptional circumstances, demonstrating flexibility in the application of Community rules on State aid and the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact is a necessity."
"The European Commission, under the decisive impetus of its President, is helping us in this very specific case."
"International coordination within the framework of the G7 at the end of the week is also necessary to restore confidence."
"As the Japanese finance minister and president-in-office of the G7 said, the G7 must send a strong, united message from the finance ministers and governors of the central banks."
"That is what the central banks have just done and it was a decisive and very positive signal, from that point of view."
"Obviously we need to bring in the large emerging countries on the stabilisation of the markets, in view of the international character of the crisis."
"That is exactly what the President of the European Council wants for the enlarged G8 by the end of the year."
"Finally, the International Monetary Fund should be the main forum for conducting discussion among the major world players."
"It should go back to the role of financial policeman that it played originally, and look after monetary stability, financial stability, which was the plan immediately after the Second World War, instead of only controlling the situation of the emerging and developing countries."
"Other than these extremely important developments concerning the economic and financial crisis, the Council Presidency wanted this Council to debate the energy and climate package."
"Under the decisive impetus of the German Presidency, in March 2007 the European Council made some ambitious commitments towards the environment."
"We want to preserve this environmental ambition of the package presented by the Commission, on which we are hoping - I am spelling this out - for agreement with Parliament in the First Reading."
"We must be ready and in a powerful position for the two meetings in Poznań in December 2008, then Copenhagen at the end of 2009."
"However, the current background of economic slow-down is tending to exacerbate the concerns of some of our partners, as well as of our industries."
"We must respond to these worries together."
"We need to see what flexibility we can give them, though without compromising the targets, fundamentals and main balances in the package proposed by the Commission."
"What the package is about is the development model we will have to use in future; today's development model having been thrown into doubt by the current economic and financial crisis."
"The Presidency also wanted the matter of energy security to be raised, in accordance with the conclusions of the extraordinary European Council on 1 September."
"On this subject, I will be quite plain: there is still a lot to do, particularly on energy efficiency, the diversification of energy sources, the interconnections, the development of infrastructure, cooperation with the big supplier countries, transit countries and the major consumers."
"We would like to adopt some orientations and guidelines in response to the legitimate concerns of many Member States and, particularly, of the most dependent Member States from an energy point of view, the central and eastern European Member States."
"We must set the guidelines so that, in November, the Commission can do what it has to do to make proposals for improving the energy security of our continent."
"In accordance with the suggestion made by Ireland in June, which has been approved by all the Member States, the European Council will come back to the question of the Lisbon Treaty."
"This institutional issue, as we can see today, is more necessary than ever and is central to our concerns."
"As you know, the Presidency would like to have worked out by December a common path to be followed."
"The Irish Prime Minister, Brian Cowen, confirmed to the European Council President that he would present to his fellow heads of State and government the study commissioned by the Irish government analysing the reasons for the 'no' vote in the referendum and the conclusions that could be drawn from this."
"During his visit to Paris, he also announced the setting up of an ad hoc parliamentary committee, the discussions of which would feed into the discussions of the Irish government between now and November."
"On 6 October, Michael Martin, Minister for Foreign Affairs, confirmed before the Committee on Constitutional Affairs that the Irish government was determined to make concrete proposals."
"In parallel, the Presidency is calling for those who have not yet done so to complete the treaty ratification procedure."
"The instability we are currently experiencing is an additional justification for giving the European Union a new legal and institutional framework."
"We need it more than ever and we need it urgently."
"The European Council will also be invited to adopt the European Pact on Asylum and Immigration, the text of which was the subject of political agreement on 25 September at the Justice and Home Affairs Council."
"I will not go back over what Mrs Betancourt said, but it is extremely important."
"Immigration remains an opportunity for Europe."
"The European Pact on Asylum and Immigration aims to give new impetus to the policy on migration, and is in line with the balanced framework of the comprehensive approach implemented since 2005 and the framework of the proposals made by the European Commission."
"It sets ambitious orientations for the future to progress towards a true common migration policy."
"The Pact embraces all aspects of managing migratory flows: not only the fight against illegal immigration and the control of borders, but also new areas such as economic immigration, proper harmonisation of asylum and the development of countries of origin."
"This seems absolutely essential to us as the Schengen area was enlarged this year."
"As far as external relations are concerned, the European Council will evaluate whether Russia has complied with its obligations under the agreements of 12 August and 8 September regarding the withdrawal of Russian troops, on which the resumption of contact on the future partnership agreement between Russia and the European Union depends."
"EU-Russia relations will be the subject of a comprehensive and detailed evaluation by the Commission and the Council in readiness for the forthcoming Summit, planned in Nice on 14 November."
"At the same time, the European Union is determined to maintain the support being given to its eastern neighbours with their efforts at economic and democratic modernisation."
"I recall in this regard the importance of the results of the EU-Ukraine Summit held in Paris in September, which marks an unprecedented step forward in relations between the European Union and Ukraine."
"In the same spirit, the European Council will call for the strengthening of relations between the EU and Moldavia, which I visited last Monday, through a new country-specific agreement, more ambitious than the last, allowing it to be associated with various EU policies - if the forthcoming elections in the country go well."
"Furthermore, the General Affairs and External Relations Council will be charged with conducting a preliminary examination of the proposals on a future Eastern Partnership, which the Commission intends to present in November."
"Madam President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, as you see, the French Presidency has a number of urgent matters to deal with."
"While it is certainly a Presidency of crisis management, it is also a Presidency that must not sacrifice its priorities."
"Europe taking action to meet today's challenges: that was the title we chose to give the work programme of the French Presidency a few months ago."
"That ambition is at the heart of our action more than ever. It should guide the work of the European Council on 15 and 16 October more than ever."
"Welcome"
"Allow me, before I hand over to the President of the Commission, to welcome the delegation from the Canary Islands Regional Parliament, led by its President, Mr Castro Cordobez."
"(Applause)"
"Preparation of the European Council, including the situation of the global financial system (continuation of debate)"
"President of the Commission. - (FR) Madam President, Mr Jouyet, ladies and gentlemen, allow me first of all to make an assessment of the role of the French Presidency of the Council."
"As Mr Jouyet has just said, in the midst of the French Presidency of the Council, first there was the crisis between Russia and Georgia and now there is an unprecedented crisis, this global financial crisis."
"It is a crisis that did not originate in Europe - it came from across the Atlantic - and it is a crisis for which we do not yet, and I stress 'yet', have the necessary rules in Europe that would enable us to give a typically European response."
"I can bear witness to the tremendous efforts the French Presidency and Nicolas Sarkozy have made to find a European response to this emergency."
"The gravity of the financial crisis is clear to all of us and it is absolutely right that it should be at the core of the European Council meeting next week."
"Addressing this crisis is an important test for the financial sector, for the Member States, for Europe and its institutions and for the international financial institutions."
"There is a wide variety of players involved - banks and other financial institutions, supervisors, the ECB and other central banks, the national governments, the Commission - so we need coordination."
"And events are moving very quickly - so we need speed."
"Last week I called for a coordinated European response, because I am convinced that, without it, it will be much harder for Europe to overcome this crisis."
"Today I am encouraged by the determination of Member States to work together, as demonstrated by the statement of the 27 leaders of the Member States and myself on Monday, the Eurogroup and the Ecofin meetings."
"But I am not yet satisfied - we can and we must do more."
"In particular I urge Member States to make a real effort at coordination - to improve cooperation amongst themselves and with European institutions."
"Yes, public intervention has taken place - largely at national level because this is where the money and competences are."
"This reflects the fact that we are a union of states, not one single state, with situations different at least to a certain degree."
"Member States' actions have in most cases been effective. But Member States need to act on the basis of common principles and within a commonly agreed framework and to take into account the cross-border effects of their actions."
"I take this opportunity to welcome the measures announced today by the United Kingdom, which are in line with the set of principles agreed yesterday at Ecofin."
"Of course, there are also many things that we are doing and we still need to do at the level of the European institutions, both in the short and in the medium to longer term."
"The proposals I have in mind are concrete, practical and realistic."
"Let me be clear: tempting as it may be, this is not the time or the place for political posturing and grandstanding, for announcing grand initiatives that have no chance of being followed through."
"Markets would penalise this sort of behaviour immediately and the costs will be borne by economic operators and mainly by taxpayers."
"This is the time for ambition combined with realism and responsibility."
"In this context let me pay tribute to the ECB, which has shown itself an assured and effective global player, with the euro a key steadying force."
"The Commission has played its role to the full."
"State-aid and competition rules have been shown to be essential to give guarantees of a level playing field."
"The risk of action in one Member State spilling over with negative consequences for another makes these rules more essential than ever."
"At the same time the Commission has shown that it is fully capable of acting at speed and with the necessary flexibility."
"I welcome the fact that this beneficial role of state-aid rules and the way the Commission is applying them is recognised in the Ecofin Council conclusions."
"The Commission will shortly issue guidance setting out the broad framework within which the state-aid compatibility of recapitalisation and guarantee schemes could be rapidly assessed."
"In the legislative area, we will come next week with two proposals."
"Firstly to promote the convergence of deposit guarantee schemes."
"Strengthened and more common rules here will be an important part of the exit strategy from the crisis."
"I am encouraged by the Ecofin Council, which has followed our proposal to at least double it, setting the common minimum threshold at EUR 50 000, with most Member States even going up to EUR 100 000."
"Secondly, we will come with a proposal to make sure that European financial institutions are not disadvantaged vis-à-vis their international competitors in terms of accounting rules and of their interpretation."
"Last week I had a meeting with the representatives of the European banks, who were unanimous in telling me that this was a serious problem for them."
"The Commission role has been to promote awareness of the need to act and to create political momentum, and it seems that, now, the obstacles raised by some Member States have finally disappeared."
"Then there is the medium and longer term: the measures needed to bring stability and sustainability back into financial markets."
"I have said it before and I say it again: apart from liquidity, we need also to inject credibility into the current economic situation."
"Fire-fighting is not enough."
"Here Commission work has been under way since the start of the crisis a year ago."
"Member States need to show that we have learnt the lessons needed to build the right regulatory framework to minimise the risks of crisis."
"Progress on the Ecofin road map agreed last year will need to be closely monitored."
"Let me highlight in particular three issues."
"First I would like the Council and Parliament to give real priority to our proposal of last week on capital requirements."
"Second, we will come next week with the proposal we announced on rating agencies."
"Again, I know I can rely on your support to fast-track work on it."
"Third, we will also review our December 2004 recommendation on executive pay, which unfortunately was ignored by Member States - or, to be fair, only one Member State decided to follow to some extent the recommendations that the Commission put forward in December 2004."
"This is a good illustration of the kind of resistance we have been facing in this area in the last few years."
"The last point is of a more systemic nature."
"We also need to have a further look at European-level supervision in the single financial market."
"There are more than 8 000 banks in the European Union, but two thirds of total European Union bank assets are held in 44 cross-border institutes."
"Some operate in as many as 15 Member States."
"This is the single market at work - but cross-border banks have to deal with different systems of supervision in each Member State, and national supervisors are not able to address the entirety of the banking activity beyond the national borders."
"It makes sense to remove the mismatch between a continental-scale market and national systems of supervision."
"When a cross-border bank is under pressure, finding rapid solutions with several national supervisors in parallel is possible, as the past weeks have shown - but, honestly, it is not easy."
"I know that we will face an uphill struggle with some Member States on this."
"The current debates in the Council on the Solvency II Directive show the large degree of resistance that any attempt at improving cross-border supervision still faces."
"What we have proposed in Solvency II and in the Capital Requirements Directive is the strict minimum we need."
"Indeed, I am convinced we will have to go much further."
"So it is important to underline this point. When the Commission speaks in favour of a common approach to supervision in Europe, we do not do it because there is any agenda for grabbing more competences."
"We do it because there is a reality - and the reality is that almost two thirds of the banking assets in the European Union already have a trans-border dimension. That means a European dimension, and we need to respond to this European dimension with a true European solution."
"So we need to launch a reflection process in order to build common ground."
"That is why I will be setting up a high-level group to look at the right architecture to ensure that financial markets are suited to the realities of the single market and that supervisors can work together to meet the challenge of cross-border banks."
"I am proud to announce to you today that Jacques de Larosière, former Managing Director of the IMF, Governor of the Banque de France and President of the EBRD, has accepted my invitation to chair this group, which will be independent and will consist of high-level experts in the subject matter."
"I believe their ideas could feed into a general reflection process, hopefully with some solutions for the long term."
"The current crisis has shown that we need comprehensive rethinking of our regulatory and supervision rules for financial markets - which include hedge funds and private equity, as highlighted by Parliament."
"So we will come back to these questions."
"I only hope that Member States will show - all of them - the same level of willingness as Parliament and the Commission."
"Let me recap."
"In the short term we need to ensure that rescue operations and other public intervention take place in a coordinated and consistent European framework."
"The speedy application of state-aid rules by the Commission injects confidence between Member States, and we will hence come very rapidly with guidance."
"We will come next week with proposals on deposit guarantee schemes and on accounting rules."
"For the medium term, there are three measures to highlight: last week's proposal on capital requirements, our forthcoming proposal on rating agencies and a review of our 2004 recommendation on executive pay."
"And, in the longer term, the high-level group that I have announced should lay the ground for building consensus on cross-border supervision."
"All these measures, together with Member States acting in a coordinated and consistent manner, will show a European Union addressing the real problems."
"The effect on confidence will be all the stronger if the institutions can show a resolution and a determination to act quickly."
"As far as the Commission is concerned, I would like to inform you that I have decided to set up, inside the college, a permanent steering group on the financial crisis, composed of Commissioners Almunia, McCreevy and Kroes, which I will chair myself."
"I want to keep open lines with Parliament on these questions."
"I know that Parliament has already signalled its openness to fast-tracking proposals, and I hope that we can work together on this very important and sensitive issue, because financial stability is a public good."
"We have a duty to show our common determination to face this very difficult and urgent situation."
"In all of this, the international dimension is critical, as was just now highlighted by the President of the Council."
"We need to come with solutions in Europe, but we need also to work with international financial institutions."
"I particularly welcome President Sarkozy's proposal for an international conference."
"It is the right way forward."
"The more that public authorities can act in tune, the more effective our action will be, and the less the chance that action will undermine fair competition and the acquis of European integration."
"The focus is on the financial crisis, and rightly so."
"But it would be a mistake to see European grinding to a halt as a result."
"There are two other areas where we must make decisive progress this autumn."
"There are in fact many other points but, because of time, I will just concentrate on two issues very briefly: the climate-change and energy package, and the Lisbon Treaty."
"First the climate-change and energy package."
"Those who think that this is not the policy for an economic downturn are making a mistake."
"The package is central to Europe's future prosperity."
"Without it there will be higher costs later, we will be more vulnerable to energy shortfalls, and we will lose the chance of exploiting some big new markets."
"Of course industries are worried that change will bring extra costs."
"This is completely understandable."
"But I am also convinced that we can find ways to reassure industries that they will not be put at a competitive disadvantage."
"I will be urging the European Council to press on and to keep up with the timetable being followed by Parliament and being maintained so effectively by the French presidency - I welcome the remarks made just now by the President-in-Office of the Council."
"Yesterday Parliament took an important procedural step forward."
"Of course we are only at the beginning here of the interinstitutional negotiations. The Commission is ready to engage constructively in order to arrive at an agreement meeting with the largest possible support both in the Council and in Parliament's plenary."
"Finally, the Lisbon Treaty."
"Now is not the time to prejudge the precise way forward."
"But it is a time to recall that the last few weeks and months have shown again how Europe needs the Lisbon Treaty."
"Honestly, can we, in the future, deal with crises like the one we have witnessed between Russia and Georgia with the President of the Council changing every six months?"
"It is obvious that we need more stability."
"It is obvious that we need more coherence."
"It is obvious that we need more efficiency in the decision-making process of Europe."
"We need a more effective Europe, a more democratic Europe, a Europe with a clear voice on the international stage."
"That is why I think we should keep our commitment to the Lisbon Treaty ratification."
"These are not ordinary times."
"These are unprecedented times, which require all of us - Commission, Council and Parliament - to rise to the occasion."
"Together we must call and work for a European response to the financial crisis."
"We owe it to our citizens."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the financial crisis that has suddenly struck our economies is very worrying."
"It is worrying for our economies, worrying for our jobs, and above all worrying for the millions of people who, having worked hard and saved to make sure they will have a pension and can leave a small inheritance for their children, are finding out that the fruits of their efforts have suddenly melted away or evaporated."
"The black Monday that all world stock exchanges experienced this week once again demonstrates that the markets can lose all connection with reality and that the financial system has become difficult to control."
"There are many reasons for this crisis."
"The European Commission is right to insist that a large share of the responsibility lies with the US authorities."
"We must ask them for an explanation."
"The Commission is right."
"However, Europe must act too, to deal with the crisis and learn lessons from it."
"At this difficult time, the first reflex of Member States is to think of themselves."
"However, as European leaders, our absolute priority must be to combine our efforts to prevent the financial crisis from having too great an impact on the real economy."
"We must at all costs prevent the crisis from having too severe and too lengthy an effect on finance for businesses, particularly for SMEs."
"President of the Commission, President-in-Office of the Council, I am afraid small and medium-sized enterprises will disappear with this crisis and nobody will care."
"We need a support plan for SMEs."
"We need to make sure that our fellow citizens maintain confidence in the banking system and do not give in to this tide of panic, which would only precipitate a downward spiral."
"I am therefore calling on the Member States to act in a coordinated, resolute manner to prevent the crisis from affecting pensions, jobs and growth in Europe."
"Like the Council Presidency, which we applaud for its determined action, our group believes that a unilateral approach is not the way forward in a global crisis."
"Clearly, the supervision of the financial markets is not working."
"That is why we need to set up a European control system."
"Once again, Europe must set an example for the rest of the world."
"The current lack of supervision poses an extremely serious problem, and the inability of credit rating agencies to act in the general interest and publish the real solvency levels of the main players in the global financial markets can no longer be tolerated."
"I would add that, in this period of uncertainty and precariousness for millions of our fellow citizens, my group feels it is absolutely unacceptable that directors who have led their institutions to bankruptcy should not suffer the consequences."
"Here too, people must face up to their responsibilities."
"I would just like to reiterate what Mr Jouyet said: it is time for action."
"We need concerted action; we need courage and solidarity from all twenty-seven Member States to inject confidence into our economy again."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Council will also discuss the Lisbon Treaty, and I would like to call upon all Member States that have not yet ratified it to do so as quickly as possible, so that each country can express a definitive opinion on the question."
"I know there are people in this room who cannot see the value of it, but I do not share their opinion."
"We understand the situation Ireland is in and we understand that its government needs time to respond after the vote of its citizens, which we respect."
"However, although the European Union is prepared to demonstrate patience and understanding, the status quo is untenable in the medium and long term."
"I therefore call upon the European Council to demonstrate the political will necessary, after examining the situation in October, for a road map like the one you proposed along with a definite timetable to be adopted in December."
"I also call upon the European Council to take responsibility for its decisions: either the Treaty of Lisbon will eventually apply, and it will apply to everyone, or the Treaty of Nice applies, and does so for all institutions."
"Of course, the European Parliament will have fewer seats and fewer powers than with the Treaty of Lisbon, but the European Commission will also have fewer Commissioners than Member States."
"The Treaty of Nice currently applies."
"That is also the reality."
"All political decisions come at a price, and if Europe wants credibility, it has to take responsibility for its political decisions, whether they concern the financial crisis or its institutions."
"I would like to add, Madam President, President of the Commission and President-in-Office of the Council, that regarding the energy/climate package on the table at this difficult time, we need to proceed carefully, to keep the general orientations but not make businesses afraid, so that investment can continue."
"To those who do not agree, I will simply say that I managed a very serious crisis: mad cow disease."
"For one and a half years, we had uncertainty; we have to reassure, accept and go on with the system, for the environment, for our planet, but we also have to accept what is happening financially."
"If we need another year, we will take another year to get where we need to be in order to save the planet and provide a future for our children and grandchildren."
"Madam President, I would also like to begin with the referendum in Ireland - that is, the Treaty of Lisbon."
"You are right, Commission President - we need the Treaty more than ever."
"Therefore, I am of the opinion that we also need a stable foundation in order to put it into effect, and that includes persuading the Irish people and Irish voters to vote in favour of this Treaty."
"If the Irish Government cannot manage to do this before the European election, then we will decide the composition of the next European Parliament and the Commission on the basis of the Treaty of Nice."
"The matter will continue after that, however, because we need these reforms."
"We need them for enlargement, we need them to deal with crises, as we are currently experiencing once again, and in the time remaining until a new referendum is held in Ireland, we have sufficient time to find out exactly which sources the anti-Lisbon campaign is getting its funds from - the CIA, military-industrial powers in the United States, or whatever."
"(Heckling)"
"Listen: the people I was talking about are already interjecting."
"We know where they get their money from."
"We will investigate this much more closely, you can be sure of that!"
"Commission President, you gave an accurate description of the crisis that we are currently experiencing, but there are several further comments to be made about what you said."
"Do not be angry with me, but I must say that even though much of your speech was good, one thing alarmed me, and that is the composition of the steering group you are putting together to deal with the crisis."
"It is a matter of course that you are a member, and it is also appropriate for a commissioner as well qualified as Mr Almunia to be part of it."
"However, now you have told us that Mr McCreevy is someone you want to include in this steering group to deal with this crisis."
"If ever there was an apologist for misleading market radicalism in this House and in your Commission, it is Mr McCreevy."
"(Applause)"
"With the best will in the world, you cannot make arsonists into firefighters!"
"It simply will not work."
"As far as Commissioner Kroes is concerned, you mentioned that we had 8 000 banks in Europe."
"Why not ask Mrs Kroes what she thinks of the public banking system in the European Union."
"In my country there are public banks that have less in the way of state guarantees than private banks are now being given by various states."
"In my country, your Mrs Kroes has just done away with savings banks - with the help of the government of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, what is more!"
"Trusting the cat to guard the cream is not the way out of this crisis!"
"For years here we have had to listen to the neoliberal dogma that the market would sort everything out."
"For years we have been told that the effects generated by the market would 'trickle down' and that in the end, everyone would benefit."
"What has actually happened is that those who were supposed to benefit from all this, the taxpayers, are having to foot the bill."
"In a crisis like this, that has to be said."
"The house is on fire, so the fire must be put out."
"The measures are the correct ones - and you are right, they must be coordinated throughout Europe - because we need to establish confidence and regain trust, because we need to conquer fear, otherwise this fear will become a self-fulfilling prophecy and merely accelerate the collapse that we are trying to avoid."
"We support these measures, too, but let me add this: the house that has just burnt down cannot be rebuilt just as it was before."
"The new house must be different."
"It must be built on a firm foundation, a foundation with clear rules."
"The President of the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, Dennis Snower, who is not a member of the radical socialist movement, put it well in an interview when he said that the regulation of the financial markets had been neither sufficient nor appropriate and that was why the system did not work."
"Yes, he knows what he is talking about."
"However, those who for years have been asking to be allowed to create regulations have had to put up with being told by those of you on the right-hand side of this chamber that we were stuck in the 19th century."
"'The voice of the past,' Mr Watson said of my demands in a recent debate here, when I called for regulation and transparency and when I talked about rating agencies and rules to achieve that."
"Well, the voice of the past has something to say: the rules of the past are the necessity for the future."
"That is the unequivocal answer that we give to counter this neoliberal mainstream, which has fallen apart in the classic way."
"(Applause)"
"The difficulties that we are now facing will not be so easy to overcome."
"It will take a long time."
"During this long time, we must avoid one thing above all: a repetition, in the future, of what led to the current very serious developments."
"Therefore, when formulating the rules, we need to think very specifically about legal prohibition of certain types of speculation."
"Nobody can tell me to what extent it is morally justified to bet on food shortages in international financial forums so that food prices will rise, because investing in the facilities of food companies brings high returns."
"A shortage of food creates hunger, but one man's hunger is another man's profit."
"That is a perverse system."
"There must be legislation to prevent such things."
"Commission President, perhaps this topic is something that the High Level Group on the architecture of the financial markets that you are putting together could consider."
"To close, I would like to congratulate you."
"It is a good decision."
"I also want to say, however, that Parliament asked you to do this three years ago, in the Muscat report."
"You have ignored that request for three years."
"You are coming late to the matter, but at least you are coming, and for that, many thanks."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I would say to the President-in-Office: At next week's European Council you must move forward discussions on the Lisbon Treaty."
"You must be constructive, yet be considerate to the countries which have yet to ratify."
"You must adopt the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum - though we must still search for schemes to seek skilled newcomers and manage migration - and you should discuss progress in combating climate change."
"But no one can mistake the most pressing issue facing this Council."
"A storm is battering global finance markets, and its effects are being felt across Europe - in jobs lost, pensions eroded and savings under threat."
"Our citizens are worried."
"The challenges we face may be the gravest for generations, and they are evolving at lightning speed."
"It is at moments like this that our Union is defined."
"We need a collective response."
"We cannot sustain a situation in which Member States surprise one another through unilateral decisions with multilateral implications."
"Europe needs coordinated and consistent policies to stem the flow of financial losses, to establish transparency and good practice and to prevent future woes."
"There are some who think they can now tap-dance on the grave of capitalism; but solutions will not be found in closed markets and command economies."
"They only ever short-changed Europe's citizens."
"If you build your house there, Martin Schulz, it will be a house built of straw."
"What we are witnessing is not the failure of the market economy."
"Rather it is the excesses of unfettered, ineffectively regulated markets."
"Financial markets currently owe less to Adam Smith than to the Cincinnati Kid."
"The greed of individual bankers, traders and short-sellers is certainly to blame, but so too is the failure of governments to ensure transparency and honesty in their dealings."
"Liberal Democrats have long warned of the dangers which caught the Council unaware and the Commission wrong-footed."
"Last May my friend Otto Graf Lambsdorff, together with Jacques Delors and others, signed a letter to the Slovenian presidency of the Council."
"It highlighted the profound danger of economic collapse posed by recent banking practices."
"In that letter they wrote, 'Decent capitalism needs effective public policy."
"Profit-seeking is the essence of a market economy, but when everything is for sale, social cohesion melts and the system breaks down.'"
"Europe was slow to heed such worries. It must now do what it can to put that system back to business."
"Liberals and Democrats hope that the conclusions of the Ecofin Council will form the basis for agreement at the European Council."
"They are not an overnight cure, but they will help to remedy the underlying sickness."
"It is right to raise deposit guarantee protection to a EUR 50 000 minimum across the Union. Family savings will be secure and capital flight discouraged."
"We also look forward to hearing the Commission's proposal to promote convergence of deposit guarantee schemes, just as we support rapid adoption of your ideas for improving capital adequacy."
"When you look at credit rating agencies, look at who pays their fees and at how they are supervised."
"But we also need to strengthen the links between national financial regulators."
"Representatives from the euro-zone central banks sit together in the Governing Council of the ECB."
"Similarly, we need a pan-European financial services authority to maintain order and transparency between financial institutions."
"The European Council should ask whether the European Union budget might be used to allow the European Investment Bank and the EIF to give credit guarantees for small businesses."
"They, after all, provide the jobs on which Europeans rely."
"It is those people who now need speedy and specific action, who need all parties and all Member States to work as one, who expect common solutions to a common challenge."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Madam President, President of the Council, President of the Commission, Mr Almunia, the European Verts Group - the group I have been asked to represent this afternoon - has approved the decisions of yesterday's Ecofin Council."
"I think the only thing that should concern us, and which is of concern to you, is the reaction of the markets today, which do not seem entirely convinced that the proposals are correct."
"I hope the markets are going to pull themselves together again and I hope the European authorities will continue to act in this sense."
"I would like to share with you three comments, or three messages."
"The first message concerns Europe itself."
"Parliament is in fact divided, in part."
"Many people have wanted to point out that Europe was absent from the management of the banking and financial crisis."
"We, the European Verts, would like to point out that the banking crisis particularly reveals the inadequacy of common European rules and that, in this area as in many others, there is a need for more of Europe, not less of Europe."
"The second message concerns the responsibility of those involved."
"I have heard and I understand that Mr Barroso in particular believes that the time has come for action, certainly, but I also think the time has come to identify where some of the responsibility lies."
"It would be all too easy for me to point the finger at the Council, the governments that make up the Council, or the Commission, since some Commissioners believed that better lawmaking meant self regulation, not lawmaking at all."
"To take a concrete example, let us look at the directive on deposit guarantee schemes: in November 2006, the Commission submitted a report which said that no further legislation was needed in this field."
"I am not sure you would uphold this position today."
"However, it is actually Parliament I am addressing."
"A week ago, in this Parliament, we voted for a report by Mr Rasmussen."
"The first version was excellent and we supported it."
"Parliament had to secure a majority vote by lowering the requirements expressed by the rapporteur himself."
"We are experiencing the same thing today with the Lamfalussy report on the structure of supervision of the financial markets."
"There again, everyone needs to take his own share of the blame."
"I believe the PPE Group and the Liberal Group, Mr Watson, have a particular responsibility for the watering down of the report that we will be voting on tomorrow."
"Next, I would just like to say a few words about the crisis. This is a message to you, Mr Barroso, since you are the one setting up another reflection group (there are many, but a new one is perhaps welcome), notably on the link between the financial crisis and the environmental crisis."
"The financial crisis, as you have said yourself, does not erase the environmental crisis."
"From that point of view, I think what this banking crisis shows in the medium term is that there is a real problem with the allocation of savings in the European Union."
"What I would like - what the European Greens would like you to put on the agenda of this group - is reflection on the instruments that the European Union might have at its disposal."
"I am thinking in particular of the European Investment Bank, which should be charged with providing long-term finance so that the energy/climate package and the investment it represents are effectively guaranteed."
"I think this is essential."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - Madam President, first of all I want to pay tribute to the Council and congratulate them for their efforts, particularly with regard to Russia and the situation in Georgia."
"It took a lot of strength and courage and great diplomacy to find a peaceful solution to the difficulties which we faced."
"It proved - if anybody needed further proof - that collectively and with strong leadership we can achieve an awful lot more than mere military might or economic wealth can bring to us, simply by the example that we give and the tactics that we employ."
"Secondly I think it is important to make sure that bringing the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership to life is on the agenda for the upcoming Council."
"Never at any stage in our history is it more required that we bring together our partners at the Mediterranean level to guarantee that we can bring about not just economic development but also the peaceful coexistence of nations."
"In particular we should follow the example of the Egyptian Government in their ongoing peace negotiations with regard to Sudan, Chad and other areas."
"I have two further points."
"It would be wrong of me not to mention the situation with regard to Ireland and the Lisbon Treaty."
"Member States have already given Ireland a period for reflection - for which we are thankful - but this is no different to the period of reflection which both France and the Netherlands got when they rejected the Constitutional Treaty."
"It takes time to put forward proposals and ideas as to how these difficulties can be resolved."
"It behoves us in Parliament to ensure that we do not try to put the gun to any country's head regarding whether or not it will ratify the Treaty - in particular because it requires a democratic vote of the people to guarantee the ratification of that Treaty."
"Secondly, regarding the present financial crisis, I do not blame or point a finger at any particular person."
"I congratulate the Council for getting their act together and taking decisive action."
"I once again congratulate the Commission for actually standing up and saying what needed to be said before the Council acted and for ensuring that credibility was put into the market by saying that we are capable, able and willing to take action, either through the ECB, Ecofin, individual Member States or whatever else."
"But let us not make the mistake of saying that everything that went on in the last two weeks is wrong and that everything that comes in the future is going to be right."
"Our history must teach us that, over the period of time that we have been living in this world, there have been alterations and changes."
"Those alterations and changes bring horrors of hardship on people."
"We must first of all guarantee to protect the ordinary person."
"The banks have got a bail-out."
"The banks have got a guarantee."
"With that guarantee also comes the responsibility for banks to now start lending to businesses and to people, to allow the economies to pick up again."
"It is not only about cutting the wages or salaries of executives; it is about ensuring that the economic cycle can get back to where it is supposed to be."
"The deposit guarantee is only a small aspect of this."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FR) Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, for several weeks now we have been watching global panic and unbearable losses, against a dizzying background of billions of spiralling euros and dollars."
"This has been generated by a system in the name of which European leaders have for years been recommending moderation on pay and caution on social expenditure, and have allowed inequalities to soar."
"These same leaders are now flying to the rescue of the banks to refloat them, before putting them back in the private sector, while announcing a long period of recession and sacrifices for the general population."
"Many people following these events, totally stunned, cannot help but see a lesson in them, not about excess, Mr Watson, but about the very essence of capitalism in all its injustice and brutality, whatever the phenomenal transformations it has undergone over the last few decades."
"I think European leaders are going to have some explaining to do to our fellow citizens."
"Consider your responsibilities rather than seeking to challenge universal suffrage in Ireland, or anywhere else."
"Today, I just want to make three immediate, good-sense proposals to deal with the most pressing issues while opening the way for a real change of political orientation."
"In the first place, I think we should not skimp when it comes to reassuring small and medium savers who are legitimately concerned about their modest assets."
"The announcement about this was, I think, late, timid and woolly."
"On 15 October, the whole of the European Council needs to formally provide an absolute guarantee for deposits throughout European Union territory."
"Secondly, a rudimentary awareness of ethics as much as a simple concern for effectiveness should prevent sorcerers' apprentices from profiting now or in future from the public intervention made necessary by the collapse caused by their irrational exuberance."
"That is why every government should, or in any case should be able to, compensate for the aid given to financial institutions in peril, through the lasting nationalisation of their healthy assets."
"The purpose of this would be to set up a public financial sector, in the future, devoted entirely to financing socially worthwhile investment, particularly the kind that creates jobs."
"Thirdly, and more generally, the real economy must be assisted with an ambitious new credit policy."
"This concerns the EIB as much as the ECB."
"The EIB, to start with, should be given the responsibility and resources for achieving the task of guaranteeing SMEs access to all the credit they need to develop production, provided that real, properly paid jobs are created and the rights of their employees are respected."
"In this regard, the decision taken to assist SMEs by providing EUR 30 billion within three years is worthwhile, but I feel the amount is too low and the timescale too long."
"In France alone, SMEs need EUR 60 billion a year, and there are twenty-seven countries in the EU."
"Furthermore, it is now that they need the oxygen in many cases."
"Later may be too late."
"As for the ECB, surely it is now or never that we must ask it to adapt its role to the vital needs of the economy and our companies by directing money not to the financial markets, but to the real economy?"
"It has an instrument for doing this, and we do not understand why it is adamant about not using it."
"The instrument is selective credit, which is very expensive if it is used for financial operations, but is very accessible when it encourages jobs, training and all the worthwhile investments."
"I am aware that some of these proposals are not very orthodox."
"So what?"
"Instead of orthodox politics in a collapsing EU, I prefer the idea of reactive, creative politics serving the renewal of Europe and a life of dignity for Europeans."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Madam President, what a funny old European Union it is, isn't it?"
"Last Saturday afternoon, after a jolly good lunch at the Élysée, the European leaders stood on the steps and they talked with fairly weak smiles about solidarity."
"The smiles were weak, of course, because President Sarkozy's US-style bail-out plan had already collapsed into the dust."
"But nonetheless, 'United we stand' is what was said."
"And yet, with almost comic hypocrisy, the German Chancellor decided that German interests come first and European interests come second, and she acted - and, perhaps for the first time in years, she got loud applause from her own electorate."
"Of course it was the Irish that started this trend the week before by going their own way, and my admiration for Ireland grows by the day."
"But I think the last week is going to prove to be the watershed moment for this entire European project."
"You see, the only way to stop countries acting in their own national interest is to take that power away from them - to form a treasury department, there in Frankfurt, that has power over tax, and power over government spending."
"Indeed I have heard some of the EU extremists this afternoon effectively call for that."
"Yet you cannot do it, because it will not command public support."
"In fact to do that would be even more unpopular than your hated Lisbon Treaty."
"No: it is more likely that what has happened in the last week marks the beginning of the end."
"The markets are saying it already."
"Italian government bonds now yield 1% more than German- or French-issued government bonds."
"The markets are saying that economic and monetary union will not last."
"And I am not surprised, because it never was an optimal currency zone."
"One interest rate could never fit all these different countries, and you have never had proper public support."
"But it must be one thing or the other. It is either a full EU state that controls everything, or it is disintegration and back to national control."
"The credit crunch is hitting and hurting all of us, but I see a speck of light at the end of the tunnel."
"I see a dividend: possibly the beginning of the end of this whole mad and unwanted project."
"(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, the representatives of the Commission and of the Member States of the Union should resist two temptations next week."
"Firstly, they should accept that the Lisbon Treaty is dead and that any pressure on the Irish citizens to make them change their opinion is unacceptable, and they should halt the ratification process."
"Secondly, all senior politicians should realise that there is no such thing as a free lunch."
"Right now they should stop acting as Messiahs who will save the Union's economy, while playing roulette with market freedom and taxpayers' money."
"The shareholders and bank managers should pay the price for bankers' bad management."
"Ladies and gentlemen, at this moment all politicians are offering guarantees to bail out irresponsible bankers."
"By doing so they create a moral hazard."
"By offering State guarantees they are laughing in the faces of taxpayers and the much vaunted small and medium-sized enterprises."
"They send just one message to the major investors: you have the right to expect fat profits and in doing so you bear no risk and, in particular, no responsibilities."
"In exchange for this assistance, however, the politicians will expect a heavy price to be paid in return, and that will be market regulation."
"This will not prevent the crisis."
"This will merely postpone it."
"In addition, by abandoning the rules of fair economic competition we will be creating a jungle."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we are facing recession and growing unemployment."
"At the same time, the political elite are facing a difficult test: whether or not to succumb to the lure of populism that always offers easy solutions."
"In the 1930s Europe did not weather the storm and failed."
"I firmly believe that we will weather the storm today."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Madam President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen."
"I will be brief."
"I just want to tell you, having listened to you, that the first lesson I have learned from the first part of the French Presidency is that one crisis does not make the other crises go away."
"The financial crisis does not make the external affairs crisis go away, with Russia and Georgia and in other parts of the world; the financial and external affairs crises do not make the food crises and environmental crises go away."
"All these challenges have to be faced, even if we have to adapt in order to maintain our priorities."
"There are three types of priority."
"You highlighted the first in your speeches; it is the return of confidence - as the President of the Commission said - so that our fellow citizens feel more protected in relation to Europe and to prevent a gulf opening up between the European Union - the idea we all have of Europe - and our fellow citizens."
"The second priority is to adapt our institutional system so we have a more involved Europe, a better organised Europe, a Europe more capable of deciding - and deciding quickly - because we know that none of these challenges can be dealt with individually or at national level."
"The third priority is to move towards a development model that is more sustainable, more focused on the long term, and towards the equitable management of resources, while taking account of the very sudden slow-down in our economies that, as we well know, we are going to be facing."
"I fully support what the President of the European Commission said."
"We need to be fair, we have to make up for lost time and review certain dogmas."
"I think the Commission President has understood this and the proposals he is making are headed in the right direction."
"We clearly need to move towards greater integration and better financial supervision at European level."
"I will not go back over the various measures listed, but obviously it is up to the Council and the Member States to shoulder their responsibilities and it is up to this Parliament to assume its responsibilities in relation to the proposals on the table - which are very necessary - concerning standards, the credit rating agencies, capital to credit ratios, directors' pay and the pay of others working in the banking sector (there is also traders' pay, which is not often talked about but it also seems to me to be an important problem)."
"From this point of view, I believe that setting up the high-level group is an excellent initiative."
"I would just like to say, however, on behalf of the Presidency, that I would prefer it if its composition was more diverse and as broad as it could be while remaining effective."
"As the President of the Commission said, what is a liquidity crisis today should not turn into a credibility crisis tomorrow."
"Mr Daul highlighted perfectly what changes should be made in relation to the objectives that remain, particularly as regards the energy/climate package."
"It is also very important, as he pointed out, that we have a dimension that supports SMEs, that the European Investment Bank really takes strong action."
"Consequently, the finance package that has been agreed is important and it needs to be implemented very quickly as regards support for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"I agree with what Mr Schulz said."
"We need much more coordination."
"We need an action plan."
"We also need an action plan to support business."
"That is what Mr Schulz said and I go along with it entirely."
"He knows we will support him on this."
"As he already has good contacts with Mr Steinbruck, I think he will also be able to convince him."
"Concerning what Mr Watson said, I agree with him that we do not need more regulation, but better adapted regulation."
"That is what is important."
"We are not dogmatists regarding regulation, either."
"As many of you have said, it is clear that to regain confidence, we need regulation in the areas mentioned, and it should be better adapted, more reactive regulation."
"There again, it is up to the Member States to shoulder their responsibilities in this regard."
"Finally, as pointed out by Mr Wurtz, we must ensure that the European Investment Bank has an active role to play in the current context."
"The European Council will also be speaking about this, and we must take the measures necessary to ensure we have an institutional framework suited to financial groups, financial players that increasingly operate across borders."
"That is the real hiatus we have to face in this crisis: that really, the way we are organised remains totally national, while the challenges are trans-European."
"Together we must find measures that enable us to change the method of regulation rather than over-regulating, and we must make sure Europe unites to make its voice heard in the forthcoming international meetings so that, unlike in the past, we do not have the rules of others and disorder of others imposed on us, for which we have to bear the consequences, but rather we can move towards a more stable international order, one that is more in keeping with the challenges we have to face on a global level."
"President of the Commission. - (FR) Madam President, I would just like to underline two or three points that seem important at this stage in the debate."
"Broadly speaking, I have noticed that there is nevertheless a consensus on the general lines we should be following."
"It is necessary to understand that this is a highly unusual situation we are in, and that we have a mainly national framework with which to be dealing with a transnational crisis."
"The truth is, the supervisory authorities are national authorities."
"The Commission and the European Central Bank do not have powers of financial supervision."
"Regarding the Commission's powers, particularly as regards State aid, we have put in some work on this, and I can assure you that there is excellent cooperation between our services and the governments, which were keen to be in contact with us early on."
"I can also tell you that cooperation with the European Central Bank has been excellent, and once again I have witnessed the extraordinary effort the French Presidency has had to make in order to achieve a European approach, against this difficult background of fragmented supervisory systems, though still with a European dimension."
"Anyway, I would applaud, in this context, the decision the European Central Bank has taken today to cut interest rates, a decision taken in coordination with other central banks."
"As regards the points you underlined in your speeches, I would just like to highlight two things."
"One, raised by Mr Daul, concerns the issue of the real economy and SMEs."
"It is now certain - it is a recognised fact - that the crisis is already having consequences for the real economy, and that we have more difficult times ahead."
"I believe we should find targeted measures, within the framework of all the reforms being put in place by Europe, to adapt to a much more difficult context of competition and to find ways of helping SMEs in concrete ways."
"This is also the reason why, within the framework of these initiatives, the European Investment Bank has been encouraged to put measures in place for SMEs."
"The whole of this dimension, the dimension of the real economy, must be followed very closely over the next few months."
"Another point raised by Mr Schulz concerns the problem of those outside Europe, the problem of the very poorest."
"I believe it is also my duty to draw your attention to an important problem here."
"We are talking at the moment about 'financial rescue', but we must not forget 'human rescue'."
"This year, according to World Bank figures, 75 million more people will be victims of starvation. Next year, they are predicting 100 million more."
"That is why, while recognising that our problems in Europe have multiplied, we must not forget the problems in developing countries."
"We must not forget the tragedy in Africa."
"We must make the effort to respond positively to the request we recently received from the United Nations Secretary General and the President of the World Bank, in a letter addressed to all heads of State and government, and also, I think, to the President of the European Parliament, namely that the European institutions, that is Parliament and the Council, should approve the Commission's initiative concerning the implementation of an emergency plan to support farming in developing countries."
"We must not forget, as Mr Jouyet quite rightly said, that all these crises are linked: the financial crisis, the world food crisis, the energy crisis, important aspects as regards the geopolitical crisis."
"I would very much like to see Europe take part in a constructive approach, not just for us, as Europeans, but also for the rest of the world."
"We contribute to a new order in globalisation, which we want to be fair, not by shutting ourselves off, not by questioning the concept of the market economy, but by trying to apply fairer principles and rules in the market economy."
"As has been said, the current problem is also a problem of incapacity, not so much of the market - though many market operators are using unacceptable behaviour - but more of the competence of certain political or public authorities, which have not found suitable solutions for a market situation in terms of regulation."
"To finish, I can tell you that in our daily contacts with the governments I am seeing a recognition of the need for this European dimension."
"For example, as you no doubt know, until now, Europe and even the euro zone did not really exist as such for the international financial authorities."
"It was only a few months ago, after many years' insistence, that the European Commission finally won the right to a seat, to a presence at the Financial Stability Forum."
"It is an undeniable fact that, until now, even with the Stability and Growth Pact, even with a European Central Bank, the external representation of the EU in international financial bodies has fallen far short of the actual importance of Economic and Monetary Union and what the European Union project represents."
"Therefore, even at the heart of the crisis, I see opportunities."
"If we demonstrate wisdom, if we understand what we can and must do, I can see an opportunity for developing our idea of a Europe at the service of our citizens."
"Madam President, the current financial crisis is not just affecting banks and investors."
"Manufacturers, retailers, importers and exporters are all finding it more difficult to get the working capital they need, and there is a real risk that the major trade slowdown may intensify."
"So maintaining the free flow of goods - not just within Europe but also to and from the developing world, as President Barroso has just said - is therefore of particular concern."
"That is why - and this is the first of my two related points - the rapid appointment of a new trade Commissioner is so important at this time."
"Colleagues in the House may recall that we all supported Peter Mandelson across most parties and delegations at the time of his appointment."
"Even the British Conservatives supported him."
"I would hope that this may yet be the case with his successor, but I should share with the House that a number of colleagues from different delegations have already raised real concerns about her apparent lack of experience for the important trade portfolio."
"So I strongly suggest that it would be in her interest, as well as ours, for her hearing to be brought forward from 10 November, if at all possible."
"One month is a long time to wait and a long time for further doubts to develop."
"There is another reason: I have just been passed an e-mail saying that the Transatlantic Economic Council, scheduled for 16 October, has had to be postponed because the outgoing Commissioner has 'outgone' and the incoming Commissioner has yet to be confirmed."
"So please can we get the show on the road."
"It is all our interests."
"My second point concerns SMEs, a point passionately mentioned by my good friend and colleague, Joseph Daul."
"When the Council talks about the big picture, please can they talk about the little picture as well?"
"I noticed the other day that the end of August was the closure date for consultation on the Late Payments Directive."
"I think that timing was unfortunate."
"Whatever companies may have said up until the end of August, they would have a more powerful message now."
"Could I please ask for that consultation period to be reopened just for a further couple of months, because I think the fresh message about the lack of working capital is something that we really ought to take on board."
"I am not convinced that a Late Payments Directive review would solve the problem, but I do think this sort of analysis would contribute to an understanding of the problem."
"(FR) Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, let me say what a pity it is that the minister responsible for the Ecofin Council is not here."
"She is the President of this Council and is calling for strong European cooperation."
"I think her rightful place today was among us."
"President of the Commission, I hear you and I am not going to copy those who say it is all just words, but all the same, when have I really seen you mobilised on these issues since the crisis began?"
"You have come here on occasion with proposals, when you felt that within the Member States, particularly the largest (I am thinking of France and Germany on the issue of sovereign wealth funds), there might be trouble."
"You came with a proposal drawn up within your own cabinet, independently of the Commissioner in charge, Mr Charlie McCreevy."
"However, since then, I have not really had the impression that you are particularly mobilised."
"Anyway, I wanted to ask you something: where today have you hidden the Commissioner responsible for the state of the financial markets?"
"I am wondering why he is not at your side."
"I am pleased to see our friend Joaquin Almunia beside you, but I find it a little strange that the Commissioner responsible is not here."
"As for the Commissioner responsible, in July 2007, when all his services were mobilised, what did he do about informing us that the situation for the European banks was going to be dramatic, that the aftermath of this crisis for the European economy was going to be dramatic?"
"Your services were told."
"That was the moment, Mr Barroso, to come with proposals that would have made it possible to reassure European savers on the deposit guarantee, on how we were going to manage these difficult situations."
"Where was your Commissioner then?"
"You are delighted that the Commission - listen to me, Mr Barroso - was invited to sit on the Financial Stability Forum."
"Did you know that when the Forum met last Monday, your Commissioner, Mr McCreevy, did not go because he was in Dublin?"
"What did he say when the country he comes from decided to go it alone on the question of deposit guarantees in the sector for which he is responsible in the Commission?"
"You tell us there is resistance within the European Council, but do you really need to await orders from the finance ministers to set up a deposit guarantee scheme or to look at how accounting standards will be applied at European level?"
"Mr Barroso, it is your political responsibility today to demonstrate courage, leadership and initiative."
"Up to now, I have seen no such thing."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, events are happening very fast; the markets are in free fall."
"Nobody knows whether it is due to the loss of confidence that has set in everywhere or whether perhaps speculators are at work, trying to find out whether, and to what extent, they can still bring the market to its knees."
"In a whole-day workshop in February this year, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe already attempted to identify the causes of the crisis and determine concrete measures that we should vote in to avoid a repetition of this crisis in the future."
"Blaming individual market participants achieves very little."
"Basically, we must admit that we have all failed: the investment banks in which products were developed that were ultimately so complex that nobody understood them, the mortgage banks that waived credit assessments, the rating agencies that generously disregarded conflicts of interest, and the supervisory organs that did not work closely enough with each other or with the relevant central banks and did not make the effort to achieve true transparency of special purpose vehicles that were not required to report individually on their balance of accounts."
"Nothing has been done for far too long!"
"The Commission, which we asked years ago to look into the rating agencies to give us some clarity about their activities and to improve transparency in other areas, waited far too long before taking any measures."
"Now, measures that would have been unthinkable a few months ago are being taken practically every day: the G7 on Saturday, the 27 Member States on Monday, the Ministers of Finance on Tuesday, the measures by the British Government today, and at the same time, a coordinated initiative by the central banks and a reduction in interest rates!"
"Good; I hope that these measures will help, but they could also be misunderstood by the markets and seen as an expression of a pervasive panic - and that must certainly be avoided."
"The house has 27 rooms, flames are billowing out of the roof, but what are the 27 residents doing?"
"They are acting individually, each one fighting the fire in his own room, instead of working together."
"(FR) Madam President, with this financial crisis, the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum will fade into the background."
"Perhaps that is no bad thing."
"Perhaps that is where it should have always been."
"We were actually wondering how this Pact on Immigration and Asylum differs compared with the policies followed for years by the European Union and by Member States."
"Well, it is true!"
"With this new Pact, what will change for migrants who are the victims of police violence, of human trafficking, of absurd red tape?"
"Does it sanction their human dignity, their rights?"
"Will it sanction the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families?"
"No!"
"For the victims of poverty, war, natural disaster, the increasing restrictions on the right of asylum, what will change?"
"Will people start to question how ridiculous it is having to apply for asylum in the first country of refuge?"
"Will there be an end to summary examinations and the unreliable, shall we say, lists of safe countries?"
"For migrants who are legally employed and who are a real part of our economic and social life, will this mean that they are officially recognised?"
"No!"
"What about migrants, including minors, who are imprisoned or expelled, even to countries where they will be mistreated, where they have no family, where they do not speak the language; will this change?"
"Will we abandon readmission and transit agreements in countries where there are human rights violations?"
"No!"
"You realise that people all over the world are booing asylum and immigration policy."
"You can no longer go to an international conference without hearing about the massive rights violations suffered by migrants due to European asylum and immigration policy."
"I believe that this has to change."
"We need a policy based on pragmatism and not on hypocrisy, which is the trademark of the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we fully agree with what President Sarkozy said in Evian: that only the coordinated action of central banks and governments will make it possible to curb the systemic risk."
"This does not take away the fact that, notwithstanding today's interesting debate, we still have some worrying doubts over why the European Central Bank did not lower rates sooner in the light of events in the US market, in the global markets and in the financial markets, particularly in some EU countries."
"We question this because there has been no clear position on the issue of derivatives, when we know that these products caused major public institutions and authorities in Italy and Europe to run up massive debts."
"We question it because the consolidation policy of banking institutions has continued, on many occasions creating idols with feet of clay without taking into account the real system that exists in our countries, and the reason why consumer credit has been uncontrolled, leading to huge debts being amassed both by individuals and, as a knock-on effect, banks."
"In short, we are asking for Europe to have the courage today to review the Stability Pact, which now belongs in the last century."
"With an exponential number of new crises emerging, we need swift and sure-fire decisions."
"Since we were talking about small and medium-sized enterprises earlier, we also need the Council to be clear about the fact that the Commission has a duty to introduce further cuts in fuel costs."
"(NL) Madam President, a little modesty never goes amiss, and this includes politicians."
"Let us make this clear from the start: the institutions of the European Union are scarcely more than utterly powerless onlookers, and the European Parliament barely more than an utterly powerless talking shop, in the global financial crisis."
"I shall therefore start by discussing a few other things for which we do bear responsibility."
"Originally, the summit was to be dominated by the Irish question and the moribund Treaty of Lisbon."
"However, recent statements by leading eurocrats give me a very strong feeling of déjà vu."
"One example is Commissioner Wallström, who stated just this week that the Irish referendum actually had very little to do with the Treaty itself, but more to do with ethical issues and taxation."
"It boils down to the fact that, in the eyes of the Commission, the Irish 'no' was in fact a 'yes'."
"The reason I have déjà vu is that identical statements were also made by members of the European establishment following the French and Dutch referendums back then."
"The people say 'no', but the eurocrats hear 'yes'."
"Such contempt for basic democracy is evidently a structural feature of this Europe."
"A certain European politically autistic elite, screened off from the people, goes ahead and takes decisions in spite of the people and then looks on utterly powerless when real disasters occur, as is the case now."
"Another example is as follows."
"Recent surveys have shown that opposition to the accession of Turkey is stronger than ever among the citizens of our countries - but what do we do?"
"We further accelerate the process of negotiating this accession."
"The Europe we see now is the exact opposite of anything related to democracy."
"In addition, we cannot solve this problem of citizens' mistrust by now acting out a play, pretending we are making a significant contribution to tackling the financial crisis."
"(FR) Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, my message to the Commission and Council is this: in the midst of this financial crisis, let us not forget the follow-up to the extraordinary Council meeting of 1 September, and particularly the Georgia and Belarus question."
"Georgia lost the war but should win the peace, and we have to do our utmost to make this happen."
"It means two things: helping Georgia with strong financial support for reconstruction and helping to consolidate democratic reforms."
"The European Union was quicker and more efficient than our American friends in handling the Caucasian crisis, and our response was coherent and based on a common approach - and thanks and congratulations to the French presidency for that."
"We have to take into account the impact of the Georgian crisis on the whole region and on the European Union itself."
"It is more necessary than ever to set up our relations with eastern neighbours, namely through eastern partnership at a higher level."
"We need a strong democratic Georgia, as Georgia needs us."
"There is also our common European interest, and I mean here energy security and the availability of a Caucasian corridor for alternative transit of oil and gas."
"We expect from the Commission and Council that they ensure the protection of existing pipelines and develop further the dramatically missing common foreign policy on energy."
"Now on Belarus: the situation there is slightly improving and there are the first signs of liberalisation."
"Elections were not democratic."
"We need to respond with a new policy to end the isolation of Belarus, but with a measured opening, based on strict conditionality and a gradual give-and-take approach."
"That means the following elements: selective application of European neighbourhood policies and human rights instruments, selective suspension of visa sanctions for officials, lowering by half the cost of entry visas for Belarusian citizens, re-establishment of political dialogue, support for opening more economic cooperation with the European Union, protection of civil society, NGOs, national minorities and free media, and all that in close consultation with those representing the democratic position in Belarus."
"(ES) Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the message that I think we should send to the forthcoming European Council meeting is the need to restore and bolster the confidence of European citizens in our project."
"The reason is that we have decided to create an economic and monetary union, which is under construction but is not yet complete."
"For a week, due to being infected by the US epidemic, we have run the risk of either a stampede or a mass exodus, which I think has been corrected."
"It has been demonstrated in time that the European institutions work: specifically, in the case of the Ecofin meeting yesterday, and also with the coordinated drop in interest rates today."
"What we need is to be able to help our production system; in this respect, besides the Community initiatives, I will mention, for example, the case of my country, where yesterday it was decided to launch a EUR 30 billion fund, because what we need to do is to help businesses to function."
"The second area in which it is important to bolster confidence is the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty."
"I also had the opportunity to have a discussion with Minister Martin."
"He made an accurate diagnosis of the situation, but a diagnosis without a prescription for medication does not work."
"What we need, therefore, is for our Irish friends, having reflected and thought things over, also to be aware that this is not a neutral exercise, in other words, that in a Union based on solidarity, it is also costing us, and it is going to cost us dearly if the Lisbon Treaty is not adopted before the elections."
"The only positive aspect of non-ratification is perhaps that it will make the European elections the centre of attention."
"However, it is important to fight and work to have the Lisbon Treaty in force by the forthcoming European elections, so that the Union might be stronger and more cohesive."
"(NL) Madam President, citizens are currently looking to Europe to provide protection and stability and to show unity."
"A strong Europe is more important than ever at this time."
"Everyone agrees that intervention was needed, and it is good that the action has been swift."
"This was unavoidable."
"There are a number of developments that I nevertheless find worrying, and I also sense a degree of ideology behind some of the action that has been taken."
"Some people in this House have already been celebrating the death of capitalism."
"To be frank, however, politicians are not bankers."
"Emergency measures are one thing, but I have also noticed that some operations amount to the common-or-garden nationalisation of banks."
"To be frank, there are a number of bankers who are clearly no longer to be trusted and to whom we cannot entrust our savings."
"Ask yourselves, however, whether you would entrust your savings to politicians acting as bankers. To Mr Schulz, for example."
"I for one would not."
"The crisis must not be seized upon to circumvent, weaken or even abolish the rules."
"I find the call for flexible application of competition policy or the Stability and Growth Pact extremely worrying."
"These are the very rules that have made Europe robust."
"I have a specific question for the Commission - and, incidentally, I note with regret that Mr Barroso evidently does not consider the debate absorbing enough to stay until the end."
"This afternoon the Dutch Minister for Finance stated in the debate in the lower house of the Dutch Parliament that the purchase of Fortis and ABN-AMRO - not only the bank, but also the parts not of systemic relevance, such as insurance - had not been declared as State aid."
"Therefore, I should like to know how the Commission intends to deal with this kind of case in the coming period."
"After all, Commissioner Kroes stated last Monday - and I totally agree - that the competition rules and the Stability and Growth Pact continue to apply in full."
"How do we deal with this kind of case?"
"What will happen if it is subsequently found that there has been an infringement of the rules on State aid?"
"(PL) Madam President, the main challenge facing Europe today is most definitely the economic crisis."
"Despite the quite recent assurances by German politicians and European Commission officials, this crisis is starting to hit Europe in a big way."
"The question is not whether it will reach us, but when."
"Last Saturday the self-appointed leaders of several of the European Union's largest countries failed to agree on any common tactic in this regard."
"Moreover, from the example of the deposit guarantees announced by states such as Greece, Ireland and Germany, in contrast to other EU Member States, it is obvious that there is not a single common tactic to deal with this."
"If a common strategy on this is not worked out at the forthcoming EU summit, it will be a very bad signal for citizens of the EU Member States, because it is precisely in times of crisis that the people of the EU most need to feel that the EU is standing by in case of need and that it is there not only during the good times, but also when there is a problem."
"(DE) Madam President, unfortunately, the President of the Commission is no longer here."
"He said - I noted it down at the time - we do not yet have the rules that allow a European answer."
"In that, he is truly right."
"Mrs Berès told us why he is right - because the commissioner responsible, Mr McCreevy, might as well have been dead for the last four years!"
"He consistently ignored Parliament's suggestions in at least 10 different reports."
"That is the reality, not neoliberalism, but remote control from Dublin and London by the commissioner responsible for the financial markets."
"If the President of the Commission had any backbone, he would take this role away from Mr McCreevy and give it to Mr Almunia, where it belongs, but he does not have the courage to do that."
"Instead, people keep talking here as if 'zero hour' were just beginning."
"All I can do is shake my head in puzzlement at what the President of the Commission has done."
"He will not be able to talk his way out of joint responsibility that easily."
"I say this so emphatically because we cannot just sit here quietly and wait."
"We must act quickly."
"The issuing banks have acted; the finance ministers have acted."
"All that has become necessary because the crisis has now reached exactly the proportions that we have been afraid of all these years."
"Where is Mrs Kroes?"
"She is waffling around with her competition rules and also compromising security in the area of stability of the banks that are still functioning."
"She is setting deadlines instead of thinking about whether Ireland can allocate 200% of its domestic product as guarantees exclusively for Irish citizens and for future loans."
"Who has said even one word about that?"
"If the Commission does not have the courage to make suggestions with regard to a European supervisory authority, even if doing so means going against the will of the Member States, then everything will just collapse."
"If a European solidarity fund is then established before the rules are harmonised, that would be outright socialism."
"(DE) Madam President, listening to Mr Langen, one could almost speak of a grand coalition, because I agree with what he said."
"A crisis in Georgia, a financial crisis, a crisis with energy prices - everything is crying out for a strong Europe."
"Therefore, as chair of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, I am delighted that, apart from the anti-Europeans, everyone here has declared their support for speedy ratification of the Reform Treaty, and I thank the French Presidency for persisting with this matter."
"This must not be postponed indefinitely and I expect next week's summit to send a clear signal and produce a timetable for completion of ratification."
"Sweden and the Czech Republic are to ratify the Treaty by the end of this year, and I still have not given up hope that ratification is still possible in Ireland before the European elections."
"Ireland's Foreign Minister, Micheál Martin, told my committee on Monday that there was a change in awareness taking place in Ireland and that people were recognising the value of the EU."
"In politics, six months can be a very long time!"
"Now to my second subject: we also need to explain to citizens why we need the EU."
"I am pleased that we will adopt a joint political declaration on the EU communications strategy at the summit."
"Here I would like to thank the French Presidency, which managed to bring together all three institutions."
"This now needs to be tackled for the referendum in Ireland and for the European elections."
"The EU is not the cause of numerous problems, but the solution to many!"
"That should be made clear outside the EU."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe has not protected people from financial speculation."
"Even the New York Times printed the prophetic saying by Ezra Pound that 'with usura hath no man a house of good stone'."
"Today the Federal Reserve and the US Treasury would like to paper over the cracks by lowering rates."
"It was this solution - easy access to credit - that caused the speculative bubble in the first place."
"In 1933, a group of economists in Chicago came up with a plan: to re-establish an exclusive state monopoly on issuing currency, prohibiting banks from creating counterfeit money, and imposing an obligation on banks to have a 100% reserve."
"This made fractional credit fraud impossible and put an end to the financial games that were ruining ordinary people, hurting savers and crippling the real economy."
"Nobel Prize winner Maurice Allais has always been openly critical of innovative finance, securitisation, derivatives and hedge funds, much beloved of the finance gnomes in a certain part of Europe's financial sector."
"He quite rightly calls - as we have been for some time - for derivatives to be made illegal."
"Let us adopt the Chicago Plan, the Allais Plan: reserving the creation of money for governments."
"Enough of Europe being unsure of what to do."
"Even the Pope has issued a warning that wealth means nothing."
"Madam President, the Council also has to draw conclusions from the invasion of Georgia."
"In order to prevent such aggressions happening again, the EU has to make sure that the idea that 'might makes right' will prove absolutely disadvantageous for the invader."
"By invading a sovereign state, Russia, as a Security Council member, has shattered not just the regional but the international security and stability paradigm."
"If there is no setting of limits, the way will be open to further demonstrations of force against Ukraine, Moldova and others."
"What we need today is a more efficient eastern partnership and a strong and democratic Georgia."
"Unfortunately, even before Russia has met its commitments, some socialist leaders visiting Moscow have declared that the EU and Russia need each other more than ever and that Russia and the EU have to cooperate in filling the possible security gap left by the weakening USA."
"There seems to be a dangerous confusion about who our real allies are and who is really interested in weakening and splitting Europe."
"Finally, the EU has to react to the ongoing distribution of Russian passports abroad."
"This means artificially creating new Russian citizens to be defended according to Medvedev doctrine, so preparing new international hotbeds of crisis."
"Our reaction should be to deny visas for those new citizens, especially for the leaders of the new Russian protectorates."
"Finally, we should rapidly provide Georgians and Ukrainians with more generous visa facilitation than Russian citizens have been granted."
"Madam President, it is my view that, sooner rather than later, the Irish Government must seek to resolve the Irish roadblock to Lisbon, and should do so by maintaining Ireland as a full member, not as a semi-detached member, which opt-outs would relegate us to."
"We need Lisbon now more than ever to strengthen Europe globally and to respond effectively to citizens' concerns."
"The financial crisis is yet another market meltdown."
"It has happened again because most governments bought into the fairytale that global markets could be self-regulating, and failed to apply democratic controls to the market."
"The euro is an example of what Europe can achieve when it seriously shares sovereignty."
"Certainly, if Ireland had opted to keep the Irish pound it would have disappeared, sunk without trace by now."
"President Barroso has admitted he got little cooperation from Member States in producing a coordinated response to the crisis."
"He is silent, however, about Commissioner McCreevy's continued resistance to re-regulation."
"Commissioner McCreevy is incapable of abandoning his neo-liberal ideology and I am therefore very concerned that he is being included in the three-person body that President Barroso is establishing."
"Could I just make one final point?"
"I propose to put Mr Farage's speech today in this Parliament on my website, because I believe the more Irish people hear what he has to say about Ireland and about Europe, the more likely they are to vote 'yes' for the European Union."
"(NL) Madam President, the question is whether this financial crisis will lead to further European integration or whether the reverse will be true."
"In my view, a crisis of this magnitude can be tackled only at European level - which must lead to further European integration."
"This requires leadership, however; not only by Member States but also, in particular, by the Commission."
"Up to now, the reaction to the financial crisis has been provided mainly by Member States - which I welcome, for example when action was taken in the Fortis crisis - whilst the Commission has remained silent."
"In my opinion, the financial crisis has been caused by the rapid innovation in the financial sector over recent years."
"Banking products have been packaged such that rapid profits are possible, but also great risks."
"However, these risks were not transparent, and in some cases they still are not."
"It is terribly complicated for experts to make a proper appraisal, and thus to assess the value of these new financial products."
"Therefore, the Commission must now present measures to increase the transparency of financial products and to improve bank governance."
"It must also present measures to improve supervision, and proposals to reinforce cooperation between central banks themselves and other supervisors."
"Parliament will express this opinion in the report on the Lamfalussy follow-up and the future structure of supervision in the financial sector, which we are discussing next."
"Incidentally, I deeply regret the abstention in the parliamentary committee, on such an important report, by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament."
"I wonder whether it will do so again tomorrow."
"The crisis demonstrates the importance of Europe."
"If the European authorities act individually in this connection, State aid and also discrimination against foreign savers, customers and investors can result."
"Only Europe can offer a rounded approach to the crisis, and that is why the Commission must take the lead, starting today."
"(PL) Madam President, just as the situation in the Caucasus this summer presented the European Union with a new geopolitical challenge, so today the crisis in the financial markets in the global market is presenting a challenge linked to the global economy, and the European Union is having to face up to this."
"Everyone is agreed that at this time we must put together a coordinated response from Europe in relation to these challenges."
"How can we do this without the Lisbon Treaty, though?"
"It is not possible, surely."
"This is why ratification of the Lisbon Treaty is absolutely fundamental - 'to be or not to be' for the European Union, a serious response from the European Union in the current global order."
"President Barroso said that the EU institutions, and the European Commission, too, are not properly represented in the global financial architecture."
"This is yet further evidence of the need to ratify the Lisbon Treaty as soon as possible in those countries that have not yet done so."
"Another matter I would like to raise today is that the market is fine as long as it is a regulated market."
"A capitalist economy that bears the human factor in mind."
"This is a completely fundamental question."
"That, after all, was Europe's response to the crisis of the early 20th century."
"Europe built up its strength precisely for that reason."
"One final matter - let us salvage the shipyard industry in Poland."
"I am addressing the European Commission on this - in view of the current crisis, what good to us are a further 100 000 unemployed?"
"(PL) Madam President, the most important matter today is overcoming the financial crisis, but the main threat posed by the financial crisis is an economic slowdown."
"We cannot concern ourselves with finance alone, because in the end it always comes down to the competitiveness of the economy, growth, and jobs."
"The adoption of the wrong legislative solutions as part of the climate and energy package could worsen the prognosis for a way out of the financial crisis."
"We wish to act on a fundamental principle - a 20% reduction in greenhouse gases by 2020."
"The President-in-Office of the Council spoke of flexibility in the climate and energy package, and of the balance that must be maintained in its adoption."
"What does this mean?"
"It should mean a capacity to adapt the package, and particularly to adapt the emissions trading system, to the current situation, and this situation is completely different to what it was a year ago, six months ago or even two months ago."
"This same aim - a reduction in emissions - may be achieved through various methods."
"We know the results of the voting on this Emissions Trading Directive that took place yesterday in the European Parliament in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety."
"We have taken note of them."
"What lies before us now is a very difficult trialogue, as regulation is adopted here subject to numerous reservations."
"We have not had enough time in Parliament to discuss all the problems linked to the Directive on Emissions and Trading."
"I am therefore appealing to the French Presidency and to the European Commission to bear in mind the conclusions and amendments of the minorities as well, despite the fact that some of these amendments were unsuccessful in the majority voting in European Parliament committees."
"If we wish to find a good solution, we must be guided today by common sense, and by the situation, which is constantly changing and is steadily deteriorating where economic forecasts are concerned."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I will start by saying that I find it very disappointing that it always takes a crisis for us to find the right sense of determination, the right choice of words, the right dynamics for finding common ground and European responses."
"Action by Europe and European rule are an essential part of the solution. They are not only an answer to crises but also necessary to prevent crises in our globalised world."
"We need both short- and long-term measures."
"These crises show us how dependent we are on one another, how global, how interwoven the financial world is these days."
"I have here a collection of requests by the European Parliament since 2002, only a fraction of which have been answered by the Commission, and many of which have been frustrated by the Member States, which impedes us from finding European solutions."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we need legislative suggestions in the areas of European supervision, capital for receivables, rating agencies, the granting of credit, crisis management models, and minimum standards for all forms of investment."
"In the same breath, I would stress that we must not misuse the crisis in the financial markets to create disproportionate regulations."
"This is not about condemning the market and demanding nationalisation."
"It is about creating as much market as possible and putting in place the amount of regulation that is required in the global world."
"Everyone needs regulation - we must not exclude anyone - but this regulation must be in proportion to the risk and must relate to the product."
"That is what I am asking for and I hope that the Council will implement this."
"Madam President, at next week's European Council summit, nothing new will come from An Taoiseach Brian Cowan in relation to the current Lisbon Treaty impasse in Ireland."
"Instead he will make an intervention similar to that of his colleague, Minister Micheál Martin, where only an analysis of the results was communicated on Monday to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs of the European Parliament."
"Nothing concrete will be proposed until the December Council summit, where a clear road map ahead is expected to be outlined."
"In order to expedite moves towards this road map, I would like to expound my idea on how to now move forward."
"First, in my view, there cannot be a second referendum for at least 12 months, in order to allow adequate consultation with the Irish electorate."
"A second referendum should be called during the autumn of next year, possibly in October."
"This means that Parliament elections will have to take place under the Nice Treaty, but this is the lesser of two evils in my opinion."
"As to the nature of the second referendum, I would propose an extended plebiscite on the Lisbon Treaty in Ireland, where we would have a constitutional referendum on yes or no to the Lisbon Treaty while, on the same day, polling consultative referenda on key opt-in, opt-out issues such as the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and European security and defence policy."
"If in the extended referendum Irish voters were to opt out of either of these two areas, the Irish Government could then seek a separate agreement at the European Council to be signed by all 27 Member States."
"This move would be similar to the precedent of the Edinburgh Agreement sought by the Danes at the Council meeting in December 1992, which granted Denmark four exemptions to the Maastricht Treaty."
"This allowed them to ratify the Treaty overall."
"With this plan, Member States who have already ratified the Lisbon Treaty would not have to do so again. This extended plebiscite would offer the Irish electorate a choice as to the extent of the role that they want to play within the European Union."
"Mr President, I have three points to begin with."
"Regarding Russia, we must maintain a policy of being open and firm at the same time, never accepting Russian claims to any interests in other countries, be they 'near abroad' or far away."
"This will be of fundamental importance in the years to come."
"Secondly, the budget review must aim to open up and deregulate European agriculture, creating more opportunities for farmers in Europe, as well as in other parts of the world - though with fewer subsidies - aiming for a global, functioning agricultural market to meet the new demands for food all over the world."
"Thirdly, the actions regarding climate change must start now, in spite of the financial crisis, so that we can benefit from a long-term process; in this way we can fight climate change and be prepared to meet the other changes it will bring about."
"Regarding the financial crisis that we have been speaking about today, many of the speakers have forgotten that we are now at the end of a long-term process, unique in human history - that of global growth that has brought prosperity in a way that we have never seen before."
"We are now at the end of that."
"I did not hear anything about this from Mr Schulz earlier today."
"Of course, we have a number of problems, but they do not only concern the market."
"No one can say that the sub-prime loans in the USA are the result of market forces."
"They are the result of decisive political interventions."
"What we need now is to ensure that we have transparency, accountability and supervision that covers the modern markets as they are."
"They are both European and global, and we need to ensure that we can catch up with the reality of the financial markets. Then we can also be constructive regarding the development of a real economy."
"(FI) Mr President, instability spreading like wildfire is typical of today's world."
"This is especially true of the financial markets, which these days are among the most global of all business sectors."
"Irresponsibility, over-zealousness and failure to regulate on one side of the world will potentially hit the pockets of ordinary consumers everywhere."
"I too welcome the Commission's initiative to set up a standing working group to deal with the financial crisis in the Commission."
"As the Commission's President, Mr Barroso, said, we can and should do much more."
"I think, however, that the Commission has been saddled with too much responsibility here."
"Responsibilities need to be kept clear."
"The European Central Bank is there to make sure that prices and the value of money remain stable."
"The ECB has acted effectively to ease the crisis."
"Today's coordinated interest cuts are a good indication of this."
"On the other hand, Community institutions - the European Commission and the European Parliament - are responsible for ensuring that the single market remains open and that legislation is in place."
"Market actors must comply with the law, control their risks and encourage households which owe them money to seek appropriate solutions."
"Finance groups must attend not just to their own business but also take wider social responsibility."
"The main responsibility, however, lies with the finance ministers, because most of the instruments for growth and solutions to the crisis are in their toolkit, and are not to be found at the ECB or among the European legislators or market actors."
"The financial ministers have shown initiative."
"In October 2007 they adopted clearer rules to prevent crises in the financial markets."
"Considering how long-term this job is going to be, the 13-point list from yesterday's Ecofin is pretty pathetic."
"I am not against the proposals, but I think that the action programme is inadequate."
"It is not enough to do something: we also have to do the right things, and it is even more important to know how to do nothing, when legislation is not the right solution to the problems."
"We should not allow room for all populist pressures."
"(HU) Thank you, Mr President."
"And I would ask the interpreters to forgive me for speaking off the top of my head."
"The key words here are solidarity, supervision and security."
"We continually assert that solidarity is of particular importance in the current financial crisis, especially coming as we do, as I do, from a country which is brimful of bank branches, affiliated organisations and subsidiaries, so what is essential here is how the head offices in their key positions, and their supervisory bodies, react to the problem facing us."
"On the subject of solidarity, I can mention here that the Common Agricultural Policy came into being five years after the creation of the European Economic Community and now, almost five years after enlargement, it is time for a Common Energy Policy, too."
"I am glad that the Minister has said that this was a good idea but it still had to be achieved."
"But what I can also say, this business of deposits, here it is about solidarity."
"This is possible, and it is a time when we are able to present a positive picture of the European Union in central European countries; if we do not hang about one after the other, but say together that indeed in a case of crisis we will give a guarantee for the entire population's deposits. For up to six months, or a year."
"We can decide, and the sooner we do this the better, as we are talking about people here, people in parlous circumstances, who we must rescue as quickly as possible."
"I do not believe that this will cause such very long-drawn-out problems."
"The second question is solidarity and our defencelessness."
"It is really about supervisory authority and that will be the next point."
"I understand that we wish to establish chambers, or colleges, and I believe it is important that we move towards some centralised supervision, just as we transfer certain key matters in competition policy to the appropriate EU body or to the ECB, the European Central Bank, but it is very difficult to comprehend how we could build up confidence in each other in a collegiate system. Thank you."
"Mr President, I would say to you, and to Mr Jouyet and Mr Almunia, that it is absolutely essential that the interbank market is restarted."
"The only sure way to achieve this is to have sovereign state guarantees for wholesale interbank deposits, as indeed Ireland and Denmark have done in their domestic markets."
"Admittedly the contingent liability is enormous; however, when the interbank market restarts, the banks will stop hoarding, they will start lending again to businesses and individuals and householders, interbank rates will return to normal levels, and it is an absolute certainty that those guarantees will not need to be used."
"I agree with Mr Jouyet that this has to be done on a global basis."
"It is the proper role of the IMF, as he said, to coordinate this action, and only with such a bold move, on a global basis, will we put out the fire and start to rekindle confidence."
"(HU) The most important thing to be done here, and I quite agree with the French presidency, is to find some kind of a solution for Ireland and the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty."
"As for the financial turbulence, I would remind Parliament that in February 2008 the Hungarian Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsány proposed a single European supervisory authority and a single supervisory rule book, in view of the crisis in the international financial markets."
"Unfortunately, there was no majority vote for this at the Council's March sitting."
"I think that this proposal should be revisited at the next sitting."
"The Hungarian Prime Minister will propose it again as, without it, without a European financial supervisory authority, global problems will occur again and again."
"I would ask the French presidency and the other Member States to support this."
"After all, a solution to this problem is in all our interests."
"Mr President, the fat cats of the American banking industry, together with the corresponding fat cats of Europe, have for the last few years embarked on an orgy of fraud, embezzlement and corruption at the expense of ordinary people."
"Yet those authorities such as the central banks, finance ministers and EU Commissioners, whose duty was to protect the citizens, have in essence done nothing to stop them."
"After their conspiracy of silence, negligence and cover-up, these authorities now have the nerve to commit taxpayers' money so that the same fat cats can get even richer."
"This is outrageous, scandalous and shameful."
"This is not justice."
"Those to blame for the current global economic catastrophe and those who offered them a cover-up should have their assets seized and should be sent to prison."
"This is true justice and this is the type of justice that the EU should be about."
"This is the bald truth about what EU citizens think."
"(FR) Mr President, a question first of all to the Council."
"What about the High-Level Conference on Georgia proposed by the French Presidency, and how the current EU Presidency plans to defend the territorial integrity of Georgia, when two separatist regions, Abkhazia and South Ossetia, are recognized by another country?"
"It is a shame that Mr Barroso is not here, because his speech lacked conviction."
"Perhaps because he himself is not convinced by his own proposals."
"I believe that the financial and economic situation is much more serious than he described."
"Even today, I think anyone on the internet can clearly see that stock markets are continuing to collapse, despite all the intervention."
"I see this as a real meltdown of the current system, a system which is completely obsolete, a system which has led to bankruptcy, which has led to the land being completely exploited and suffocated by greenhouse gas emissions, which has led to underdevelopment in the South, and underdevelopment in our towns and cities."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(PL) Mr President, in today's crisis we are dealing with the subject of public aid for threatened economic sectors."
"The German Hypo is being rescued by subventions to the value of EUR 50 billion, aid for the British Bradford & Bingley is a further EUR 35 billion, and the Fortis rescue is EUR 11 billion."
"The European Central Bank has meanwhile pumped a further EUR 120 billion into bank deposits to keep them liquid."
"Meanwhile, Commissioner Kroes is bringing about a political crisis in Poland through the repayment of around half a billion - let me emphasise, half a billion - euros in public aid for three Polish shipyards."
"I am curious to know how the European Commission would like to explain to Poles a situation in which hundreds of billions of euros are flowing into banks in the old Europe, while half a billion euros may not be transferred to three shipyards that may fail as a result of the Commission's actions."
"I suggest that we remember this when decisions on further cash injections for the financial sector come up during the next session of the Council."
"(EL) Mr President, a French Prime Minister, Édouard Balladur, issued a statement to the effect that complete freedom in the market was tantamount to the law of the jungle."
"He added that our society, democracy and institutions could not allow the jungle to take over."
"In spite of this, we now find ourselves in a jungle and are paying for the complete market freedom that used to reign in the United States."
"If you consider that for each dollar of actual investment, the US banks were lending USD 32, as against the European banks' paltry USD 12, you will understand the unaccountability that was rife in the US banking market."
"I now fear that neither Mr Paulson's measures nor those of the US Government will bring the world out of this crisis."
"Considering the future, I think that strict rules need to be applied from now on."
"(RO) Mr President, Mr President of the Council, Commissioner Almunia, honoured colleagues, over the past few years there were important leaders, especially socialists, who talked about the need to reform the world's financial system, some sort of a post-Bretton Woods, able to face the challenges of globalisation."
"Unfortunately, nothing happened."
"This is why I salute the recent interventions of president Sarkozy and of the French presidency as well as of other European leaders who have referred to the need to make such a reform."
"Today I was happy to hear the words of the President of the European Commission, Mr. Barroso, who spoke about the need to look beyond the financial crisis and beyond Europe."
"Therefore I suggest, Mr. Barroso, that the European Union and the European Commission make an explicit commitment to the need to reform the world's financial system together with other major actors such as the United States, China or Japan to provide mankind with the necessary instruments to govern the financial aspects of globalisation."
"Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, since I have already spoken, I will be brief."
"Regarding the management of the financial crisis, I am very sorry that my being here is not enough for Mrs Berès, but I am glad that she is satisfied with seeing Mr Almunia here."
"More seriously, the speeches by Mrs Berès, Mr Karas and Mrs Kauppi, in particular, show that what we need - as has already been said - is to make sure that we effectively adopt the Commission's proposals which are on the table and which cover all aspects of the supervision, regulation and modification of accounting rules."
"This will be in the sense of an adaptation of existing regulations, of an adaptation of the rules rendered necessary by the present situation, and not in the sense of overregulation."
"As we have already said, in this area we need more of Europe and we need to adapt our regulations to the interdependency of financial institutions and the interdependency of our rules for financing the economy."
"We need to get up to speed very quickly in this area and regain the momentum we had a few years ago - you will be discussing this - in order to finalise the organisation set up as part of the work carried out by Mr Lamfalussy."
"It is also important for the Commission to have competencies - to have a role to play in this respect - and the Commission is perfectly right to insist on that point."
"We need to be logical about this."
"If we want more integration, if we want to implement the solutions that we have seen work for others, we need to create an organisation can meet the financial challenges that we will have to face, and we need to act swiftly."
"The French Presidency, as I said, will do everything within its power and devote all of its energy to increasing the necessary coordination and adaptation of rules in this area."
"We clearly need there to be - as there indeed is - coordination between the European Central Bank, European finance ministers and the Commission in this area."
"This is more important than ever."
"We need to find concrete answers and we also need to anticipate the consequences that this crisis will have on the financing of the economy, and on the economy itself."
"We can already see the first signs of this."
"Here too - and this is an essential part of building confidence - we need to adopt major groundbreaking measures, particularly for SMEs."
"In terms of external relations, elements of which were raised by Mr Saryusz-Wolski and Mrs Isler Béguin, I would like to tell Mr Saryusz-Wolski that the priority of the European Council, as I mentioned earlier, is to define precise strategies and to issue guidance for energy security and solidarity."
"One crisis should not mask another."
"Three months ago, we had an energy crisis."
"This still exists."
"Countries were dependent on other countries for their energy supply."
"That is still the case."
"We must have a European energy policy with substance, and here too we have fallen behind and need to move swiftly."
"Concerning Belarus, I wanted - we will be debating this in more detail shortly - to tell Mr Saryusz-Wolski that there will be a troika during the General Affairs Council and that we will meet with the Belarus authorities then."
"As you know, and Mr Saryusz-Wolski underlined this, we have expressed our concerns in terms of the election process, which we are not satisfied with. We will be open about this, but, at the same time, the Council is considering a possible relaxation of certain sanctions, particularly the visa restrictions imposed on some Belarus officials affected by the sanctions."
"The Council is still reflecting on these developments."
"I liked the expression you used, Mr President, concerning the conflict between Russia and Georgia."
"We must restore peace and ensure that there is peace in Georgia."
"This allows me to answer Mrs Isler Béguin."
"We will hold a High-Level Conference on 14 October, in the evening, and on 15 October."
"On 14 October, foreign ministers will meet with Bernard Kouchner, and on 15 October there will be a meeting of senior officials and leaders in order to find appropriate solutions to the situation in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, recognition of which - I must say this to Mrs Isler Béguin, although she is well aware of it - remains extremely isolated, which is fortunate as this unacceptable act was strongly condemned by the European Union and by the Presidency."
"In terms of the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum, I would like to answer Mrs Flautre - although I have no doubt that Mrs Isler Béguin will let her know what I said - by saying that the difference with this Pact is that there is better coordination; harmonisation, if you will, particularly in terms of asylum applications and in terms of applications made by migrants."
"The Pact actually clarifies the status of migrants, which represents progress for them."
"We would actually prefer a more pragmatic vision, a more balanced approach, an approach that can be interpreted in the context of the enlargement of the Schengen Agreement."
"The demographic crisis, the demographic challenge, is also one of the challenges that we must face under the French Presidency."
"Finally - and this point is crucial, because everything boils down to this - these crises are interdependent."
"These crises are interlinked."
"The economic and financial crisis is the most visible."
"However, three months ago, it was the energy crisis."
"In any case, we still face a food crisis, we still face an external crisis."
"I will say it again, to respond to these crises, to respond to these challenges, there needs to be more Europe, more coordination, greater capacity for decision-making, more visibility and more responsiveness."
"The answer to this is more institution, and the way that we will have more institution is through the Treaty of Lisbon."
"We must ensure that the treaty comes into force soon."
"We must find a solution with our Irish friends."
"We will use our best efforts so that, by the end of the year, we have a political solution to this institutional problem, which, when we look at the challenges that we face and that we have debated all afternoon, must be resolved as a matter of urgency."
"Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I will start with the end of Mr Jouyet's speech."
"As President Barroso said in his opening speech, the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty is essential in order for us to move forward with European integration, especially at a time like this."
"Some of you have mentioned aspects of external action and the common foreign and security policy: Georgia."
"The Lisbon Treaty will enable us to increase the effectiveness and the intensity of our action in such important matters for our own security and defending our values outside our borders as in the case of Georgia and other countries."
"Some of you have quite rightly mentioned the importance of the debates on energy and climate change that are going to take place in the European Council."
"The French Presidency supports the Commission's ambitious package of proposals, which we hope will be adopted and implemented."
"The Lisbon Treaty will give the European institutions - not just the Commission - increased powers to tackle this very important challenge."
"Some of you have quite rightly mentioned immigration, the immigration pact, a commendable initiative by the French Presidency, along with some other Member States."
"The Commission has also made proposals during recent times on immigration, which have been discussed and adopted, or are being discussed and adopted by the Parliament and the Council."
"Once again, the Lisbon Treaty will enable the European Union to move forward towards a common immigration policy, which is essential."
"Finally, the majority of the speeches have focused, naturally enough, on economic and financial matters, which we are particularly concerned about at the moment."
"I agree with you, with the Presidency, and, of course, with the President of the Commission in his opening speech, that we need to step up the concerted action of all of us who have responsibilities in Europe."
"There are responsibilities in the Commission, without any doubt, there are responsibilities in the Council, there are responsibilities in Parliament, there are responsibilities in the Member States, in the supervisory bodies and in the central banks."
"We all need to act in a coordinated way, each according to our responsibilities."
"For a year, since the beginning of the crisis, the Commission has been developing initiatives to tackle the future of our financial system, with a medium-term vision, as discussed and adopted a year ago by the Council and the Commission, in the informal Council meeting in Oporto and the Ecofin meeting in October last year."
"However, the Commission is also actively participating in the short-term, urgent, essential measures that are part of the conclusions of the Ecofin Council yesterday, including a commitment to improve deposit guarantee schemes, which are seriously affected, not by the insecurity of deposits in financial institutions, but by some unilateral initiatives with negative impacts for other countries."
"The Commission is cooperating and also working to develop and apply the principles established yesterday in the Ecofin conclusions, which are essential in terms of the way in which the difficult situations in each of the financial institutions should be tackled: through recapitalisation and, in some cases, through other instruments."
"The Commission is working, as President Barroso has said, to move forward more quickly than we have been up to now in terms of supervision at European level, at cross-border level, which we obviously need."
"We have all had experience in recent days of the need for these mechanisms."
"The Commission, like the Council and Parliament, is satisfied with the speed with which the European Central Bank and other central banks have acted today, with a coordinated reduction in interest rates, which should relieve some of the tension in the market."
"I fully agree with Mr Purvis on the need to adopt measures, each within our responsibilities, to facilitate the recovery of the interbank market."
"This is essential."
"We cannot contemplate only having the central banks as a source of liquidity in the functioning of the financial system in the future and, of course, the Commission - and I am responding in particular to a speech by Mrs in't Veld - said in front of the Heads of State and Government in Paris on Saturday, and said again yesterday at the Ecofin meeting, that when it comes to regulating State aid, the Treaty has sufficient clauses and provisions to deal flexibly with compliance with competition rules and the rules on State aid in a situation such as we are facing now."
"Either today or tomorrow, my colleague, Commissioner Kroes, is going to publish, as she announced yesterday in the Ecofin Council, guidelines on how the Commission considers that the margins for flexibility in the Treaty can be used on this specific point, while avoiding discrimination between different solutions and different types of aid."
"She will also refer - and some of you have also mentioned this - to the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"We revised it in 2005 and from then onwards, as I believe I also said here the other day in another debate, the consensus on the implementation of the revised Pact has been total, one hundred percent."
"Yesterday, again, the Ecofin Council, as on Saturday in the meeting in Paris, unanimously agreed to say that the current Pact, as revised in 2005 - and Parliament also took part in that debate and in that consensus - has sufficient room to manoeuvre to deal with the situations that are beginning to occur and are unfortunately going to continue to occur, such as the increase in public deficits."
"This can be done within the framework of the established rules, not by putting them aside."
"This was clear on Saturday in Paris, it was clear yesterday at the Ecofin meeting, and it is clear here, in today's debate, and I assure you that the Commission is going to ensure that it is clear from now on, even though we are going to experience very difficult circumstances, not only in the financial system but also in the real economy."
"Tomorrow we are going to Washington, to the Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund."
"The IMF's forecasts have once again been revised downwards."
"Our forecasts in a few weeks are going to be revised downwards."
"This is not just an exercise in economic forecasting, a theoretical exercise; unfortunately, it means less growth, less employment, greater tension in the employment market and, along with the inflationary pressure that we are still suffering from, although it has calmed down in the last two months, it means a loss of purchasing power and difficulties for real citizens."
"However, this should not cause us to forget the medium term."
"It should not cause us to forget the lessons we learned in past crises."
"I think that, with this spirit, the vast majority of the speeches that I have heard this afternoon reinforce, support and agree with the consensus that we reached yesterday - which I think was a very positive consensus - in the Luxembourg Ecofin meeting."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place during the next part-session."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (FR) I would first of all like to congratulate the President-in-Office of the Council, Nicolas Sarkozy, for his pragmatic and effective measures, and the excellent work of the French Presidency, represented today by my friend Mr Jouyet."
"The European Union was formed amid the suffering caused by war."
"It seems destined to continue amid suffering and crises."
"These crises - the Caucasus crisis in Georgia, the financial crisis, the failure of the WTO - show how much we need the new-look institutions that the Lisbon Treaty gives us, and particularly a permanent presidency of the EU."
"On the subject of the financial crisis, the ECB has just decided to cut interest rates, and I welcome this decision."
"It has finally awakened from its indifference; it should learn a lesson from the failure of its monetary policy, since nothing would be worse than increasing rates again once economic growth returns."
"There is a growing need for the Commission, based on Article 105(6) of the EC Treaty, to refer the matter to the Council so that it can give the ECB a policy mandate for the prudential supervision of credit institutions with a view to establishing a European banking regulator."
"in writing. - On 24 September I was asking in a written statement if Europe is prepared to absorb the shock induced by its indissoluble link with the US market and if the EUR 36.3 billion injected into the market by the ECB and Bank of England is enough to make the danger disappear."
"A few days later Fortis Bank and Dexia Bank were also caught in the stream of the financial crises."
"Furthermore, Iceland's banking system hit the ground (culminating with acquisition by the government of Glitnir Bank) and the UK Government announced further money infusion (GBP 200 billion) in its economy."
"The events that have occurred so far provided an answer to my question that was posted as a rhetorical one."
"Now, what is going to happen next?"
"We know by now the financial institutions that were hit."
"The big ones."
"What we do not know is who else was hit and keeps the thrash hidden."
"What about the dozens of regional US banks who were involved in lending easy money in the housing sector?"
"What about the European banks who could not stay far from investing in all kind of US exotic financial instruments that invaded the markets this decade?"
"Despite the somewhat emotional words on the financial crisis and related crises, basic measures to deal effectively with these crises are still not forthcoming."
"Even when some ad-hoc measures that were rejected only a few months ago are accepted, such as the nationalisations of banks that have gone bankrupt due to poor management on the part of their administrators and some of their main shareholders, who have pocketed the substantial profits and gains and left the general public to deal with the damage, this is always done in defence of big business, without really taking into account the interests of workers and the least well-off."
"They do not tackle the root of the issue."
"They do not abolish tax havens."
"They do not scrap the false independence of the European Central Bank."
"They do not do away with the Stability Pact. They do not adopt a Solidarity and Social Progress Pact."
"The ECB lowered its own base rate too late, after a short-sightedness that has already cost the more fragile economies and those who are in debt to the banks dearly."
"In this way, the issues that are on the table are of prime importance and call into question the neoliberal policies that gave utmost priority to free competition, worsening exploitation of workers and multiplying the problems of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises."
"There needs to be a clear break with these neoliberal policies at the next Council."
"in writing. - (RO) Apart from its trans-national character, the current global financial crisis risks creating a state of major panic very rapidly, not only in the financial, banking and economic sectors, but also at the level of the ordinary European citizen."
"I believe that, even more than the severity of the economic phenomenon which must be kept under control both financially and economically, the danger of having European citizens being stricken by panic is much more difficult to measure and its effects will need a much longer time to heal."
"Therefore, I am making a public appeal to you, in your capacity as presidents, and ask that you, whatever steps you take to directly, immediately and efficiently solve the current economic and financial crisis, make sure that such steps are transparent to European public opinion, so that citizens feel protected by the European Union, whose aim was precisely to provide a protective framework in cases of grave emergency."
"If we do not manage to strengthen European trust and solidarity now, we face the danger of seeing everything that we have consolidated with difficulty over the past 50 years disappear."
"We should not count on a single meeting of the European Council solving the problems of the financial markets."
"The Council's aim should rather be to look for ways of making European banking systems more secure."
"There is no doubt that the current involvement of national governments is necessary at this time, but it will surely not replace joint actions at the level of the EU as a whole."
"What is of particular importance today is the avoidance of any populist auction of promises and protection of citizens from the extreme cynicism of certain politicians."
"This cynicism is based on peddling pessimism while calling on other politicians to do something."
"If the dark prophecies are fulfilled, the cynics will say: did we not tell you so?"
"If the worst-case scenarios do not come to pass, the pseudo-saviours will say: we wanted to be cautious; in situations like this it is better to blow cold."
"Now the cynics are rubbing their hands with glee at having come up with a no-lose stratagem."
"This glee is evidence of extreme irresponsibility and a denial of fundamental values of democratic policy - prudent care for the common good."
"It may even be that the greatest danger to Europeans' wallets is this very cynicism."
"It is also interesting that this fake concern for the future of citizens is proclaimed by those who are making efforts to block the new European Treaty and do not like the idea of a common currency."
"I hope there will be no false prophets at the Council meeting. Thank you very much."
"in writing. - The global financial crisis will rightly top the agenda of the October Council."
"The crisis is man made - from the USA to the EU and beyond, the meltdown in the banking and financial sector is as shocking as it is real."
"There is a sense of disbelief that the unthinkable - namely the collapse of the banking system - is now upon us."
"The demise of individual banks and dramatic intervention of governments to shore up the fragile financial sectors has resulted in great public unease about the ability of politicians to protect them against such eventualities."
"Banks do not want regulation, and it is now clear that regulation was weak and ineffective in protecting not just the banking customers but the very institutions themselves."
"Yet, when times got tough for the banks, they ran to the politicians to rescue them."
"So it is up to us to seize this moment and place the power back where it should always have resided, and that is in the political system, rather than in the financial markets."
"in writing. - (FI) The United States of America has gone down with mad money disease."
"Its symptoms are bank collapses, the socialisation of banks and insurance companies, and a junk bank used for the socialisation of debts and as a landfill site for bank waste."
"The crisis shows that capital needs the state for purposes other than just going to war in far-off foreign lands: in America's case, Iraq and Afghanistan."
"The good side to the crisis, caused as it was by cheap 'funny' money, is that the United States cannot now afford new wars."
"It looks bad when a superpower is flummoxed because its esteem in the eyes of others slumps."
"That is how it has gone for the United States: many are of the opinion that, as a superpower, it has suffered the fate of the Soviet Union."
"All of America's political and economic resources will be needed to extinguish the fire at the bank that was ignited with cheap money, debt and speculation."
"This is no longer just a matter of the economy, however: the giant that stood on a pile of securities has seen its authority collapse."
"Preening America, winner of an ideological struggle, is no longer credible in the victor's role."
"The statements of the Council and the Commission, and the positions adopted by the political representatives of capital during debates in the run-up to the EU Council summit, signal a stepping-up of the anti-popular policy on management of the capitalist economic crisis."
"The crisis is spreading inexorably through EU Member States and developed countries generally, laying the EU's reactionary nature even barer."
"These statements, the state-monopoly interventions announced by Ecofin and the bourgeois governments of the EU Member States, as well as the bailing out of the debt-ridden banks and other monopoly business groups with public money, are measures to support EU capital in a bid to shore up the monopolies' economic and political dominance."
"This proves that capitalism has no answers when it comes to the peoples' interests."
"Faced with the risk of crisis, the EU and the bourgeois governments of its Member States are intensifying their attack on the working class and the masses."
"The peoples of Europe have nothing to expect from the EU summit conference."
"The only way ahead for the workers is to disobey and break with the anti-popular policy of the EU, and the bourgeois governments of its Member States."
"Lamfalussy follow up - Future Structure of Supervision (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Ieke van den Burg and Daniel Dăianu, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on Lamfalussy follow-up: future structure of supervision."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, since 2002 I have been dealing with the issue of stability and supervision on the financial markets."
"Already at that time, in a report for Parliament on prudential supervision, I pleaded for a strong system of European supervision comparable to the European system of central banks."
"Thank God we have the euro and the ECB in these turbulent times, but it is all the more embarrassing that we do not have this strong supervisory architecture."
"At the time I could not get a majority of Parliament behind a revolutionary reform; everyone was speaking about evolution."
"Nevertheless, when I have spoken over the years with a number of supervisors and other high-level representatives from the industry and supervision, people told me: 'We cannot say this publicly, but you are right that something more has to happen; a real crisis situation will show that this is not sufficient'."
"So we needed a crisis to create the sense of urgency."
"Needless to say, I would have preferred to avoid such a crisis and I wish that we had been better prepared."
"But the crisis is there now and the tsunami that Mr McCreevy still did not want to look at some weeks ago, when we dealt with the Rasmussen and Lehne reports, is there and it is unprecedentedly heavy, I would say."
"I would now expect this momentum to be there, but I am disappointed and embarrassed that what we are doing in the European Union is too little, too late."
"The whole world is watching but we are not managing to really get a common approach."
"Even economists and commentators that were the cheerleaders of this wonderful innovative financial engineering that should not be hindered by regulation are almost unanimous in their disappointment at what Europe's leaders have done so far."
"I could refer to the editorial in yesterday's Financial Times for instance, where they say: 'Thus far, Europe's leaders have displayed a purely declaratory brand of unity, jointly proclaiming that they will each take care of the problems in their own back yards.'"
"So the Financial Times also concluded that we need a conductor and not only solo singers."
"Tomorrow I think there is an opportunity for Parliament to show that we not only sing our own arias of regret and anger and play the blame game, but we can make a real contribution constructively to establish leadership and pick up on very concrete proposals that the European Commission could immediately initiate."
"It may look quite technical for many other Members of Parliament but I can assure you that these have been well thought through and well prepared by us in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"It only needs leadership and courage from you, Commissioner, to give the green light and to start up the process."
"You should not listen too much to the City lobbyists keeping you from doing things, and of course you should listen to experts - but the political responsibility is with you to take these initiatives."
"Mr Barroso has already mentioned some short-term measures."
"I am happy with what he said about a wise persons' group but, here again, this was something that we in Parliament proposed two years ago, and we did not get your support for this."
"In relation to the CRD proposals, the measures for the credit-rating agencies: it is not quite clear to me what measures you are going to present on the recommendation on executive pay."
"Here, I hope, you are not listening only to the weak proposals of the Ecofin Council but that you are prepared to move a bit further."
"Finally, on the supervision: it is not only long-term measures for the wise persons' group; we should already start with something now."
"Concerning my Amendments 5, 6 and 7: I hope there will be support for a proposal which immediately leads to an independent chair and vice-chair for the European supervisory structure."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, I am going to use this moment just to say a few words on issues which seem to frame the public debate on regulation and supervision."
"Firstly, free markets are not synonymous with no regulations."
"A lax monetary policy can lead to higher inflation and eventually to recession but cannot by itself cause the meltdown of a financial system."
"The features of the financial system that have brought the threat of collapse are structural traits of the new financial system."
"The root cause of this crisis is an inadequately regulated financial system."
"Mortgages are not toxic per se; badly constructed securities based on them are toxic."
"The packaging of financial products can bring a lot of opacity to markets."
"Compensation schemes that make behaviour irresponsible: that is toxic."
"Misleading models are toxic; extreme leveraging is bad."
"Not to address these problems would be terribly wrong."
"Not all financial innovation is benign."
"It is baffling therefore to hear that fresh regulation is bad because it would stifle financial innovation."
"Building up proper regulation and supervision is not about bringing in socialism."
"It is about what kind of market economies we want to live in."
"That may lead to the recreation of elements of state capitalism, I agree, and that is for discussion."
"Relying on industry-led initiatives is quite insufficient, for such initiatives frequently serve vested interests."
"Why is it that we fail to learn from previous crises?"
"Clearly, vested interests can have a long arm and try to influence regulations and supervision, including the behaviour of people like us."
"Do moral values matter?"
"Yes, I believe they do matter."
"The mess that we are in today is also because some believed that moral values do not matter in business."
"Regulators and supervisors should understand that there are systemic risks."
"They should always be alert to financial stability."
"Strains and crises cannot be entirely avoided, but we can limit the damage they cause."
"We need comprehensive answers to crises and genuine coordination among the EU, US and other major financial centres, particularly during bad times."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, let me start my remarks with the situation on financial markets."
"We are in the most serious crisis in living memory."
"What started as a sub-prime crisis has now moved way beyond this to embrace the whole economy."
"Fears about the ability to raise financing are creating even greater lack of confidence among all economic actors."
"Unless there is a rapid unfreezing of lending, we face a continued downward spiral with obvious impact on economic activity."
"Freeing up lending is the number one priority today."
"The measures taken by central banks today will be an important contribution to unblocking the flow of lending."
"One thing we have seen over the past few weeks is that no economy or financial market is immune from what is taking place."
"At ECOFIN yesterday the concern of Finance Ministers was evident."
"We recognised the need for governments to intervene to shore up the financial markets, whether it be by capital injections, guarantees or other means."
"There is no silver bullet here."
"Strong, fast responses are essential."
"For its part, the Commission is showing its capacity to respond quickly."
"I will be bringing to the college next week amendments to the deposit guarantee scheme which will increase the minimum level of protection, as well as requiring Member States to put in place procedures for rapid pay-out."
"At Ecofin yesterday it was agreed that Member States would increase the current level to at least EUR 50 000, with many going beyond this to EUR 100 000."
"This reflects to a degree the differences in average savings in Member States."
"In addition, we are urgently putting into place changes to our accounting rules to ensure banks in the EU can avail themselves of the same flexibility that is offered to banks in the United States, namely the option for individual banks, if they wish, to move assets from their trading books to their banking books."
"This is a comitology measure to which I hope Parliament will be able to give its agreement as a matter of urgency."
"In the mean time, I would hope that national supervisors would apply these new provisions already so that banks who wish to could avail themselves of this new possibility for their third-quarter results."
"In addition there is the IASB's acceptance of the US SEC's clarification of the use of fair-value accounting when there is no active market information."
"This is also highly relevant for banks and should be used for third-quarter reporting."
"We are, of course, continuing to work for the rapid implementation of the Ecofin road map to strengthen the European Union's capacity to prevent and manage future financial crises."
"Overall the implementation of these initiatives is on track."
"In times of crisis, politicians need to be seen to do things so as to reassure the public."
"Things are no different here in Brussels, except that our margin for manoeuvre is more limited."
"We do not have access to the financial resources that are necessary to combat this crisis."
"It is central banks and finance ministers who control the purse strings."
"What we have do is endeavour to maximise a common approach by Member States."
"There can be no doubt that, by working together, Member States are in a much stronger position to counteract the downward spiral we are currently in."
"We must continue to assist Member States to work towards common goals and shared approaches."
"Where we have the tools, we will continue to move forward quickly with any necessary measure."
"Turning now to your report on the 'Lamfalussy follow-up and future structure of supervision', I would like to congratulate the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee - in particular Mrs van den Burg and Mr Dăianu - for their excellent work in producing such a thought-provoking and wide-ranging report."
"It highlights many of the challenges facing us now in the context of the current financial crisis."
"Innovative and well-thought-through proposals for regulatory and supervisory reform are crucially needed in the current situation."
"You include in your report quite a demanding list of recommendations of where legislative action will be needed."
"It is heartening to see that so many of the issues you highlight are those that the Commission is also prioritising."
"In many cases, work is either ongoing or is planned on initiatives corresponding to the recommendations."
"Let me mention here some of our most important ongoing initiatives, such as the Solvency II proposal, the proposals for revisions to the Capital Requirements Directive, which was adopted by the college of Commissioners last week, and the legislative proposal on credit-rating agencies, due shortly."
"This reflects many of the recommendations put forward in your report."
"The proposal for amendments to the Capital Requirements Directive covers critical areas and will fundamentally strengthen the regulatory framework for EU banks and the financial system."
"I hope you will fully support us on this. Reaching agreement by next April is essential."
"Soon we will also go forward with a proposal on credit-rating agencies."
"The proposal will aim to introduce a legally binding authorisation and robust external oversight regime, whereby European regulators will have to supervise the policies and procedures followed by the credit-rating agencies."
"The Committee of European Securities Regulators (CESR) will play a strong coordination role."
"On the EU supervisory framework, we are working on a revision of the Commission's decisions establishing the three committees of supervisors."
"By the end of the year, these committees will be assigned specific, practical tasks, such as (i) mediation, (ii) drafting recommendations and guidelines, and (iii) an explicit role to strengthen the analysis and responsiveness to risks to the stability of the EU financial system."
"Also, we have now to think about the longer-term vision of European supervision."
"Current events are showing its limitations today."
"The European Central Bank's handling of the crisis has been exemplary."
"We now have to reflect seriously on how our supervisory arrangements for the cross-border financial institutions are constructed."
"As President Barroso announced earlier, we want to establish a high-level group to work through the various options and make recommendations on how we should proceed."
"This takes up the suggestion in your report of a high-level group to tackle European supervisory arrangements."
"I have been around here long enough to know that agreement on reforms to supervisory arrangements will not be easy."
"But if we do not draw the lessons from the current crisis, then we are doing a great disservice to the European Union."
"This reflection should not blind us to the necessity to take the pragmatic steps to strengthen supervision that we have put forward in the Solvency II proposal and in the Capital Requirements Directive."
"Colleges of supervisors are essential."
"The time ahead will be fraught."
"All of us have to take our respective responsibilities."
"Now is the time for us to show that, by working together, we can confront the challenges."
"I look forward to the strong support of Parliament in this regard."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, I think it was Mrs Tumpel-Gugerell who said in Nice in mid-September that the worst mistake we made was not to include the financial supervisory architecture into the Maastricht Treaty. We should have dealt with this issue already, together with EMU final phase decisions."
"I completely agree with this view, and Mrs Tumpel-Gugerell is definitely not the only one who has said this."
"But whom are we to blame for the lack of progress on supervisory architecture?"
"I do not think it is the Community soldiers we need to blame - and by Community soldiers I mean the European Commission, which has delivered, and also Parliament: as Mrs van den Burg said, we have been dealing with this issue since the beginning of 2000, and we have made several proposals to the Council, but the Council seems totally reluctant to move."
"I still wonder how it was possible to have the Lamfalussy regime in place."
"Maybe it was the deal between the UK and Germany to offer the CESR location to Paris which finally made the difference, but I think that in Council they have been totally unwilling to move forward on this issue."
"So now it is the right time; maybe it is too limited and too late, but at least something is also now being done in the Council."
"Parliament has made several very important proposals."
"In order of priority, these three are the most important:"
"First, the mandatory colleges for all cross-border financial institutions, with legally binding rules on how they operate, how they share information and what kind of decision-making procedures they use."
"Second, improved legal status for the Level 3 Committees, and more effective working methods for them too."
"Maybe on this issue, the Commission could give a little bit more room for manoeuvre to Level 3 Committees, so that they would not only be consultative but also decision-making bodies in the future."
"And third, strengthening the role of the ECB in financial stability."
"The ECB should get more information."
"It should be linked to CESR and CEOPS and they should work more together."
"Finally I want to say something about the transatlantic dialogue."
"Now is not a good time to put the transatlantic financial services on hold."
"I know this is not the fault of the Commission but it mainly depends now on US actions, but I think the more you can do to keep that discussion going, the better it is."
"It is very important for the future..."
"(The President cut off the speaker.)"
"Mr President, we cannot shut our eyes to this."
"The current crisis has revealed a lack of supervision and economic governance in the financial markets."
"Citizens are very clear that identifying risks and preventing them is much better than correcting them when they have resulted in imbalances and caused damage to the financial markets and to the real economy."
"The times when a large proportion of these financial markets operated in an opaque, uncontrolled manner, abandoned to the irresponsible games of imprudent or unscrupulous operators need to come to an end."
"Free movement of capital, Economic and Monetary Union, the growing complexity in the field of financial services and globalisation demand that we go beyond a national supervisory framework."
"We need to move towards European supervision."
"The European Union cannot be absent from and left out of new concepts such as macro supervision, systemic risks, global financial stability, and the need to participate in global economic governance."
"We therefore need to move towards European supervision and do so in a decisive way."
"Not to do so will be a serious strategic error at a time when global power is changing."
"We will need to overcome inertia in order to break the deadlock on Solvency II, and we will therefore have to rectify and accept an integrated European approach."
"In order to ensure consistency and fairness in resolving differences between authorities or between the different financial sectors we need to abandon unilateralism and progress towards a genuinely operational European system."
"The differences between two authorities cannot be solved through a decision made by only one of them; it is not possible to be both judge and interested party at the same time."
"I therefore fervently support the van den Burg and Dǎianu report."
"I am grateful that my amendments have been taken into consideration and have inspired some of the compromises, and I hope that their most ambitious proposals will triumph."
"This will be good for our citizens and essential for the financial markets."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at the start of this decade, Baron Lamfalussy presented a report in which he suggested ways in which supervisory authorities in Europe could cooperate better and more intensively."
"At the time, the Council welcomed these suggestions, but did nothing about them."
"If the financial crisis that we are currently experiencing has a positive side, then perhaps it is that the topic of improving supervision has moved to the top of the agenda."
"It is surprising, however, that it takes a report from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs according to Rule 39 for the Commission to start to tackle this topic seriously."
"What is certain is that we can face the challenges of an integrated and growing financial market successfully only if supervision develops increasing convergence and becomes increasingly integrated."
"In the meantime, 58 of the 100 financial conglomerates are now active across borders."
"That statistic alone shows how much has to be done!"
"The report by the two rapporteurs points in the right direction."
"Mrs Kauppi alluded to it: the wide-ranging establishment of colleges to supervise cross-border financial conglomerates; the strengthening of the Level 3 committees."
"That is fine, but it should also be remembered that the small Member States are often represented in these colleges only as a host country supervisor and that it is therefore important to take proper account of their interests."
"In the short and medium term there are probably no other ways to improve the situation; in the medium to long term it will not be enough."
"We must have a system that earns the right to be called a European supervisor, and this system should align itself with that of the European central banks."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE. - (FR) Madam President, Commissioner, I said earlier on behalf of my group that we supported the conclusions of the Ecofin Council."
"I notice that the stock markets have plummeted again today, and that markets across Europe have gone into freefall."
"These measures are therefore insufficient."
"On the question of responsibility, I agree with Mrs Kauppi on the fact that there has effectively been a great deal of resistance in the Council, but it is clear that the Commission - yourself in particular - has never been a fan, to put it mildly, of more regulation at European level."
"Your entire tenure has been dominated by this idea of industry self-regulation."
"This is why we are lagging far behind in terms of European legislation on the topics under discussion today."
"In terms of the report that will be put to the vote tomorrow, my group will support all of the amendments tabled, particularly by the rapporteur Mrs van den Burg."
"From our point of view, these also try to ensure that there will be more binding provisions on securitisation and the mechanisms that hinder speculation."
"They mean that the Lamfalussy Level 3 Committees are almost a forerunner of this European supervision, of the European supervisor that we want."
"This is the direction that we would like to move in, and I believe that the Commission, which has a monopoly on legislative initiative, has failed in its duty during this legislature."
"From this point of view, grandstanding is all very well, but you have very little time in which to get up to speed."
"Madam President, I appreciate the co-rapporteurs' willingness to work towards a consensus on this report."
"It is still not perfect as far as I am concerned - they will probably be pleased to hear that! - but it is much more appropriate than it was, and I feel we can be justified in supporting it."
"I raise two particular points."
"Securitisation is seen as one of the demons of the current financial crisis, and now it seems to be seen as a necessary solution that we require originators to retain a percentage of their products."
"The Commission is proposing 5% in its capital adequacy review."
"We must at the very least have an impact assessment of this idea."
"I hazard to suggest that the only result will be to clog up the financial markets, and investors may even be tempted to omit full due diligence because of it."
"What really matters is being able to trace back originators through intermediate repackages and hold them to account for any misrepresentation, negligence or incompetence."
"And the second matter is the way of settling disputes or disagreements in the colleges of supervisors."
"The rapporteurs have suggested a rather complex and formal appeal process with chairmen and vice-chairmen and a new bureaucracy."
"Surely such situations must be resolved quickly, and we have proposed therefore that the parties to any disagreement which cannot be resolved amicably should agree mutually on a mediator whose decision, at least in our view, should be final."
"Lastly, Commissioner, I appreciate the introduction that you gave to your speech on the present crisis and am sorry you were not present during the previous debate with Mr Almunia and Mr Jouyet, when all these matters were represented by the Members of this Parliament, including myself."
"Maybe you can read through those speeches at great length and give us a response to our points of view."
"Madam President, this report is ambitious but also realistic."
"It analyses the causes of the financial turmoil and proposes future changes."
"Many of these changes, as others have said, would have been suggested without the present situation, because there was already a view that the Lamfalussy process had not progressed as far as it could or should have done."
"So this is about the next generation of supervision, rather than a fix for the current crisis - though we think it will help prevent any similar occurrence, and now there should be more willingness at Member State level to have formal integrated decision-making structures."
"But I reiterate that it is important for regulation to be smart."
"The solution to our current problems, and the calmer future when it arrives, will not take the form of regulatory spam with thousands of compliance tick boxes, which, as we now know, causes it to be pushed off to specialist departments to do the ticking, without proper 'hands-on' at board level."
"We should have clear, simple rules."
"Some, yes, fuller in scope, but rules that do not swamp the big picture, so that those at the top are properly accountable and know what is going on."
"Finally, as part of crisis resolution, we need improvements on winding up, but that is not just in crisis situations: we also need to look at cross-border winding up in normal times."
"Here again we may need to tread on territory that makes Member States uncomfortable, but it has to be faced."
"Madame la Présidente, first of all allow me to disagree with those saying that we are not able to deliver an EU-wide response to the financial crisis."
"We responded by bold actions at national level where they were needed."
"Because our national financial markets differ, we have room for manoeuvre in stressful times, taking into account the different level and scope of our financial markets in Member States."
"In Vilnius we do not have a City, so our actions are different."
"Somehow I am not surprised that the Commission proposals are based on the needs of cross-border financial groups;"
"I have been a Member of the European Parliament for five years."
"What does surprise me is that the Commission cannot figure out that the cross-border group model cannot survive during downturns in the economy."
"We are witnessing this now."
"Business leaders have to come up with plans to modernise their model by adding flexibility at subsidiary levels, to reflect the diversity of needs of the real EU economy."
"The EU supervision and regulation system has to ensure the smooth restructuring of the financial industry."
"The starting point for reform has to be an answer to the question: 'Which treasury will pay for the bail-out bill in the end?'"
"This is in the interest of the stability of the whole European Union."
"However, I would like to ask my colleagues not to forget one small neighbour of the European Union which is closely related to us - Iceland."
"We have left them on their own."
"(SV) Madam President, Europe is now feeling the full brunt of the financial crisis."
"The decision taken yesterday by Europe's Finance Ministers on a common minimum level for deposit guarantees is an important step, as are the rescue operations being undertaken by individual banks."
"Today's coordinated interest rate cuts by several central banks are necessary to restore confidence in the financial markets."
"These measures are targeted and must resolve a crisis here and now."
"We decision-makers also need to take responsibility for ensuring that the market functions in the long term."
"This means that we must adopt a methodical and clear approach when we introduce new legislation so that it also creates good prospects for growth."
"The importance of impact analyses is no less as a result of the financial crisis; on the contrary they are even more vital now."
"The proposals which have been presented here in the Lamfalussy process mean better coordination of European supervision and are an important step towards a better European market."
"I would like to thank both colleagues, in particular Ieke van den Burg, who has done a magnificent job for many years and has been extremely persistent. That is a good thing in politicians!"
"The proposals build on already existing systems which must also be improved and made more effective without checking the economy."
"We must not confuse our responsibility for reacting quickly and managing the crisis with an even greater responsibility - that our rules must work, not only in this crisis period but also for the benefit of Europe's future growth."
"Protectionism is never the answer and this is not the end of the global economy."
"Madam President, I should like to welcome Commissioner McCreevy."
"I have listened to many colleagues' reaction to the Irish response to our banking confidence crisis and liquidity problems and the follow-through from other countries in the days since, because, having criticised the Irish, they then had to follow on."
"It is more than ironic that we now debate today the supervisory architecture for financial services in Europe. I do not know if you could call it a happy coincidence or too little, too late."
"Would things have been so much different if we had had some sort of supervisory architecture in place, particularly in terms of the rating agencies?"
"It seems to me, when you go back to the first base, that they are really the cause of many of the problems."
"They allowed the sub-prime crisis to get out of control by continuing to give strong ratings to institutions that had packaged these devious products and sold them on."
"Hence the problem we have with us today."
"Let us be sure that our response reflects cool heads and proper thinking, given the crisis within which we are talking."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, when, if not now, will it be necessary to improve European supervision?"
"All the omens are clear: there is a need for action and we have something to do here."
"The provisions for monitoring the stability of the financial markets are critical."
"We need stricter monitoring regulations for macroeconomic policy and financial market supervision, particularly by the European Central Bank."
"Key parameters for making decisions via qualified majority voting in the colleges of supervisors dealing with a cross-border institution in the European authorities are critical."
"Naturally, we must work on a case-by-case basis when it comes to dealing with and assessing the size of the Member States."
"A smaller country must not be swamped by a larger country."
"There needs to be a structure at EU level, backed up by legislation, to run the blockades and resolve conflicts between national and sectoral supervisors."
"We must make use of all the management options at Level 3 in order to create a better architecture."
"(PL) Madam President, the main reason for the current collapse in the financial sector is the irresponsibility of financial institutions, unsuitable risk management, bad loans and allowing excessive debts to arise without proper guarantees, which has ultimately led to a loss of liquidity."
"The entire supervision system was also ineffective."
"It seems that the current solutions are failing to keep pace with the rate of change in global finance."
"We therefore need to bring them up to date, to soften the potential consequences of further crises in the future."
"Bearing in mind the current difficult situation in the financial markets, we should give absolute priority to legislative work to establish cohesive and effective means of supervision."
"At the same time, in recognising the fact of increasing integration and growing dependences between individual financial markets, we need to ensure maximum compatibility between the new European system and the American, Japanese and Chinese systems."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, can I briefly respond to a few points made."
"One relates to the previous debate, referred to by Mr Purvis."
"I was not invited to the previous debate."
"I would seldom pass up an opportunity of coming to the European Parliament to hear regular fans of mine on the Left praise my contribution to all things European."
"I could never miss an opportunity to hear people as eminent as Mr Schulz and Mrs Berès and many others speak about me in such glowing terms, so if I had been invited I would have gladly been here."
"Regarding European solutions, I should like to give two examples."
"My predecessor initiated an item regarding pay; this was issued in the form of a recommendation, which is possibly the one of the softest instruments that the EU has at its disposal."
"That was the only chance it had of having anything accepted, because the competence in this regard lies with Member States."
"We produced a report about a year and a half ago, but only one Member State has implemented most of the recommendations."
"The others have, by and large, ignored it."
"The Member State that implemented it - to give credit where credit is due - was Holland."
"I am not saying it has implemented every exact letter of it, but it is the only Member State that has gone down that particular road."
"So a European solution was there."
"A lot of comment is being made at the present time about the bonus culture and executive remuneration."
"We tried to come forward with a type of European solution, which was put forward by Mr Bolkestein - I think it was technically me who put it into effect but I give credit to Mr Bolkestein for initiating it."
"That is what we did, and that is what our report shows."
"Secondly, regarding supervision - the main subject of this report - I have spoken on many occasions in the Parliament and elsewhere about the issue of the cross-border supervision of financial institutions."
"I have spoken at Ecofin and at press conferences."
"It is practically impossible to move forward on this particular issue because Member States do not want us to have a European solution to this."
"However, I should like to point something out to Members of the European Parliament."
"Last year I initiated the Solvency II proposal regarding insurance, and advanced the idea of colleges of supervisors, group supervision and group support."
"Both in the Council of Ministers and in the negotiations with the European Parliament, it has been watered down considerably."
"If we are to get this directive through in the lifetime of this particular legislature, a lot of heavy lifting will have to be done with the Council of Ministers because there are large divergences, not only on those particular items but on other items as well."
"Although I have been in politics for all of my adult life, and have ceased to be amazed at contradictory positions that politicians may adopt - and no doubt, if you look over my long political career, you might find some of them as well - I still find it totally ironic and amazing that, when we advocate a European solution, for example regarding supervision to do with Solvency II, the people who advocate European responses - both Ministers and Members of the European Parliament - are often the same people who come back and lobby for their own national state positions when a particular piece of legislation comes before them."
"Those of us who were brought up in the Catholic religion know the prayer of Saint Augustine which says more or less, 'Make me pure, but not just yet'."
"It is a bit similar here."
"This does not surprise me because I have been a politician for all of my adult life so I am used to that type of irony, to put it in its politest terms."
"Be that as it may, there are only 44 or 45 cross-border financial institutions and we have a supervisory system which is way out of date for such operations."
"Finally, may I make this point regarding the current crisis, which I have spoken about here and in other forums including press conferences."
"There is not one single magic bullet solution to all of this."
"If there had been, it would have been found long ago."
"These are unprecedented times and unprecedented responses have been given, both on this side of the Atlantic and in the United States."
"Can I just remind Members here - and I am sure President Barroso did so as well in his contribution - that we in the European Commission do our best to coordinate and encourage Member States to give a total response."
"But, as I said in my opening remarks, these responsibilities lie with Member States, with Member States' central bankers and with Member States' ministries, because they are the elected people."
"They are the people who are in control of taxpayers' monies and they are the people who must give the responses."
"We have attempted - and we have succeeded somewhat - to get a European response in some of these particular areas."
"May I finally make the point that we must remember the structure of Europe."
"We are not a federation like the United States."
"We are not a central government, as found in the 27 Member States, and therefore we can only act to the limit of the powers that are given to us."
"rapporteur. - Madam President, there is a lot of material for debate."
"If I may quote the Commissioner on some of the things that he said, I should like to start with his statement that, in times of crisis, politicians should do something."
"I think they should do it much earlier."
"Before a tsunami comes over us, we should take the measures and be proactive and prevent this type of thing from happening."
"So I agree with what others have said: if we are starting to act now, it is too little, too late."
"My second point is this issue of the supervisory steps to be taken."
"You mentioned the Solvency II example where you also accuse us, Parliament, of weakening these proposals on group supervision."
"I do not think it is a weakening of the structure that has been proposed, as I think my colleague Mr Sánchez Presedo has mentioned already."
"What is proposed in fact by the Commission is a system of group supervision where lead supervisors, which often are the big Member States, take the lead in the process of a college."
"I support the idea is that we should create colleges and that we should take some of these supervisory issues at a common, joint, level, because these cross-border groups act at the joint level."
"But the point is that there may be conflict between the interests of these lead supervisors of one national Member State and the supervisors of a host Member State, a big part of whose markets may dominated by this other group."
"So in these cases of conflict, it is not fair to just say that you can have a sort of voluntary mediation by the Level 3 Committees followed simply by advice to the lead supervisor, and then in the end the lead supervisor can either comply or explain that he is deviating from this advice."
"This is what is worrying the host Member States, and that is why you cannot stick solely to national supervisors dealing with this."
"There you need a neutral, impartial, independent arbiter at European level, and this is what I have already proposed in this report: not a bureaucratic supervision structure, just something to build on the present structure simply by adding to the other chairs of these three Level 3 Committees an independent chair and an independent vice-chair to act together with these Level 3 Committees and to deal in a binding way with the resolution of conflicts that may remain between supervisors."
"This is what I think should be the guarantee to enable host Member States, smaller Member States in particular, to give their assent to this type of group supervision and these mandates to lead supervisors."
"So this extra level, the extra add-on that we need to solve this problem, as well as for the short term, is in Amendment 7 that I have tabled for the vote tomorrow."
"Another issue is the role of these supervisory committees as compared to the Commission."
"I also have the impression, like Mrs Kauppi, that in the Commission you would only prefer to have these supervisors as advisors and not really have an independent role for them to play, for instance in the international connection, in connection with the IASB standard-setting board or the FSF."
"A direct question to you."
"We have been told that Mr Barroso was very proud that now the Commission is invited to this financial stability forum, but that although you were invited last week you did not go to that meeting."
"Maybe you can directly respond to say whether this true or not?"
"A final thing, on the executive pay recommendation, the only thing you have mentioned is that this is soft law and one Member State is following up on this."
"There is room to come up with stronger proposals, so please come up with your proposals."
"rapporteur. - Madam President, let me say something which, in my view, has not been properly outlined."
"Regulation and supervision is not only about the building; it is about the object: what we regulate and supervise - and that is the crux of the matter."
"We could have had an independent, EU-wide oversight body regulating in Europe and we would still have experienced the eruption of the crisis, because the problem is that the flaw lies in the financial system, not necessarily in the non-existence of a unique body of oversight and supervision."
"Secondly, we are going to experience a very severe recession."
"We have to recapitalise the banks, and this will cost a huge amount of money."
"It is going to put tremendous pressure on public budgets, and I am asking myself - because we have to look at the broad picture - what is going to happen."
"I think that the current crisis shows that the size of the EU budget is nothing when the time comes to intervene and do something, so we have to rethink the EU budget."
"(The President cut off the speaker.)"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Written Statements (Rule 142)"
"In the absence of effective mechanisms at European level, we are witnessing a cascade of often disjointed and even competing emergency financial interventions by various countries."
"Action at European level has been reactive, 'a posteriori', seeking to forestall even greater damage."
"The net result is that the confidence of EU citizens has been dented."
"Regulation needs to be thought through in calmer times."
"Neither citizens, nor we, their elected representatives, can understand the apathy that has greeted Parliament's many specific initiatives."
"Now, in the midst of the turbulence, is not the right time to discuss where the responsibility lies."
"One thing is certain, however: the rules of the system have to change."
"The text that we shall vote on tomorrow is central to better regulation and supervision of the EU's financial markets."
"It is a proactive response by Parliament and not a reaction to recent events - which unfortunately have just served to confirm its relevance."
"Many of those who were politically opposed to a minimum degree of transparency, regulation and supervision of the new financial instruments are now holding their tongues or changing their tune."
"We hope the Commission will finally shoulder its responsibilities for initiative, strengthening the soundness of European financial institutions and helping to restore some confidence to citizens."
"in writing. - (RO) The financial crisis that has extended to almost the entire planet should be analysed at the level of the European Union's institutions."
"It is inadmissible that the youngest territorial organisation in the world, the European Union, cannot intervene in identifying a solution acceptable to all parties and I insist on creating fast action instruments, as the EC high-level task force is also defined."
"We presently live in historical, unprecedented times."
"We are on the edge of a financial collapse endangering the achievement of the goals undertaken by the EU, both for the 27 Member States and for the other countries on our planet."
"Any second lost in administrative and bureaucratic proceedings means huge losses for the international banking system and the financial stock exchanges on all continents, as well as the deterioration of the standard of living for all inhabitants."
"Europe is forced to make a stand and become a standard bearer in the fight for stopping the current financial crisis."
"At this moment, we need to prove the functionality of the European system and institutions; we need coordination and cooperation between the Member State governments, the European Commission and the European Parliament."
"We have the necessary maturity and expertise to intervene in solving a dangerous situation for the future of the European Union, as well as of humankind."
"Welcome"
"I am delighted to welcome Alexander Milinkevich and Alexander Kozulin to the distinguished visitors' gallery today."
"Our two visitors are prominent leaders in the democratic opposition movement in Belarus."
"During the presidential elections in 2006 they bravely challenged the undemocratic government of the time, repeatedly showing great courage, and were greatly hindered in their untiring efforts to bring freedom and democracy."
"It is a great honour for us that Mr Milinkevich, the leader of the freedom movement and winner of the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought in 2006, and Mr Kozulin, a former political prisoner and the honorary chairman of Hramada, the Belarusian Social Democratic Party, are present for today's debate here in Parliament on the situation in Belarus."
"(Applause)"
"Situation in Belarus (debate)"
"The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the situation in Belarus."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to congratulate my friends here in the House, and whom I have met with."
"I know that you are all extremely concerned about the situation in Belarus, as indicated by the resolution that you adopted in May and our recent exchange of views on 16 September within the Committee on Foreign Affairs, following the General Affairs and External Relations Council."
"We explained then that the Council would be closely monitoring the legislative elections in Belarus, which took place on 28 September."
"The results are not encouraging."
"The Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights has of course identified a few positive developments, but the election process did not satisfy OSCE requirements for democratic elections."
"We note that no member of the opposition will have a parliamentary seat."
"In the Presidency's declaration, published on 30 September, we spoke of our concerns on the subject of democracy and human rights."
"We continue to call on the Belarus authorities to cooperate fully with the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights in order to comply with international democratic standards."
"The Council will continue to work on a strategy for Belarus."
"There is wide consensus among Member States that the measures taken must reflect the actions of the administration over the summer, and particularly the release of the last remaining political prisoners."
"We must also take into account the geopolitical situation created by the Georgia conflict."
"We must ensure that the positive signals observed recently continue, such as the peaceful opposition demonstration following the election results, which took place without intervention from the security forces."
"We must also guarantee the safety and freedom of movement of political dissidents."
"The Council is currently discussing a possible resumption of political contact and a possible suspension of visa sanctions."
"It is of course selective, and these discussions are ongoing."
"The Belarus foreign minister, Mr Martynov, was invited to a troika during the Council meeting due to take place in Luxembourg on 13 October."
"We will review the situation with him."
"It will give us a chance to renew our commitment to progress in terms of democracy and human rights."
"Before I conclude, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to once more congratulate Mr Protasiewicz, and Mr Milinkevich and Mr Kozulin, who are here in the gallery, and to reassure them that the European Union remains open to a progressive re-engagement with Belarus, to strengthening ties with the administration and the Belarus people, and committed to continuing to help Belarus civil society."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I am speaking in this debate on behalf of my colleague Benita Ferrero-Waldner."
"The situation in Belarus is in a state of flux and calls for a measured and strategic response from the European Union."
"At the present time we are faced with a complex reality."
"To begin with, it is very clear that we were disappointed with the parliamentary election on 28 September and the way it was conducted."
"The election did not match up to international standards or to our expectations."
"We are all agreed on this and I will not dwell on the subject."
"On the other hand, some progress was made before the election with the freeing of political prisoners and also in connection with the election, where Belarus cooperated with the OSCE/ODIHR and its observers ahead of the elections."
"The freeing of the remaining political prisoners was regarded as an essential step not only by ourselves, but also by the opposition: this move reduced and eased the level of fear in civil society, where imprisonment on political grounds is no longer seen as a fact of life, even though the threat still exists."
"And yet, while at the time we welcomed the freeing of the political prisoners, we did not respond tangibly with positive measures, with the election just around the corner."
"But now we should not delay our response any longer."
"Similarly, just as the freeing of the political prisoners was a decisive gesture, the cooperation of the Belarusian authorities with the OSCE observers cannot be ignored, nor can the - albeit limited - access to the media for all the candidates be overlooked."
"These are major steps forward compared with the previous, presidential, elections in 2006."
"How do we now make sure that these steps forward are maintained and consolidated?"
"How do we make sure that also in the future there are no political prisoners in Belarus?"
"How do we make sure that the OSCE/ODIHR can continue its cooperation with the Belarusian authorities until the publication of its final report on the election in two months and, beyond this, follow up the report?"
"What can be done to prevent any toughening of the rules applying to the media and to provide greater legal certainty for NGOs to work in?"
"I am here to listen to the Parliament's views."
"It is our belief that resuming the dialogue at political level with the authorities, without ceremony but with realism, is the response we must give Belarus today."
"It is important that we can have contacts at the appropriate level, in order to make sure that our message gets across."
"I would add that generally speaking, whatever the exact details of our response, our line must be 'gradual and proportional'."
"These two principles will guide the delivery of our response to Belarus and will enable us to encourage the democratic development we all hope for."
"In the meantime, the Commission will make available all its expertise in order to strengthen contacts with the Belarusian administration in sectors of shared interest such as energy, environment, customs and transport."
"These contacts have demonstrated their worth by promoting the development of networks between persons and between administrations."
"In parallel we will stick doggedly to our support to civil society, helping Belarusian NGOs, promoting development of an independent press and the European Humanities University in exile in Vilnius."
"I promise to keep up our effort and to strengthen our links with civil society."
"In conclusion, Belarus, a country at the heart of Europe and a neighbour of three of our Member States, is faced with a historic choice: either it takes the necessary steps towards democracy and real independence, or it resigns itself to stagnation and growing dependence on one country."
"It remains our wish to welcome Belarus as a full partner in our European Neighbourhood Policy and the future Eastern Europe Partnership."
"I therefore call for your support so that we can determine the right approach that will, at this crucial time for the stability of our continent, encourage Belarus to make real progress towards democracy and respect for human rights."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, when a sitting president wins all the seats in his Parliament, we can probably assume that something is amiss."
"Not even Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe has managed a clean sweep as President Alexander Lukashenko did last month in Belarus."
"I do not dispute that Lukashenko enjoys widespread popularity in a country largely insulated from post-Soviet reality."
"But his iron grip on power has turned his country into an international pariah."
"For the European Union it does not make sense to welcome the presence of the last European dictator on our own doorstep."
"Nevertheless, we should always seek to challenge and also at the same time to engage with Belarus."
"The recent release of political prisoners therefore presents us with an opportunity."
"Whether Lukashenko's move constitutes an overture to the West remains to be seen, but we should be ready to respond with our own incentives to recognise and reward Belarus as appropriate."
"We should not discount the possibility that Lukashenko is blackmailing the Kremlin, which has hitherto been vital to his stranglehold on political power."
"If this is indeed the case the EU should not be afraid to wield the carrot as well as the stick and therefore I welcome Foreign Minister Martinov's imminent visit."
"Belarus has much to gain from closer ties to the European Union, not least the partial alleviation of widespread poverty caused by a stagnating economy."
"Nevertheless the fact remains that Belarus is still not a member of the Council of Europe."
"Ratification of its Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with the EU remains frozen."
"Belarus remains a country where human rights are routinely disregarded, political dissent is not tolerated and a free press is a distant pipe dream."
"Once we have started dangling the carrot, we should also make sure we still have the stick in the other hand."
"I personally hope nevertheless that Belarus, if it does not reunite with Russia as some within the Kremlin would like, will one day enter its rightful place amongst the European family of free nations."
"Madam President, firstly, we too are dissatisfied with the outcome of the elections in Belarus, and we agree with the conclusion of the OSCE/ODIHR that the elections fell short of our European standards."
"Therefore, there is absolutely no reason to change EU policy towards Belarus now."
"We do agree that it is good to look at whether we can initiate dialogue with the Belarusian authorities on an informal basis, as has also been proposed by the French Presidency, on a possible follow-up."
"Follow-up measures must chiefly originate on their side."
"If Belarus is prepared to develop a dialogue with the European Union on the possibility of increasing freedom in its society, and to create elbow room, including for the opposition, the European Union will be able to respond."
"Until then, I do not support lifting the existing sanctions against a number of leading figures in the country who are not permitted to enter the EU."
"There have been a number of encouraging signs over recent months - these have already been mentioned by my fellow Members in this House - which indeed give cause to look at whether progress can be made by means of dialogue with the country."
"Secondly, if the Foreign Minister, Sergei Martynov, is invited to talks in Luxembourg, I propose that the Council also contact the opposition."
"There are two prominent representatives of the opposition here - Mr Kazulin and Mr Milinkevich."
"Why has the Council not invited them, too, to talks?"
"On a final note, if dialogue is established with Belarus on possible reforms, we think it important that the opposition be involved."
"There is a precedent: some seven years ago a kind of informal dialogue was held in Belarus itself, partly under the auspices of the European Parliament, which was called the Parliamentary Troika on Belarus."
"It would be possible, if the Belarusian authorities were prepared to do so, to restart that dialogue via a kind of troika of the European Parliament, the OSCE and the Council of Europe."
"After all, whatever we do in Europe, whatever discussions we hold, the opposition must be involved."
"Madam President, the course, and also the outcome, of the elections in Belarus clearly demonstrate that although Alexander Lukashenko is signalling a desire to develop relations with the European Union, he imagines that the dialogue may be initiated and conducted on his terms and without any concessions on his part."
"We must, however, be aware that an improvement in relations with the European Union is not only in the objective interests of Belarus, but also in the interests of Lukashenko himself."
"Constant pressure from Russia to take over control of key sectors of the Belarusian economy may lead to such dependence on Russia that Lukashenko's hold over the country will be seriously weakened."
"One possible way out, then, is to involve Western companies in a privatisation programme that has become necessary because of the condition of the Belarusian economy."
"This is the only way in which Belarus will escape being bought out by politically controlled Russian capital."
"Dialogue must therefore be commenced, if only to bring about legal and political conditions in Belarus that will encourage the investment of EU capital in the country."
"This dialogue must not, however, provide an opportunity for the regime to acquire credibility or be legitimised."
"It must therefore be accompanied by actions on the part of Belarus that, albeit not greatly but at least visibly, will clearly indicate the direction of changes to the political system."
"Meanwhile, each conversation with representatives of the Belarusian authorities, wherever it might be held, should be balanced with meetings at the same level between EU politicians and the most important representatives of the opposition."
"Madam President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I welcome the delegation of the well-known politicians Alexander Milinkevich and Alexander Kozulin, who are following our debate here in the European Parliament today and will then be able to report back to their own country on it."
"It is still a problem that information on our work here for the country of Belarus has to take this route because there are no other options."
"This is a sign that the basic preconditions for democratic development in Belarus have still not been established."
"Freedom of opinion and freedom of information are essential for democracy."
"This summer, President Yushchenko made a public promise to conduct the elections in his country openly, democratically and fairly, and he broke that promise."
"An election campaign that denies the opposition any possibility of presenting its candidates throughout the country and changes the conditions so fundamentally that even a well-organised opposition is not able to get even one candidate elected is not a fair, democratic election."
"Therefore, our resolution is clear on this point."
"We need to include the prerequisite of having the visa ban lifted and at this point, the prerequisite of a new financial instrument to be equipped with funds to support the opposition and the people in their efforts to establish democracy."
"Madam President, the policy of fast-track door-opening to Belarus has been poorly drafted and conducted in an amateurish manner."
"Declarations of a warming of relations have begun to emanate from the European Union and some Member States before the Lukashenko regime has taken any lasting step towards freedom."
"We have done this on trust."
"This lesson should teach us to be more precise in future."
"Of course we can open up to Belarus, but only when the government in Minsk takes concrete steps in favour of freedom: initiating political dialogue through a television channel or newspaper for the opposition;"
"This is the only tactic - something for something - that will maintain our credibility and bring about an opportunity for the democratisation of Belarus."
"Madam President, if all parties have an equal chance of winning seats in elections in Belarus, there is every chance that the party of the incumbent President, Alexander Lukashenko, will win the most."
"He is held in high regard by those who set more store by social security than by individual liberties. They appreciate the much lower level of upheaval in Belarus compared to a number of other former Soviet republics."
"On the other hand, he inspires loathing among people who reject his pursuit of unification with Russia."
"They are attached to the separate Belarusian language, which was the reason for the establishment of the country almost 90 years ago."
"Many intellectuals who look more to Poland, Lithuania and the European Union have left the country."
"There must be an end to the beating of demonstrators, the imprisonment of opponents and all other attempts to make it impossible for opposition parties to survive."
"Electoral law that makes it easy to exclude the entire opposition from parliament is bad electoral law."
"We must not seek confrontation with the country but rather do everything possible to support its democratisation."
"Recently, there has been some improvement in the situation in Belarus compared to previous years."
"Political prisoners have been released and the government is seeking to engage with the European Union."
"The government had also announced that the parliamentary elections would be fair this time - but what happened next far from bore that out."
"Belarus still employs capital punishment and, in derogation from the law, the media are not independent."
"In the coming period, freedom of movement between the EU and Belarus must be promoted, and dialogue must be held with both the government and the organisations not under government control."
"Madam President, many Belarusian citizens hope for an improvement in relations with the European Union, resulting in a positive dynamic of reform in their own country."
"I support this desire wholeheartedly."
"This is also why all the European institutions, without affecting their own political credibility and subject to strict conditions (see paragraph 10 of the resolution), should seek gradual engagement with Minsk."
"I consider it an important tangible step in this direction that we adjust - that is, lower (see paragraph 13 of our resolution) - the cost of the EU visa for Belarusians: currently EUR 60 for Ukrainians as against EUR 35 for Russians."
"I should like to hear what the Council and the Commission think of this proposal."
"One thing that I found strange in the resolution - which I otherwise intend to support - was paragraphs 7 and 8."
"In these paragraphs we call for truly democratic elections and also respect for human rights, but we only address the Belarusian Government."
"We should also be addressing the parliament, as that is our natural discussion partner."
"(PL) Madam President, the elections that have taken place in Belarus have already been reported on by the OSCE mission."
"They were neither transparent nor honest nor democratic."
"It is, however, a fact that political prisoners, at least the main ones, were released."
"Nevertheless, the reasons for which they were imprisoned have not been eliminated."
"We do not have complete certainty that in the near future either they (those temporarily released) or new prisoners will not be arrested in Belarus."
"We have to ensure that the causes are eliminated and not just the effects."
"It is also worth recalling, given the opportunity presented by this debate, that there are 14 other people in Belarus whose freedom is restricted by being condemned either to house arrest or to enforced labour for activities supporting human rights and freedom."
"Our declaration is a very balanced one."
"On the one hand it expresses satisfaction at the release of the prisoners, while on the other it views the course and outcome of the elections with dissatisfaction."
"Meanwhile, in paragraph 12 Parliament agrees with the 'step-by-step' policy in future negotiations with Belarus and says that we may agree to a partial suspension of sanctions for a maximum of six months on condition that there are some very substantial changes, which would improve the situation above all for media freedom in Belarus."
"This is a good move, and I am a keen advocate of it, while at the same time I would like to appeal to both the French Presidency and the Czech Presidency, which will take over for the first half of next year, to ensure that whenever there are official meetings with representatives of the Belarusian authorities, time must also be found for meetings with representatives of the opposition."
"The will must also be found to reduce the cost of visas for Belarusians, because otherwise we shall not bring this nation closer to Europe."
"As a Pole I would like to express my appreciation of the fact that Parliament decided to take note that the activities of the Polish minority in Belarus are restricted by the Belarusian authorities, and that there is a legally elected authority representing Poles, headed by Angelika Borys."
"Madam President, the resolution on the situation in Belarus reveals what Brussels and Minsk could do in order not to lose the momentum for improving their relations."
"I support the approach taken by Jan Marinus Wiersma, which also mirrors the stance taken by the Belarusian opposition of Alexander V. Kazulin and Alexander Milinkevich."
"The policy of the EU, to punish Belarus and the Belarusians for the actions of their regime, did not achieve the envisaged results."
"It is necessary to open all gates for people-to-people contacts, and bring down visa barriers which are contradictory to common sense."
"Providing Minsk is really willing to improve cooperation with the EU, this should create more favourable conditions for the kick-off of mutual discussions, not only externally but also domestically."
"It can be done by starting talks on the political, economic, social and human rights issues involving all political parties, opposition forces, NGOs and trade unions."
"(NL) Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, just a few weeks ago you thought it premature to invite the Belarusian Foreign Minister, Sergei Martynov, to Paris."
"Now you obviously believe that the time is right."
"To be frank, even after your statement, I am still at a loss to understand the precise reasoning behind this change in direction."
"After all, as everyone here has already noted, the elections of 28 September by no means met the standards that are familiar to us all and by which you, too, set so much store."
"A meeting at this level and in this setting - informal or otherwise - appears to be the regime's reward."
"A reward for what, however?"
"This morning I, too, had the pleasure of exchanging views once more with Mr Milinkevich and Mr Kazulin."
"The Belarusian opposition is united and possibly stronger than ever."
"The same opposition must then be given the opportunity to reach out to the Belarusian people, and the Belarusian people must be given the opportunity to experience European liberties directly."
"It is unacceptable that an EU visa should still cost EUR 60 when the average monthly salary in Belarus is a paltry EUR 250."
"How many more times must we ask for this?"
"I do not dispute the usefulness and necessity of some level of dialogue."
"It is clear, however, that Mr Lukashenko's fine words are often empty words, and so the dialogue envisaged must be justified, and also very targeted."
"My question here is as follows: what exactly is the Council's specific road map?"
"I should very much like more information on this."
"I wish to conclude with a question that Mr Wiersma also raised."
"Is the President-in-Office prepared to receive Mr Milinkevich and Mr Kazulin, too, next Monday - either before, during or after the conversation with Mr Martynov?"
"That is for you to decide, but let it be clear that this would be the only appropriate signal to send out in the present circumstances."
"Unfortunately I will have to leave the Chamber in a few minutes."
"I do apologise for the inconvenience but I would like to have a straight answer."
"(PL) Madam President, today the fate of Belarus, a country of 10 million Europeans, is being weighed in the balance."
"We cannot stand by and watch this happen."
"Dictators like Lukashenko only give way under pressure."
"There is only one question: in which direction will this giving way take place?"
"Since the economic key to the independence of Belarus is held by Russia, its constraints may end in Belarus losing its sovereignty."
"Pressure from the EU may be effective if Lukashenko has something to lose, and the EU something to offer."
"It seemed he would agree to changes, but the recent elections can hardly be termed anything other than a farce."
"The dictator's fear and obstinacy may lead to a loss of sovereignty for Belarus."
"Lukashenko does not have to lose out over the democratisation of Belarus if he enjoys a large amount of popular trust."
"These must, however, be real steps down the road to democracy, not just a put-on show, with the price paid by the Belarusian opposition."
"Despite the risk of a black scenario, the EU cannot accept this price."
"Let us not, however, break off the dialogue if the independence of this country is at stake."
"As Mr Milinkevich said today, the future of democracy in this country depends on whether it can maintain its independence."
"(HU) Thank you, Madam President."
"Even if the Belarusian parliamentary elections, observed by the OSCE, did not meet the requirements for fair and free elections, next week's sitting of the Council of Ministers will in all probability give the green light for political dialogue."
"Lukashenko has not done anything unusual."
"After the war in Georgia three political prisoners were set free."
"This satisfied the EU's only condition for the initiation of dialogue."
"It is obvious that after the war in Georgia the West needed every little move it could make to try to counterbalance Moscow's growing influence in post-Soviet territory."
"But if even Lukashenko succeeded in arranging the dialogue to his own liking, what kind of dialogue can we expect with Moscow?"
"Brussels must initiate dialogue on the basis of a previously agreed benchmark system, otherwise the EU can only lose in this dialogue."
"Lukashenko will use this to reinforce his domestic authority and keep Moscow on a leash, not to offer gradual political liberalisation."
"Meantime the EU could lose its greatest Eastern weapon, its image."
"It's up to us to decide ..."
"Madam President, I want to warn against a policy which tends to reward the Belarusian leadership in compensation for decisions of the Russian leadership which we do not like."
"It is simply wishful thinking to believe that in this way we can generate a rift between Moscow and Minsk, or change the political orientation of President Lukashenko."
"We should also not offer words for the liberation of prisoners who should not have been arrested."
"Indeed, the European Union must avoid the isolation of Belarus and engage in dialogue with the leadership of the country."
"To this end, it must put in place a motivating package which should convince the regime, and the ordinary citizens who innocently support it, that the European Union could contribute to improving the life of the Belarusian people."
"On the other hand, any opening should be gradual, conditional, mutual and focused on principally bringing profit to society and not to the leadership."
"Mr Lukashenko stated that opposition is good in any country but not an opposition supported 100% from abroad."
"The problem is that the opposition in Belarus could not survive because it is crushed by the regime."
"Therefore we must not abandon the democratic opposition."
"Mr President, the visa issue is very important to all Belarusians."
"But I would like to highlight a specific situation with regard to travel."
"The Chernobyl Children's Project International founded by Adi Roche in Ireland brings approximately 1 000 children from Belarus to Ireland each year for a few weeks for rest, recuperation and, in some cases, ongoing medical interventions."
"In total, 17 000 children have come since the charity started."
"Unfortunately, permission has been withdrawn for the children to come to Ireland, and this has devastated everybody concerned: the children, their host families and so many others."
"This is such a good project and everybody benefits."
"An intergovernmental agreement is being worked on and I hope it will be finalised soon, but in the meantime I know that Ireland is seeking an exemption from the ban."
"I would ask the Commission and the Council, perhaps in its informal dialogue, to do all they can to ensure the continuation of this very worthwhile project."
"I know it is just a small part of the overall situation, but it will make such a positive difference to so many lives."
"(CS) Mr President, we were outlining foreign policy, we were arguing about the Southern dimension and the Eastern dimension."
"On 21 August we, the Czechs and Slovaks in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, celebrated the 40th anniversary of the Soviet Army entering Czechoslovakia by debating the situation in Georgia."
"The Eastern dimension has become a reality."
"We cannot run away from it, and we must therefore act."
"Politics is not a concert."
"Politics is a context and we have the context."
"For this reason we must fully support Belarus on its route to Europe."
"I therefore give my full support to the motion for a resolution as it stands."
"We must not isolate Belarus but we must not call it a democracy either."
"We must call on Belarus to abolish the death penalty, to let students return to the universities, to allow those who have refused to serve in the Belarusian armed forces to return with impunity and to allow non-governmental organisations to be registered."
"What about us?"
"What do we have to do?"
"We must demonstrate that we are observing the Copenhagen criteria."
"We must act as Europe."
"(PL) Mr President, above all I would like to welcome Alexander Milinkevich and Mr Kazulin, representatives of the Belarusian opposition, to the European Parliament today."
"It is very difficult at this time to put a finger on EU policy with regard to Belarus."
"On the one hand we are constantly having to deal with an authoritarian state, while on the other we are seeing signs of a certain evolution and certain changes to this system of a complicated international situation."
"EU policy at this time should be directed entirely at the Belarusian people."
"The question is: who stands to lose most by sanctions?"
"The Lukashenko regime, or the people of Belarus?"
"This is a question we have to answer for ourselves in the various EU institutions."
"There is no doubt that we must try out a policy at this time that will specify our objectives and bring benefits from EU actions aimed at Belarus."
"Mr President, we are currently receiving conflicting signals from Minsk, and this is already some kind of progress in relation to before, but the recent parliamentary election reinforced the popular Western image of Belarus as a kind of banana republic."
"On the other hand, the recent release of political dissidents is a welcome development."
"If it is an attempt by Lukashenko to reach out to the West, let us reward his efforts with our cautious support."
"But we should be under no illusions about the widespread abuses of human rights and political freedoms in Belarus."
"Our focus must be the people and civil society of Belarus - a cause that this House has a noble and vital tradition of supporting, even more so after today's speech by Ingrid Betancourt."
"The people of Belarus yearn to take their place in the new Europe."
"They need to know that we care and that we will not ignore them."
"(CS) Mr President, several important changes have taken place in Belarus during the past few weeks."
"The most significant was the release of political prisoners: Mr Alexander Kozulin, who is present here, Mr Syarhey Parsyukevich and Mr Andrey Kim."
"Nevertheless, the parliamentary elections unfortunately fell short of international democratic standards."
"What does this mean for us?"
"My opinion is that the European Union should provide much more support for the development of Belarusian civil society, the concept of democracy and human and citizens' rights than it has hitherto provided."
"I also think that we need to consider increasing our financial support, for example for independent media, non-governmental organisations, independent trade unions, etc."
"Lowering visa fees or abolishing them completely for Belarusian citizens, especially young people and students, should form part of this support for Belarusian civil society."
"As we have already heard, a visa costs EUR 60, which is equivalent to the weekly salary of an average Belarusian citizen."
"We should give this some thought."
"Mr President, I call on the Council and the Commission to urge the Belarus authorities to end their practice of issuing exit visas to their citizens, in particular children and students."
"Whereas in most instances a visa is required to enter a country, in Belarus one needs a visa in order to leave the country."
"I raised the issue of the international travel ban on children from this country with the Belarus opposition leader Alexander Milinkevich during the PPE-DE Group meeting this morning."
"He told our Group that the Belarus regime has imposed this travel ban as it does not want children to see how the other half lives."
"From my own constituency of Ireland South, something like EUR 70 million has been raised and expended in looking after children and improving the conditions in which they live in their orphanages."
"My colleague Marian Harkin has already referred to the ban here this evening."
"I understand now that in fact the bilateral agreement between Ireland and Belarus will not be in place until May or June."
"Therefore I join with her in calling for the exemption to be granted to Ireland so that children can travel for Christmas and get the help and assistance that they require."
"(SK) Mr Milinkevich, Mr Kozulin, I am delighted that you are here for today's debate on your country, Belarus."
"To me, you represent the prospect of Belarus becoming a free and democratic country one day."
"The unfair October election in Belarus once again strengthened Mr Lukashenko's totalitarian regime."
"Of the 110 seats in the lower chamber of the Belarusian Parliament, not a single one was won by the opposition."
"Although political prisoners were released in August, they could find themselves back in prison at any time."
"Ladies and gentlemen, by making small improvements to the election process Mr Lukashenko is trying to persuade us that the EU has no longer any reasons to isolate Belarus."
"Although good relations with Minsk would be beneficial to both sides, the Union must demand more than just cosmetic changes in improving democracy."
"The EU must call for a free media in Belarus and for all democratic forces to be able to participate in the process of governing Belarus."
"Mr President, the French Presidency pays close attention to all of the EU's eastern neighbours: Georgia and Ukraine, where the summit on 9 September marked an unprecedented step forward in relations between the EU and Ukraine - Moldova - I was there two days ago to discuss the future of relations between the European Union and Moldova in the form of a new and more ambitious agreement than the current Partnership and Cooperation Agreement."
"So it is in this context that we are closely watching developments in Belarus."
"Like you, we are sorry that the regime did not use the elections on 28 September as an opportunity to signal progress towards democratic standards."
"At the same time, the EU is pleased to see a few positive developments, notably the release of political prisoners."
"There must be a debate between foreign ministers in Luxembourg on Monday, under similar to those used by speakers during this debate."
"Our message is that the European Union is prepared to budge if the authorities in Minsk make an effort."
"We need a progressive approach - in other words, sanctions are not going to be lifted overnight - and a conditional approach, in that the EU will react to positive signals from the regime, as well as an approach geared towards the welfare of civil society, as Mr Severin said."
"I would like to explain that children and students can of course obtain visas."
"It depends on the embassy, but it is allowed under the Schengen system."
"We need to put pressure on the authorities in Minsk to ensure that these visas are issued, although the EU is not responsible for this."
"I would also like to point out that there are specific advantages in terms of young people, children who are close to the Belarus border."
"The EU will maintain its support for the opposition."
"I myself have just had a meeting with Messrs Milinkevich, Kozulin and Protasiewicz and Parliament can pride itself on awarding the Sakharov Prize to Mr Milinkevich."
"I believe that this gesture is a tribute to the European Parliament."
"As we have already said, it is essential that if a representative of a Member State goes to Minsk, he or she should meet with the opposition."
"Therefore, we have not lost hope of the regime evolving towards greater liberalisation, so that Belarus is not left in an exclusive one-to-one with Russia."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, on the question of whether we are prepared to receive the opposition on Monday on the margins of the GAERC meeting, this is an interesting suggestion."
"We will look into it and I will pass on the views of the Members to Benita Ferrero-Waldner."
"However, it is for the Presidency to extend the invitation."
"If the meeting with the opposition takes place, the Commissioners are of course ready to participate."
"On the question of EU assistance to Belarus, assistance focuses on support to civil society and the needs of the population: the combined ENPI resources of EUR 20 million for 2007-2010 to address the needs of the population and democratisation in the broad sense, with the funding from the thematic programme for non-state actors and local authorities and the Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights to support democratisation and civil society in the more narrow sense."
"We foresee actions to further the extent of the capacity of NGOs, in particular in the human rights field and independent media."
"The question was asked about Chernobyl orphans being banned from travel and from stays in Member States."
"The Commission, together with the heads of missions in Minsk, has raised the issue of Chernobyl orphans with the authorities and we will continue to do so as necessary."
"In addition the Commission will continue to support the alleviation of the Chernobyl catastrophe."
"In conclusion may I say that this vivid debate demonstrates that there is a clear interest in the Belarus issue at this crucial time."
"Undoubtedly the time has come for making strategic choices on what should be our approach towards Belarus at this complex juncture."
"I have listened with interest to the views expressed by the Members of Parliament and I understand that, according to some of you, a limited and proportionate suspension of sanctions could be used as a positive lever to press for democratic progress."
"We now await the Parliament resolution on Belarus which is due to be adopted tomorrow, and we will take due account of your opinion in our decision which will be taken shortly."
"I have received six motions for a resolution in accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"The results of the elections in Belarus speak for themselves."
"This outcome was largely to be expected: the opposition ended up being crushed by President Lukashenko's powerful machinery that effectively prevented the elections from being properly conducted."
"It seems to me that Europe is again turning a deaf ear: claims of election-rigging, intimidation, violence and harassment have so far gone unheeded, despite international observers confirming the clear violations, light years away from the required democratic standards."
"I expect the European Union to speak out more clearly and plainly, and to take the necessary political and diplomatic action."
"Let us avoid the usual proclamations and fine resolutions, the declarations of intent."
"This would just be hypocritical, symbolic of a Europe unable to express an authoritative and decisive position."
"Once again Lukashenko has 'outflanked' the European Union, which has shown its naivety in not setting any initial conditions for the regime."
"Lukashenko has turned out to be more shrewd a politician than Europe thought."
"The elections and what went on during the campaign showed that the EU's strategy was poorly prepared."
"This should make the EU aware of its naivety in its Eastern policy."
"To begin with Europe will demand specific actions aimed at citizens' freedoms on the part of Minsk if the process of opening up to Belarus is to continue."
"It is immeasurably important for the West to recognise these elections as a farce, because they were not free elections."
"If these elections are recognised, we shall be carrying on with Lukashenko's game with the West, in which Lukashenko will be the only one to benefit further."
"The media continue not to be free and there is no freedom of association."
"The mysterious deaths of political activists remain unexplained 10 years later."
"The liberation of political prisoners does not essentially alter anything."
"After the elections there will be more persecution."
"So far, Donald Tusk's government has not managed to show anything whatsoever in the way of an Eastern policy."
"Nothing specific has been negotiated with Russia, Georgia has been pacified, Ukraine is continually moving away from Europe, and Belarus has treated our emissary as if he did not exist."
"I think it would be worth finding out who the author of this compromising Eastern policy is."
"Mr President, the European Union is analysing and adjusting its own policy with regard to Belarus."
"The policy of sanctions and isolation we have pursued so far has not brought the anticipated results."
"It has failed to alter the repressive nature of the authorities."
"The Russian offensive in Georgia, signalling a resumption of the Kremlin's imperial ambitions, was a new circumstance."
"It will most definitely have been noticed in Minsk and in other countries that Russia considers as its sphere of influence."
"An attempt to take advantage of this new situation with EU diplomacy would seem to make sense, with full awareness of the risk of dialogue with a dictator. This was done in agreement with the Belarusian opposition."
"An additional circumstance was provided by the parliamentary elections, as a test of good will on the part of President Lukashenko."
"'Carrot and stick' diplomacy has not been a success, but that does not rule out a review of policy on Belarus in relation to the way the situation is developing in that country."
"The aim is still the same - to draw this European country into the sphere of democracy, a market economy and human rights."
"I am convinced that maintenance of Belarusian independence is a necessary condition, since it is only then that prospects for democratisation of the country will become real."
"The alternative scenario - democratisation of a country that has been absorbed by the Russian empire - is a historical illusion."
"in writing. - (ET) Ladies and gentlemen, Belarus has repeatedly been described as 'Europe's last dictatorship' and remains so today."
"The parliamentary elections on 28 September were a litmus test."
"It was a fine gesture for President Lukashenko to release political prisoners before the elections."
"Yet it has also become clear that the opposition will not enter parliament in the short term."
"The OSCE assessed the elections correctly."
"One of the most important aspects for strengthening Belarusian civil society is the European Union's visa policy."
"Civil society must be as fully involved as possible in the democratisation of Belarus."
"In order to be active citizens, people must have a broader world view. And the opportunity to get out of a totalitarian country."
"Belarusians need visas in order to travel."
"Obtaining a Schengen visa is a complex and time-consuming process."
"The visa process needs to be simplified."
"People should not be punished."
"By making circulation of people a complex process, we restrict Belarusians from partaking in the values and culture of the European Union."
"It is not our intention to punish the civil society of Belarus."
"It is high time to change."
"The people of Belarus deserve as much. And it is our job as Europeans to help them."
"With outrageous audacity, and without citing a shred of evidence even as a pretext, the political forces supporting and serving the EU have signed a joint resolution to condemn the Belarusian Government for the elections of 28 September."
"The resolution proposed by the political forces of the European Left, through the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, is similar in spirit."
"It is obvious that the EU and the parties of the 'European one-way street' (New Democracy (ND), the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK), the Coalition of the Radical Left (SYRIZA)/Synaspismos and the Popular Orthodox Rally (LAOS)) are aligning themselves with the representatives of imperialism who are rallying round the so-called opposition - the NATO lackey, Mr Milinkevich."
"This opposition won a 'surprising' 6% in the previous presidential elections and failed to win a single seat in the recent parliamentary elections."
"The election results should silence all the objections of EU and US imperialists, because the people of Belarus are supporting their government's policy against NATO and the EU."
"This is what is so infuriating and demoralising for the political forces of the 'European one-way street'."
"This time they do not have the pretext of released 'political prisoners', or the excuse of a lack of equal publicity for candidates."
"Now that they acknowledge the existence of such equality, they are shamelessly and high-handedly claiming that the new parliament has 'doubtful democratic legitimacy'."
"The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece condemn both of these unacceptable resolutions and express their solidarity with the people of Belarus in their struggle against imperialist dominance."
"in writing. - Recent elections held in Belarus can be described as anything but free and fair."
"Stalin's notorious principle that it is not important who receives the votes, but who counts the votes, is still very much respected in Belarus."
"The votes were mostly counted out of the field of view of the observers, thus the OSCE election observation misson, for example, was compelled not to recognise the elections."
"Lukashenka's hypocrisy in his recent courting of the West is unmistakable."
"He has made promises on the nature of the elections that he has been unable to keep - the rights of numerous election observers were violated by depriving them of their right to oversee the election procedures fully."
"We should not disregard this severe breach from the ideals of democratic elections."
"No European Union sanctions should be lifted before an evident regime transition has commenced."
"The position of the Council and of the Commission and the resolution of the European Parliament on the situation in Belarus have the objective of evaluating the results of the parliamentary elections held on 28 September, and also their impact on EU relations with Belarus."
"The European Union finds itself in a complicated international situation."
"On the one hand, there is no doubt that Belarus has failed to fulfil its democratic obligations, but on the other we are seeing a gradual, albeit slow, 'melting' of authoritarianism."
"During the elections it was possible to observe certain positive phenomena pointing towards democratisation, such as the liberation of political prisoners, the request for independent OSCE observers and an improvement in election observation conditions."
"The Belarusian authorities did not, however, meet all their obligations."
"They should confirm their desire to improve cooperation with the EU and create better conditions for dialogue with the EU."
"They should take genuine action on a broader scale to move towards democracy, respect for human rights and the principle of the rule of law."
"I fully support the call from the Commission and the Council to review and possibly suspend some of the restrictions that are in place with regard to Belarus."
"The development of a civil society must not be blocked."
"The sanctions imposed by the EU - especially those relating to visa procedures and the costs of obtaining a visa - hit ordinary citizens, not the state authorities."
"Composition of Parliament : see Minutes"
"Corrigenda (Rule 204a): see Minutes"
"Enforcement of the ECJ judgment on the 'Turco' case (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on:"
"the oral question to the Council by Marco Cappato and Michael Cashman, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, Anneli Jäätteenmäki and Costas Botopoulos, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the enforcement of the ECJ judgment on the 'Turco' case - B6-0470/2008), and"
"the oral question to the Commission by Marco Cappato and Michael Cashman, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, Anneli Jäätteenmäki and Costas Botopoulos, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the enforcement of the ECJ judgment on the 'Turco' case - B6-0471/2008)."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our fellow Member in the previous parliamentary term, Maurizio Turco, now an Italian Radical MP, submitted an application - an application that any ordinary citizen can make - requesting access to Council documents in which the names of national delegations that had adopted certain positions during the debate were censored."
"The Council refused to grant the request and access to a legal opinion was also denied."
"The appeal before the Court of First Instance, which in the meantime had forced the Council to make available the identity of the national delegations, found against Mr Turco and for the Council, in order to prevent a ruling from the Court of Justice on the matter."
"However, an appeal brought before the Court of Justice overturned the original judgment."
"The Court simply said that access to documents, particularly those with legislative implications, had to be compulsory because access to documents was democratic and that any exception was to be limited, since this clearly was in the public interest."
"Public and legal debate on documents increases the legitimacy of the institutions and bolsters public confidence in them."
"The question that we are asking today, in brief, is this: how does the Commission and how do the European institutions intend to follow up this judgment?"
"In other words, will they use it as an opportunity for a thorough review of the procedures allowing immediate access to documents?"
"I know that we are talking about an ordinary citizen, that this is an application that any citizen could have made, and not a reform following an institutional debate."
"However, I believe that this is precisely where the strength of Mr Turco's initiative lies, since it shows how an individual case can do much more than institutional initiatives allow."
"We must have every possibility of publishing these documents."
"People need to know, for example, that today, during the European Commission press conference, it was confirmed that the Commission has still not requested information from the Italian Government on a matter that Maurizio Turco himself raised, namely discrimination in religious education in Italy."
"How can this information not have been requested?"
"It is a concrete example of mechanisms where the functioning of the European institutions becomes inscrutable for citizens."
"Therefore, this should be used as an opportunity for a radical overhaul of document access and publication procedures."
"author. - (FI) Mr President, the legislative process in democratic countries is open and public."
"Citizens can find out how their members of parliament have voted and what lies behind a decision."
"That is unfortunately not the case in the EU."
"We cannot boast that the EU is democratic and open and that our citizens can access the documents which are the basis of legislation."
"We have therefore actually asked the Commission what it intends to do first to change the rules and practices as a result of this court decision, so that openness, transparency and democracy might be implemented, and what the Council has planned to do to implement openness and democracy and also to make national opinion visible after a decision."
"Unless opinion is open and public, people will not be able to control what those that represent them do."
"It is high time we took prompt action to ensure that the EU can at long last say, and be proud to do so, that we have democracy and openness and transparency of legislation."
"(Applause)"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to thank the Honourable Members very much for their questions."
"Of course, as we have already heard, this Turco judgement by the Court of Justice is a very important one."
"The Commission fully agrees with the Court when it recalls the great importance of an open legislative process."
"Needless to say, we will respect this judgement and take it fully into account in our daily work."
"I want to be as clear as possible, but I will have to be rather brief in my replies to your five specific questions."
"The first one concerns better lawmaking, our interinstitutional relations and Regulation 1049/2001."
"This Turco judgement concerns access to documents by the public."
"There is no direct link to our interinstitutional cooperation."
"For that we have our framework for enhanced interinstitutional cooperation, which I believe works very well."
"Our two institutions have a good track record of working together in the legislative process to meet the better lawmaking objective."
"Regarding your second question on accessible information on current public consultations, I would like to start by mentioning the PreLex database, as we call it in our jargon."
"The aim behind this database is to facilitate access to pre-legislative documents through a single entry point."
"In practice, it is a portal containing links to key pre-legislative documents."
"This database is operated by the Official Publications Office and it is based on information supplied by the Commission."
"More importantly, it is directly accessible to the public on the Europa server."
"Regarding public consultations launched by the Commission, there is also a single access point on the Europa server."
"That is your voice in Europe."
"This website facilitates access to consultations and provides general information on the Commission's different consultation processes."
"It also gives comprehensive information on open public consultations and on related consultation documents and questionnaires."
"In addition, this access point also gives information on the follow-up, such as consultation reports and published contributions."
"Regarding your third question about the TRANS-JAI project, I would simply like to assure you that full public access with dedicated servers - entitled 'public go live' - for the TRANS-JAI web portal is planned for March 2010."
"This leads to your fourth question on the transparency principle and the principle of good administration."
"Of course these principles are closely interlinked."
"We are always committed to providing as much information as possible to the public."
"This is particularly the case for procedures which concern citizens and their rights and for the workings of the institutions, which we all know are sometimes not so easy to understand."
"The Commission's website gives information on its organisation and procedures, and we have an easy-access 'Who is who' directory of the Commission staff and the different directorates-general."
"Your last question, number 5, concentrates on the public register of documents and the Ombudsman's draft recommendation in the 'Statewatch' complaint."
"A public register of documents has been up and running since 3 June 2002, as required by Regulation 1049/2001."
"Since then, the Commission has also put in place a dedicated register for comitology procedures and a register on expert groups."
"We are doing our utmost to modernise our internal IT systems but, as you know, unfortunately these things do not happen overnight."
"But one thing is clear. This is ongoing work."
"We always take into account the need to increase the coverage of this public register."
"More specifically, on the Ombudsman's draft recommendation in this case, the Commission has of course submitted a detailed opinion to him."
"In that opinion we acknowledge that we still have to increase the coverage of our public registers and we confirm our commitment to further develop our public registers in the interests of enhanced transparency."
"On one point we were unable to share the Ombudsman's view."
"He concluded that the Commission should - and I quote - 'include references to all the documents within the meaning of Article 3(a) in the register'."
"I can share the aim and the ambition of this conclusion, but unfortunately it is impossible to achieve."
"It is simply impossible to reconcile the wide and imprecise definition of 'documents' in Article 3(a) of Regulation 1049/2001 with one single, fully comprehensive public register."
"Instead we have to provide the links or make different entry points."
"I could, of course, mention that I have made the register of my own correspondence directly accessible on the web, and I could mention other examples of what can be done proactively outside the formal legislation, such as improved registers, greater user-friendliness and accessibility, active dissemination and quicker publishing of documents."
"But all this is not our topic for discussion today."
"I am sure we will have other opportunities to discuss these important issues in depth."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, a precondition for the credibility and legitimacy of the EU is a set of working rules on transparency and the protection of data and information."
"Transparency in the decision-making process is especially needed when European democracy is questioned."
"Member States have different experiences."
"More exchange of experience can lead to better administration in the EU, but also in the Member States."
"We have come very far since 2001 when the EU legislation on transparency was decided."
"Most Member States already have some kind of Freedom of Information Act - Sweden and Finland since 1776, other countries like Ireland since a few years ago."
"It takes time - you have to respect that - to find common behaviour and attitudes."
"One national formula cannot be applied over the whole EU."
"The cultures are too diverse."
"Open government is essential in a representative democracy."
"The whole process is influenced by the fact that the digital revolution is transforming our society into an information society."
"One important point that has to be better developed in Regulation No 1049 is the balance between confidentiality and transparency."
"We need an open decision-making process respecting the overriding public interest without infringing institutions' or the individual's rights to confidentiality."
"Judicial interpretation of complex matters, for example competition cases, cannot be left to the judgement of tabloids."
"The Turco judgment can contribute to the development of better lawmaking."
"Which practical consequences will the Commission and Council draw from the Turco case?"
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, as the original rapporteur on Regulation No 1049/2001 I find this a very interesting debate."
"What I find strange - since I know the participants in the debate here tonight are committed fully to openness and transparency - is that the argument as to why not enough has been done is 'we need more time'."
"This is unacceptable."
"Only 30% of the European population have faith in the European Union."
"Why?"
"Because they feel absolutely disconnected from what is done in their name."
"And the amazing thing is that we have a positive story to tell."
"Why is it that the institution has to be dragged screaming and kicking to the European Courts in order to do the right thing?"
"We need to do more than just explain."
"Commissioner Wallström, I know you are as exasperated and exhausted by these arguments as I am, but it is not enough to say we need more time."
"We actually need to demonstrate to our citizens that we will not only explain to them why we do what we do, but how we do it and the legal advice upon which we operate."
"Because, unless we do that, we will disconnect people from the European project."
"It has been argued here tonight that this is impossible with regard to some matters, owing for example the imprecise definition of 'documents'."
"It is not imprecise at all."
"It is in fact well defined."
"It means all documents held, received or produced by the three institutions or the agencies set up by them."
"And 'documents' itself is clearly defined."
"So let us have the courage to have an open register. Not the maze that we have at the moment where, when you go into one register, you do not get access to all of the other registers or all of the other links."
"At the moment we have citizens who go into a maze."
"Let us allow citizens to come into the door of the three institutions and let us expose ourselves to the scrutiny of public opinion."
"I tell you now that unless we do the right thing, the judgement will be made in the June election in favour of those extreme parties who are not in favour of the EU or the EU institutions."
"Time is running out."
"Act now."
"It is not impossible."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (SV) Mr President, the Court of Justice plays a central role in the EU system and the Court has the power to interpret political decisions."
"When EU legislation is to be interpreted, the Court of Justice's decision prevails, irrespective of the aim of the legislature or the intentions behind the legislation."
"We saw this in the judgments on Laval, Rüffert and others."
"In those cases, the Court's decision went against workers."
"In the Turco case, on the other hand, the Court's decision is positive."
"I welcome this, but my basic criticism still holds, that the Court of Justice determines EU policy and the Court always has the last word in any disputes."
"In the Turco case I welcome the fact that the Court recognised that citizens' control of the legislative process takes absolute precedence."
"This is a step in the right direction, but unfortunately I must say that there are very many steps still to be taken before the EU leaves behind its closed working methods where only those on the inside can see the way forward."
"This is ultimately a question of democracy, participation and transparency."
"It is important for account to be taken of the Turco judgment in the current review of the so-called public access regulation."
"(EL) Mr President, the Turco judgment is a significant step forward for law and democracy."
"It explains the concept of public interest as stated in Regulation 1049/2001 governing public access to documents."
"This concept is to be interpreted such that the right to broader knowledge of the facts leading to decision-making is considered to be more important than, and to outweigh, internal procedure secrecy whereby a decision is taken."
"In other words, according to the Turco judgment, it is important that citizens should not only know - as they have a right to do so - how or why a decision is taken, but also be aware of the documents on which a decision is based, so the documents have to be as widely known as possible."
"Now this leads us in tabling today's oral question to call on the departments of the Commission and the Council to take this decision into account."
"As the President-in-Office has said, let us interpret Regulation 1049/2001 in the light of this new case law."
"Some problems might, of course, also arise in connection with what is known as document secrecy, especially in the case of the opinions of the Legal Department."
"I know only too well, as I am a lawyer."
"Never let us say, though, that such documents should remain secret in case they cause problems."
"Instead, I believe that we should call on a radical change in the culture of transparency."
"Transparency means balance and respect for procedure, not fear of knowledge."
"Let me end with one final remark: we really must see the difference here between what happens in practice in the Council and what happens in our own institution."
"In Parliament, access to meetings and documents is almost total."
"I think the Turco judgment provides an opportunity to bring the Council into line with this, too."
"Mr President, I want to pick up on this point about 'disconnect' which Michael Cashman rightly raised."
"Certainly in the Lisbon Treaty debate in Ireland there was a huge disconnect."
"But let us not blame ourselves here too much, because Member States have a great capacity to blame Europe for things they are uncomfortable with, even though they have agreed to them here."
"I think it is time we all grew up - all our elected politicians, governments, opposition and everyone in this House - and tell the truth."
"I am dispirited to read this magazine this week where an unelected, unaccountable member of a wealthy elite is giving out about the unelected elite in Brussels."
"He has some cheek!"
"But unless we do what Michael Cashman says and tackle him and his ilk upfront, the European elections in June will be a disaster for the people of Europe, and it is about time those of us who believe that said it loudly."
"author. - (FI) Mr President, this court decision is important and categorical."
"It clearly shows that the legislative process in the EU must be under the democratic scrutiny of the people and that protecting the institutions in the decision-making process is of secondary importance."
"It is a clear argument."
"Against this background, I am really rather disappointed with the responses."
"When I heard the Council's response, it was emphasised several times that transparency and openness were important, but there was not much else."
"What has been done?"
"The Commission, meanwhile, has asked for more time."
"The attitude the EU institutions have adopted towards the court decision I think is really interesting."
"What if our citizens were to adopt the same attitude towards the court decision as the Commission and the Council and did not care about the decision at all?"
"It just would not happen."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council Presidency has mentioned the figure of a million published documents."
"When it comes to access to documents, there must be quality as well as quantity, but it is not just about quality."
"If we are going to be honest, there is a problem with the type of documents: meeting documents or documents that accompany the decision-making process."
"It is this that is missing today."
"I will give you an example: Coreper I documents, which are so difficult to find, or documents on foreign policy, which are treated like diplomatic documents, and so are not in the registers."
"These are all documents that are vital for learning about the decision-making process."
"I have only given you one example in the short time available to me."
"In view of the answers that we have been given, I believe that this should also be seen more as an opportunity than a risk for the functioning of the European institutions."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what emerges clearly from our debate is that we must truly increase transparency and communication, because there is indeed a lack of understanding, as you have pointed out, among our citizens about how Europe works."
"Better transparency and better communication go hand in hand."
"As I said, this is the basis on which we signed a political agreement with Mrs Wallström and Mr Vidal-Quadras to communicate better on the ground."
"Mr Cappato and Mrs Jääteenmäki are right that we must be more transparent and explain how we work."
"This is why the Council will make a special effort with new technologies."
"Even after reading the arguments given to me, I agree with Mr Cappato about the fact that producing millions of documents does not mean better transparency."
"What matters is providing documents that people ask for, and documents that are good quality."
"The COREPER I documents that you mentioned, for example, are available online."
"These have not always been ready in time due to a lack of technological resources. Now we have this technology and we will ensure that we resolve the problem you raised."
"To be honest, we must also strike the right balance with the legal basis, with genuine transparency and with the proceedings actually involved."
"There are a number of proceedings and diplomatic issues that are actually quite difficult and where freedom of speech, of expression, of decision-making, must be guaranteed."
"I may seem too conservative to you, but I think that we also need to address this balance."
"The French Presidency has embarked upon a review of Regulation 1049/2001 and we need to act quickly."
"Mr Cashman is absolutely right in this respect."
"With his help and coordination we are acting swiftly, and we hope to make solid progress by the time the French Presidency comes to an end."
"As I said, we need to make sure that, as Mr Cappato pointed out, we put quality before quantity, because there is such a thing as too much information."
"Citizens are then faced with the problem of sifting through information."
"This also exists at European level."
"We must be able to freely help citizens sift through information."
"What does this mean?"
"It means, as I said in my presentation, ensuring that citizens are fully informed about practical information, about their rights, about the outcome of decisions, about the way in which these are taken and about the legal basis."
"From that point of view, there is no doubt that we need to reflect on the resources available to the Council."
"Within the Commission, I think you have been confronted with the same situation when, for example, you have to explain the legal basis for decisions, particularly concerning SMEs, but you only have one or two people in the Member States or institutions who can answer these questions, and those people are on holiday."
"The end result is that citizens and small businesses are forced to wait two or three months before they receive a response."
"To me this seems equally as serious as access to official documents."
"Finally, we need to give our debates political meaning."
"At a time when we are preparing for the European elections, I know that the European Parliament is fully committed to this, and you can count on the French Presidency to ensure that this duty of transparency, this duty of explanation, this practical and concrete obligation is applied because, if we do not, and this is where I agree with Mr Cashman, it will be the extremists who win the next European elections, and this is something that we do not want."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all, the Turco judgment will be respected and implemented by the Commission too, of course."
"The Court judgment actually said that in this case the Council was wrong, that the Council has to correct its procedures, and I am sure that the Council will follow the judgment."
"That is the starting point of this discussion."
"However, it has been partly confused with the discussion we had on Regulation No 1049/2001."
"The Turco judgment is one thing, and then there is Regulation No 1049/2001."
"As you know we presented a proposal and are in the process of dealing with Regulation No 1049/2001 and how that regulation should ultimately be designed."
"I think there must also be some confusion about what I said."
"I did not ask for more time."
"I was explaining the fact that the modernisation of our information technology tools has to be done continuously, it cannot be done overnight."
"We already have a register."
"We are complementing the register with a number of things, such as comitology and all the expert groups."
"However - and I was very honest in trying to answer one of the five questions - I am not convinced that the best thing is to have one register."
"It is like having a telephone book for the whole of Europe instead of trying to have different national telephone books."
"Are you sure that this is better, to have one huge telephone book for the whole of Europe instead of having different entry points?"
"Because the definition you asked for today in your specific question is the definition which is in a certain paragraph, which also includes audiovisual form."
"This is a very wide definition."
"Are you sure it will be helpful to citizens to have one huge entry point for all of this?"
"Let us discuss that, but I am not sure that there is one simple solution like that."
"So we do not share that view."
"Modernising our tools in this area is a constant thing that we have to discuss all the time, because things happen so quickly."
"But we seem to share the same objectives of having openness and transparency and access to documents."
"That is the starting point and that is what we will continue to fight for and we will of course follow the Turco judgment."
"On the specific issue where I mentioned that we have a target date for 2010, that is on a very specific project and I was just giving you the date for this."
"But in general we do not and should not need to ask for more time."
"This is something we have to do on a daily basis: to provide more openness, more transparency, to serve citizens because they need to know, and it has to be part of the culture and the attitude of all the institutions."
"Along with your fellow Members I was able to applaud your good speech, Mr Cashman, because it contains the starting point for what is required now: to open up, to create access."
"I think that having our deliberations in the open will also help people to make their own informed judgment of what is going on and of why we have so many important things on our agenda."
"The debate is closed."
"One-minute speeches on matters of political importance"
"The next item is one-minute speeches on matters of political importance."
"(EL) Mr President, as a member of the Committee on International Trade, I naturally devote some attention to relations between the EU and China."
"I have therefore noticed that, according to the figures for 2007, the EU trade deficit has risen to around EUR 160 billion."
"This deficit is a consequence of the serious barriers blocking access to the Chinese market."
"It is certainly also due to the competitive advantage of Chinese products, but this is based on economic, social and ecological dumping practices."
"However, this unequal trade relationship is not the only cause for concern; another is the case of unsafe products coming from China."
"We should therefore - and I address this message mainly to the Commission - ensure that products from China are subject to thorough, effective inspection, in the interests of public health and the protection of European consumers, and also in the interests of the competitiveness of European products."
"Madam President, the turbulent financial events of the last few days have changed the world."
"We have all been concerned for some time now about the potential problems in the global financial system, but the rapid fall of the major banks, one after the other in quick succession, has been astonishing."
"I therefore welcome the moves by the UK Government today to increase stability."
"Although it is outside the Eurozone, the measures taken by the UK are all in line with the decisions made yesterday in the Ecofin Council."
"I only wish that some of the countries in the Eurozone had acted in the same way."
"In order to get through the challenges we will face, there is an urgent need for the European Union to provide leadership and coordinate a strategy with EU national governments."
"Europe must take a central role, not a back seat, especially if the EU wants to connect with the people of Europe."
"But we also need to recognise that this crisis has been brought about by market failures, a lack of appropriate legislation and as a result of decisions taken by a few selfish individuals on fat-cat bonuses that will affect the lives of millions, and even billions, of people around the world."
"We need to ensure that such criminal negligence can never reoccur and we need those responsible to be held accountable for the full weight of their actions."
"(RO) Ladies and Gentleman, I would like to take this opportunity to plead once more for stronger involvement of the European Union in the improvement of health services in the European Union Member States."
"It is very true that organisation of the health system falls within the competence of the Member States, but the European Community has some competencies too and the important role of the European Community in the health sector was reaffirmed in the Lisbon Reform Treaty."
"The peoples of the European Union are growing old and they are subject to new threats: pandemics, physical and biological incidents, bioterrorism; we must find solutions to all of these together."
"We should also develop a mechanism for a structured cooperation among the Member States, an information exchange and a best practices mechanism for preventing, fighting and treating diseases in the European Union countries."
"The Directive on transboundary medical services was a very good initiative."
"However, I believe that it should be followed by other initiatives just as brave, because an important role that the European institutions should assume is that of reducing health-related inequalities."
"(HU) Madam President, as a Christian and a Hungarian, and a Member of the European Parliament, I speak out now in defence of the community of half a million people of Hungarian origin living in Slovakia, a part of the European Union."
"In other words, I speak in defence of democratic European values."
"While I can congratulate Slovakia on the economic results it has achieved, I have regretfully to say that extreme nationalist propaganda is directed against Slovakian Hungarians, resulting in an intimidating hysteria."
"I would ask the President, Hans-Gert Pöttering, the European Parliament and the European Commission to take action against the brutal violation of human and minority rights and the ethnic intolerance, verbal aggression and discrimination ruling in Slovakia."
"As a European MEP, I am ready to undertake an intermediary role in the interests of Hungarian- Slovak harmony."
"(PL) Madam President, I would like to draw Parliament's attention to the situation of Christians in Vietnam."
"For 50 years they have been obliged to renounce their faith, they have had their property confiscated and they have been resettled in different regions."
"In recent times this persecution has been particularly starkly manifested in Hanoi, where the authorities are brutally intervening against Catholics from the Thai Ha community who are protesting against the unlawful seizure of lands belonging to this community, which is run by the Redemptorist Fathers."
"For example, on 31 August participants in a procession were subjected to brutal beatings."
"More than 20 people suffered serious injuries and were taken to hospital."
"Journalists were also beaten, including Associated Press reporter Ben Stocking."
"Let us do all we can to ensure that Vietnam, which is currently a member of the UN Security Council, observes human rights."
"(DE) Madam President, this evening my report on promoting social inclusion and combating poverty, including child poverty, is the last item on the agenda."
"This is an own initiative report which is being handled according to Rules 131 a and 45 of our Rules of Procedure on short presentations in plenary, i.e. in a presentation without open debate by Members and without the opportunity to propose amendments."
"I object to this self-limitation of the rights of Members of the European Parliament and call for us as the European Parliament to change these rules."
"It is wrong for important matters such as combating poverty and social exclusion not to be discussed openly here."
"All the same, the committee has debated intensely and made 200 amendments and 40 compromise amendments."
"It is a matter of public interest and we are denying ourselves some of our own rights when we forego discussing it here in plenary."
"(PL) Madam President, in India the number of Christian martyrs horribly murdered by Hindu executioners is still on the rise."
"The Catholic Church is appealing in various parts of the world to governments and international institutions for aid for Christians in India, Iraq and Vietnam, so far without success."
"Sadly, the persecution of Christians is still accompanied by passivity, not only on the part of representatives of the government and legal institutions in that location, but also on the part of other democratic governments and international institutions that are actively involved in other instances of human rights violation, and this also concerns the European Union."
"I would therefore like to protest before the European Parliament against the fact that human rights violations in India, Iraq and Vietnam are being ignored - I am also addressing the European Commission here - and I would like to appeal for diplomatic intervention and objection where such acts of barbarity have occurred."
"Passivity in the face of persecution may constitute evidence of a particular kind of discrimination against Catholics."
"(SK) In the past 50 years, the strong Slovak national minority in Hungary of over 200 000 people has been almost completely annihilated."
"On the other hand, the Hungarian minorities in the surrounding countries, Slovakia included, are growing."
"Paradoxically, for many years the Hungarians have been making Europeans believe that it is their minority that is oppressed."
"Several current Hungarian political leaders talk openly about the idea of a Greater Hungary."
"Sadly, this goes unnoticed by Europe's senior politicians."
"The Hungarian Parliament organises in its chambers a cross-border forum of Hungarian Members of Parliament for the Carpathian Basin."
"Representatives of ethnic Hungarian political parties in Slovakia and Romania openly meet to discuss autonomy."
"In today's Europe such attitudes are unacceptable and dangerous."
"(RO) Mr President, Romania is unfortunately facing a serious issue which endangers the safety and the health of European citizens: the use of non-sterile surgical thread imported from China in hospitals."
"The Romanian Ministry of Health has known about this problem since August but, in spite of warnings that this might cause infections or even lead to the death of patients, it did not stop it in time."
"The alarm was sounded after a patient died in hospital due to an infection and other patients are facing the same danger."
"I believe that this is a warning signal not only for Romania but for all of Europe."
"The fact that more and more products brought from China raise question marks and endanger the health and safety of European citizens is a very serious matter."
"Not so long ago we had problems with sweets contaminated from powdered milk containing melanine, also imported from China."
"We import products from China because they are cheaper, but I believe that Europe should put the health of its citizens first."
"I am asking Commissioner Vassiliou to start an investigation in order to prevent any other incidents in the Member States."
"We need urgent measures to inspect these products so as to stop imports to the internal market in due time."
"(FR) Madam President, the fragility of demand for new vehicles is evidenced by the downturn in Europe's automotive industry."
"A leading French manufacturer has just announced 4000 job losses, plus 2000 job losses in Europe."
"At the same time, despite a 37% increase in profits in the first half, it is still determined to go ahead with the job cuts."
"On the pretext of rationalisation, there is too much focus on profitability at the expense of and without thought for ambitious industrial policies and, more importantly, without thought for workers."
"I would like to act as spokesman for these workers, who are the most affected by these measures, who are victims of this situation, and encourage this manufacturer to rethink its strategy and save jobs at the same time."
"At a time when we face an employment crisis, this should be the main priority."
"In this spirit, the decision regarding the proposal for a regulation to reduce CO2 emissions from new vehicles must balance different aspects: sustainable development and safeguarding employment through innovative industrial policies at all levels, particularly at the social level."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a violation of the principles of democracy is taking place in Italy to which I would like to draw the attention of my fellow Members: for the past 18 months, the Italian Parliament has refused to elect a judge to the Constitutional Court, as it is required to do by the Italian Constitution, and for the past six months the Italian Parliament has refused to appoint the parliamentary oversight committee for the information system."
"I do not have time to go into details. We have sent Members a pack containing detailed information."
"My colleague Marco Pannella has been on hunger and thirst strike since midnight last Saturday to protest against the unlawful actions of the President of the Italian Republic."
"We have received votes of confidence from 25 MEPs, who have signed a resolution in accordance with Article 7 of the Treaties."
"My time is up, so I would just like to ask you to read it and to support it."
"(DE) Madam President, this year marks the 60th anniversary of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights."
"In the last 60 years countless human rights groups and organisations around the world have used this declaration as the basis for their activities, for example Charter 77 in Czechoslovakia, Solidarity in Poland and the human rights movement in Latin America."
"Human rights policy is still just as important today."
"It has not yet made its way into all areas of politics."
"We must not allow human rights to be relegated to a special item alongside our other political areas, but must seek to contend for human rights, even though that entails certain disadvantages."
"As a fundamental value, human rights are one of the strongest supporting pillars in the European house, so we must also be more mindful of them in our own work as well."
"I therefore support the idea of making the Subcommittee on Human Rights a standing committee, in view of its significance."
"(PL) Madam President, the review of the common agricultural policy clearly highlights hazards in various branches of agriculture."
"Much has been said about the need for reform in the sugar market, the tobacco market and the fruit and vegetables market."
"There is mention of a need to increase quotas, including milk quotas, to release fallow land for the sowing of cereals, while other problems, such as the problem facing European apiculture, are left in the shade."
"Bees are dying in large numbers because of a range of diseases, the best known of which are Varroa and Nosema."
"Bees are also linked to pollination issues and are a guarantee of biodiversity in our existence and persistence in the world of nature."
"This is why I would like to draw your attention to this subject today, as we usually see bees in terms of honey, propolis or wax."
"Were it not for Mrs Lulling's resolution, we in the European Parliament would undoubtedly be indifferently skirting around the problems associated with apiculture."
"What is needed is an urgent programme to rescue bees and apiculture in the European Union."
"(PT) There have recently been closures of companies in Portugal, in particular in the textiles and clothing sectors, especially in the north of the country, for example, the textiles company Oliveira Ferreira in Riba de Ave and several in the Barcelos, Santo Tirso and Fafe areas."
"They were recently joined by the factory of the multinational Lee in Évora, not to mention the threat hanging over workers in many others, such as in Vila Nova de Gaia and Lousada."
"Against this backdrop of dismissals, hundreds of other companies are not complying with labour laws and are using the threat of unemployment to pay wages below the legal minimum and are discriminating against young people and women, as was recently revealed in a study by the Textiles, Clothing, Footwear and Leather Workers' Trade Union of the District of Porto on the Tâmega and Sousa sub-regions."
"It is therefore particularly important to know what the European Commission intends to do about the double checking system for trade with China, which expires at the end of this year, bearing in mind the need to defend production and jobs with rights in our countries."
"(PL) Madam President, in India repression aimed at Christians is showing no signs of waning."
"People continue to be murdered because of their religion - simply because they are Christians."
"Catholic churches are being destroyed."
"Violence is being used even against defenceless nuns who look after the poor."
"The Indian Government is not doing anything effective to guarantee human rights in this country, particularly the right to life and the right to freedom of belief."
"The European Union, which has built its phraseology and its institutions on attitudes to human rights, has so far not reacted in any serious way to defend the rights of Christians who are being murdered in India."
"At the EU-India summit no pressure was brought to bear on India to cease the martyrdom of believers in Christ."
"At the European Parliament, on the 60th anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, we are celebrating an occasional conference devoted to human rights."
"Have the excellent speakers made any demands concerning the rights of the Christians being persecuted today, and not only in India?"
"We are, then, faced with a question - do the EU and its leaders take the doctrine of human rights seriously?"
"Do they apply it to all people?"
"Are double standards perhaps being applied?"
"Is the preaching of human rights meant to defend all kinds of minorities, including sexual minorities, but not the rights of people who are being murdered because of their Christian faith?"
"Europe, wake up!"
"(SK) From the outset, Slovakia has strived to create equal conditions for all of its citizens."
"Without any doubt, Slovakia today is a perfect example of how to treat national minorities."
"This cannot be said about Hungary, where the Slovak minority was brutally assimilated."
"Of all the national minorities living in Slovakia, the Hungarian minority in particular has a special place."
"In Slovakia, it has a political party represented in Parliament."
"The school system allows education in the Hungarian language from nursery school right through to university, and many students leave universities without any knowledge of the Slovak language."
"Consequently, I consider the establishment of the Carpathian Basin Forum, comprising Hungarian Members of Parliaments from sovereign states that are members of the European Union, set on establishing autonomy, to be a provocation and absurdity that is inappropriate in this 21st century."
"Madam President, amidst the angst and concern about the banking sector there is perhaps some hope."
"I am glad that the Commissioner for Agriculture is here to listen to me because maybe it is at a time of crisis that Europe can actually rise to the challenge."
"Remember the BSE crisis when the entire beef industry and food sector was in collapse and confidence was gone, and Europe reacted by bringing in tough regulations from farm to fork, traceability with penalties."
"Let us say to the banking sector, this is their BSE moment, and they will rise from the ashes, but they will have to be better regulated."
"They will have to be tagged and traced - the people and the money - and those who are engaged in bad practices will have to be penalised."
"But there is hope."
"We have experience, and I believe that Europe will be better as a result of this crisis because we will regulate better."
"(FR) Madam President, I would like to go back to the rather unorthodox statements made by Mr Barroso."
"He implies that he would be willing to forget the sacrosanct rules of competition; that he would be less particular about state aid."
"If it were a question of saving a particular sector of European industry, if it were a question of allowing Member States to invest in research or even of launching an ambitious European loan, I would welcome this U-turn."
"However, it is a question of the large-scale repurchasing of toxic financial products held by financial operators. It is a question, at the end of the day, of saving the financial hooligans who make light of the efforts of market regulators."
"If the Commission reviews its doctrine, then so much the better."
"However, this has to be done properly, by being more flexible about the question of state aid in strategic sectors in Europe that are under threat, and by driving forward measures concerning rating agencies, the fight against speculation based on food prices and the regulation of speculative funds."
"We have been calling for this for years, and now we have the proof: the credo of free competition and the free market have clearly led to a dead end."
"(FR) Madam President, for once we have something to smile about."
"In the current climate, in which Europe, the fatherland of yesteryear, is again in the process of destroying our European birthright, it is difficult to know what to say."
"Well then, here is a surprise."
"Yesterday, the French newspaper Le Monde - and I would like to thank its new editor Eric Fottorino for this - published a wonderful editorial with a cartoon by Plantu, in which this non-institutional G4 that we have just invented is depicted as follows: we have the Krauts, the Eyeties, the treacherous Albion and the French uniting to destroy Europe, each one thinking of its own petty interests, faced with a Parliament, a self-styled Parliament, which still fails to make itself understood."
"Thank you Le Monde, thank you Plantu."
"Plantu for President!"
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(PL) Madam President, in its declarations the European Union expresses concern for the growth of employment and for a high level of social security."
"The Commission's approach to the question of the Polish shipyards, however, runs counter to these declarations."
"In the European Union public aid may be used to subsidise failing banks, and it may be used without restriction in areas that were formerly part of communist Germany."
"What about equal treatment of economic entities?"
"Shipyards in what we call 'the old EU' have been receiving aid for many years and everything was fine."
"The new Member States, which should have the opportunity to catch up with the rest of the Community in economic terms, are being treated by the Commission as conquered territory."
"I am convinced that, in the forthcoming elections to the European Parliament, the Polish electorate will show by their voting how opposed they are to this European solidarity."
"Madam President, for years I have been warning that the European arrest warrant could be used to suppress free speech on the Internet."
"This has now happened."
"On 1 October, Dr Frederick Toben was arrested at Heathrow Airport on a European arrest warrant issued in Germany for alleged xenophobic crimes committed on the Internet."
"Dr Toben is a Holocaust denier."
"His views are repugnant to all reasonable people. But this is not the point."
"He has been arrested in Britain for publishing his views on the Internet in Australia."
"Holocaust denial, while repellent, is not illegal in Britain or Australia."
"If this European arrest warrant is executed, its use proves that, if someone expresses themselves on the Internet in terms legal in their own country, they can be extradited to another EU country where those views are illegal."
"This would have profound implications for free speech within nation states."
"(HU) Thank you, Madam President."
"Unfortunately, after the dispute about the foaming of the River Rába, there is now another Austro-Hungarian environmental protection debate in the European Parliament."
"The Austrian BEGAS corporation is planning to construct a 325 000-tonne-capacity waste incinerator just a few hundred metres from the Hungarian border, at Heiligenkreuz."
"This new plant will be able to take waste not just from local sources but from other areas too."
"The project has an exceptionally low level of support from the local communities in both Austria and Hungary."
"A particular cause I have for concern is that the planned incinerator would be barely a kilometre from the Hungarian town of Szentgotthárd, which lies in the predominant wind direction, and the Őrség National Park, which is protected under Natura 2000 and which contains the Őrség, recently a winner of the EDEN prize."
"There would be unforeseen consequences for a region of Hungary which relies on its natural beauty, national parks and eco-tourism."
"Finally, Madam President, I would like to ask why the Slovak Member who was uttering a diatribe full of hatred against Hungarians was allowed to speak on two occasions."
"This is a procedural matter. Thank you."
"(SK) I would like to object very strongly to the comments we have heard here accusing the Slovak Government of disseminating hatred and violating the rights of the national minorities in the Slovak Republic."
"Ladies and gentlemen, my fellow Member, Mr Tőkés, the Slovak Government's Statement of Policy contains a declaration of rights of minorities and the government consequently observes these rights."
"I deeply regret the fact that the Hungarian Members are using one-minute speeches, in every single part-session of the European Parliament, to attack the Slovak Government and, by extension, the citizens of the Slovak Republic too."
"Madam President, the Slovak Government appreciates good relations with its neighbours and wants to have good relations with its neighbours."
"However, two partners are needed for good bilateral relations."
"So far, it is only the Slovak Government that has offered the hand of friendship."
"(SK) The results of the three-year study by the World Health Organisation on health inequalities between different populations in the world are alarming."
"The situation is caused by socio-economic conditions, not by biological factors."
"An average Japanese girl, for example, can expect to live to the age of 83. In Lesotho in Africa, her life expectancy would be 42."
"The chance of a woman dying when giving birth in Sweden is 1 to 17 000; in Afghanistan the ratio is 1 to 8."
"Those who live in poor areas of large European cities can expect their lives, on average, to be 28 years shorter than those who live in wealthier areas."
"A combination of poor policies, inadequate social conditions, a low level of education, substandard accommodation, limited access to healthy food, etc., is the reason why the majority of people are not as healthy as biologically possible."
"The WHO Commission on Social Determinants is of the opinion that by adopting a pro-active approach the inequalities can be reduced within a relatively short space of time."
"Madam President, the recent publication of the first-ever Eurobarometer survey of our citizens' views on climate change marks the rise of climate change from being a niche environmental issue to being at the heart of European policy."
"Given the global economic and financial turmoil at the moment, I can fully understand the concerns of colleagues as we as politicians address what is unquestionably the single greatest moral, environmental, social and economic challenge facing the whole of mankind, namely global warming from our greenhouse gas emissions, or climate change."
"But it will not wait;"
"Copenhagen will not wait and we cannot be found wanting."
"As rapporteur for one of the four dossiers of the post-2012 climate change regime - namely the ETS review - I have full confidence in our governments to resolve, in the shorter term, these major economic and financial issues with which we are presented today, and resolve them long before 2013."
"So while it is the nature of politics to focus on today's problems today, we must not be distracted from legislating now for the longer term, for the post-2012 scenario, on this most important of issues, or history will not judge us kindly."
"(SK) It is bewildering to see the abuse of this House and the politicking focused on the Slovak political scene."
"I listened carefully to the words of my fellow Member from Hungary, Mr Tőkés, and I have to protest against the one-sided view of current events and its presentation as a universal attack on the actions of the Slovak Republic in this area."
"I would like to emphasise that even though the minority policy of the present Slovak Government conforms to all European standards, the Government wishes to continue to improve it even further."
"I want to condemn the attempts to misuse specific moments of difficulty and present them as a bad attitude on the part of the government in principle, and, above all, doing so in the European Parliament."
"By actively seeking points of friction and distorting the situation we will merely be igniting and fuelling artificial conflicts, which are pointless and unnecessary and which make life for Slovak society complicated and unpleasant."
"That concludes the item."
"Suspension of the WTO Doha Round (debate)"
"The next item is the Commission statement on the suspension of the WTO Doha Round."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I presume you had expected to see Commissioner Mandelson here tonight, but as you probably know he left the Commission, and I won the lottery to take over from Mr Mandelson here tonight."
"Having been directly involved in the negotiations in Geneva at the WTO with responsibility for the agricultural sector, I am however happy to be here with you tonight."
"While the negotiations in Geneva in July did not succeed, the Doha Round has not been suspended."
"On the contrary, it has actually been kept active, even over the past few weeks, and it is our intention to contribute constructively to this activity in order to facilitate full ministerial resumption in due course, once the necessary technical analyses now being undertaken by key countries on the remaining problematic issues have been completed."
"The negotiations that took place in July delivered some real progress."
"The emerging package outlined a possible balanced outcome which respected the European Union's key requirements in agriculture while delivering valuable benefits for our industrial manufacturers."
"A broad outline of the agreement has emerged on different key issues, including the overall reduction in trade-distorting domestic support in the agricultural sector, the scope that developed and developing countries would retain to shield a limited number of sensitive and special products from tariff cuts, the Swiss formula used to determine tariff cuts for industrial products, and the flexibility to be made available to developing countries to shield a number of industrial products from those cuts."
"In the assessment made by the Commission, this package contains real value for European business and consumers and would ensure an international legal framework for agriculture fully in line with the 2003 reform."
"In our opinion, the emerging package also contains real development value for the poorest countries in the world."
"A Round concluded on this basis would reduce world tariffs by half and, while developing countries would contribute one-third of the savings, they would benefit from two-thirds of the increased market access."
"It would also ensure that OECD economies join Europe's initiative in providing least developed countries with duty free and quota free access to their markets - what we normally call our 'everything but arms' initiative."
"We would also have succeeded in locking in real farm reform in the United States."
"With an agreement, the United States would have had to reduce their trade-distorting domestic support or subsidies to USD 14.5 billion."
"Without it, subsidies can now go up to USD 48 billion under the new farm bill."
"It would also serve our interests to get permanent international legal protection of our reformed common agricultural policy."
"A deal on this basis would turn the emerging countries into custodians of the multilateral trading system which needs to be preserved but also to be strengthened."
"We would anchor them more firmly into the rule-based system of global trade which is essential for the future."
"It was therefore a disappointment that it proved impossible to close the discussions on the Doha modalities in July because of continuing disagreement on a very specific point in the agricultural field."
"The difficulties arose over the issue of special agricultural safeguards for developing countries, the so-called SSM, essentially within the G7 grouping."
"India and China were unable to agree with the United States over the triggers and the remedies to be put in place for this safeguard when it is used to breach pre-Doha-Round rates."
"Since early September, contacts have been taking place at senior official level to try to resolve this continuing difference of views, but we have not yet been successful on this issue."
"Though the European Union remains firmly committed and engaged, it is actually unclear how far discussions will pick up in the coming weeks."
"As normal, we will maintain strong dialogue with Parliament and we will of course hope for your continued support on this issue."
"Mr President, the cost of the collapse of the Doha Round of negotiations is not to be counted only in terms of lost opportunities, lost profits and a worsening of the climate of economic uncertainty."
"Equally critical is the systemic cost and institutional cost."
"I refer to the blow to the WTO's credibility."
"Of course, we all want to reach an agreement, but not if it is something to be achieved regardless of the cost to the EU."
"A successful conclusion of the current round of negotiations requires a comprehensive, ambitious and balanced agreement."
"We therefore demand substantial concessions both from our developed trade partners and from the dynamically developing countries."
"We therefore call on the Commission to take a decisive negotiating stance in future."
"There has been a reform of the CAP. I ask you: has this been used as a negotiating tool?"
"Far from it: the Commission has proceeded unilaterally with a series of additional, fruitless offers to the agricultural sector."
"There are many questions I could put to the Commissioner for Agriculture."
"I shall restrict myself to one: does the issue of geographical indications form an essential part of agricultural negotiations?"
"Our commitment to a multilateral trading system can be taken for granted."
"We look forward to trade governance aiming at effective management of globalisation and a more equitable redistribution of its benefits."
"To conclude, let me say that I personally believe the negative completion - that is, the removal of barriers in the WTO framework - has not been adequately backed up by the necessary positive integration in terms of regulatory systemic convergence."
"Madam President, as we know from experience, world trade rounds are very difficult."
"I would like to thank the Commission because, as we, the Members of the European Parliament, experienced many times in the talks during the last round in Geneva, it conducted itself in a very balanced way right to the very end, and because the Commissioner, in her area of competence, showed not only the necessary flexibility but also great sympathy for the poorer developing countries, and this was constantly pointed out to us in the talks."
"To that extent, it was not the European Union that was exposed to public scorn this time, but other countries, which were actually much more difficult negotiating partners."
"I regret that, confronted with the current financial crisis, we find that we need more international and multilateral rules, because these rules form a corset that will make it possible for poorer countries to integrate themselves, on the one hand, while richer countries will also be able to ensure that their people benefit from this, and that standards are set, on the other."
"What we really regret is that this is apparently the reason why this world trade round cannot be completed by the end of the year."
"We should rid ourselves of this misconception."
"Perhaps it is better that way, in that we will tackle all this with the new Parliament and the new Commission and after the elections in the United States, instead of getting it done by any means."
"My group would recommend caution, rather than bringing this round to a conclusion come hell or high water."
"Commissioner, I do have one request: however you negotiate and whatever happens, please inform Parliament in good time and make sure, too, that whether we get the Lisbon Treaty or not, we take another look at whether we can perhaps create some kind of 'quasi Lisbon Treaty' in advance, relating to the area of trade."
"Madam President, some of us witnessed the real efforts made by all the participants in the July Ministerial Summit of the Doha Round, and in particular the efforts of the European Union, represented very worthily by Commissioner Mandelson."
"The presence at the negotiations in Geneva of the Commissioner who is here today was also appreciated."
"There was therefore a feeling of frustration that we were able to experience at first hand, at seeing that in the end all these efforts and energies did not produce any tangible results, even though they had reached a level of rapprochement that seemed to mean that there could be some sort of result."
"In the resolution we are tabling today, which will be voted on in this house, we express our commitment as Parliament to what was achieved there."
"We ask that what was achieved there, even though it was not really a final agreement, should be the basis on which work now begins, so that the efforts are not wasted."
"We ask, in a spirit of naivety, with a touch of naivety, for the Doha Round to be completed as soon as possible."
"It is possible, indeed probable, that some think that this statement is naïve; even more so given that the main European negotiator did not even believe in it sufficiently and returned to his country, leaving all the negotiations on behalf of Europe in the hands of someone who knows nothing about what is on the table, despite the future capacities that she may have."
"It is therefore true that there is a great deal of naivety in our resolution, but we need to be clear and firm."
"If the Doha Round is not concluded, developing countries will lose out."
"If the Doha Round is not concluded, the multilateral approach is at serious risk, especially in a situation of global uncertainty such as we are experiencing, that until the Doha Round is concluded, the other matters on the global agenda such as climate change and the rising price of food cannot be tackled."
"There are other matters to be resolved and none of them can be resolved unless we make an effort to conclude this round of negotiations."
"Parliament will continue to be committed to this."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, I am very happy that this House has become rather more critical towards the Doha Round in recent years."
"In fact, the joint resolution in front of us reflects very faithfully the declaration of the Global Parliamentary Assembly in September, which expresses very serious concerns about the very little development content that remains in the Doha negotiations and is very critical of its ever more exclusive deal-making procedures."
"Let me add that, in the spirit of the declaration of that Global Parliamentary Assembly, I hope that the amendment put forward by the PPE-DE Group and the UEN Group, calling for bilateral WTO-plus type free trade agreements, will not be carried in tomorrow's vote."
"Bilateral FTAs are exactly the opposite of a functioning multilateralism and Greens will not be able to support the resolution, if indeed that amendment is carried."
"What strikes me in our debate today, and indeed in this resolution, is the failure of courage to name a simple truth - that the Doha Round negotiations, as we have got to know them, are now over."
"That suspension could well be long, lasting until the spring of 2010."
"It is almost certain that the new negotiators of the US, the Commission, India, will not be going back to the same old quick fixes of July 2008 that did not work even then."
"So this is actually an opportunity."
"This is exactly the right time to evaluate the failures of the last seven years of Doha talks and to re-establish a common and fairer agenda, together with a more open and democratic process, which can be fully supported by all WTO members and especially the least developed among them."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when you negotiate for seven years without coming to a conclusion, then you have to be a little bit self-critical and ask what mistakes you may have made, regardless of the mistakes made by other countries or other parties to the negotiations."
"I believe it is possible to make a list - it does not necessarily apply to everyone, but perhaps the call for eliminating tariffs and opening the markets is not the right instrument for the developing countries, because they would lose the income they need for their own budgets and they have no way of getting it from elsewhere."
"Then it would not be possible for health care, education or development of infrastructure to take place in these countries."
"For some of these countries, a free trade agreement of any kind is not the right model and they have an interest in concluding a trade agreement, but on the basis of GSP+."
"Perhaps it is true that at that level of development, many countries need to develop an independent economy first."
"After all, the European Union, or some European countries, developed their economies in closed markets."
"If a result is not achieved, one must ask why that is."
"The Doha Round was originally bound to the Millennium Development Goals."
"I do not share Mr Ó Neachtain's view: I understand why many countries say they feel that the current negotiations serve exclusively to enable companies active globally to become even more global, and this is what the Global Europe strategy also says."
"This has a negative effect on small regional producers."
"Incidentally, it also has a negative effect on European small local producers."
"It is part of the raison d'être of the European Union, part of its imperative, that we move forward."
"Therefore, perhaps we need to consider a different negotiating tactic."
"I hope that the new Commissioner will take that opportunity."
"She comes from outside; she has negotiating experience."
"Although she may not have the necessary knowledge in trade matters, she has a well-informed team, and perhaps she will use the opportunity within the framework of the mandate rather differently to the way the previous Commissioner did - and we do have an opportunity!"
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - The EU likes to throw its weight around when it comes to trade."
"Remember the six-year-long banana war with the US?"
"That was after the EU gave special market access to its former colonies in the Caribbean."
"The Director-General of the WTO is former trade Commissioner Pascal Lamy."
"Is there not perhaps a conflict of interests?"
"After all, his EU pension might depend on him not attacking EU policies."
"Could that have been a factor in his mind as he attempted to negotiate between trading blocs?"
"Peter Mandelson blamed the collapse of the Doha Round on US agricultural subsidies."
"Talk about the pot calling the kettle black!"
"For decades the common agricultural policy has been stuffing the pockets of EU farmers with enormous subsidies."
"This was as much to blame for the collapse of the trade talks as anything else."
"Anyway, the last thing the EU should be doing is scoring points against other regions in trade wars at a time of global hunger and financial crisis."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, the current financial crisis is proof that, when a problem is global, we need global action."
"This is particularly true in food and agriculture."
"This is largely why the World Trade Organisation was created, and we all agree on this."
"The WTO tries to have globalised rules."
"However, it seems that this does not function exactly as we would like, because we are faced with the following problem: we need to reconcile two things, the free trade that we all agree on, and protection, which is also necessary."
"Protecting our economies or national agriculture is not a byword for protectionism."
"To do this, the road that we have taken over the past 60 years, since GATT, has been a rocky one, with tariffs being cut with a view to scrapping them altogether."
"Technically, lowering customs tariffs seems to be difficult."
"As proof, look at the number of mathematical formulas that exist for this purpose: the South Korean formula, the European formula, and of course the Swiss formula."
"This does not really work, because a product is not unitary."
"It is composed of numerous elements with very different rules of origin, so technically, reducing customs tariffs is not as simple as we might think."
"Therefore, we find ourselves in a technical rut, and it is through negotiations that we are trying, politically, to find a way out of this rut."
"However, scientists have apparently invented a new customs technology: customs tariffs that are deductible for the exporter against the importing state's economy."
"In concrete terms, this deductible customs tariff amounts to a customs credit equal to the amount of duty that the exporter has incurred in the importing country."
"There are three sides to this customs credit: it is refundable, negotiable and transferable."
"First of all, it is refundable: when the exporter goes to buy something from the importer, he can deduct the amount of duty paid."
"Secondly, it is negotiable, because if the exporting company, which has paid duty, has nothing to buy from the importer, it can sell its customs credit on the stock market or to a bank."
"Finally, it is transferable: to help developing countries, the importer can donate the surplus customs credit above the amount of customs duty."
"Well, with this technique, we create a trade currency, where the money supply is equal to the amount of existing customs tariffs."
"The European Union, for example, would provide EUR 13 billion in trade currency."
"Madam President, like others here, I was in Geneva and was amazed and amused sometimes at how the WTO works."
"In this case, it did not."
"For once the common agriculture policy was not directly in the firing line and I think that is to be welcomed."
"But agriculture at a more global level very definitely was still top of the agenda."
"The talks collapsed because India and China were concerned about protecting their farmers from agricultural import surges."
"I think the words of the Indian Trade Commissioner are worth repeating."
"Kamal Nath said: 'This is the last mile we could not run because of an issue of livelihood security.'"
"India saw protection of its large and relatively poor rural and farming population as vital and believed that a WTO agreement was not in its best interests."
"We are now seven years into the process."
"Peter Mandelson has left the stage after four years at the helm."
"I believe he failed to listen to the concerns of farmers, particularly European Union farmers, and the food industry, and dismissed their voice by claiming that the development part of the agenda was to the fore."
"His proposals would have decimated the EU livestock sector, not to the benefit of the developing world, but rather to the low-cost emerging economies and their large ranches and ranchers."
"As I said, he has now left the stage and I wonder whether he saw the writing on the wall."
"If he really was concerned about the development agenda, why did he not stay and complete the work?"
"Food security is now a big political priority."
"We are seeing huge fluctuations in the price of commodities."
"I understand that the grain market has collapsed today."
"We have to ask ourselves whether this is the best way of ensuring the supply of food to all consumers at reasonable prices. More importantly, we should look at our development policy, where we have failed to invest in agriculture in the developing world."
"Let us go for a deal but one that is fair and balanced."
"(FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, since 2001, developing countries have been negotiating a round within the WTO described as the development round."
"Now in the face of a sudden and devastating food crisis, alerting the world to the urgent need to find a long-term global and balanced solution, these countries expect a clear response from us to guarantee their food security."
"I would like to confirm that, if the round continued to be about market access at any price, we would not achieve our objective."
"We also know that, the more we postpone the signing of a development agreement, the further away the prospects are of achieving the Millennium Development Goals, and unfortunately we are already way behind schedule."
"Faced with this crisis situation, we ask that a political solution be found as soon as possible to the special safeguard mechanism in order to produce an effective protection tool for small producers in poor countries."
"This is an essential step before continuing negotiations on other aspects, and I hope that the recent resumption of talks on agriculture and non-agricultural market access (NAMA) will allow progress in this respect."
"Before I finish, I would like to describe the amendments tabled to the joint resolution."
"The Socialist Group in the European Parliament will of course ask us to vote in favour of Amendment 2, which is absolutely essential for increasing the rights of Parliament in international trade."
"We also support the amendments tabled by The Greens/European Free Alliance, but we cannot accept the amendment tabled by the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, for we believe that it is not appropriate, in this resolution on multilateral negotiations, to call for new regional bilateral agreements to be signed, since we know that these are usually negotiated at the expense of the weakest."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, once again - yet again - a Doha Round has failed."
"Is the WTO simply boring the world now?"
"Certainly not!"
"We really were almost at the point of agreement."
"There was not very much left to be done, but at the last moment, India and China - of all countries - caused the talks to collapse."
"That makes it very clear that the talks did not run aground for technical reasons but that the event had a political nature, as it shows that the new power centre of the world trade round is in Asia and no longer so much in Europe."
"China's role is considerable, as China has so far always been committed to free trade, but suddenly it apparently has a new agenda."
"Nevertheless, I would like to extend sincere congratulations to the Commission - to you, Commissioner, and also to Commissioner Mandelson, on the positive role played by the EU."
"Unlike in Hong Kong, we were involved in the negotiations, were pro-active and were prepared to make compromises."
"It is rather a shame, though, that Mr Mandelson is leaving at this point; it means we have to change horses in midstream."
"He was a good negotiator."
"He hassled us a lot in Parliament, and he leaves big shoes for Lady Ashton to fill."
"All the best!"
"(SV) Madam President, I am a staunch Eurosceptic, but there are two areas where the EU must play a central international role - trade policy and environment policy."
"We are now talking about trade policy."
"Free global trade is the key to economic prosperity for all the countries of the world, particularly the poorest."
"The setback in the Doha round over the summer was therefore very serious and it is now up to the EU, the world's biggest trading organisation, to take a new initiative."
"It is therefore highly unfortunate that Peter Mandelson, our most competent Commission member, is leaving his post as Commissioner responsible for the EU's trade policy."
"At the same time, the world economy is threatened by a devastating financial crisis."
"In these circumstances, the UK Government is proposing a replacement who clearly is not up to the task."
"It is now the responsibility of the European Parliament to ensure that we get a strong, competent Trade Commissioner at this dangerous point in history."
"Let us take that responsibility!"
"Madam President, may I first of all raise with the Commissioner the problem of the situation following the demise of Peter Mandelson."
"I think he has failed the EU by leaving his post."
"We are in a serious position."
"You yourself have just said there is a real opportunity for the Doha Round to be restarted."
"Without Peter Mandelson at the helm - and I have criticised him on many occasions, but at least he had the intellect and the knowledge as a past minister of trade to be able to carry on with the battle - I feel that we are in dire straits."
"Will you, Commissioner, for example, be signing off the agreement next week on EPAs?"
"What knowledge do you, with the greatest respect, have on EPAs?"
"You were not involved in the negotiations, or in the setting up of the EPAs. Certainly I never spoke to you when I was drafting the report on them."
"And will the Commission guarantee to this House today that we will have a proper hearing, when Baroness Ashton comes before the Committee on International Trade?"
"Because if you try to push it through on a day when there is going to be nobody present, if you try to push it through next week, or, for example, on a Monday, which is very difficult for Members, then beware the wrath of this House!"
"Remember what happened to the Santer Commission!"
"I believe that she should be given a fair and proper hearing and, as many people have said, it is vitally important that we have a good Commissioner at the helm."
"With regard to that, I just wonder, Commissioner, whether you and I are listening to the same sort of discussions."
"You said the US farm bill was being redrafted."
"I think you are kidding."
"Obama said only yesterday that he was going to continue to be more protectionist than ever before, and so has the Republican candidate."
"You will see huge protectionism coming from America."
"I leave you with one thought: somebody said there is a food crisis."
"Let me make it absolutely plain to this House: there is no food crisis."
"Wheat is now EUR 40 a tonne less than the cost of production."
"Madam President, on a point of order, just very quickly."
"Outside this Chamber do we have a circus?"
"This has nothing to do with the discussions today."
"Do we have a circus?"
"Do we have a restaurant?"
"Do we have a club?"
"You have to fight your way through."
"I think you should take it to the Conference of Presidents and stop the sort of circus that is going on outside this Chamber now."
"Your comments are noted, Mr Sturdy."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what is at stake now within the framework of these WTO negotiations?"
"I do not think that it should be the lot, as noble as these people are, of Mr Mandelson or Baroness Ashton."
"I am not even sure that the most important thing is the issue of industrial tariffs, agricultural tariffs and market access."
"Clearly, we all want the agreement to be solid, to be fair for Europe, but I think that there are two main issues here."
"The first is the preservation of a multilateral framework for trade."
"We can see how much the absence of this framework in another area of globalisation - the financial markets - costs in terms of the risk to the economy, to citizens and to our society."
"This is what is at stake, because if these six years of negotiations result in failure, we know what sort of bilateral agreements will gradually replace them within the WTO."
"This is a flawed framework."
"We want to reform the WTO - we said so in our draft resolution - we also want to have other trade-related dimensions to be taken into account, particularly environmental dimensions, to deal with the impact on climate change and social rules."
"This is absolutely fundamental."
"However, it is not by dissolving the multilateral framework, but by strengthening it, that we will succeed in better organising this aspect of globalisation."
"The second issue - which I will not go into because it was covered by my colleague Mr Arif - is the rebalancing of rules that were set during the Uruguay Round, during the creation of the WTO, to reflect differences in terms of development, the situation of the least developed countries, the situation of developing countries."
"You also mentioned this, Commissioner, with the request for an 'everything but arms' style initiative, with a safeguard clause for sensitive products."
"In this regard, we need to introduce rules - not necessarily free-trade rules - that look at each situation."
"We want fair trade, provided that it is not just about the law of the jungle."
"These, I believe, are the two main issues on which European negotiators must focus."
"It is only natural that they should be concentrating on other measures, such as agriculture, services - although not by questioning the right of developing countries to regulate public services - and industrial tariffs, but not at the expense of a successful outcome to this development round."
"(ES) Madam President, we would have liked to see Mr Mandelson still in his place here, rather than having bolted, which appears to have been the European Union's coup de grace to the Doha Round."
"The global financial crisis does not augur a promising future for Doha."
"This collapse is in turn worsening the global economic situation, and the less developed countries will pay most dearly for it."
"The WTO is necessary; the regulation of international trade is essential."
"Regulation is now a key asset in globalisation, as we are seeing."
"It is therefore necessary that we reach an agreement in the Doha Round."
"We will have to reflect on improving the way that the WTO operates and its legitimacy, and the role in this Round of the 'emerging' countries, who choose whether to be developing or developed countries as it suits them."
"As the resolution states, the dialogue should not only be North-South, but also South-South."
"The European Union has taken very significant steps in these negotiations, more so than others."
"We have also taken steps with initiatives such as Everything But Arms."
"Others also have to move in this direction, and in the interim, let us conclude the pending association agreements, such as with Mercosur, which are essential in this new context."
"(ES) Madam President, today's debate is definitely revealing some major points of agreement."
"One of them is that, in response to the crisis that we are experiencing, what we need is more regulation and multilateral regulation."
"If we focus on finance, it is really undesirable for the International Monetary Fund or the World Bank to play a leading role, even for the worst of enemies."
"They just make catastrophic predictions and show that they have less and less say in what happens, and that their influence and clout are in practice unpredictable."
"That being the case, as we have an instrument like the World Trade Organization, what we need to do is use it."
"Now more than ever we need regulation, but now more than ever we need a real economy, as opposed to a speculative financial economy."
"The trade in goods and services is the real economy, and economic growth for employment is based on the real economy."
"I therefore do not agree that the crisis means that it is going to be more difficult to conclude the Doha Round, quite the contrary: any responsible government should make a real effort to conclude this Round, whether it is from the North or the South, whether it is an underdeveloped country or a developed country."
"I think that we have a global market and we need visible hands."
"In this case, we need the hands of the World Trade Organization."
"We will have to improve the way that it operates, we will need to have more of a development model and less of a free trade model, certainly, and we will, of course, need to have political will."
"I assume that the Union, with the new Commissioner, will continue to have this."
"(HU) Peter Mandelson is leaving the sinking ship and giving up his captain's bridge."
"He is leaving a ship which he himself has steered towards an iceberg."
"It was a mistake to give such extravagant concessions, especially in agriculture, at the very beginning of the negotiations."
"This gave no incentive to our trading partners to offer concessions themselves."
"We have become a laughing-stock for, while we are ditching the Common Agricultural Policy, the other negotiating partners are protecting their own agricultural policy and strengthening the position of farming in America."
"The WTO negotiations cannot be carried on from where they were left off."
"Negotiations can only be continued if they cover environmental issues too."
"Otherwise further liberalisation of world trade will lead to even more offensive devastation of the environment and the acceleration of climate change."
"Is it right, when we are suddenly in the middle of a financial and food crisis, to sacrifice Europe's food security and its agriculture just so that our bankrupt banks are better able to export their misdirected services?"
"(PL) Madam President, the European Union has been making significant changes to the common agricultural policy."
"This reform has had the effect of restricting agricultural production."
"This is particularly apparent in the sugar market, but not only in that market."
"We have restricted the level of support for our farmers."
"To what extent has this had the effect of increasing added value, in which countries and in respect of which social and occupational groups?"
"I would like to ask the Commissioner what the European Union has received in exchange."
"Another question is: how have the signs of a world food crisis impacted on WTO negotiations?"
"Will the current financial crisis, which will certainly affect the state of our economy, have an impact on negotiations at WTO level?"
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, could I first try to describe our huge disappointment after ten days of intensive negotiations in Geneva."
"We felt that we were so close to being able to strike a deal on agriculture and NAMA, knowing very well that at the very end this would be the single undertaking that would determine whether the European Union could consider a package to be acceptable."
"As the person responsible for agriculture, I must say it was extremely encouraging that for the first time ever European agriculture was not blamed for the failure of the discussions."
"The reason was that we have actually been doing our homework in the agricultural sector by reforming our common agricultural policy, first with the big reform in 2003 and then all the reforms after that period."
"So we were able to deliver an 80% reduction in trade-distorting domestic support, without actually damaging our agricultural sector."
"We had the possibility here to also lock the reforms into the multilateral trading system."
"It was not an agreement at any cost."
"It was a balanced agreement within those two areas."
"We could justify to the Council that we were negotiating within the mandate given by the Council to the negotiators."
"For agriculture, this mandate was simply not to force us into a new reform within the agricultural sector."
"I agree with those of you who have said that the multilateral system is important and necessary, because of the fact that it is only within the multilateral system that we can discipline, for example, trade-distorting domestic support and all other non-trade concerns."
"This can never be done in bilateral negotiations, so we have to stick to the values of the multilateral system."
"I also have to say that in these negotiations we never targeted the market of the developing countries."
"Quite the opposite, actually, which was why the SSM was so important, as I said in my first intervention, in sheltering special products in the developing countries."
"I would like to add that we introduced the 'everything-but-arms' agreement back in 2002, which means that the European Union today is by far the biggest importer of agricultural commodities worldwide."
"We are bigger than Canada, the United States, Australia and Japan all together."
"So we have actually opened up our markets in the agricultural sector to these countries."
"Food security has been mentioned here tonight as well."
"We have to realise that food security consists both of domestic internal production and of imports."
"If we look at the European Union's agricultural sector, we would never be able to be as strong as we are today if we had a closed market in agriculture."
"We have today, if I could take the country of the Presidency, EUR 7 billion in surplus trade in agricultural commodities."
"If we imagine that we closed our markets, we would never be able to sell all our high-quality products internally because we would be punished if we protected ourselves."
"Others would do the same, which would prevent us from taking advantage of the emerging and increasingly open market opportunities for our high-quality products."
"So, of course we need a balanced approach."
"Geographical indications (GIs) were mentioned, but I did not raise this in my first intervention because of the time pressure and the Chair's very strong hand on time limits."
"GIs are a crucial issue for the European Union and we made it totally clear to the other negotiating partners that we would never be able to sign a deal if we did not have a positive outcome on geographical indications because this is so important, especially for high quality Mediterranean products."
"I will reply briefly to Mrs McGuinness."
"I do agree with you that we have actually been under-prioritising our development aid in the agricultural sector for decades."
"Now that we see prices - not commodity prices, as it is right that prices have been going down today, but the prices of seeds and fertilisers - skyrocketing, we have suggested our facility to try and help the least developed countries, the poorest countries in the world, and put them in a position to buy seeds and fertilisers."
"This EUR 1 billion facility is now being discussed here in Parliament, and I hope that there will be a positive approach to this possibility of helping developing countries feed their own people and avoid migration from rural areas to the cities."
"Please keep this in mind."
"It is very important."
"I have received six motions for resolution tabled in accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - The failure of the Doha Trade Round could be a harbinger of things to come, at a time when the deepening financial crisis puts tremendous strain on governments' ability to play by the rules."
"Benefits of free trade have been hailed against the backdrop of increasingly global markets."
"But free trade has to be fair and complemented by an international regime that helps poor countries develop."
"Increasingly unequal incomes in wealthy economies and their fear of the rising power of some emerging economies are triggering bouts of protectionism."
"Likewise, the struggle to control exhaustible resources and obtain basic commodities at affordable prices raises the propensity to restrict trade in many countries."
"One needs to mention here the increasingly complicated nature of geopolitics."
"The EU has to take the lead in mitigating the fallout from the current crises, in terms of preventing a collapse, de facto, of the multilateral trade and financial system."
"This lead includes, among other things, a reform of the IFIs, involving the emerging global powers (BRICS) in dealing with global economic issues and a reform of the international architecture regulating the flow of finance."
"At end of the 19th century an international system that promoted free movement of goods and capital broke down and was followed by a devastating war in Europe."
"We should remember this."
"EC-Ukraine Agreement in relation to preservation of commitments on trade in services contained in the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (debate)"
"The next item on the agenda is the report by Zbigniew Zaleski on behalf of the Committee on International Trade on a proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Community and Ukraine in relation to preservation of commitments on trade in services contained in the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement - C6-0202/2008 -."
"rapporteur. - Madam President, this report closes a certain phase in our EU-Ukraine policies."
"Starting with trade and service agreements, I will draw a broader vision of the future cooperation within the WTO and then within the enhanced Free Trade Area once this is created."
"The report, which is short on statements, is an important step in regulating and facilitating our cooperation with our significant neighbour, Ukraine."
"We are consistent and transparent in our intentions and deeds."
"There is an assumption behind them that, if economic conditions improve, then people may invest more energy in solving the other problems that they face - political, social and others, although all of these are interwoven."
"Today, when the very substance of Ukraine trembles - a minute ago I read a message that Yushchenko has dissolved the parliament - our assistance can be of crucial value, but cooperation limited only to the economy would not be sufficient."
"We need to have a broader project, a detailed strategy, composed of various aspects."
"The frame of our neighbourhood policy gives room for a strategy similar to the Union for the Mediterranean."
"There is a report by Mrs Napoletano which is very much supported by the present Presidency."
"It would be advisable for the French Presidency to show more courage in promoting the proposal by a sufficient group of Members to create EURO-NEST, that is an official assembly of European and our eastern neighbours' parliaments."
"We should not limit ourselves only to the nations around the basin of the Mediterranean Sea but should have a balanced vision in our neighbourhood policy."
"We should not leave weak links in the chain of countries surrounding our Union borders."
"Taking the example of Barcelona as a potential candidate to be the seat, or as it were capital, of the Mediterranean Union, I propose for the future eastern neighbour union - something like the Black Sea Union - that the city of Lublin in eastern Poland be the location for administering such a body."
"Historically Lublin has proved itself by being the city of an important international union that preceded the one which we are building at the moment - or at least are trying to build."
"In conclusion, the scope of my position and proposal is that I would like to mobilise this House, the Commission and the Council to be more active in our eastern dimension."
"Why should we do that?"
"The answer is simple."
"If we believe in our European values as being able to improve the human condition on Earth, there can be no room for passively awaiting political developments in that area."
"The case of Georgia is a warning to us as far as the future of Ukraine is concerned."
"Let us not wake up to find that we are pushed away from the political and economic stage, which has been taken by another actor, or even being accused of passivity, lack of political vision and inability to resolve the conflicts in our neighbourhood."
"If we rely on the Kremlin strategy - as seemed to be supported by the Socialist Group during its recent delegation visit to Moscow led by Martin Schulz - then we lose out as a player on the international stage."
"Our European citizens will be the victims of energy prices, tensions and insecurity."
"To conclude, even if Ukraine is not as efficient in democratisation as we would expect, we should not decrease our efforts to create an enhanced cooperation with her people, whose European ambitions are crucial, not only for themselves, but perhaps even more for us, the citizens of Europe."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I would like to thank the European Parliament for promptly giving its opinion and adopting this positive report, as it is important that this agreement is formalised as soon as possible after Ukrainian accession to the WTO, to avoid any legal vacuum."
"Following Ukraine's accession to the WTO, this agreement preserves two very important commitments that help our international maritime operators in their activities in Ukraine."
"The first provision ensures national treatment to nationals and companies of the Community providing international maritime transport services when providing international sea-river services in the inland waterways of Ukraine."
"The second preserves the so-called Greek clause, which allows EU or Ukraine nationals or shipping companies established outside the EU or Ukraine to benefit from the provisions on maritime services, if their vessels are registered in the EU or Ukraine respectively."
"These two provisions will be integrated in the very ambitious Free Trade Agreement we are currently negotiating with Ukraine."
"This Free Trade Agreement is referred to as a deep and comprehensive FTA and it should indeed correspond to these qualifiers."
"We are keen that this should be so because of the important political and economic considerations at stake in relation to Ukraine."
"The process we are engaged in is not just about trade and investment flows."
"It is a sign of Ukraine's continuing political and economic integration into the global economy, and deep partnership with the EU."
"The Free Trade Agreement is one of the central elements of the broader Association Agreement we are negotiating with Ukraine in the context of the neighbourhood policy."
"To the extent that Ukraine can transpose, implement and enforce the EU acquis in some key areas, as foreseen under the current Free Trade Agreement negotiations, the European Union should be ready to extend the internal market benefits in these areas."
"This is especially valid for services where there can be most added value for both partners."
"Furthermore, because Ukraine's WTO commitments in the field of services are already very broad, the FTA and the acquis approximation process will allow us to tackle beyond-the-border barriers."
"This agreement will incentivise EU foreign direct investment in Ukraine by cutting red tape and bringing transparency as well as helping exporters and service providers on both sides, by bringing our relations closer and sharing our standards."
"As a consequence we should see accelerated trade flows and an increase of personal contacts that result from growing small businesses and regional supply chains."
"This is of course a challenging and lengthy process but the Commission believes that this agreement will set the framework and create the incentives for this convergence to occur."
"But, as I stressed before, we should not forget that this process is not just about economic opportunities."
"It is part of a broader test of the transformation of Ukraine and its partnership with the European Union."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (SK) Although the present turbulent domestic politics in Ukraine have weakened the country's negotiating position, they must be seen as part of a democratic process."
"EU integration continues to be the top priority for Ukrainian foreign policy."
"I welcome the report by my colleague Mr Zbigniew Zaleski."
"It highlights many key elements and emphasises the progress Ukraine has made since the Orange Revolution."
"I firmly believe that without the EU's intensive support for Ukraine's accession to the WTO, it would probably not have become a member of this important organisation in May 2008."
"Just as in the case of the WTO, Ukraine now needs the EU's support once again."
"During the 11th meeting of the EU-Ukraine Parliamentary Cooperation Committee that took place in Kiev and Krym last week, I became even more convinced that the EU must be prepared to support Ukraine's efforts, both technologically and financially."
"On the other hand, Ukraine must implement the necessary reforms, in particular in its services sector, and hold ambitious negotiations with the EU."
"The conclusion of the agreement we are discussing presents an excellent opportunity to reiterate the importance of the relations that link the EU and Ukraine in many sectors."
"These relations, which have intensified, are based on a heritage of joint values and principles and on a repeated desire to strengthen partnership and cooperation at the institutional level."
"The European Union cannot but look with admiration on the Ukrainian people's efforts to consolidate the democratic system, the Rule of Law and an open economy."
"These efforts have been carried out in especially demanding circumstances and this means we have an even greater responsibility towards that country and towards ourselves."
"We are all aware of the special nature of Ukraine, which, due to its geographical location and its history, presents a complex national reality, shot through with various tensions, and of exceptional importance on the geopolitical and geoeconomic levels."
"That is why the European Union must strive to promote forms of cooperation that contribute towards developing and stabilising such an important country, which has, in fact, been happening."
"The road already travelled and the soundly expressed prospects, which are based on an association agreement being concluded in the near future that includes the creation of a free trade area, give strong grounds for optimism."
"On the EU side, we have an obligation not to ignore the aims expressed by very broad sectors of Ukrainian society of strengthening ties with Europe."
"These aims revolve around a desire for Ukraine to be part of a community of values and the political and economic organisational model that are at the heart of Europe's identity."
"Stepping up trade, in particular in the services sector, has helped to deepen economic relations and may well decisively contribute to modernising the country."
"Ukraine's accession to the World Trade Organization, which deserved the EU's enthusiastic support, allowed the country to join the multilateral world trade system, which, among other aspects, is also enabling the country to draw closer to Europe."
"This process of drawing nearer must be intensified, as it will not only bring benefits for the two parties directly involved, but also for the entire region."
"Ukraine is part of Europe's past and of its future."
"Any steps, no matter how small, towards highlighting this fact deserve to be welcomed and supported."
"Madam President, I would like to start the debate from the other side."
"After the visit of the European Parliament delegation to Ukraine last week, it is very important to emphasise that Ukraine's next step towards the West, the way forward to democracy and even to integration in the European Union, will not be decided by this Parliament alone, but very much by Ukraine itself."
"Being confronted time and again with new political crises on regular annual visits, discussing year after year whether there will be new elections again, is not the kind of development that will undergird this integration."
"The members of the EU delegation to Ukraine made it clear while we were there that we believe that rivalry between the exponents of the political blocs must not be allowed to continue to dominate the political agenda but that they must come to an understanding about what measures they want to take to stabilise the country."
"There is still virtually no selection of political programmes and content to choose from."
"This is most alarming, because many Ukrainian citizens, who really fought hard to achieve a democratic process, are now avoiding Ukrainian politics with a shudder."
"Ripples of discontent of that magnitude need to be addressed at every visit and at every meeting with representatives of all Ukrainian blocs and parties."
"Madam President, trade relations between EU countries and Ukraine are of very considerable importance because of the demographic potentials of the two partners."
"The development of these relations is all the more important in that trade contacts will help to promote the pro-European strivings of the Ukrainian people."
"There are still many unresolved problems in our bilateral relations."
"One of them is the question of the illegal takeover of companies by Ukrainian partners."
"The uncertain relations that prevail in the Ukrainian administration of justice mean that it can take many years for property to be recovered."
"The political instability of our partner is also having a deleterious impact on our expanding cooperation."
"The future promises to be even more unpredictable."
"We hope that the authorities in Ukraine will do all they can to see that the European Union borders a Ukraine that possesses full legal and political guarantees for the development of companies and economic cooperation, especially in the services sphere."
"(PL) Madam President, political and economic relations with Ukraine are of great importance to us."
"Each year we can see a rise in investment in Ukraine, and this includes a European dimension."
"These investments are having a beneficial effect in many sectors - including on consumers in Ukraine - by increasing levels of consumption."
"The involvement of foreign banks in the Ukrainian banking sector has already reached 35%."
"The services sector is of fundamental and vital importance for the Ukrainian economy. It needs further reform and investment if it is to reach the level of development of this sector in EU countries."
"The same is true of other areas of the Ukrainian economy, including the health-care and tourism sectors."
"We need to develop and reinforce our economic relations between Ukraine and the European Union."
"We must bear in mind that Ukraine is an important transit country for us from the aspect of energy security in Europe."
"We also appreciate the efforts being made by Ukraine, including legislative efforts, linked to the expansion of economic dialogue with Europe and the recently attained WTO membership."
"(PL) Madam President, the draft legislative resolution we are discussing has the full support of my political group, the Union for Europe of the Nations Group."
"Ukraine is an interesting partner, especially in the sphere of trade, provision of services and investment."
"Good cooperation between the European Union and Ukraine is very important, especially for neighbouring countries. One such country is Poland, which is linked to Ukraine by many experiences that go beyond the economic sphere."
"Ukraine has enormous potential for the development of tourism and leisure."
"It is a country of rich cultural traditions."
"For Ukraine to develop properly it needs new technologies, investment, and expansion of the banking system and social communication."
"The European Union can help Ukraine to do this."
"Ukraine is also an important sales market for European products."
"This is something we should also bear in mind when specifying our tasks and directions for action in future cooperation."
"(PL) Mr President, an agreement with Ukraine is an important event that has the effect of helping to rationalise relations between our two sides."
"It is a good starting point on the way to drafting an association agreement between the EU and Ukraine."
"Above all this agreement creates an opportunity to develop trading exchanges between us and to increase investment in a two-way system."
"One inordinately important area of our cooperation is the transfer of know-how in the sphere of standards, quality and the convergence of our legal and institutional heritage."
"Youth - particularly student - exchanges will help to promote the implementation of these tasks, along with the development of scientific, cultural and tourist cooperation."
"(PL) Mr President, I wish to draw attention in this debate to three questions that I think are important."
"Firstly, Ukraine is a key partner of the European Union in the move to diversify oil and gas supplies."
"An understanding with Ukraine provides an opportunity for Europe to secure supplies of these energy media from the Black Sea and Caucasus region."
"Secondly, Ukraine's accession to the World Trade Organisation in May of this year has created additional favourable conditions for the development of economic relations with that country, especially in the sphere of service provision."
"Thirdly and finally, as a result of the serious neglect of infrastructure, Ukraine needs significant financial support from the European Union, originating not only from the EU budget, but also primarily from the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I once again thank the Parliament on behalf of the Commission for these comments, its positive opinion and the rapid adoption of this report."
"In the short term, this helps both partners to preserve some important economic interests, with the least legal vacuum possible, following Ukraine's entry into the World Trade Organisation."
"In the medium and longer term, this is only one element of the wider and very ambitious process of economic integration we are engaged in within the framework of our Association Agreement with Ukraine."
"rapporteur. - Commissioner, the maritime service agreement cannot be overestimated."
"We all know how important the Black Sea route and land transit across Ukraine could be for Europe - for all of us - but without our support the future of this area is not certain."
"I will now speak in Polish."
"rapporteur. - (PL) My fellow Members have mentioned the need for close cooperation and have emphasised the fact that Ukraine obviously belongs to Europe."
"They have gone on to talk about investment, tourism and enterprise."
"Of course, much depends on Ukraine itself."
"That is obvious."
"Perhaps especially now, today, and tomorrow, in the weeks to come, the polarised Ukrainian people need help on the economic, political, scientific and social fronts."
"Let us stop criticising so much; let us rather take sensible and constructive steps."
"This is for the good of both sides: Ukraine and the EU."
"Thank you all very much for the debate and may I ask for your strong support for this report."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Written declarations (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - The service sector is essential for the EU and the Ukrainian economies."
"Ukraine seems to be compelled to reform its energy sector in order to maximise production and improve quality and safety standards."
"The short-term transition hardships should therefore result in a modernised and more transparent services market."
"On the other hand, we should not forget about fighting corruption, which is so rampant in the Ukraine."
"The European Union must be ready to support Ukraine's efforts but Ukraine must also do its share of domestic reforms."
"There are a number of issues that we as representatives of the European Union should address: (1) strengthen the energy security of Ukraine and the EU Member States; (2) ensure a higher level of energy efficiency; (3) reconstruct and modernise the thermal power sector and reduce its negative impact on the environment; (4) increase regulating generation capacities; and (5) ensure a higher level of consumption of renewable energy."
"All of them should fall within an open and transparent energy market."
"We cannot handle more monopolies in such crucial sectors."
"Addressing the challenge of water scarcity and droughts in the European Union (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Richard Seeber, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on addressing the challenge of water scarcity and droughts in the European Union."
"Mr President, I would like first to thank the shadow rapporteurs and the Commission for their excellent cooperation on the preparation of this report."
"We all know that water is the basis of all life."
"However, this basis is not infinitely available."
"In the future, up to three billion people will be affected by lack of water."
"Already in 2007, a third of Europeans lived in regions in which water resources were limited, according to the European Environment Agency."
"This problem particularly affects countries such as Cyprus, Bulgaria, Belgium, Hungary, Malta, Italy, the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain and, unfortunately, many others."
"That means that water is being overused."
"Of course, climate change is also exacerbating the problem."
"Drought events have therefore become more frequent over the last 30 years, costing more than EUR 100 billion so far."
"The EU economy suffered losses of approximately EUR 8.7 billion in the drought of 2003."
"These extreme weather situations have not only economic, but also social and human effects."
"Apart from the general impairment of human health, approximately 35 000 people in Europe died as a result of the heatwave in 2003."
"We also note that patterns of water use vary greatly within Europe."
"The average consumption in the EU fluctuates between 100 and 400 litres, although in fact 80 litres per person per day should be enough for a European standard of living."
"This is caused by inefficiency owing to out-of-date technologies and also to the wasting of water."
"For example, 30% of the water in France's distribution networks simply disappears."
"For us, this means that there is tremendous potential for saving water here in Europe."
"It is high time for the Community to take action as well."
"The Commission has already addressed the topic of water in several directives, such as those on bathing water, drinking water, floods, environmental quality standards for water, etc. Without a doubt, the milestone so far was the Water Framework Directive in 2000, with its implementation steps."
"It is now particularly important for the Commission to make sure that the Member States perform their obligations arising from that legislation."
"Changed environmental and climate framework conditions, greater use of water by business, agriculture and households, and of course changed consumption habits have exacerbated the water shortage."
"Unfortunately, we are seeing extreme weather situations more and more often."
"On the one hand, there is heavy rainfall accompanied by flooding, while on the other, periods of drought that devastate entire swathes of Europe are becoming more frequent."
"The communication that the Commission has now laid before us represents an important step in the right direction, but essential improvement measures are imperative."
"Firstly, water shortage and drought must be seen as a global phenomenon."
"Here in Europe, we must not concentrate only on our own problems - let us not forget the huge numbers of migrants descending upon Europe, very often because of droughts."
"Secondly, the Member States need to work together across borders to combat water scarcity and drought."
"The management plans of the Water Framework Directive need to be supplemented with regard to drought and water scarcity."
"Mutual solidarity between the Member States as regards their water resources does not, however, mean that their sovereignty for making decisions about their water resources has to be abolished."
"In my view, transporting water over long distances is no solution to the problem, either."
"Thirdly, the Commission document does not contain a specific timeframe or verifiable goals."
"Without these, this strategy cannot be implemented."
"Fourthly, Europe really ought to try to become a global leader in water-saving technology."
"That requires dealing with both the human side of the problem and of course also the economic needs of the moment."
"In summary, I believe that we have been presented with a paper that makes important improvements to the Commission document."
"Member of the Commission. - (CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, water scarcity and drought represent a major global problem and it is clear that climate change will aggravate the situation and result in serious water scarcity."
"This trend was confirmed by another report on the impact of climate change in Europe, prepared by the European Environment Agency last week."
"The frequency and intensity of droughts in the European Union have dramatically increased over the past 30 years, and over 100 million people and almost one third of the EU were affected in 2003."
"Since the Commission presented its communication on water scarcity and droughts, we have seen further evidence of this trend."
"Cyprus is experiencing its worst drought since 1900."
"Water supplies for irrigation purposes were suspended during the summer and farmers suffered 80% crop losses as a result."
"In some areas cereal crops were completely destroyed."
"The estimated losses exceed 1.5% of Cyprus's GDP."
"Nor was this an isolated occurrence: 2008 is the third consecutive drought year in Cyprus."
"This is therefore the right time for Parliament to debate its report on water scarcity and droughts."
"I am glad that the European Parliament has taken this opportunity to send out a clear message that it is important to tackle this problem."
"Global warming, population growth and increasing per capita consumption all mean that the pressure on our water resources is rising."
"As a consequence, water scarcity or droughts are becoming increasingly likely, and they have a direct effect on the population and on those economic sectors that depend on water supply, for example agriculture, tourism, industry, power supply and transport."
"They also have negative side effects for biodiversity and water quality."
"The risks of forest fires and the consumption of land are increasing."
"Unless urgent measures are taken, entire regions will face the risk of desertification, both within and outside the European Union."
"In order to prevent this, our top priority must be a shift towards practices that will lead to effective water use and water savings."
"At the same time, measures aimed at water saving will be adopted at all levels."
"In order to achieve this, the entire population will have to play a role; the adoption of government measures will not on its own be enough."
"The latest Eurobarometer poll, asking the public about their attitude towards climate change, indicates that 62% of Europeans consider climate change/global warming to be among the two most serious problems facing the world today, while 68% of Europeans feel that 'poverty, the lack of food and drinking water' is the most serious problem."
"In this context the good news is that the fears expressed by the members of the public are also reflected in their behaviour: 61% of Europeans declare that they have personally taken actions aimed at tackling climate change and more than half have reduced their consumption of water at home."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to note that your report welcomes the Commission communication and supports the proposed first set of policy options for action."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Seeber, for his excellent work on this report, as well as Mrs Herranz García and Mrs García Pérez from the Committee on Agriculture and the Committee on Regional Development for their positive and constructive contributions."
"There is broad agreement between the report and the conclusions adopted by the Council last year regarding the measures to be taken."
"The task now is to turn this political support into real actions."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Seeber on his report and by saying that, in the Committee on Regional Development, we are aware that water scarcity has become one of the fundamental challenges for the cohesion policy, as it has so far affected 11% of the population and 17% of the territory of the European Union."
"For this reason, this aspect needs to be taken into account in the future cohesion policy, using the necessary budgetary measures and instruments in order to do so."
"We need to stress to the regional and local authorities the opportunity offered by the Structural Funds to address the challenge of water efficiency in terms of saving and reusing water."
"We also need to call on the Commission to promote the entry into operation of the European Drought Observatory, to work on complementing national, regional and local data."
"Finally, we need to acknowledge that water scarcity and droughts have direct effects on social, economic and territorial cohesion, as the impact is more pronounced in certain regions, leading to land abandonment, forest fires and soil degradation, and hindering significantly the development of those regions."
"Mr President, firstly I would like to congratulate Mr Seeber on the work he has done, because his report picks up many of the concerns expressed in this House regarding problems that are crucial for the whole of the European Union: water scarcity and drought, which have now ceased to be a problem for only the southern European countries."
"I am pleased that this draft incorporates some of the ideas included in the opinion for which I was the draftsman in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, in favour of agricultural activity, for example in highlighting the role that farmers play in the sustainable management of available resources."
"It also includes a reference to droughts and water scarcity as factors that push up the prices of raw materials, an aspect which, in the current climate, I think it is very important to highlight, so that we keep in mind not only the environmental dimension of this problem, but also some of its most important economic consequences."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety also included the idea of establishing a European Drought Observatory, something that is also mentioned in the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture, and which I hope will one day become a reality."
"The text to be put to the vote tomorrow does not, however, include a proposal made by the Committee on Agriculture for the Commission to look into setting up an economic adaptation fund against drought, which would benefit all economic sectors, including agriculture."
"I would personally like to make it clear that I will continue to advocate the establishment of this fund, an idea that I will propose to Parliament again when the Commission produces its planned communication on adaptation to climate change in the next few months."
"I think that, following the establishment of the Solidarity Fund, which was created to mitigate the losses caused by climate disasters, it is time for us to think about an instrument that acts in advance to fund preventive measures to reduce the environmental and financial cost of these climate disasters."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE group. - (HU) Thank you, Mr President."
"I would first like to add to my colleagues' praise of Mr Seeber."
"He has brought expertise and hard work to this task and well deserves success and praise."
"This, I must say, is an extremely important matter."
"Ninety per cent of Hungary, my country, is a land threatened by drought."
"The regular occurrences of drought in past few years have caused exceptional damage to Hungarian agriculture, with the damage last year alone amounting to one billion euros."
"Drought is a problem that is not restricted to the countries in the south."
"It has caused huge problems in Hungary even though Europe's largest river, the Danube, and the seventh largest, the Tisza, both flow across it."
"Even so, the hundred-kilometre-wide area lying between these two abundant rivers has begun to suffer from desertification and this process is happening and being made to happen ever faster."
"This demonstrates that the European Union needs an overarching water management programme and I would therefore like to welcome this report, showing that the European Union has resolved to take action in the fight to control desertification and in the interests of that fight."
"Yesterday, the Committee on Budgets, on my proposal, supported a pilot project calling for assistance in the control of desertification."
"But we must all contribute more in support of efficient agriculture practices and overarching water management."
"The measures we have to take to rationalise the use of water by the general population are important too."
"As a result of climate change the effects of regular periods of water scarcity will probably become more pronounced and every single drop of evaporated water will have a consequence."
"Finally, permit me to draw your attention to the question of global responsibility."
"As the population of the world continues to grow dynamically, with even more pressure on industry, agriculture and water in the developing countries, Europe must re-evaluate its water reserves."
"It is our duty and responsibility to conserve and augment these reserves. Thank you."
"On behalf of my group, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his work."
"This is an important report containing appropriate proposals on how the European Union can address the challenge of water scarcity and droughts."
"This is not a new problem, but the situation has become more acute and extensive."
"The 2003 drought affected more than 100 million people and a third of the EU's territory, and cost the European economy EUR 8.7 million."
"Water scarcity no longer affects just the southern European countries; its impact is already being felt in central and northern Europe, as has been mentioned here, and the situation is getting worse because of climate change."
"The European Union must take urgent measures to resolve the two issues of excessive water consumption and water wastage."
"According to European Environment Agency data, there is huge potential for water saving in Europe."
"Approximately 40% of the water used could be saved."
"Moreover, Europe is continuing to waste at least 20% of its water due to inefficiency."
"That being so, the amendments I tabled, and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety adopted, on the re-use of waste water and desalination, are fully justified."
"Furthermore, as leakages from pipes result in much wastage, I suggested that Member States could use the Structural Funds to improve and renew existing infrastructure and technology."
"It is impossible to develop a water saving culture without the involvement of citizens."
"Therefore, it is necessary to promote public awareness and information campaigns."
"Water is a public asset, yet it is scarce."
"We all need to contribute towards reducing consumption and combating waste so that it is accessible to everyone at a fair price."
"Before I conclude, I should like to ask the Council and the Commission when the Solidarity Fund support mechanisms will be made more flexible."
"As drought is an anomalous natural phenomenon with serious, lasting repercussions on the living conditions and socioeconomic stability of the affected regions, it would be helpful for the Fund to support situations of a regional nature and for public and private damage to be made eligible."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the lively debates that we have had recently about energy show that energy is a valuable asset, a basic need."
"Well, what about water?"
"This is even more precious."
"We are conscious of the scarcity of water in developing countries."
"Well, what about in Europe?"
"Water is also a valuable resource for Europe."
"Let us stop wasting it; let us conserve this resource."
"The report that will be put to the vote tomorrow is a comprehensive report that deals with technical aspects, such as leakage from distribution networks, as well as political and societal aspects, such as usage and raising awareness about the efficient use of water."
"Our responsibility for water is both individual and collective."
"This report also addresses the issue of problems arising from the scarcity of water and drought, problems that are both immediate and long term in the context of climate change."
"I would like to point out that it is important to share good practices, since Europe is affected to varying degrees by the scarcity of water, or drought, and therefore the practical experience of all regions is crucial if we are to avoid these phenomena or resolve them."
"I will even go further by saying that lessons can be learnt from both good and bad practices."
"I am also satisfied that a link has been made between the availability of water and the quality of water."
"In fact, Parliament attaches a great deal of importance to this issue of water quality, through texts such as environmental quality standards or the current debate on pesticides."
"The solution to the scarcity of this resource has many different angles: we need to encourage research and innovation, we need to improve technical and agricultural use, we need to change individual behaviours."
"Let us act now and disprove the old English adage that 'you never miss the water till the well runs dry'."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, I would also like to thank the rapporteur for his work."
"We can only stress the fact that water has become a precious and rare resource."
"The rapporteur told us that 3.2 billion inhabitants on this planet could face a water shortage."
"We also know that Europe is not immune from this."
"Therefore, we should do everything possible to conserve this rare resource."
"Water is a shared asset and it is unfortunate that some of my amendments were not adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety."
"This is why I am addressing the Commission directly."
"I hope that, as part of the CAP reform, we will also review certain methods of cultivation - I am mainly thinking of irrigation techniques that are unsuitable for some European regions and which must be abandoned if we are to stop wasting water."
"It is also a shame that the amendment on the cooling of nuclear power stations was not taken into account because, in my own country France, at the time of year when river levels are very low, nuclear power stations have to be shut down or cooled using sprinklers."
"This is ridiculous, and is terribly dangerous for our citizens."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (NL) Mr President, I should like to start by expressing my warm thanks to Mr Seeber."
"Many of us here think that clean drinking water looks like this."
"I should like to point out that, in a great many countries, that glass is empty."
"Many people have either no water or water looking like this."
"Debates on oil shortages are tremendously heated, and I sometimes wonder why this is not the case for water."
"After all, water is a matter of life or death."
"The world's population is constantly increasing, and the quantities of clean drinking water available are only decreasing."
"Water scarcity exists even in Europe. This includes 'hidden' water scarcity: when, for example, households have their drinking water supplies cut off."
"The causes are various, for example poor sanitation systems, the creeping liberalisation of public services, the use of pesticides and artificial fertilisers, and intensive livestock farming."
"Did you know that producing 100 grams of beef requires 2 400 litres of water?"
"The Commission Communication largely focuses on water saving."
"As far as I am concerned, this is like carrying coals to Newcastle, as the source of the problems I have just mentioned should be tackled to begin with."
"For example, we first need investment, throughout Europe and beyond, in proper sanitation and water purification systems."
"In addition, more careful use must be made of pesticides, thought must be given to the impact of intensive livestock farming on water management, and measures must be taken to combat climate change."
"Access to clean drinking water is a civil right, something to which everyone is entitled."
"The problem lies not in the availability or otherwise of sufficient drinking water, but in the distribution of clean drinking water, unnecessary pollution, and the drive towards privatisation."
"To give just one example, in the United Kingdom privatisation led to a sudden sharp increase in prices and in the number of households having their water supplies cut off."
"That is a disgrace."
"I would advocate leaving drinking water supplies in the public sector."
"Mr President, water scarcity and droughts particularly affect southern parts of the European Union and have both climatic and human causes."
"Tourism also makes heavy demands on water resources, in the very countries where the problems are already severe."
"Study results from the IPCC have shown that the risks will only increase in coming years."
"Therefore, we must take care that the situation with regard to water does not grow any worse."
"In my opinion, therefore, this report sends out a good signal."
"Efficient water use is vitally important in the fight against water scarcity and droughts."
"I would emphasise in particular the water-pricing principle also included in the report."
"Several Member States have had positive experiences with this."
"I, too, welcome the link made in the report to the Water Framework Directive."
"I think that that is the right place for the problems of water scarcity and droughts."
"Finally, my compliments to the rapporteur, Mr Seeber, on a job well done."
"(DE) Mr President, as long as it is guaranteed that water resources remain under the exclusive sovereignty of the Member States and neither the EU nor the ECJ can intervene in any way, it certainly makes sense to have a joint strategy to combat water shortages."
"However, it makes sense only if we tackle the problem comprehensively and apply ourselves to causally related problems such as population explosion and climate change."
"In the agricultural sector, which is responsible for 70% of the world's water consumption, there is certainly enormous potential for economising on water use."
"However, the EU has also contributed its two cents' worth to wasting water by requiring connection to and the use of canal systems."
"On top of this, existing water shortages are often exacerbated by poor decisions - as in Cyprus, where citizens are paying the price in the form of water rationing for the building of new golf courses despite chronic water shortages."
"Therefore, when it comes to water, a resource essential to life, we must become more aware and responsive, but this must on no account take the form of forcing benefits of dubious value on all Member States in typical EU style."
"(HU) Thank you, Mr President."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the issue of water shortages and drought is one of the most urgent now facing the European Union, and, as a complex issue, closely linked with other environmental issues, it must be regulated with that in mind."
"Water use is not restricted to a specific geographical area."
"Its capacity to span borders demands regulation at European Union level."
"We must emphasise this important aspect of cross-border water management."
"The conditions attaching to floods which cause such serious damage are closely linked to the widespread practice of cutting down forests; in other words, deforestation results on the one hand in aridity and wasteland and on the other in devastating floods."
"It is important to stress that we must maintain the principle of subsidiarity in the area of water management."
"The role of local and regional authorities and the elected councils must be strengthened as these bodies have a significant contribution to make in ameliorating the difficulties deriving from water shortage and drought through land use and building regulations."
"As well as regional and local authorities we have to keep civilian organisations in mind, too."
"They are an important factor in education and publicity campaigns and this role should be supported in the future."
"It is essential to organise incentive and media campaigns, since it is not just the existence of the issues that can be highlighted through these forums, but in addition people can see how ideas and proposals are put into practice."
"I would also like to draw attention to how important it is for the Member States to have a certain flexibility so that they can regulate other issues concerning irrigation and water management in line with their own special conditions."
"The regulatory authorities at different levels must work together to create a sustainable water management framework."
"I would like to thank Mr Seeber for all the work he has put into his report, and to thank you for your attention."
"(ES) Mr President, I welcome the fact that there is a document on water, although I think that, unfortunately, this document, because of climate change issues, has been reduced to a partial and very specific view of the subject, which is water saving ."
"Despite this, I commend several things that Mr Seeber has highlighted and expanded on based on the Commission document, by making it clear that water is everyone's right - water for all - and that we need to take into account that we need to have closer cooperation between the regions, which is a phenomenon that I do not think is up to date right now, and which is a good lesson for all those who believe that water belongs to whoever has it in a river in their backyard."
"I have to say, however, that I think that we have to start thinking in terms of water and climate change from an overall perspective."
"There are three problems in the world at present: one is hunger and food shortages, another is climate change, and another is drought, which is a problem that we have had for many centuries."
"An increase in resources is essential and it is not dealt with here."
"We need to multiply the existing resources, and this is only mentioned in amendments made by Parliament."
"Not only desalination; we will also have to regulate the rivers again, and think about new engineering and new water paradigm, consisting of making every effort to ensure that water remains in the land: through reforestation, drought tanks to recover water during floods, recharging aquifers during floods and another set of measures."
"We also need to think about an agricultural strategy for producing products that can generate the same plant mass as is produced now, but with a strategy focused on new crops that can grow with little water."
"For the same reason, we need to talk about a water economy, as it is not only a question of rising prices as has been said here, or of real prices, but rather there is a much more complex water economy."
"Therefore agriculture strategy, consumption strategy, land treatment, river regulation and, if water needs to be diverted, it should be."
"What is important is for the world to continue to be sustainable, thinking about people and the economy."
"(ES) Mr President, I would first of all like to thank the Commission for finally presenting a document on the problem of drought and water scarcity, which we have been calling for in Parliament for some time now."
"Especially having seen how cases of major floods have been dealt with in a way that we felt was right and sufficient, but it has always been forgotten that in other places drought is becoming a structural problem and that the problem of water scarcity has not only social effects but also economic effects, and has an even greater impact on all aspects of sustainability."
"I must congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Seeber, on his excellent work, and also thank him for his active participation in and presence at the debates for European Environment Day at the International Expo 2008 in my city, Zaragoza."
"I must thank him for this because at the Expo, the European Union was able, through Mr Seeber, to express its concern about water sustainability and to set out the needs and problems that affect the European Union, from the perspective of the Union and the European Parliament."
"I also have to say that we now know that water scarcity problems are very much linked with the cycle of the fight against climate change, as we know that in that cycle, unrestrained deforestation and urban development are contributing to growing water scarcity, and therefore the authorities concerned need to pay heed to water-related considerations in their land-use planning, especially in connection with the development of economic activities in increasingly sensitive river basins."
"On this aspect, as the Commission proposes in principle, we advocate establishing a hierarchy of water uses and, as Mr Seeber acknowledges in his report, we do not, of course, think that diverting water over long distances should, under any circumstances, be the solution to the problem of water scarcity."
"On the contrary, our point of reference should always be correctly applying the Water Framework Directive, as a framework for achieving a good status for all European waters, respecting river basin units as well as objectives for improving quality."
"As Mr Seeber's report rightly acknowledges, there are losses of up to 50% in cities and 20% water losses in Europe in general."
"Through various mechanisms and technologies and new forms of water saving and water efficiency, it would be possible to save 40%."
"In order to do this, we need to promote sustainable water use, protection of available water resources and their efficient and sustainable use."
"We therefore welcome the proposals to keep the European Drought Observatory within the framework of the European Environment Agency and for a network of cities to encourage sustainable water use."
"(SK) Water is life."
"Life on earth could not exist without water."
"Rain is a gift from God that must be managed in a responsible manner."
"We must not flush a gift from God down the drain."
"We must use it to nourish the ground, to bring forth new life."
"Every year, more than 20 billion m3 of rainwater are drained away from European cities through sewers and drainage pipes into the seas and oceans."
"This is the real reason why the European continent is drying out because rainwater, in all its forms, is the source of all water resources on the continents."
"I welcome the involvement of the rapporteur, Mr Richard Seeber, in seeking solutions to the problems of water scarcity and droughts in the EU."
"However, I expected the report to be slightly more ambitious."
"Only in paragraph 48, which found its way into the report thanks to my suggestion in the Committee on Regional Development, does the report mention the need for rainwater collection, and even then it does so only marginally."
"I believe that the new water paradigm, developed by the team of Slovak and Czech scientists led by Mr Michal Kravčík, will also influence our rapporteur and in the future will change the EU Water Framework Directive."
"As far as I am aware, Commissioner Špidla has also expressed his support for this suggestion and this programme."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Richard Seeber for his commitment in this most important area."
"I fully support the movement towards a water-efficient and water-saving economy and of course the full implementation of the Water Framework Directive, which I was very involved in a few years ago when my former Austrian colleague Marilies Flemming was the rapporteur."
"In fact the contents of Article 9 of the Water Framework Directive, to which I would like to draw attention tonight, were a result of an amendment I made to the original draft proposal."
"I would like an assurance from the Commission that any proposals regarding water pricing or compulsory water metering, if it should arise, would be expressed in accordance with Article 9 of the Water Framework Directive, which allows for the continuation of the established Irish practice of not charging domestic householders for domestic usage."
"Please do not ask me to justify the sustainability of this to you here and now, but please believe me that it is a matter of acute political sensitivity and one, if I may suggest, best handled by Irish governments rather than under an EU directive."
"We are a wet island off the west of Europe but we too are facing shortage as we consider the impact of climate change on water."
"(HU) Food and water have acquired the same strategic value as oil and gas."
"One moment we have water shortages and the next we have inland inundations and floods."
"This is a European problem, and Mr Seeber's report is extremely important here."
"I would like to amend Esther Herranz García's proposal in that we do not need a common European position on floods but on water management, as inland inundations and floods cause as big a problem as drought, and those on the committee know only too well that there is no single European risk management basis here."
"It is in this context that the problem of drought has to be tackled, and not just in Mediterranean countries."
"My colleague Péter Olajos has mentioned that ground level has shrunk back by four metres in Homokhátság, between the Danube and the Tisza, in the last four decades."
"Desertification has now reached Hungary and Central Europe."
"This is a pan-European problem."
"We can learn a lot from our Israeli colleagues, I am not ashamed to learn, they have excellent irrigation methods. Thank you for your attention."
"(PL) Mr President, the protection of water resources, water ecosystems and drinking water is one of the essentials of environmental protection."
"Coordinated action is therefore required at EU level to ensure effective protection of this valuable resource."
"The three main challenges facing Europe in the sphere of water consumption are thrifty, sustainable and effective consumption."
"Climate change is not the only challenge facing Europe."
"Despite increasing demand for water, we are still grappling with excessive, unsustainable and inefficient water consumption that is rising almost twice as fast as the world's population."
"In Europe itself, at least 20% of resources are wasted because of inefficient management."
"Means of regulating demand are therefore to be preferred to the usual increase in supply."
"Means of regulating supplies should be considered only when the potential linked to more thrifty water management, better control of demand and educational actions has been exhausted."
"Regional cooperation and the use of structural funds may also play a not insignificant role."
"Member of the Commission. - (CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for the debate on water management and water-related problems, which has highlighted many varied points of view."
"Although I will not respond to each individual speaker, I would like to address several issues contained in the report that I consider to be of particular importance."
"Firstly, the report acknowledges the importance of the Water Framework Directive."
"Full implementation of this Directive is a priority that will help to solve the problem of poor water management."
"The report also points out that measures on the demand side should be preferred and welcomes the fact that water savings are the Commission's first priority in tackling this problem."
"The water-saving potential in Europe is huge: 33% in households and 43% in agriculture."
"The report also emphasises the link between climate change, water scarcity and drought and the need to take water-related issues into account in other policies, such as land-use planning, where poor decisions in some cases have aggravated the problem in the past."
"The report also calls on regional and local authorities to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the Structural Funds, and underlines the role played by environmental programmes within the framework of the second pillar of the common agricultural policy."
"This integration will be a priority in the shift towards practices aimed at achieving water savings."
"The report also acknowledges the importance of high-quality information and calls on the Commission to promote the entry into operation of the European Drought Observatory."
"In response to the communication, the Commission's Joint Research Centre is now developing its prototype."
"Finally, the report stresses the need for precise measures and a concrete timetable for their implementation."
"I can assure you that the Commission intends to elaborate further on the goals set out in the communication and that it is working on a report that will evaluate the progress made in solving the problems concerned."
"In addition, the Commission is fully committed to continuously solving these issues at international level, in particular through the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in conclusion I would like to say that water-related issues will continue to be at the heart of our political programme and that your report is a very useful and topical contribution to the Commission's continuous efforts to adapt to climate change."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I think that the debate has demonstrated clearly that water management is a complex issue and I cannot but agree with your opinion that this issue must be streamlined in all policies and that its facets are also extremely significant at international level."
"Mr President, thank you, Commissioner, and thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your very good input."
"I would like to say in advance that sovereignty over water resources must remain a national matter."
"Nevertheless, we need to demonstrate solidarity, although this solidarity must be voluntary."
"Many good and very detailed suggestions were put forward by Members."
"I took only some of them into account, for the simple reason that this was an own-initiative report that had to remain relatively general and illustrate general principles."
"I am very much looking forward to seeing the paper that the Commission will present, hopefully in the next few weeks - that is, the Green Paper on adaptation to climate change, which we are all impatiently waiting for, because we all know that the 'Adaptation and Climate Change' section relates primarily to water."
"We are eagerly waiting to see what concrete suggestions the Commission has to make."
"I would like to remind you that from our point of view, 'mainstreaming' is extremely important."
"It is vital for water policy to be included in all other areas of policy and politics, as my colleague Mr Berend has also pointed out."
"European funds must not be used in ways that contribute to short- or long-term water scarcity."
"Everyone must realise - and we must raise awareness of this in the political and economic world, but also amongst citizens - that water is not an infinite resource."
"My colleague Mrs Doyle mentioned water pricing."
"It is very clear: Article 9 must be implemented, but here the Member States have a wide scope and the necessary flexibility, and their traditions must be taken into account."
"I support the measures on the demand side, too, although the supply side must also be taken into account, as our Spanish fellow Member said."
"There are special situations where these, too, simply have to be solved via the supply side."
"In summary, I would like to thank everyone most sincerely for the stimulating debate."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Written declarations (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - Water scarcity is a growing concern for all nations, but the impacts are generally more strongly felt by the poorest regions, leading to great environmental and economic misfortunes."
"Some countries are affected more than others depending on their geographical location and the core industries of their economies."
"Such is the case of the Mediterranean region, where water scarcity will be an acute problem as a result of its potential to disrupt tourism."
"Protecting water as a scarce resource is fundamental for environmental protection and economic development."
"The creation of a more cohesive policy with regard to water consumption, education and policy integration is necessary at European level to ensure effective and responsible protection of water supply and the environment in Member States."
"Also, more research is necessary into desalination plants and water recycling technology in order to have a cheaper and more efficient system."
"In addition, in the EU itself - at least in number of Member States - we need to have better and tougher legislation to curb abuse and pollution of water tables."
"Moreover, in certain regions the allocation of structural funds to support projects relating to water should be promoted."
"It is of critical value to ensure that all stakeholders in our society, politicians, industry and consumers themselves believe in this priority to be able to make informed decisions."
"in writing. - (RO) Climate change can have an irreversible effect on all the planet's water resources and therefore it is essential to adapt all aspects of socio-economic life to counteracting the effects of water shortage."
"The European and international legislative frameworks offer efficient levers but we need real progress in terms of the rapid enforcement of all measures adopted, especiallyly those contained in the Convention to Combat Desertification and the Water Framework Directive whose protracted implementation deadlines endanger the sustainability of resources."
"I appeal to the Commission and to the Member States, utilising the active involvement of all authorised bodies and the local authorities, that they accelerate transparent and coherent water consumption tariffing processes by basing it on the principle of ""the user pays” and by eliminating system losses."
"I also recommend that the implementation of concrete measures for the rational use of the river basins is accelerated, especially in the case of those where there are hydropower plants built and most importantly of rivers that ensure the cooling of nuclear plants, because irrational use combined with the accentuated decrease of flows may lead to the closure of many clean electricity production facilities and, as a consequence, could throw the European electric power system out of balance, which would entail major risks to the Union's security in the electric power sector."
"in writing. - (RO) I wished to intervene because I am a MEP from the south of Romania, an area which has faced serious drought problems over the past couple of years."
"The last drought, in 2007, affected over 80% of the homesteads from my region, Ialomiţa."
"I believe that this phenomenon can be reduced and that we can get the results we all want if we also examine it from the perspective of regional development."
"Member States must be careful with sensitive river basins where there is a water shortage but they must be especially careful when they authorise economic activities in those sensitive areas."
"When we allocate funds for water infrastructure, priority must be given to those which include clean technologies, use water efficiently and also involve risk prevention measures."
"I also believe that both the Commission and the Member States must favour the emergence in Europe of a culture based on water saving and on management rules acquired through education."
"Water shortage is one of the new challenges."
"So far, this has affected 11% of the European population and 17% of European territory."
"Cohesion policy must face this challenge."
"I conclude by adding something that I also consider to be of immediate importance, in order to generate results: optimisation of the use of the Solidarity Fund and of the Civil Protection Cooperation Mechanism."
"in writing. - (RO) Water scarcity and droughts have become issues of major importance both in the European Union and at a global level, especially in the context of climate change, which has aggravated this situation."
"Such phenomena have harmful secondary effects on biodiversity, water and soil quality and increase risks of forest fires, as proved by the recent devastating fires in Southern Europe."
"In South-East Europe, the grants coming from the Common Agricultural Policy have caused an increase in water consumption, a reason why it is necessary to encourage the full suspension of grants and to provide support for the management of water resources within rural development programmes."
"Also, the continuous increase in the current demand for biofuels forces us to adjust production and the other economic activities to the amount of water available at local level."
"In order to find solutions to these problems, the main priority is the transition to the efficient use and the saving of water."
"The introduction of water charges to stimulate the rational use of water, the achievement of the goals provided in the Water Framework Directive and the correlation with other industry water policies should materialize in actions to be carried out in the future."
"Arctic governance in a global world (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission, by Diana Wallis, Bilyana Ilieva Raeva and Johannes Lebech, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, on Arctic governance in a global world - B6-0467/2008)."
"author. - Mr President, the Arctic has been described as the last imaginary place."
"It is a special place for many people."
"We are in the midst of International Polar Year."
"The last such commemoration saw the emergence of a Charter for the Antarctic."
"The Arctic is different."
"It has peoples and nations, but it is also the focus of global climate change, with all its threats, challenges and opportunities."
"I have long argued that we should have an Arctic policy - perhaps through our Northern Dimension mechanism - and I was very pleased a month ago to attend a conference in Greenland on behalf of our President where I found myself for the first time surrounded by more than a dozen Commission officials from different DGs."
"Somebody has now got the message that this is important."
"We look forward to the coming Commission communication, but this resolution is to give you, Commissioner, courage to be bold and to show you how important this House considers this issue."
"Yes, we have to protect the fragility of the Arctic environment."
"Yes, we have to look at sustainable ways of developing resources in the Arctic, specifically energy-based resources."
"Yes, we have to look at how we can safely use any emerging sea routes."
"There is much more that I could say."
"I am grateful to colleagues for their cooperation on this very important resolution."
"When our continent emerged from the Cold War, Gorbachev said that the Arctic should be an area of peaceful international cooperation."
"I believe that our Union has a duty to secure that, both for our own Arctic nations and also for our Arctic neighbours - so courage with your communication."
"member of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this debate comes at a particularly propitious time."
"The Commission announced in its Communication of October 2007 on an Integrated Maritime Policy for the European Union that it would review EU interests in the Arctic region by the end of 2008."
"It is currently in the process of putting the finishing touches to this review in the form of a communication entitled 'The European Union and the Arctic region', which we plan to adopt in mid-November."
"The Arctic is increasingly important for the world and the European Union is inextricably linked with this region."
"EU policy in areas such as climate change, energy, transport and fisheries have a direct impact on the Arctic."
"Three Member States have territories situated in the Arctic."
"The maritime and terrestrial areas of this region are vulnerable and represent the essential components of the terrestrial ecosystem."
"The effects of climate change are appearing more quickly and on a larger scale in the Arctic region than anywhere else in the world."
"Since the turn of the century, our external action in favour of the North has been successfully guided by our Northern Dimension policy."
"The Arctic, including the Barents Sea region, was recognised as a key area in the 2006 guidance document on the Northern Dimension, adopted in consultation with Russia, Norway and Iceland."
"Nevertheless, the Northern Dimension policy has always been more focused on Europe, and particularly on north-west Russia."
"The future communication, which will be extensive, will propose that the European Union plays a more dynamic and coordinated role in the Arctic and that its action should be structured around three main objectives: to protect and preserve the Arctic in cooperation with its inhabitants; to promote the sustainable use of Arctic resources; and to improve multilateral governance of the Arctic."
"Climate change is the result of a planetary process and the European Union must continue to play a leading role in tackling this phenomenon."
"The communication will make the protection and preservation of the environment an absolute priority, although this should not necessarily rule out the sustainable use of the Arctic's resources."
"The Commission also plans to increase, in close cooperation with countries in this region, our contribution to the Arctic and particularly its governance, as indicated by the Ilulissat declaration of the five Arctic States, from May 2008."
"It seems that the conditions are not yet in place for a binding legal framework specifically designed for this region."
"We should use the extended legal basis established by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and other interventional conventions."
"Nevertheless, we can clearly see the need to fully implement the existing legal framework and to ensure that this is respected while fleshing it out and adapting it to new realities."
"Our aim is to help establish a system founded on cooperation, which will ensure the viability of this region, as well as freedom and fairness in terms of access."
"We recognise that it is essential to improve coordination and to provide more strategic guidance."
"The Commission will put forward a series of proposals in this respect, specifically proposing the enlargement of the 'Arctic window' of its Northern Dimension policy."
"We want the communication to give rise to a detailed reflection on the various issues covered, laying the foundations for a future EU Arctic policy."
"The communication will encourage the adoption of a more coordinated approach to the Arctic and will be followed by a more detailed reflection on various themes."
"It could thus establish the basis for a global EU policy on this region."
"There is no doubt that a stronger policy in this area will serve as a basis during future discussions on the future of the Arctic, enabling the European Union to make a strong contribution from the outset."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Wallis for initiating this debate and resolution."
"There are several reasons to do it."
"First, the Arctic region still lacks multilateral norms and regulations; in particular maritime traffic is not regulated by international safety rules and this is going to pose serious risks in the near future."
"Second, the region has entered a dramatic climate change we need to react to."
"Third, the Arctic is of growing economic interest as it may contain about one fifth of the world's still undiscovered oil and gas reserves."
"In fact competition has started between different interested countries about securing access and control of these resources."
"The planting of the Russian flag below the North Pole last year is one signal of this interest."
"Therefore we call on the Commission to come forward with a communication on the Arctic region, proposing subjects and working procedures."
"Especially we look forward to the Commission putting the Arctic regions' energy and security policy on its agenda."
"The EU has to form its own Arctic policies, involving two countries very close to us: Iceland and Norway."
"The EU Northern Dimension partially covers Arctic problems but it has become clear that a comprehensive EU Arctic policy is needed to address the wide and important context of Arctic problems."
"Finally we suggest that the Commission should start international negotiations to finally achieve an international treaty for the protection of the Arctic."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, many of us here have just had the pleasure of hearing you announce a number of positive developments that have never been mentioned before, and which will no doubt appear in the communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and to the Council, which we look forward to receiving."
"However, your response gave the impression that there was no complete recognition of the fact that events are snowballing."
"First of all, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, with a scientific consensus which is now shared, has told us that the Arctic faces greater threats than those imagined only four or five years ago."
"The living conditions of the Inuit people are under threat, and biological diversity is in danger."
"Many species, including polar bears, are also threatened."
"Secondly, this summer, for the first time in several millennia, the Arctic sea route was navigable from the east and west."
"That has never happened before."
"We have also had the recent announcement of oil slicks, degasification and oil damage in the Arctic."
"Thirdly, my fellow member from the PPE has just this instant reminded us that a Russian submarine planted a Russian flag at the North Pole."
"What was this supposed to mean?"
"Russia is claiming the expansion of its maritime zone to include its entire continental shelf. That represents 38% of the entire surface of the Arctic."
"It is a terrible situation because it is the prelude to the militarisation of the Arctic."
"The only way, Commissioner, of blocking this procedure, which is being examined by the United Nations Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf, is to commence negotiations for an international protection treaty."
"This has never been mentioned before."
"With Greenland and Denmark, the European Union has one country that borders the Arctic region and two other countries that are situated in Arctic territory."
"We have close ties with Iceland."
"The European Union has the power to ask it - and I believe that there is an urgent need for this, both in the interests of security and in the interests of the policing of shipping and climate preservation - to continue initiatives which could produce surplus energy."
"We need to begin negotiations now for an Arctic protection treaty, as there is for Antarctica."
"I know this because I was one of the sponsors of those negotiations."
"It is with this in mind that I propose swift action."
"There is no time for delay."
"This has to happen before the UN committee finishes examining Russia's claim."
"Only recently the Arctic region was the subject of the Arctic countries' national security and research investigations."
"Today, with climate change and melting glaciers, other aspects, such as environmental protection, energy resources and human health, are gaining priority."
"Unfortunately, the dominant interests appear to be economic, especially those concerning energy resources, as well as the introduction of new sea routes for trade and passenger transportation."
"According to scientific data, the Arctic harbours 30% of the world's undiscovered gas reserves, 20% of the natural liquid gas reserves and 13% of the oil resources."
"In recent years, through certain actions and their imperative position, the countries of the Arctic region and various others have made their wish to be the sovereign users of Arctic resources quite clear."
"Besides, there is division among the Arctic countries with a view to asserting spheres of influence."
"I welcome the ideas of the declaration to develop EU-Arctic policy, including economic and environmental issues, as well as those concerning adaptation by local people to the aspects of climate change."
"As far as energy is concerned, the issue of the Arctic region should be a part of the common EU energy policy; it is high time for actions to replace words."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a big thank you to Mrs Wallis and the others who have raised this issue."
"From outer space you can see that Planet Earth is warming up."
"It is conspicuous in the fact that the ice around the North Pole in summer melts more and more."
"This should be a warning bell for us to take more stringent action to protect the climate."
"Instead, it has started a race to exploit Arctic oil and gas reserves."
"This is a serious contradiction."
"We badly need an international treaty on the management of the Arctic region, but its starting point and main goal must be conservation of the region: a similar moratorium as that for the Antarctic."
"If we respond to the melting of the ice in the north simply by increasing the exploitation of fossil fuel reserves, we will make the climate change problem even worse than it is."
"Mr President, the Arctic plays an increasingly important geo-strategic role in the world, and we are now faced with the opening of hitherto closed seaways as a direct result of global climate change."
"This should not come as any surprise to us, however, as the Arctic is warming at a much faster rate with an increase of 2°C in temperature in the last hundred years compared to an average of 0.6°C increase in the rest of the world."
"This highly fragile and vulnerable ecosystem is coming under increasing pressure from resource-hungry nations which wish to exploit its potential."
"Without any multilateral governance in place, we would have no guarantee that they would have due regard for the sustainable lifestyle of the indigenous peoples or for the Arctic's fundamental importance as a stabilising force for the world's climate."
"The Arctic is critical for global climate stability, and I would urge the Commission to ensure that this is fully reflected in the forthcoming Commission communication on Arctic policy, together of course with energy and security policy matters."
"And, as paragraph 9 of our resolution says, 'by virtue of its impact on the world's climate and its singular natural environment, [the Arctic] merits special consideration as the EU develops its position for the 2009 COP 15 Framework Convention on Climate Change in ... Copenhagen', and as we discuss a framework for multilateral governance for this unique area."
"(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, the Arctic is the only part of the world that is not yet governed by any multilateral rules and regulations."
"However, interest in this area and its geopolitical as well as strategic importance have recently been growing on a surprising scale."
"Maritime traffic in the Arctic, both commercial and tourist, is on rising."
"Interest in its mineral wealth is increasing."
"Climate change has a negative impact on the native population's way of life and on biodiversity."
"For all these reasons the Arctic should be the discussed at international level with a view to the conclusion of a treaty on the protection of the Arctic, similar to the Madrid Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty of 1993."
"Three Arctic countries are Member States of the European Union and two further countries are members of the common European Economic Area."
"The European Union should therefore be a key player in future international negotiations concerning the Arctic."
"As we have heard, the European Commission is currently working on a communication on its policy regarding the Arctic area."
"In our joint motion for a resolution we call on the Commission to consider all of the aspects above."
"We also feel that it is crucial to ensure that the Arctic and the Arctic Ocean is an area free of military forces and nuclear weapons, as Mrs Diana Wallis said earlier."
"We would also call on the Commission to think about whether it should establish a specialised section for the Arctic area, which would aim at realising these goals and addressing the problems."
"Mr President, as we are all aware, surely, although we have some information about the Arctic, overall it is still terra incognita, in the truest sense of the word, as far as international law goes."
"My colleague Mr Kelam has mentioned the lack of legislation on maritime traffic."
"In addition, when we take the natural resources into consideration - it is estimated that 22% of the world's oil and gas reserves are in the Arctic region - this is a region of enormous significance to Europe's future."
"It is therefore particularly important that we present this resolution, under the leadership of Mrs Wallis."
"It is now very much up to the Commission to present a plan - a strategy with specific goals and measures."
"In my opinion, that is what is still lacking."
"Even though people have woken up and started to deal with the problem, there is still no strategic orientation."
"We do not want to come off second best here!"
"Some countries bordering the Arctic, particularly Russia, are attempting to use the facts, and it is very difficult to use appropriate action against a major power like Russia if we take such a long time about it."
"Europe as a collective must not subjugate itself to the Member States."
"This is a region in all our interests and it is unacceptable for us to allow certain Member States an advantage due to the fact that the CFSP is not functioning."
"The common interest of all of Europe is too important for that."
"Hence my renewed appeal to the Commission to present a precise, specific strategy as soon as possible so that we can discuss it in Parliament."
"There is too much at stake for us to dither about on this."
"Member of the Commission. - (CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that the debate clearly shows that this really is a problem that touches on fundamental strategic interests, whether it is viewed from the angle of environmental protection or from the geopolitical angle."
"It also shows that there is not much time left and that there are clear reasons for the European Union to formulate its policy."
"However, it is also clear that some proposals are complicated and that the general situation in the Arctic is very complicated, from the perspective of both the European Union and international law."
"For example, we must remember that the most important countries, such as Norway, Iceland, Greenland and the Russian Federation, are not members of the European Union and, consequently, our strategy cannot consist of exercising coastal or territorial rights."
"The fact still remains, however, that a strategy must be formulated."
"At any rate, the Commission is now working on such a strategy and a relevant communication will be tabled very soon, in the next few weeks in fact."
"Ladies and gentlemen, there is not enough time for me to respond to all of your comments but I have noted them down and the Commission will take them into account."
"As I tried to explain briefly, some issues are extremely complicated and extremely complex."
"I have received three draft resolutions submitted in accordance with Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Written declarations (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (HU) The North Pole has in recent years become one of the symbols of climate change."
"Due to its untapped natural resources, this region could soon become the epicentre of international conflict."
"This heralds a constant re-evaluation of the region, looking at whether there is a state which can give a clear-cut signal that it has a claim to the territory."
"While it is not the job of the European Parliament to get mixed up in geographical debates about the proper place of this region, I would like to highlight a couple of points."
"First, if there are any unsettled issues, they should be resolved by legal and diplomatic means and not by planting a flag in the area."
"I think the present international regulations, though by no means perfect, can give a framework of reference to settling issues by diplomatic means."
"On the other hand, bearing in mind increasing European demand, the untapped energy sources of the North Pole can contribute to Europe's security of supply."
"We must then declare that exploitation must not upset the biological balance of the region."
"Environmental considerations must be met in all circumstances."
"It is my opinion that current international legislation offers no comfort on these points."
"It is important, I feel, to note that the exploitation of the resources of the North polar region will play only a supplementary role in the provision of energy for Europe."
"Nor, for this reason alone, will the existence of these sources affect the wider use of renewable energy sources and continuing efforts to improve energy efficiency."
"Stepping up the fight against undeclared work (short presentation)"
"The next item is the report by Pier Antonio Panzeri, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on stepping up the fight against undeclared work."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am going to be brief, because it seems to be getting quite late."
"Obviously my thanks go out to the committees that expressed an opinion and to the shadow rapporteurs with whom we have worked over the past few months."
"It was partly thanks to their contribution that we were able to produce a text that could be supported by a large majority in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"We have shown that the fight against undeclared work must be seen as a problem that affects all countries and that if Europe wishes to attain the objectives set in Lisbon it must take on this battle."
"There are some paragraphs in the text that have been adopted that I consider to be crucial in an issue such as undeclared work which is so extensive: we are talking about some 20% of Europe's gross domestic product."
"This means that there is widespread illegality, which cannot be tolerated as it generates a strong distortion of competition between companies and territories and makes work and workers less secure."
"For this reason, it is only right that we draw attention to the problem, because there needs to be greater awareness of the fact that the failure to seriously combat undeclared work is liable to generate these problems and at the same time to greatly weaken social security schemes in Europe in the near future."
"These considerations were the starting point for this proposal being submitted to Parliament."
"As I said, there are key points in the report, which, if the Commission also commits to them, could deliver positive results and proposals that we consider useful."
"I think I can say that the European Parliament has done its bit."
"It is now up to the other institutions to do theirs so that we can achieve the aims of the fight against undeclared work."
"Member of the Commission. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur and say a few words about as number of the issues highlighted in the report."
"The fact is that undeclared work is increasingly becoming a cross-border phenomenon, as the Commission states in its Green Paper on modernising labour law."
"It is therefore necessary to pay close attention to this issue."
"In our opinion, establishing a team of experts as well as developing a system of information exchange between social security bodies such as labour inspectorates, are important steps for 'the establishment of some kind of permanent Community structure for cross-border cooperation', as suggested in paragraph 53."
"We all agree that greater efforts are needed to solve the problem of undeclared work."
"However, I think that in general the most appropriate and justified steps would be those taken at Member State level."
"Our research has shown that undeclared work in the Member States differs from country to country."
"Consequently, taking measures at Community level should not be considered the immediate priority."
"The report proposes a 'pact to declare the undeclared', offering more relaxed legislation on a temporary basis, which would stimulate the regularisation of undeclared work."
"Although this is a good idea, in our opinion the Member States should act in conjunction with the social partners who also include undeclared work among their priority tasks throughout Europe."
"The Commission would have the authority to support their initiatives through campaigns funded by the PROGRESS programme or through the Structural Funds."
"Regarding the call to propose a framework statute for spouses or family members helping in family businesses, I am pleased to be able to say that the Commission recently adopted the proposal for a directive on the application of the principle of equal treatment between men and women, which will replace Directive 86/613/EEC and ensure that spouses or family members helping in family businesses enjoy the same level of protection as self-employed workers."
"Within the framework of the PROGRESS programme, the Commission is also working on developing tools and methods for better assessment and monitoring of undeclared work, and on the identification and exchange of good practices that exist at EU level."
"We are putting more emphasis on the exchange of good practices and we hope that in this way we will acquire the experience necessary to suggest, as soon as possible, a pilot project of interest to as many Member States as possible."
"I will not go into detail on the issue of illegal immigration and the proposal for sanctions against employers of illegally staying third-country nationals."
"We acknowledge the concern expressed in the report about the treatment of the victims of illegal employment and the level of contractors' responsibilities, and we will take it into account in our discussions with the Council."
"The Commission is extremely pleased to have the support of the European Parliament for its efforts to put an end to the transitional provisions limiting the mobility of workers from the new Member States."
"In conclusion, I would like to say that this extremely constructive report will give the Commission and the Council new energy to make the fight against undeclared work more visible and to increase our corresponding objectives."
"That concludes the debate."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Written declarations (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - Undeclared work exploits workers, distorts labour markets and provides an unfair competitive advantage to unscrupulous employers, which leads to a low-level underground economy."
"One catchment area for undeclared work is to be found amongst illegal/irregular immigrants within a number of Member States of the Union."
"This racket of cheap labour is growing at a very fast rate."
"It is expected to grow further since illegal immigrants would need the money and at the same time would be terrified to report defaulting employers for fear of being expelled from the country by the authorities."
"I appreciate that some Member States are taking a number of measures to eradicate this flagrant abuse of the law, but on the whole, the record of success in this regard has not been very impressive."
"The EU and the Member States need to harmonise their efforts and to enact more legislation with a view to taking serious punitive action against those who are in default."
"The availability of illegal workers and the culture of underground work, lax legislation, unscrupulous employers, financial and economic crises and falling profitability margins all make it very attractive for exploitative practices."
"The European Union (EU) continues to have an extensive undeclared labour market."
"With the free movement of workers within the EU, cases of undeclared work have increased."
"This is disadvantageous not only to people working illegally, but also to countries' finances."
"Illegal work interferes with the functioning of the internal market, preventing effective competition."
"People who work illegally are often exploited by their employers; they have no right to benefit from social security or healthcare services."
"Such cases are particularly common in Member States that still continue to use the transitional measures, limiting the free movement of workers from the new Member States."
"These restrictions encourage the practice of undeclared work and should therefore be scrapped as soon as possible."
"It is regrettable and inexcusable for the EU to hold its citizens powerless hostages to this inexpedient policy."
"During interviews with Lithuanian emigrants working abroad, complaints about employers who take advantage of their lack of knowledge of local legislation and lack of language skills and fail to pay them for their work are very often heard."
"To my mind, the EU should take firm, decisive measures in order to tackle undeclared work."
"At the moment employers who use undeclared labour have little responsibility; they often get away with paying insignificant fines that do not discourage them from hiring undeclared workers."
"In my opinion, sanctions with a direct impact on employers' economic interests, such as the suspension or cancellation of their business licences, thereby preventing them from benefiting from access to Member States' or EU funds, would be much more effective."
"This could reduce undeclared work or even eliminate it altogether."
"in writing. - (HU) The 2007 Eurobarometer end-of-year survey showed that 5% of European Union citizens capable of work (19.7 million persons out of the EU's 392.9 million inhabitants) admitted to working illegally."
"In some Member States the level of undeclared work reached or exceeded 20% of GDP."
"Undeclared work is a factor with permanently existing negative economic effects in the European labour market, a vicious circle it is very difficult for the employed, and the work providers, to get out of."
"The sectors most under this stress are agriculture, construction, house maintenance, and the hotel and tourism services, where uncertainty and unfavourable wages are typical."
"For this reason the updating of labour and employment standards and the effort to control this black market cannot remain at the level of empty hypothesis but must be embraced by the Member States."
"It is my proposal that the Commission should draft a European Union strategy to fight the black market and should shoulder the lion's share of the work of employment and social supervision."
"The Member States must pursue reforms in the tax and social security regimes, thereby reducing the oppressive tax burden on the labour force."
"So that households can purchase services at lower prices, the introduction of EU service vouchers would be proposed; these would ensure payment of both social security contributions and tax payments."
"For the fight against undeclared work it is however an essential condition that the Member States open up their labour markets to each other's employees, as partial restriction in these areas encourages the formation of regional inequalities as well as divergence from EU principles and the European approach."
"in writing. - (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Panzeri for his excellent report on more effective prevention of undeclared work in the EU."
"According to the report, undeclared work accounts for up to 20% of GDP in some Member States."
"In these countries especially, but also in all the other EU countries, undeclared work is a problem for the country's economy, but at the same time it also violates the entitlement of employees to human work."
"The EU is committed to the targets for 'decent work' with its agenda, which threatens not to be implemented in any practical sense unless there is effective control and a clear system of rules."
"The poor working conditions and non-existent terms and conditions of employment of migrant workers doing undeclared work have created a new form of social slavery in Europe."
"To root out the undeclared workforce we can use both a stick and a carrot."
"There should be more controls in place to make it possible to intervene faster than now in cases of possible abuse."
"The trade union movement has an important role as one that proposes, monitors and reinforces fair play in working life."
"National information campaigns for foreign employees are a way to improve workers' awareness of the rules of employment in each country."
"The truth is, we will not get rid of the problem of the undeclared workforce merely through regulation."
"Fair play in employment, decent pay and adequate levels of social security must be guaranteed in every EU country, as well as around the world."
"People must have the opportunity to earn a decent livelihood and enjoy basic social security, regardless of which country they live in."
"in writing. - (RO) Undeclared work is a phenomenon encountered in all EU Member States and an alarming feature of the European economic market, which goes against flexicurity principles."
"The fight against undeclared work is somehow similar to the duel between Microsoft and hackers."
"The more innovative our methods to fight undeclared work are, the more efficient the tricks used by the employers become."
"And the best example of this is the emergence of ""grey labour” when employers would rather enter into employment contracts for the minimum guaranteed wages while the rest of the money up to the real wages is paid without using legal forms."
"In Romania, the phenomenon has become more and more extensive and currently grey labour accounts for 20 - 50% of total employment."
"The alarming fact is that, if at the beginning the users of this method were small enterprises, now there are well known names which avoid taxes and social security contributions resulting in a very small pension for the employee which will bring him/her close to the poverty threshold."
"I have emphasised these aspects because the future strategy for fighting undeclared work as mentioned in the report must take into account the specific situation in each Member State."
"We need a unified European approach and efficient collaboration between the governmental agencies, labour inspectorates and the social partners."
"Implementation of the social legislation relating to road transport (short presentation)"
"The next item is the report by Alejandro Cercas, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the implementation of social legislation relating to road transport."
"Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for being here."
"As you are aware, in March 2002, the Council and Parliament came to an agreement, through conciliation, on Directive 2002/15/EC, which establishes the requirements that have to be fulfilled for the working time of persons performing mobile road transport activities, in order to ensure their health and safety, to ensure road safety and also to align conditions of competition for all enterprises."
"It included all types of work, not only driving but also the physical work that these drivers sometimes do in loading and unloading or cleaning the vehicles."
"That conciliation procedure resolved the most significant problem, which was whether or not self-employed workers should be included, and the parties agreed together, with the support of the Commission, that self-employed workers would be included, in order to put an end, once and for all, to the problems of double legislation, the double standards applied to self-employed drivers and employed drivers."
"The lack of common regulation raised huge problems: these self-employed workers were working extremely long days, causing problems for their personal lives and for road safety, and also because drivers were posing as self-employed and undermining the rules of fair competition."
"It was therefore a great achievement to put an end once and for all, with a reasonable transition period, to this double legislation, and in 2002, the Commission, the Council and Parliament all reached the conclusion that it was the most rational and logical step."
"We have produced this own-initiative report, with the support of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Committee on Transport and Tourism because, Commissioner, it now appears that this principle, this commitment from the Commission, the Council and Parliament, is not so firm; it appears that there are ambiguities; it appears that there are confusions and explanations that we are not satisfied with."
"The Commission was meant to have produced a report to set out legislation to ensure that these self-employed workers were indeed included."
"The truth is that the report was presented last year, but it was, in its own words, inadequate and we are waiting for the final report, which means that now, six months from the end of the term established for integration, we do not have a report or any initiatives from the Commission."
"That is why, Commissioner, with the date approaching for the inclusion of self-employed workers - and we are neither clear nor convinced that there is still the will that existed at that time, and there are rumours that there are thoughts of reviewing the criteria - Parliament has produced this report with two objectives: as a reminder and as a demand."
"It is a reminder of the commitments made by the Council, the Commission and Parliament to workers, businesses and all citizens to put an end to this situation, which is a hotbed for lawsuits, and a demand that the promises be kept."
"There are no circumstances that have arisen to change the reasons."
"There is still the same need; therefore, for the health of workers, for road safety and for perfect competition, we should include self-employed drivers in the Directive."
"A final request, Commissioner."
"I think that it is very important, at the end of this term, that you do not go back on the commitment made."
"Economic demands or sectors of the profession seeking excessive competitive advantages should never be put ahead of the public needs that I am referring to."
"Therefore, and because it is important, Commissioner, I want to call on you, on behalf of all my fellow members, not to upset the balance and for the promised legislation to be put in place soon."
"Member of the Commission. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament is today discussing the implementation of, and the possible ways of further developing, the Directive on the working time of persons performing mobile road activities."
"This specific legislation organises the working time of persons performing mobile road activities, such as bus drivers and lorry drivers."
"However, the Directive does not include self-employed drivers."
"Many Members will recall that the Directive was adopted in 2002 following an arduous conciliation procedure, on the basis of which a complex clause was approved."
"This clause establishes that with effect from 23 March 2009 the scope of the Directive will be extended to include all self-employed drivers if the Commission sends a report to the Council and the European Parliament concerning an impact assessment of the present circumstances under which self-employed drivers are not included, and drafts a legislative proposal concerning self-employed drivers."
"Although the question of whether or not to include self-employed drivers in the scope of the Directive is a genuine dilemma, let me say that it is also a false problem."
"The Commission's main aim when drafting a legislative proposal concerning road transport working conditions is to ensure a high level of social protection and fair competition as well as improve road safety."
"Consequently, the Commission considered it necessary to introduce a special regime for road transport mobile workers through a specific law accompanying the general Directive on working time."
"However, the post-2002 provisions of the legislation concerning drivers have changed significantly and it has been a positive change."
"Thanks to your help, and Mr Markov's help in particular, new rules on driving times, rest periods and inspection procedures were adopted in 2005."
"While the Working Time Directive adopted in 2002 originally applied only to employed drivers, the rules adopted in 2005 apply to all drivers, both employed and self-employed."
"The rules apply to 80% of the working time of all drivers."
"Consequently, Parliament's founded concerns about this issue which were voiced in the course of the conciliation procedure for the 2002 Working Time Directive were properly allayed."
"Regarding the revision of the 2002 Working Time Directive, it is no secret that the attitudes of the individual Member States to this issue are very different and that opinions are also divided within the Member States and within the transport sector."
"The Commission published its report on the consequences of the exclusion of self-employed drivers from the scope of the Directive in May 2007."
"The report reached two conclusions."
"Firstly, it stated that there were both advantages and disadvantages of including and excluding self-employed drivers."
"Secondly, the implementation of the Directive had caused some problems because the Member States had found it difficult to enforce it."
"This problem was chiefly due to the mistaken classification of some drivers as self-employed."
"This is how the transport sector describes those drivers who, although officially self-employed, are in reality dependent on one company and are unable to plan their work themselves as they would like to do."
"They are socially vulnerable and, as I said before, although the Directive applies to them already, we need to see significant improvements in its implementation."
"The Commission very carefully monitored the transposition of the Directive into national legislation and, when necessary, commenced proceedings where breaches were observed."
"As soon as the Member States completed the transposition of the Directive into national legislation, we performed a thorough check of the quality of this transposition."
"In many cases this resulted in the commencement of proceedings where breaches of duty were observed."
"At present the Commission is also carrying out an impact assessment with a view to establishing a compact basis for a legislative proposal to be developed this year."
"Consequently, it would be premature for the Commission to adopt already a view on those aspects of the issues concerning self-employed drivers that pose the question of whether or not to include them in the scope of the Working Time Directive."
"I welcome the report by Mr Cercas, particularly the developments concerning the issue of transposition."
"However, as I said before, the Commission is of the opinion that the solution put forward in the report does not take into account the problem of the full and correct transposition of the Directive for the workers it already covers."
"This is what we have been working on up until now and what we hope to achieve with the next amendment."
"That concludes the debate."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Written declarations (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - Road transport is an essential economic activity in the EU."
"Compliance with rules for driving, working time and rest periods are basic requirements for ensuring road safety and the health and safety of drivers and passengers."
"We particularly welcome the inclusion of all workers in the sector, including self-employed drivers, within the rules on working time which will guarantee fair competition within the sector."
"It must also be clear that the Directive establishes minimum requirements and must under no circumstances lead to a levelling down of the more favourable conditions that already exist in some Member States."
"Promoting social inclusion and combating poverty (short presentation)"
"The next item is the report by Gabriele Zimmer, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on promoting social inclusion and combating poverty, including child poverty, in the EU."
"Mr President, firstly, I regret that, for the own-initiative report that I am to present on behalf of the committee, neither open debate in plenary nor amendments are possible."
"I find it unacceptable that Members of Parliament restrict their own rights in this way and devalue own-initiative reports."
"Our committee held very vigorous debates about the reports being presented today, with more than 200 amendments, 40 compromise amendments and two hearings for experts and stakeholders, all in close cooperation with the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality."
"All this demonstrates the level of interest in this subject among Members."
"The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs voted by an overwhelming majority across all groups to continue to develop the EU strategy for combating poverty and social exclusion and I hope that the entire plenary will do the same tomorrow."
"The committee makes it absolutely clear that, given the 78 million people living in poverty, including 19 million children, the EU and its Member States have an obligation to initiate specific, measurable goals to promote social integration and combat poverty."
"A few days ago, the Commission suggested principles for the strategy of active integration, which should be approved by the European Council."
"As a committee, we support these suggestions, to the extent that we were made aware of them in advance."
"We go further, however, and call in our report for the development of a holistic approach to active social integration."
"We believe this must be based on four pillars: firstly, making incomes poverty-proof through minimum income benefits and minimum wages; secondly, active employment market policies for better workplaces and sufficient incomes; thirdly, improved access to public services of general interest and quality services; fourthly, improved participation by those affected by poverty and exclusion in developing and implementing this strategy."
"Furthermore, we want to integrate gender equality into all aspects of this strategy."
"Our committee finds it unsatisfactory that not even all EU states have a nationwide network of minimum income benefits."
"The level of minimum income benefits in many countries is below the EU poverty threshold."
"We therefore demand that income from minimum benefits and paid work should not lead to income poverty."
"We call upon the Council to agree on EU-wide targets for the level of minimum income benefits - at least 60% of the national median income - and minimum wages - at least 60% of the national average wage or the average wage in the relevant sector."
"Member States should meet these targets within a set deadline, taking full account of the principle of subsidiarity and applying the open method of coordination."
"The committee paid particular attention in its consultations on this report to combating child poverty."
"For us, the focus is on the well-being of children."
"We base our work on the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and derive from that a politically integrated requirement to combat child poverty."
"We point out that in our view, access to high-quality services provides crucial momentum for the social integration of adults and, particularly, for that of children, particularly children at risk of poverty."
"We insist that the Member States begin by reducing child poverty by 50% by 2012 as a first step."
"Furthermore, we affirm this Parliament's resolution in January this year on combating the phenomenon of street children by 2015."
"Member of the Commission. - (CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to say a few words about the report in question."
"You are well aware that in the renewed Social Agenda the Commission put forward the idea of fighting poverty as an integral part of the Social Agenda and the recommendation on social inclusion took up this idea."
"I am glad that the report, presented by the rapporteur in her speech, expressed support for this recommendation and also looked positively on some of the key sentiments in the recommendation."
"Let me say that while the Commission considers integral efforts to achieve social inclusion to be extremely important, it places even more emphasis on the issue of child poverty."
"In this context, I would like to point out that this is the first time in the present Commission's term that this topic has been presented in such an excellent manner."
"We aim to continue in this direction in the future because it is quite clear that hereditary poverty, which is passed down from parent to child, is one of the serious sociological problems linked to poverty."
"In our view, it is extremely important to break this vicious cycle."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is obvious that in this regard the Commission can rely on Parliament's support."
"Of course I will be interested to see how the documents and report progress in the future."
"It is also quite clear that the Commission will make considerable use of Parliament's decisions and opinions in its future efforts to achieve social inclusion: this is not an issue that can be solved with one communication alone, nor is it a battle that can be won within a short period of a few weeks or months."
"That concludes the debate."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Written declarations (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (BG) Mr President, colleagues, I would like to express my support for Gabriele Zimmer's report on promoting social inclusion and combating poverty."
"Combating child poverty is a EU priority, but there are numerous obstacles to proper socialisation."
"I would like to familiarise you with an unprecedented case in Bulgaria, which demonstrates how the authorities restrict the opportunity of thousands of children to receive education and achieve something better in their life."
"The state administration subjects Christian children in the public schools to religious discrimination."
"On account of the Muslim feast of Ramazan Bayram, which is not a public holiday except in states professing Islam, and with the connivance of the Bulgarian Ministry of Education, the schools in the regions of Kardzhali, Razgrad, Targovishte and Shumen closed their doors for two days in order to celebrate the Muslim feast."
"Despite the secular nature of Bulgarian education, a religious school holiday was declared in those regions!"
"The Bulgarian children were forced to stay out of class."
"Bulgaria is a Christian country and has no decrees on nationwide observance of Muslim feasts."
"How then have the Bulgarian public schools closed their doors and honoured a non-Bulgarian religious feast, at the expense of their own children, tacitly and without explanations?"
"A certain person or certain people in Bulgaria are evidently interested in leaving the public schools' classrooms empty so as to fill the Turkish mosques."
"in writing. - This report has been described as a holistic approach to eradicating poverty."
"However, as the global financial storm continues to batter our citizens and economies, it has never been more clear that we live in an interconnected, interdependent world."
"Policies enacted within the Union also have effect outside the Union."
"Therefore, problems outside the Union should inform the policies within it."
"We cannot isolate the fight against poverty in Europe from the global fight against exclusion."
"Child labour reinforces poverty, condemning generation after generation to ignorance, ill health and early death."
"The proper place for children is in school."
"A developed economy cannot be built by an uneducated workforce."
"Children at work exclude their parents from such work and thereby the potential to struggle for better conditions."
"Indeed, children at work contribute to the global race to the bottom."
"In 2005 78 million people (16%) in the European Union were living on the poverty line."
"Currently every fifth EU citizen lives in sub-standard conditions; each day some 1.8 million people seek shelter for the night in hostels for the homeless; 10% of individuals live in households where no-one works; the extent of long-term unemployment is as much as 4%; 15% of employees receive extremely low wages; and 8% of employees live in poverty despite having jobs."
"Moreover, 19 million children are affected by poverty."
"Among the EU Member States there are countries in which suitable national social security systems have still not been put in place."
"In this context, the European Commission's proposed approach to active social integration is worthy of recognition."
"The policy of social integration must guarantee the fundamental right of all people to have a decent life and to be part of society and it must also guarantee an integrated labour market, better access to high-quality services, sexual equality and an absence of discrimination."
"The level of social aid is currently lower than the threat of poverty, and the Member States should adapt it to meet its main objective - lifting people out of poverty."
"Social protection programmes should provide people with effective help and support them in finding stable employment."
"There is a need to take immediate action to benefit children suffering from a range of problems, children of immigrant families, neglected children, exploited children and children experiencing violence."
"in writing. - Following the recent, in fact current, financial and economic upheaval and the global repercussions, I feel there is a necessity to re-evaluate the definition and thresholds of poverty."
"I am concerned that a significant amount of poverty is not as obvious as it was decades ago but I am afraid it is just as real."
"The contemporary lifestyle helps camouflage this new poverty to a large extent."
"The purchasing power of many households is being eroded by sharp increases in costs in general, and especially those relating to food, health and energy."
"Families with low incomes, pensioners, the unemployed and other niches within our society are at risk of becoming vulnerable and will struggle to survive as these costs represent the largest share of their monthly budget."
"The performance of economies worldwide is expected to deteriorate rapidly as a recession is expected to take over."
"This would inevitably create instabilities in all sectors of the economy."
"Reductions in social programmes and services would compound the problem for those who are experiencing an erosion in their purchasing power."
"I feel that the Union and the Member States have to address this issue to reduce the drastic inequalities and hardships that hidden poverty is having on many EU citizens."
"in writing. - The necessity of eradicating child poverty is felt to be an important issue within the European Union."
"Roma children especially are the most deprived minority, lacking assistance in the areas of housing, employment, education and healthcare."
"The combination of these factors results in a dire situation where Romani children have no future and where Roma and Romani children are socially excluded, especially in cases where Romani children grow up in extreme poverty."
"This type of environment denies Romani children the chance to exercise their existing rights which they deserve."
"Roma children who grow up in poverty lack the opportunities given freely to the majority."
"Social exclusion and child poverty must be taken into consideration during EU and Member States' policy-making, especially in areas relating to active social inclusion."
"Current data show about 50% of Roma are illiterate or semi-illiterate; 30% of children aged 3-10 are suffering from serious illness such as TB; the life expectancy of Roma is 10 years lower than the majority."
"The level of social exclusion that Roma encounter in childhood is compounded as they grow into adults."
"In most European cities 90% of Roma are unemployed and have little hope of finding employment in the near future; this vicious circle has to be broken for the social cohesion of the EU."
"in writing. - (HU) Our children's well-being is based on a healthy environment, decent housing, proper food, and access to education."
"The title of the report is too wide-ranging to focus with proper emphasis on the position of children."
"It cannot therefore express, but merely hint at, the extent to which child poverty shapes the future and present of society."
"The report covers the themes of integration and poverty in a complex way, sometimes holistically, sometimes focusing on at-risk groups such as ethnic minorities, migrants, the elderly and persons with disabilities, with particular mention of the position of women and children."
"Naturally I support the view that employment is the most important tool for breaking out of poverty."
"In itself, however, it is not a guarantee of social integration or the elimination of poverty."
"It also shows that among the employed there are many who are poor."
"A reason for this, reinforcing the message of the report, lies in improper working conditions and the inequitable wages system applying to certain disadvantaged groups."
"It is unfortunate that this document, which strives to reflect diversity, does not offer an opportunity for the problems of certain at-risk groups to be explored."
"Given the commitment of the author and the content of this report, I am sure the contribution it makes will assist the European institutions in making laws which will achieve its purpose, helping those for whom it is intended, the poor."
"in writing. - (ET) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen. Every person should have an equal right to participate fully in the life of society, including the right to work and be economically active, and to enjoy a normal standard of living and well-being for the society in which they live."
"Employment is unquestionably the best way of preventing poverty and social exclusion."
"It is, however, a curious fact that 20 million working people live in poverty in the EU today, most of them women."
"To my mind, in addition to tackling the problems of poverty and social exclusion in vulnerable sections of the population, greater attention must be focused within the EU on poverty among working people, particularly among women."
"A survey must be made of EU policies to stimulate the labour market: in order to offer people greater social protection, we need a springboard for regular, gainful and legally secure employment."
"I am also of the view that the remuneration payable to workers in the Member States (the minimum wage) should be fair and should guarantee their income, thus preventing them from falling into the poverty trap."
"I welcome the EU target set out in the report to provide for remuneration of at least 60% of the relevant (national, sectoral, etc.) average wage and the fact that the Member States have agreed on a timetable for achieving that target."
"Only a balance between flexibility and protection can improve employment and social inclusion."
"in writing. - (RO) 9 years after launching the ""decent work” concept, half of the planet's labour force makes less than $2 a day and in 2007 the women's employment rate was 49% of the entire population, compared to that of the men, 74.3%."
"In Romania, only 15% of the total number of employees benefit from decent work places and the number of women who risk becoming victims of poverty is approximately 10% higher than that of men."
"The discrepancy between salaries is obvious as men earn more than women in most economic fields and the monthly difference is approximately 1/3 of the minimum basic salary at country level."
"The study conducted by the International Labour Organisation published on the occasion of International Woman's Day clearly shows that Europe can no longer afford to ignore women's potential and access to the labour market and to decent jobs is crucial for achieving gender equality."
"Access to decent work for all citizens must be a priority of employment policies because this is the basic social inclusion mechanism and, at the same time, the only sustainable solution for the fight against poverty."
"in writing. - (ET) Social inclusion and child poverty are things we should take seriously and in that respect the committee's initiative is welcome."
"We should nonetheless question whether our plans are ambitious enough."
"The Member States should take several important steps in this regard."
"The thing we need most in order to reduce social exclusion is for people to have incomes which are enough to live on."
"We should acknowledge that in most of the EU States where it is established, the minimum wage does not provide for the normal income."
"Falling social assistance clearly has a role in social exclusion."
"Given the current economic depression there is open talk in Estonia, where there have been lively debates on how to balance the budget, of compromises on child benefit."
"Universal child benefit is something which all children deserve and as such, in addition to being of practical assistance, is of great symbolic significance."
"As a former Minister for Population and the current President of the Estonian Child Protection League, I am au fait with these matters and I shall do everything to ensure that this support, although costly and inefficient, is not abolished."
"In addition to income support there are important targeted benefits to vulnerable groups such as the elderly, single parents, households with many children, and the disabled."
"Benefits of this kind should cover extra costs in connection with personal support, and medical and social care."
"The benefits in place in the United Kingdom for the elderly during cold weather to enable them to keep their homes warm and combat energy poverty are an excellent example of what other Member States, including Estonia, should take as a model."
"in writing. - (RO) Road transport services represent 1.6% of the GDP and provide jobs for 4.5 million European Union citizens."
"Economy and society, in general, largely depend on the efficiency of road transport since 44% of the goods are carried by trucks and 85% of the people travel by car, bus or coach."
"I consider that, in order to meet the legal requirements regarding social conditions, Member States should invest in the road transport infrastructure and take the necessary actions to ensure the correct level of investments for the development of road transport infrastructure."
"In this context, the building of safe parking areas should be a priority."
"In order to have no artificial barriers to the free movement of goods, I requested, by way of an amendment, that a report on the situation of traffic controls in every Member State be submitted to the European Parliament by the Commission."
"Taking into consideration that there are types of controls limiting the free movement of goods or persons, I requested the Commission to review the existing legislation and propose its amendment in order to ensure a consistent system of traffic controls."

"Use by Parliament of the symbols of the Union (new Rule 202a) (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Carlos Carnero González, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on insertion in Parliament's Rules of Procedure of a new Rule 202a on the use by Parliament of the symbols of the Union."
"rapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, the decision my report proposes to this Chamber is, above all, political, in the strictest sense of the word."
"The formal decision we are about to adopt, though clearly relevant, is the very least of it."
"Indeed, we are about to amend our Rules of Procedure to make official what is already a reality, what the different Union institutions have been doing for years."
"I would like to remind Members of that."
"We are proposing that this House should use the Union flag in all its meeting places and on the most formal occasions, for example, at constituent sittings or when receiving heads of state."
"We also propose that the anthem should be played on these occasions, that the motto 'United in Diversity' should be included in all our written documents and that Europe Day should be celebrated."
"Mr President, although you were in favour of the idea, we are not suggesting that the euro should be used as a symbol."
"However, in our opinion, the euro is a great tool, a wonderful instrument that is undoubtedly helping us to deal with the international financial crisis."
"Where would we be without the euro?"
"We would be back in this torturous situation of competitive devaluation that would have brought our real economy to its knees in the face of international financial speculation."
"The most important aspect of my report is the political message to citizens."
"This message is very clear: the symbols of the Union are alive and well in the institution that represents, more directly than any other, the 500 million inhabitants of our 27 Member States."
"This means that the constitutional process that was launched in 2002 with the European Convention lives on in spite of frequent and sizeable obstacles and setbacks."
"The Convention, of which I had the honour of being a member, along with other distinguished Members here today, had no doubts about including the symbols of the EU in the Union's primary law for the first time."
"It thus happily brought to an end a curious situation whereby the most important body of law did not recognise what the public had long accepted: the symbols."
"The decision in this respect was unanimous and no one challenged it during the ratification process; on the contrary, it was one of the provisions most welcomed by Europe's supporters."
"I have to say that it came as a huge surprise, therefore, when the Intergovernmental Conference which adopted the Lisbon Treaty decided to remove all mention of European symbols from this document."
"The fact is that, through our decision today, we can undo this error."
"Of course, we are not amending primary law, but we can do our part and move a step closer to formalising Union symbols within the institutional framework."
"Symbols express a shared goal and shared values."
"In Europe's case, it is the desire to build a Union of and for all citizens who want unity, freedom, democracy, justice, equality and solidarity, which are European values that we also consider to be universal."
"Symbols also allow us to establish what we are and who we want to be in relation to the rest of the world, which recognises us by them."
"Who, for instance, has not felt proud to represent the Union when wearing the election observer's waistcoat?"
"Furthermore, symbols help us to remember where we came from, that day when our story of unity, growth and freedom began to be written."
"What the President of Parliament said a few days ago in Madrid about young people and history has much to do with symbols."
"We must remind young people where we came from, who we are and where we are going."
"Symbols get this message across quickly and clearly."
"These symbols unite, not divide, us."
"This is not only a great virtue, but, more than anything, a huge advantage."
"Mr President, the wonderful writer Aldous Huxley said that the most important thing is not experience, but what you do with that experience."
"The same applies to symbols."
"The flag is not intended to be an icon, but to be used in our everyday lives to strengthen the unity for which we are known."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE group. - (HU) Mr President, I went to Kiev recently and the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry building could hardly be seen as it had been adorned with a three-storey-high European flag."
"If this symbol can be given so much respect and honour outside the European Union I am sure that here too the European Union can treat the symbols with respect."
"I would like to correct my colleague, who has prepared an excellent report, on this point."
"The rule on the symbols of the European Union is at present part of the acquis communautaire, of European legislation: the flag with twelve stars and a blue background, the anthem based on the Ode to Joy, the long-standing meetings of the heads of State and Government, and even the headquarters of the European Parliament, Strasbourg, and of course we hold our sessions in Strasbourg."
"And at this moment, so to speak, there is no regulation vacuum since, at this moment, rules do exist for the symbols of the European Union, whether they are in the Lisbon Treaty or not."
"At the same time, an important aim of this report is to regulate how our own institution, the European Parliament, does honour to our standard."
"It is my conviction that the sense of identity, of where we belong, is very important."
"We often talk about how our citizens do not understand our complicated Europe."
"The symbols are one approach, helping them to feel closer to the European Union."
"Many, many people are fond of these symbols, honour and respect them, and I am sure that it is for us too, here in Parliament, as committed Europeans, a point of major importance to bring in a rule on how we use the symbols of the European Union in our own institution. Thank you for your attention."
"Mr President, why is it so very important that we should make such an effort and hold this debate, especially now, on the subject of the symbols of the European Union?"
"I believe that there are two reasons."
"Firstly, we as the European Parliament must show in the way we habitually go about our business that the EU is about more than just legal texts."
"Let me remind you that, as the rapporteur has said, the symbols originate from the Constitutional Treaty."
"An attempt was made to institutionalise them, but it is very significant that today we are continuing this effort to keep them alive."
"Why?"
"Because they happen to show that Europe is not built on flawed legal texts, which are necessary but are difficult for the various nations to understand."
"They happen to symbolise something else, and how appropriate that fine Greek verb is here: a political project, an idea of Europe."
"As such, I think it must be kept alive, especially today."
"The second reason lies in what the symbols conceal - the symbols behind the symbols: in other words, the idea of the EU's common action based on its values."
"That is what the symbols are: a common action based on values that we need now more than ever."
"Thus if we say that the crisis we are all experiencing - and I am referring not only to the economic crisis, but also to Europe's present institutional and moral crisis - is a symbol of these difficult times, I think the EU's response must be united action."
"This means that we could potentially all move forward together."
"I believe there could not be a more apt and at the same time more bitter example than that of Iceland today."
"This country does not belong to the EU, but it is so buffeted by the economic storm that its people are wondering whether they should indeed be part of this 'Europe of ideas'."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, the symbols of the European Union are a celebration of the unity that we have achieved and that we hope to strengthen."
"Symbols such as the EU flag, the anthem and the motto are already widely used at official events and within all Member States."
"The European flag and anthem, with which we all are so familiar today, were first adopted at the 1985 Milan European Council."
"By then the flag had already been in existence for 30 years."
"The flag is intended to represent perfection, complementarity and solidarity and to symbolise Europe's unity."
"The motto 'unified in diversity' is the most recent of the symbols."
"It originates from an initiative by the European Parliament and can now be seen as a definition of the European project."
"During the plenary yesterday, Ingrid Betancourt of Latin America and France said that she dreams of a Latin America that could cooperate and be as united as the European Union."
"It is clear that our symbols serve as an identity and an indication to the rest of the world that we have accomplished great things together."
"Although I believe in this unity and hope that it continues, I have been disappointed that on many occasions we have not been unanimous."
"For example, last week the European Union President, Mr Sarkozy, invited only four of the Member States to discuss the financial crisis."
"It is very interesting that the President of the European Union does not pay attention to the solidarity and unity of the European Union."
"This action - like all actions of this kind - only serves to divide rather than to unite us."
"It is ironic that we are so proud of our unity and solidarity, but at the same time the President of the Union seems to pick favourites with regard to the most important current issue."
"I hope that by using the flag, anthem and motto more often we will all be reminded of the values that are vital to the existence of the European Union but, at the same time, we must remember that how we behave is most important of all."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, as the rapporteur stated, this debate is entirely political in nature and is taking place in a very specific political context."
"I agree with previous speakers that Europe is currently experiencing a crisis of values and that values are Europe's lifeblood."
"Imposing symbols in violation of legislation currently in force in Europe is no substitute for these values."
"The symbols concerned were rejected at the Intergovernmental Conference that confirmed the Lisbon Treaty."
"Nonetheless, Parliament is today endeavouring to impose them."
"In so doing, Parliament is acting in defiance of clear principles according to which measures to be directly implemented and binding on all Member States may only be imposed through a treaty."
"Such a method of imposing measures intended to be binding is unacceptable."
"It violates the fundamental principle upon which the European Union is based, and which involves unconditional compliance with international law and agreements."
"It amounts to side-stepping the provision rejected in the European Treaty and bringing in measures aimed at establishing via the back door a pseudo-state called Europe."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, I fully support the parliamentary initiative on the flag and the anthem."
"European unity needs these symbols because they bring Europe closer to the people and create an identity, and so they need to be officially recognised."
"Against this background, I see our decision today as a small but significant step to bring us back, as soon as possible, to normality."
"The removal of the anthem and the flag from the Treaty - the background to which I of course am fully aware of - is and remains an essentially barbaric act against European unity, for which those who called for this step ultimately bear responsibility."
"The fact is that we have played into the hands of the Ganleys, Klauses and Haiders: their nationalist slogans about a European 'superstate', which were targeted against European integration, have thus gained a veneer of credibility."
"However, that is just one side of the coin."
"There is another issue which I would like raise and which causes me no less concern."
"The citizens of the European Union do not want or need a furore about flags and anthems in Brussels."
"What they want is a social and democratic Europe, a European Union which offers them effective protection from the negative repercussions of globalisation."
"They want a clear answer as to what, or whom, the Union is protecting, the people or the markets?"
"They want serious action to be taken against wage, social and tax dumping and an end, once and for all, to the galloping casino capitalism promoted by financial jugglers."
"For that, we need a political European Union."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (DA) Mr President, I wonder if there is anyone in this Chamber who still remembers when the Constitution was changed to the Treaty of Lisbon after its rejection in the Netherlands and France."
"The symbols of the EU were removed, as it was thought that EU citizens were particularly sceptical about the Constitution's objective of turning the EU into a polity."
"Now, the European Parliament - which of course is the only EU body for which citizens can vote - is in the process of reintroducing them."
"This most closely resembles a parody of democracy; one executed by institutions with no respect for those they are there for."
"The EU is there for citizens; citizens are not there for the EU."
"For this reason, it is improper to first remove something on the grounds of wanting to fulfil citizens' wishes, only to reintroduce it a few months later."
"I must say with regard to this matter that I am quite simply ashamed to sit in the European Parliament."
"We cannot allow ourselves to become notorious for duping citizens in this way."
"I would call on everyone who has even a modicum of respect for the voters who elected them, to vote against this proposal today."
"Mr President, this Parliament wants these symbols for one reason only - to inflate its ego and attach the trappings of statehood to the EU."
"I have a much better anthem and flag, thank you very much, and I am not about to trade them for the tawdry baubles of Eurofederalism."
"Ode to Joy, which we are going to purloin, may be a very nice tune, but so is Jingle Bells, and like Jingle Bells it heralds a fantasy, the fantasy that the EU is good for you."
"But unlike Jingle Bells, it will damage your national sovereignty and the right to control your own destiny."
"More like 'code to destroy' than Ode to Joy!"
"As for the flag, which we have stolen from the Council of Europe, even its proponents do not know what it means."
"We have as many explanations in the AFCO Committee as to what the stars signify as there are stars on the flag."
"This proposal to me exposes the insatiable fanaticism of Europhiles."
"The ink was not dry on the Lisbon Treaty, which deliberately excluded these symbols, before there was an insistence that Parliament give them official status nonetheless."
"My constituents do not want an EU flag and an EU anthem."
"They want the right to say 'yes' or 'no' to the Lisbon Treaty, thank you very much!"
"(ES) Mr President, I would like to mention a compatriot of yours, who, during the French Revolution, was upbraided in the street by a sans-culotte, who said: 'Why are you not carrying the Tricolore, the symbol of the revolution?'."
"That compatriot of yours replied that there was no need to show on the outside what one felt in his heart."
"I am more one of those who, no doubt out of modesty, like a good Spaniard, do not externalise their feelings."
"However, this does not mean that I do not feel moved when I see the European flag hanging from Ljubljana Town Hall or when, at a meeting with our colleague Pierre Lequiller in Yvelines, I heard the European anthem follow the Marseillaise, or when, yesterday, I read in a newspaper that the winner of the Prince of Asturias Prize, the Bulgarian Tzvetan Todorov, had said that 'united in diversity' was what European meant today."
"That is our motto."
"I am not one of those with a narrow, restrictive mentality or a beleaguered outlook on life, who think that the European flag is in competition with the national flag or that the European anthem aims to replace their national anthem."
"That, Mr President, is simply ridiculous."
"Symbols show that we belong to a community; they do not, in any way, represent an attempt to eradicate our individual native countries."
"They indicate added value, that we share something with other Europeans."
"I therefore believe that the initiative taken by Mr Carnero, whom I congratulate, and the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, is the right one."
"It is an initiative that, at a time when we are 'stitching together the two Europes', to use the wonderful expression of our dearly remembered colleague Bronisław Geremek, shows our fellow Europeans that we have the same values."
"These values are also expressed outwardly, including, but not exclusively, through symbols."
"The Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats will therefore vote in favour of this proposal to amend the Rules of Procedure, and I look forward to feeling moved, like everybody else, when I next hear the 'Ode to Joy' in this Chamber."
"(FR) Symbols are to sentiment what allegories are to thought."
"As colourful as it is, this quotation by the philosopher Alain is nevertheless a clear illustration of what these symbols represent for the European Union today."
"Listening to the Beethoven symphony or celebrating Europe together on 9 May are precisely the elements we are going to use from now on to ensure that Europe stays alive."
"They are a concrete expression of the values on which the Union is built, markers that gradually become implanted in the memories of the 500 million Europeans."
"By inserting this Rule in Parliament's Rules of Procedure, the work by our colleague Carlos Carnero González, whom I congratulate, is sending out a political message from Parliament to the citizens based on these values, as proven by the opposition of the Eurosceptics."
"No politics without symbols!"
"Giving Europe an identity through an anthem, a flag and a motto gives the citizens living and working in Europe an opportunity to see themselves as part of a single entity united in diversity."
"Displaying these symbols at all levels and in all institutional areas will ensure that there is a constant reminder of the values that inspire Europe."
"I would nevertheless like to stress today that Europe is experiencing a serious crisis of confidence and that we need to go even beyond these symbolic elements and envisage and rebuild together a strong sense of belonging."
"(PL) Mr President, symbols such as a flag, an anthem, a common currency and holidays are intrinsic features of statehood."
"This was the very reason why it was decided not to adopt them during negotiations on the Lisbon Treaty."
"It is duplicitous to maintain that a decision on reinstating them may be taken internally by one of the European institutions."
"The European Parliament is a legislative body."
"It must not send out a signal that it is acceptable to find ways to circumvent previous intergovernmental agreements."
"Parliament must act as the guardian of democracy and the rule of law."
"If the European Parliament attempts to resurrect previously rejected symbols, it will become an anachronism."
"One can readily understand that every institution should wish to use specific symbols."
"In this case, however, it must be understood that a broader political dimension is involved, as the rapporteur pointed out."
"The move should therefore be opposed."
"(DA) Mr President, as has already been said, the common symbols - the anthem, the flag, the motto - were removed from the Constitutional Treaty when it was changed to the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Some proponents of the Treaty of Lisbon even claimed this demonstrated that we were attentive to popular reluctance."
"In some countries the removal of the quasi-constitutional symbols was actually used to argue that there was no reason to hold a referendum on the Treaty of Lisbon."
"For example, the Danish Government stated in a document addressed to the Danish people that the Treaty of Lisbon, and I quote, 'will be purged of symbolic provisions on the EU anthem, motto and flag'."
"'Will be purged of'!"
"We should ask at this point what difference this has made in reality."
"The answer is 'none'."
"In its reply to my enquiry, the Commission itself wrote that the fact that the symbols are not mentioned in the Treaty does not alter their status in any way."
"'Does not alter their status in any way'!"
"And now Parliament is to go one step further."
"Perhaps someone believes that more intensive use of the symbols will arouse enthusiasm about the EU."
"Perhaps someone believes that the symbols can mask a lack of benefits for the people."
"I personally do not."
"Many citizens would just see it as a further example of the EU elite doing exactly as it pleases."
"This would send out completely the wrong signal, and I do not think that we should adopt this proposal."
"(NL) Mr President, I wonder what is really the point of this report and the amendment to the Rules of Procedure that is the purpose of the report."
"According to the explanatory statement, the fact that they are not included in the Treaty of Lisbon does not prevent the institutions from continuing to use them, so why do they have to be enshrined in the Rules of Procedure of this Parliament?"
"The context in which we should place this debate is that of the European Constitution and the referenda that have invalidated the Constitution."
"The symbols were deliberately not included in the Treaty because the Dutch, for example, want nothing to do with a European superstate and with the outward symbols of a European superstate."
"In the meantime the Netherlands has ratified the Treaty of Lisbon."
"What are we going to do now?"
"Now we are going to enshrine the European symbols in our Rules of Procedure anyway, through the back door."
"This amendment to the Rules of Procedure is unnecessary."
"It is in fact a gratuitous provocation and it is sticking two fingers up at the Dutch voters and, by extension, all European voters who want nothing to do with a European superstate."
"Well done, ladies and gentlemen!"
"(PT) Yesterday, here in plenary, the European anthem could have formed a backdrop to Ingrid Betancourt's tears."
"The anthem would have culminated in a call for the collective sharing of memories and desires."
"Every human project needs a symbolic dimension, from the strength of the words with which we govern the people of Europe to the rituals of political representation that seat us on the left and on the right, in the dialectic of parliamentary debate."
"There can be no history without symbols."
"We need words, a flag, an anthem or a motto."
"The universal project of Europe cannot be forged in the collective imagination without the chemistry of symbols, because symbols depict not only the world that we have, but also the world that we want to have."
"They link the deepest reason and emotion within us."
"Their value comes from the identity process that they trigger."
"How can the great project of Europe, based on the transcendental value of human dignity, open towards the world, leading the way in terms of rights, manage without a symbolic dimension?"
"European thought has left us with a long record on the meaning of symbols."
"Politics cannot ignore this, because politics carries with it all the dimensions of the human being in terms of what is also ideal and sublime."
"Mr President, I am somewhat surprised at the storm in a teacup that this change to our Rules of Procedure has provoked in some quarters."
"We know that the Member States decided some time ago not to elevate the European flag and anthem to Treaty status."
"They decided not to give them such an elevated status but to leave them with their current status."
"What is their current status?"
"They are simply recognised by the institutions."
"The European Council did so as long ago as 1985."
"By the way, Mrs Thatcher was a member of the European Council then."
"I see some of her admirers are now repudiating her decision."
"I must say that I myself had some hesitation about adopting a symbol chosen by Mrs Thatcher as the flag of the European Union."
"However, in the spirit of all-party compromise and consensus, I am willing to accept it."
"That is the status the flag and anthem were given - recognition by the institutions."
"There is, however, an anomaly."
"We, the European Parliament, have never actually recognised them in our Rules."
"It is quite logical that we tidy up this anomaly and put a reference to the flag in our Rules of Procedure."
"How people can make such a fuss about such an obvious thing to do - about such a normal procedure, which respects the decisions of the Member States not to elevate it to Treaty status - I do not know."
"But then the ways of working of the Eurosceptics - not least in my own country - have always been a bit of a mystery."
"When you see that this flag has been around for many years, if you saw the European supporters at the Ryder Cup, when Europe played America at golf just a couple of months ago - where people, who probably included Conservative Eurosceptics, were waving the European flag - it really does look a little ridiculous when they now make such a fuss about this reasonable change to our Rules of Procedure."
"(EL) Mr President, as all the previous speakers have said, the symbols of the European Union have existed for many years."
"What are we in the European Parliament aiming for by amending the Rules?"
"We wish to emphasise what is called the proper use of symbols, as is done in all organisations."
"Unfortunately, there have been unjustified reactions from both Member States and citizens."
"These are reactions from Member States that think that adopting and promoting the symbols of the EU will lead to the creation of a super-state."
"For heaven's sake, will symbols really create the super-state that some Members have talked about?"
"Some say that the national morale of peoples and states will be affected."
"If the national morale of anyone is so low that it can be eclipsed by a symbol of unity of all states, then I pity what some call 'national pride'."
"Such arguments have been heard in this House."
"There is another question."
"If some citizens and Member States react so badly to these symbols, how can they continue to be members of this EU when they cannot even bear to look at its symbols?"
"This is a contradiction."
"The European Parliament is right to proceed as usual today with the formal adoption of these symbols."
"It is sending out a message: the EU must advance united under its symbols in order to become complete and reach a point where it can play its part."
"Its role is to promote principles and values throughout the world."
"Mr President, we frequently hear the opinion that symbols are a waste of time and that the European Union should not concern itself with such irrelevant questions."
"Rather, this argument goes, the European Union's job is to focus on bread-and-butter issues like employment or trade."
"This approach is completely mistaken and wholly misunderstands what symbols are about."
"If you look carefully at how institutions work, then it will rapidly become clear that every institution maintains a set of symbols."
"These symbols carry a message that people will recognise and act as a shorthand version of that institution."
"Without institutions, democratic politics cannot exist."
"So symbols are a necessary part of democracy that the EU regards as being central to its identity."
"Besides, if symbols were as marginal as their opponents say, then why bother to oppose them?"
"The European Parliament, as the pivotal democratic body of the European Union, has every reason to promote the symbols of Europe as a means of connecting itself with the voters of Europe."
"Those who are against the symbols of Europe are basically questioning European democracy itself."
"One could further argue that this is too fluid and crisis-ridden a time to be thinking of the symbols of Europe, and thus that it is not the right moment for Parliament to spend time on symbols."
"Maybe so, but timing is something that always can and will be debated."
"In the long run, it will not matter whether the symbols of Parliament and of the European Union are debated now or at some later date."
"So I give my full support to this important and cogent report."
"Mr President, our federalist friends should not try and recruit Mrs Thatcher to their cause."
"She would be appalled at the developments that have taken place in the European Union."
"We have heard that symbols are important, yet we are constantly reassured that the European Union has no ambition to become a state despite every resolution and piece of legislation through this Parliament taking us further in that direction."
"Of course, the outstanding example of this was the Constitution."
"This was rejected and then re-emerged as the Treaty of Lisbon."
"In order to try and sell the Treaty of Lisbon, national negotiators decided that parts of the Constitution that could be interpreted as impinging on statehood, such as the flag and the hymn, should be removed."
"Indeed, British Government ministers used as a selling point when they were trying to sell the Treaty of Lisbon to our people that it was somehow different to the Constitution."
"My constituents in the East of England do not want a Constitution, they do not want the Treaty of Lisbon and they certainly do not want a state called Europe."
"I think it is an affront to them to try and introduce, or give official character to, these symbols."
"(RO) The symbols of the European Union ensure that its identity is asserted and can be decisive elements in the communication with the public and its emotional attachment to the European institutions."
"The Parliament has recognised and adopted the following symbols of the Union: the flag, which consists of a circle with twelve golden stars on a blue background, the anthem, excerpt from the ""Ode to Joy” which comes from the Ninth Symphony of Ludwig van Beethoven and the motto ""United in diversity”."
"The flag is raised on all premises of the Parliament and on the occasion of official events."
"By introducing regulations concerning the use by the European Parliament of the European Union symbols in the Parliament's Rules of Procedure, the Parliament is sending a strong political signal."
"The Parliament celebrates Europe Day on 9 May."
"I suggest that the European Parliament should organise a yearly competition for Europe Day dedicated to the young generation who should show how they see the future of Europe and especially how they wish to contribute to making this future a reality."
"Mr President, in the northern part of European Cyprus, on the Kyrenia mountain range, there is a mammoth one-kilometre-long Turkish flag, not an EU flag, to be seen."
"In fact in the whole of the northern part of Cyprus, there is a plethora of Turkish flags present, not EU flags."
"This is symbolic not of the unity of Europe but of the division imposed by the Turkish army on a small EU Member State."
"With the EU-Turkey accession negotiations in progress and with peace talks in Cyprus under way, pressure must be applied firmly on the Turkish Government by the EU to remove its troops and accompanying symbol from Cyprus and allow our proud EU flag to fly freely in that corner of the EU."
"The EU flag in Cyprus symbolises unity."
"The Turkish flag symbolises division."
"Let us all help to raise the EU flag in the whole of Cyprus as soon as possible."
"Mr President, I find it especially strange - tragic even - that the symbols are attacked by people who were formerly from Communist states of Central and Eastern Europe."
"We recall the flags being waved in the crowds in Tallinn, East Berlin and Budapest."
"We recall the anthem being played at the Brandenburg Gate."
"These things were not imposed or prescribed by parliamentary rules of procedure but were inspired by the hearts and emotions of the citizens."
"The symbols are symbols of our dignified values of peace and solidarity."
"(ES) Mr President, I would like to put the following question to those who have said that symbols and anthems belong to the State."
"The city in which I live has a flag - the flag of Madrid - and the community in which I live - the Community of Madrid - has its own flag and anthem."
"Is it because they are states?"
"Do they harbour ambitions to become a state?"
"Do those who say that flags and anthems are national symbols wish to abolish local and regional flags?"
"I would like an answer from my fellow Members."
"I myself have the flag of my rugby club at home!"
"Mr President, just to add to Mr Méndez de Vigo's point, the International Olympic Committee has a flag and an anthem."
"From what the British Conservatives have just been saying, I can only conclude that the International Olympic Committee is a state by their definition."
"rapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking all those who spoke during this debate, although it is clear that I openly disagree with some of them."
"Symbols do not represent only states."
"At this stage of our development, symbols do not embody confrontation, combat or battles; they are a means of conveying ideas and of uniting people around values."
"This is what our flag, our anthem, our motto and Europe Day represent."
"The Intergovernmental Conference was forced by some to remove symbols from the Treaty, against the will of the vast majority."
"This vast majority preferred to forge ahead with the essentials of the Constitution rather than get caught up in the traps set by those challenging not only the symbols but also the need to progress further in political union."
"For that reason, 16 countries, including my own, issued a statement to the effect that, in their view, the use of symbols was a fact of life, official and, what is more, something that should be welcomed."
"Nobody questioned the European Union's symbols during the referendum campaigns that resulted in the non-ratification of the Constitution."
"Let us be serious: can anyone remember large sections of the French and Dutch population saying 'no' to the Constitution because it referred to Union symbols?"
"I, for one, cannot, and I campaigned actively in France."
"There could be other reasons that may or may not be common to a number of people, but the matter of symbols was not one of them."
"Of course, I feel Spanish because I am European and European because I am Spanish."
"This means that when I see my country's flag next to that of the 12 stars, the conviction that both are part of my life grows stronger."
"When I see the President-in-Office of the Council appear with both the French flag and the European Union flag, I also feel proud."
"Above all, I feel proud to have been cheered, like many of you, when someone has received humanitarian aid or has noticed our election observation team and recognises us by the flag and applauds it."
"We would be foolish to deny ourselves what others recognise with friendship and with joy."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 11 a.m."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - The European Union is without any doubt at a crossroads in its evolution, when it is of the utmost importance to acknowledge the need to move forward by tackling all the current complex issues that potentially could stalemate the dynamics of the European integration process."
"In this process, the European symbols are a crucial linking element for developing a positive identity at European level, complementary to and not replacing well-established national identities."
"The absence of the European symbols in the rejected Lisbon Treaty was most regrettable from the point of view of the critical democratic deficit currently confronting the European Union."
"The claim that their inclusion in the Lisbon Treaty would be inappropriate turned out to be profoundly unrealistic for there is no doubt that they would not pose any peril to the concepts on which the EU was built."
"Thus, in order to increase the popular support for and commitment to the European Union in the forthcoming years, it is imperative to maintain and adjust these symbolic elements, so as to bind the European institutions and decision-making processes to acknowledgement of the 'demos' factor."
"in writing. - I support the introduction in the Rules of an official recognition of our European flag, the European anthem Ode to Joy, a European Day on 9 May and the motto of 'Unity in Diversity'."
"This support does not diminish my commitment and loyalty to my own country, England, where I was born, brought up, educated and now live."
"I reject the view that one has to choose to exclusively give one's loyalty to one region."
"I am proud to be from the Forest of Dean, to be English and European."
"in writing. - (PL) Symbols do indeed generate an emotional attachment to an organisation or country dear to us."
"As we gaze at flags or mottos, listen to anthems and even as we handle coins, we identify directly with a particular country or organisation."
"The European Union does of course also have symbols of this nature facilitating identification and emotional attachment."
"The blue flag with 12 golden stars, the 'Ode to Joy' from Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, Europe Day celebrated on 9 May and the euro, which is the official currency of 15 Member States, are established, familiar and generally accepted symbols."
"Initially they were symbols of the Communities, and they have now become symbols of the European Union."
"Taken together with the Union's slogan or motto, namely 'United in Diversity', these symbols encapsulate the essence of the European project."
"As a member of the Convention, I very much regret that the Union symbols described in the European Constitution never came into being."
"They were perceived as features of a pseudo-state and therefore deleted from the text of the Lisbon Treaty."
"Even so, however, I believe that they have not lost any of their character or their appeal to European citizens."
"These symbols continue to be vehicles of the values on which the European Union is based."
"They are an expression of the feeling of community felt by its citizens."
"It is right, therefore, that the move to use the European symbols should have arisen precisely in the European Parliament."
"Together for Health: A Strategic Approach for the EU 2008-2013 (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Alojz Peterle, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the White Paper entitled 'Together for Health: A Strategic Approach for the EU 2008-2013'."
"rapporteur. - (SL) This report concerns everyone - the sick and the healthy."
"Health is one of the key social and political issues on which the future of the European Union hangs."
"The importance of health to the economy is clearly stated in the Lisbon Strategy."
"Health is one of the most important assets of human life."
"Due to worrying health trends, especially the rise in cancer cases, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and obesity, and despite the improvements in curative medicine, this asset is under increasing threat."
"In addition, there are new challenges such as ageing population, climate change, rising food prices and globalisation."
"There has been talk of pandemics and bioterrorism."
"On the one hand the World Health Organization has forecast an epidemic rise in cancer cases in future years, and on the other there are ever-stronger demands for patients and medical workers to have freedom of movement."
"Health systems and their financing are coming under increasing pressure."
"In recent years the cost of medicines has been rising faster than overall health costs, giving rise to public concern about equality of healthcare and the sustainability of health systems."
"Citizens are worried that there will not be sufficient healthcare for all."
"They are not interested in debates about competences; they are primarily interested in the best way to be healthy."
"They are also concerned about equality of healthcare, which is considerable among the Member States, as also within the countries themselves."
"As far as cancer is concerned, differences in survival rates between the new and old Member States are such that we could justifiably talk of an iron curtain in health."
"All this is a reason for health to be afforded greater importance in the European political agenda."
"We are not talking about Any Other Business but about Survival."
"That is why we need a common strategic approach."
"At the end of 2007 the European Commission adopted a health strategy entitled 'Together for Health'."
"This strategy is a product of the commitment by the Member States and the Union to respect the common values and principles of health policy when ensuring the conditions for realising citizens' rights and responsibilities in their personal healthcare throughout their life, in their active involvement in decision-making and the adjustment of healthcare to patients' needs, in reducing inequalities in healthcare among different social groups, Member States and the regions within them, in understanding the investment in healthcare as a condition of economic development, and in the consistent inclusion of health in policies at all levels."
"It is clear that the health sector really needs a long-term strategic and comprehensive approach, which will require all the main actors in the Member States and at European Union level to work in cooperation."
"If we want to improve cooperation we need to determine which forms of interinstitutional cooperation can enhance the effectiveness of our joint efforts."
"We need a key strategic shift in the area of disease prevention."
"Although the importance of preventing disease has been highlighted for many years, only 3% of the health budgets of the Member States is devoted to that purpose."
"At the same time we know that it is precisely a prevention policy that would help us to achieve much better results. Forty percent of diseases are linked to unhealthy lifestyles, and a third of cancers are also preventable."
"One of the main messages in this report is the call on the Commission to prepare an ambitious plan of preventive measures for the entire five-year period."
"I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, the Commission and everyone who contributed to the consensus opinion on what needs to be done to improve health."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I am taking this debate on behalf of my colleague, Commissioner Vassiliou."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Peterle, for this report, and Members of Parliament for their interest in the white paper putting forward an EU health strategy."
"I am delighted that Parliament supports the health objectives and principles of the white paper."
"The Commission welcomes this report, and fully agrees with the key issues it raises, in particular the need to address health inequalities, to focus on promoting health by encouraging healthy lifestyles and to help prevent diseases."
"I am pleased to say that these issues are at the very top of the Commission's health agenda."
"Health inequalities between different regions in the EU and between different socioeconomic groups are a growing concern, and the Commission plans to bring forward action later next year to help bridge the health gap across the EU."
"The Commission fully shares your views about the need to promote healthy lifestyles, in particular as regards nutrition."
"We all agree that this requires action targeted at citizens of all ages, in schools, the workplace and other settings."
"This is a key component of the health strategy, and initiatives will be developed in the next couple of years."
"In the mean time, we are actively pursuing our strategies on nutrition, overweight and obesity and on alcohol-related harm."
"The Commission also fully agrees with Parliament about the need to step up our efforts to prevent diseases."
"In addition to encouraging healthy lifestyles, we share your views about the need to support effective screening to detect diseases, in particular cancer, at an early stage, and to foster greater exchange of best practice."
"The Commission is actively supporting the implementation of the Council recommendation on cancer screening and has recently updated the EU guidelines on breast and cervical cancer."
"But we need to do more to help health systems fight cancer."
"I am pleased to announce that the Commission plans to launch an EU platform for action on cancer next year to help Member States exchange knowledge and good practice in the prevention and treatment of cancer."
"The Commission welcomes Parliament's emphasis on the role that a healthy workforce plays in delivering the Lisbon agenda."
"Now let me comment on a few additional issues that the report raises."
"Parliament calls for the establishment of European centres of reference."
"These would be leading centres of expertise in particular conditions, such as rare diseases, that require a combination of expertise and resources that many Member States do not have."
"The Commission will build on the principles agreed between Member States for such centres and will continue work to promote such centres in the framework of the future directive on patients' rights in cross-border health care."
"Parliament also underlines the need for effective measures to tackle the rising problem of resistance to antibiotics."
"The Commission shares this concern and is actively supporting Member States in implementing the Council recommendation on anti-microbial resistance."
"We will present a report on this next year."
"Finally, the Commission endorses the views expressed about the need for health and social policies to work closely together."
"Mainstreaming health concerns in other policies is indeed a key principle of our strategy, and we are currently exploring synergies on a wide range of issues between these two policy areas."
"In conclusion, the Commission and Parliament share the same vision about the key health issues that we need to address."
"The time has now come to take forward work on the strategy and translate words into action."
"The Commission will work closely with Parliament, the Council, the Member States and civil society in transforming the strategy objectives into better health for all across the European Union."
"So I thank you for your support and I look forward to hearing your views."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. - (CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, health, alongside our freedom, is the most important thing for the majority of us."
"Health is a prerequisite for a happy life and for a successful society."
"It is necessary to constantly repeat and emphasise that caring for our own health and for the health of those who are close to us is a personal responsibility of each one of us."
"Health is the result of our genetic heritage, of the lifestyle and environment in which we live."
"Our upbringing, acquired habits, nutrition, exercise, working environment and housing all influence our health."
"The influence of healthcare on health comes last in this list."
"The Community is quite rightly responsible for the protection of public health."
"However, health services and the way in which they are organised, their quality and their funding are the complete responsibility of the EU Member States."
"Our common goal is to ensure the quality, safety and wide accessibility of health care for all those who need it."
"Each country seeks out its own way of providing the best possible healthcare services to its citizens in this difficult environment."
"The European Union has added value: the diversity of these independent systems, the opportunity to share in the successes and avoid the mistakes made by our friends."
"Healthcare is a very broad issue, as highlighted by those who spoke before me."
"Consequently, I personally regret that here in the European Parliament it is not clear who in our midst really deals with health and healthcare."
"One day we see healthcare as an internal market service, the next day as a social security issue, and on yet another occasion as a public health issue."
"I would like to call on the President and on each one of us, on this occasion when we are debating this important document, to consider the possibility of establishing a European Parliament Committee on Health during the next parliamentary term."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality. - (ET) Mr President, Commissioner, colleagues, health is one of the most important resources for every person."
"The European Union's healthcare strategy for the 21st century should guarantee a high level of uniform health protection available to all throughout Europe."
"Unfortunately the health systems of the Member States today differ widely and uniform and effective action on health is not guaranteed throughout Europe for citizens."
"I am pleased to welcome the European Commission White Paper on healthcare strategy although, like the rapporteur, I am of the view that the White Paper does not set specific quantifiable and measurable objectives whose attainment could and should produce tangible results."
"Healthcare requires effective political support in all areas and at all levels."
"Hence my appeal to the Commission that in future it should integrate public health issues into all EU policy areas and in that regard it should not forget gender mainstreaming in an enhanced healthcare policy."
"I thank the rapporteur for his work and you for your attention."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, we are currently discussing this White Paper on health for 2008-2013, and health is of course a fundamental right for us all."
"We have a series of challenges to face: cancer, cardiovascular diseases, obesity, diabetes and, above all, the ageing of the population, not to mention the constant threat of pandemics."
"Our fellow citizens expect a great deal from us when it comes to these health issues: when we talk about the value added of the European Union, it is in these areas where they are severely affected and where their expectations of us are highest!"
"Unfortunately, this White Paper is pathetically trivial and offers nothing that is in any way concrete."
"Fortunately, our colleague Mr Peterle has vastly improved its content."
"Perhaps repetition is indeed necessary: on numerous occasions in this House we have talked about these health issues and we are all in favour of health for all and health of a high standard through an integrated approach."
"Investing in prevention is important."
"We want it but we are not doing it because we are constantly coming up against overly timid budgets, notably when it comes to research."
"We have not yet realised that prevention would cost a great deal less than a cure."
"It is essential to take into account the ageing of the population and its consequent effects on society: economic effects, social effects and health effects."
"However, we need to ensure that there is less talk and more action: it is vital that we respond to our citizens' expectations."
"There are very clear messages that must concentrate on good practices: the need for physical activity, a balanced diet and, above all, responsibility: responsibility on the part of the EU Member States but also responsibility on the part of each European citizen."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, my political group supports the Commission's white paper on the health strategy."
"In particular we support the focus on prevention, education and encouraging healthier lifestyles."
"Planning to protect our citizens from health threats and pandemics, and aiming to reduce health inequalities across the EU, are very important."
"We need new guidelines on cancer screening, a directive on organ donation, improved surveillance mechanisms to respond to health threats and improved exchange of best practice."
"But, with regard to e-health, I should sound a note of caution."
"This is an area where we need to draw up precise rules defining a clear framework."
"It should be clear that it should not exclude those who are not Internet-literate, and should not replace a visit to consult the doctor."
"This said, I can see many advantages, but we must also be aware of the potential perils."
"However, what health policy also needs at EU level is clear focus."
"In my work as shadow rapporteur on this report, I have detected a real sense that there are too many different working groups and work streams, expert groups and task forces, many of which have been set up as presidencies' pet projects, or because of pressures from members of this House or from other interest groups."
"I believe the EU has a lot of value to add in the field of health, but that resources should be properly focused and provide value for money."
"I would urge colleagues to vote for my Amendment 2 calling for the Commission to launch a review of current work streams."
"I would also urge colleagues to support my amendments on protecting our citizens' health from dangers at work."
"I would like to ask the Commission to respond in particular to my Amendments 1 and 6 regarding exposure to substances toxic for reproduction."
"In the forthcoming proposals for review of the Carcinogens Directive, it is vital that substances toxic for reproduction are included. I understand that the Commission has made a U-turn on this, and would be grateful if the Commission would explain its position."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, everybody agrees that health is one of the most precious values for our citizens, yet, as we all know, under Article 152 of the Amsterdam Treaty, health falls exclusively within the competence of the Member States."
"This obvious antithesis is not just a strange peculiarity in EU law; it is, in practice, highly obstructive to our endeavours to achieve optimal health goals within the EU, and one wonders why this situation has been allowed to proceed unchanged for such a long time."
"The reason, of course, is a financial one."
"Health care is very costly, and improving it to the extent of achieving the desired equality across the EU would mean large increases in health costs for some EU Member States."
"So we can all come to this Parliament and criticise the shameful differences in life expectancy, in infant mortality rates and cancer survival from rich to poor Member States, but most of us fail to point the blame where it should lie, on the EU's inability to secure the provision of financial assistance to poorer members in order to help them catch up in terms of the level of health care, and thus stop their governments from opposing the possibility of removing health from the sole province of national competence."
"This, one could argue, is a sad reflection on the fundamental values we uphold in the EU in practice, whereby we accord greater importance in terms of competence to internal market rules for our businesses, for example, than to health care for our citizens."
"My position is that the time has come for an urgent change to Article 152 of the Amsterdam Treaty and this can only be achieved by a concerted effort by the Council, the Commission and Parliament."
"As parliamentarians, we should do our utmost to bring about the required change."
"That having been said, the most important aspect of health strategy in practical terms is, of course, disease prevention."
"Everybody knows that smoking, obesity, alcohol, drugs, high sugar intake and a stressful, unhealthy lifestyle in general are our health's greatest enemies, but are we doing enough to free our citizens from these curses?"
"Not really."
"Let us take smoking, for example."
"How can we claim to be doing everything we can to prevent people from smoking when we still subsidise tobacco-growing in the EU, we still allow tax-free cigarette sales on planes and ships travelling to and from the EU, we still have a relatively low tax on tobacco considering the enormous health cost of cigarette smokers, we still have indirect tobacco ads on our TV screens, and we still have laws relating to smoking which have hardly been fully implemented in the EU?"
"I do not have time to say much more about prevention, but I think the main point of what I am saying is the need to change the competence rule relating to health."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur for his work."
"It is absolutely right for us to deal with this important subject today, following up the strategic document prepared by the Commission last year."
"The importance of prevention, proper nutrition, air and drinking water quality, a healthy lifestyle, early detection of diseases and potential swift treatment of the latter should all be emphasised."
"It has been noted that currently major differences exist between individual countries and different social groups regarding access to healthcare."
"This indicates a clear lack of social cohesion."
"Such inequalities are also manifest in terms of survival rates for cancer, cardiovascular diseases and other conditions."
"There is a worrying increase in the number of mentally ill persons."
"Treatment methods used leave much to be desired, too."
"I have in mind in particular the over-use of antibiotics and steroids."
"Healthcare systems are also cause for concern, as they often prove inadequate."
"We all appreciate how precious our health is, and know that our biological life is limited."
"In this context, I would remind the House that the Polish poet Alexander Fredra advised his readers not to neglect their well-being, because to do so would endanger not only their health but their very lives."
"Mr President, let me express my thanks to Mr Peterle for his attempt to add some additional policies and actions to the Community strategy on health."
"He has aimed at promoting equal access to an integrated health system as a basic, inalienable right of every citizen."
"We must therefore work hard to make the organisations concerned politically aware of the principle that as far as health is concerned, funding is equivalent to investment."
"At this point, let me add that I agree with Mr Matsakis's position."
"We should concentrate on disease prevention through the promotion of healthy lifestyles and the provision of optimum treatment, as well as on investment in new technologies and research."
"Our goal must be a cross-sector policy to be coordinated at various levels."
"It will aim to meet the key challenges of an ageing population and the huge inequalities affecting the health systems of the Member States."
"(SK) When we talk about the European Union's common approach to health, our first consideration must be consolidating standards for the provision of healthcare services."
"The European Union's goal must be to eliminate the disparities between the new and old Member States, which are still quite significant."
"Since the individual Member States have different goals in the area of health policy, the health sector across the European Union needs long-term and strategic cooperation so that consensus can be reached."
"It is also necessary to invest in prevention and public education programmes."
"Better results can be achieved with a prevention policy and it is well known that almost half of all diseases are linked to unhealthy lifestyles."
"I agree with Mr Peterle's request to the Commission to draw up a long-term plan for preventive actions for the above reason."
"This could help to improve the European population's state of health."
"Research in medical areas also contributes to prevention and makes diseases easier to cure."
"For example, the European Union does not invest enough funds in cancer research: EU investment is almost one fifth of what the US invests."
"Rectifying this shortcoming would be in the interest of all European citizens."
"A useful idea in terms of raising patient awareness is the establishment of information and guidance centres to help patients, the healthcare personnel and the entire health sector."
"Once these goals are met, the European Union will be much closer to achieving a common approach to health."
"(PL) Mr President, I wholeheartedly support the report by Mr Peterle on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, entitled 'Together for Health: a Strategic Approach for the EU 2008-2013'."
"In particular, I welcome this report because it deals with one of the most urgent challenges facing the European Union and the entire world."
"It should be highlighted that this is the first strategic programme presenting a comprehensive Union approach to health policy."
"It lays down the values adopted by the Community and the aims it is setting itself in this area."
"It amounts to a Union healthcare strategy that stands out against other health systems, and could indeed serve as an example for the latter."
"I am glad to hear that the strategy has been positively received in the Member States."
"I am also glad to learn that certain countries have already taken action with a view to developing a common standpoint and incorporating the strategy into their national health plans."
"Slovenia is but one example."
"Action of this nature has also been taken in Poland."
"The financing of healthcare services makes a significant contribution to the budget deficit in many countries of the European Union."
"It is essential to take this fact into account when considering health strategy."
"Accordingly, I believe that the strategic plan should be considered in conjunction with methods of financing public healthcare in the Member States."
"I should also like to mention an issue that we have previously debated."
"I am referring to new information technologies and their effect on children and young people."
"Unregulated use of the Internet and computer games, addiction and related conditions are becoming increasingly serious problems for our society and civilisation."
"Children and young people are the worst affected."
"The Commission and the European Council are currently developing a sound method of cooperating in the healthcare area and it would be right for us to be involved in the implementation of this project."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur on his work, which has improved on the initial text."
"This White Paper proposed by the Commission is a first step in setting clear and beneficial objectives in the field of health, but it is unfortunate that it does not respond to the challenges of quality healthcare and equal access."
"The report on the table today has not taken over the initial proposals concerning self-medication and that is a good thing."
"In my opinion, trivialising or even encouraging self-medication is totally inappropriate in terms of the healthcare we must strive towards."
"'Together for Health' must not become 'every man for himself in times of illness'."
"The introduction of the idea of an active patient is a worrying concept: because it is not accompanied by a clear definition, the door is left open to different interpretations."
"Encouraging patients to take responsibility for their own care and urging population groups to provide their own responses to certain health needs are further proposals that must be treated carefully."
"We must remember that health is a very specific field that requires a very high level of competence and the issues involved can often be a matter of life and death."
"The proposals encouraging self-medication, in conjunction with the concept of individual responsibility, do not seem to respond to the health challenge we have to tackle and they move away from the concepts of solidarity."
"There is one other point that I must criticise: facilitating the mobility of health professionals."
"This could have very serious consequences on the territorial distribution of health personnel and aggravate what are already very precarious situations in certain Member States."
"Rather than encouraging the mobility of health professionals, it would be preferable to put the emphasis on the exchange of good health practices among all the Member States."
"I also recognise that web-based health resources must be encouraged."
"This is a positive and innovative initiative that is nevertheless only available to a minority of people."
"I naturally support the amendments tabled by my colleagues concerning health in the workplace."
"This is a crucial topic because work-related health problems are becoming more and more common."
"(PL) Mr President, I should like to draw attention to three issues in this debate."
"Firstly, there are notable health inequalities between the old and the new Member States."
"The cumulative effect of these inequalities is manifested in significant differences in terms of life expectancy."
"This can vary by 9 years for women and by as much as 13 years for men."
"We should strive to achieve a substantial reduction of these differences."
"Secondly, a substantial increase in investment aimed at disease prevention is needed."
"To date, barely 3% of investment is allocated to this purpose."
"It is well known, however, that up to 40% of diseases are linked to an unhealthy lifestyle and could largely be effectively prevented."
"Thirdly, as obesity is becoming an increasingly serious disease of our civilisation, it is essential to promote a healthy lifestyle."
"Favourable terms should also be made available for healthy organic food produced without the use of artificial fertilisers and pesticides."
"This type of farming is not very cost-effective, however."
"It therefore requires increased financial support within the framework of the common agricultural system."
"(PL) Mr President, many important issues relating to health and healthcare are raised in the document under discussion."
"General access to healthcare is guaranteed in the constitutions of individual Member States."
"Respect for the competences of the Member States in the area of healthcare and freedom of choice of health services are positive features."
"Nonetheless, I should like to draw attention to the danger threatening my fellow citizens because of the Polish Government's current plans to transform all healthcare entities into commercial profit-making companies."
"The proposed reforms transcend the limits of freedom to make an individual choice of healthcare system."
"They threaten fundamental human rights such as the right to life and healthcare."
"The scale of the threat should make it incumbent upon the European Commission to establish guidelines preventing public authorities from relinquishing control of public hospitals privatised against the wishes of Polish society and of the President of the Republic of Poland."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his well-prepared response to the Commission."
"We are all aware that it is Member States' individual responsibility to decide on the organisation and delivery of their health services and medical care."
"However, this should not mean that they neglect serious health cooperation at EU level."
"There are a wide range of health issues, such as the prevention of pandemics and the movement of patients or health professionals, where Member States cannot act effectively in isolation and where action at EU level is necessary."
"EU action can be valuable in creating pan-European networks of expertise which permit exchange of best practice in fields such as e-health, nanotechnology, rare disease treatments or centres of excellence."
"The EU, in partnership with Member States, has made important progress in protecting health, for example in the area of legislating on tobacco advertising, in the area of blood products, and indeed in the launch of the European Centre for Disease Control."
"We need to strengthen action to reduce health inequities across the EU-27, in particular through exchange of best practice and through better public information on citizens' cross-border health-care rights."
"We need to legislate in this area quickly, and not let ECJ judgments be the patients' sole guide around Europe."
"We need to respond with proper legislation."
"Furthermore, comprehensive health impact assessments and evaluation on all legislation across the board should be carried out, in order to provide a platform for joined-up thinking and better enable decision-makers to assess the real cost to human health of any policy initiative."
"This should be done in the same way that environmental impact assessments are now taken for granted as a way of informing legislators, and are a prerequisite for the formulation of most EU policies."
"Even with the backdrop of the economic and financial crisis today, health is our ultimate wealth."
"(SV) Mr President, I wanted to speak about two things."
"The first is how we must deal with excessive antibiotics prescription, which is handled very well in the report."
"We need only look at ourselves here in the European Parliament, or I need only look at myself."
"I would probably not be standing here today if we did not have effective antibiotics."
"I have been ill a number of times and just like many of you here in this Chamber, I am sure, have been saved by antibiotics."
"Unfortunately, our children's chances of getting this kind of help in the future are being jeopardised because we allow doctors to prescribe antibiotics when they are not needed and even sell antibiotics without a prescription."
"We need means of control and incentives to stop doctors meeting with patients to make money, so that they do not prescribe antibiotics when they are not necessary."
"I believe that the EU has an extremely important role to play here, to disseminate different ways of working successfully to combat this kind of excessive prescription."
"The second question which I wanted to address concerns inequality in health, which has also been raised by several earlier speakers."
"There is another aspect of inequality in health."
"It is not just a matter of inequality between countries."
"There is also inequality within countries."
"The WHO organised a special commission which looked at class differences in health."
"It boldly stated that 'social justice is a matter of life and death' and this is something which we must discuss openly in the Union."
"It is completely unacceptable that there are such big differences within countries."
"There are good examples where class differences in health have been successfully overcome, but there are also very bad examples."
"I myself am very concerned at what is happening in the capital of my own country."
"A system has suddenly been introduced there as a result of which doctors are moving away from socially deprived and poor areas, where medical care is most needed, to areas where people are healthiest and most wealthy."
"I believe that the EU should collect statistics and information so that voters, and also those who take decisions on health care, can be given clear advice on what measures lead to greater social justice in health and which do not."
"(RO) To respond the major challenges that the health sector is facing in the European Union, we need action plans which should include promoting a better state of health , public education and disease prevention programmes, especially for those diseases related to food, obesity, alcohol and drug consumption and smoking."
"Early detection and diagnosis, as well as the supply of proper treatment for chronic diseases, especially cancer, will ensure quality of life for people who are affected by these illnesses."
"This is why the exchange of best practices in all medical assistance fields within the European Union will contribute to increasing citizen welfare and health."
"I believe it is important to promote a healthy lifestyle inside families, in schools and at work in order to set the path for a healthy life model and to promote healthy ageing, both for the current generation and future ones."
"We must be especially concerned about our children's interests, developing provisions concerning maternity and parental leave, taking into consideration the effect the presence of parents has on a child's physical and mental development."
"It is just as important to improve the medical care system for pregnant women and to inform them about the effects of smoking and drinking."
"(LT) I would like to compliment the rapporteur and also point out that the only way for us to tackle the challenges of the 21st century is to improve public health."
"The saying 'all the medicine in the world cannot replace exercise, but exercise can replace all the medicine in the world' is timeless."
"We should not simply preach healthy living and healthy nutrition."
"The time has come to encourage people who are not consciously ruining their health but rather strengthening it through various means, including financial."
"Recommendations from the European Commission on this subject would be of great value."
"An acute problem for the new Member States is the lack of specialists."
"In some places half of all newly qualified doctors seek employment in other EU Member States, where salaries are much higher."
"That way the new Member States are supporting and strengthening the health services of their richer neighbours."
"I am not suggesting any restrictions on the free movement of citizens."
"However, a solidarity and compensation fund is necessary for the abatement of the consequences of this loss of specialists."
"(PL) Mr President, matters relating to health fall within the competence of individual Member States."
"This should not, however, represent an obstacle when it comes to taking joint action aimed at protecting the health of Europeans."
"The key objectives are laid down in the White Paper."
"They include promoting health in an ageing Europe, protecting citizens against dangers to their health and supporting dynamic health systems."
"These objectives cannot be achieved without substantial involvement by local and regional authorities."
"The latter must therefore be fully involved in implementation of this strategy."
"The White Paper raises the important issue of health inequalities and of the variations in health levels between individual countries and social groups."
"The provision of certain healthcare services in most of the new Member States is low."
"This gap must be bridged."
"It is therefore necessary to strengthen action aimed at doing away with inequality and to make this a priority objective."
"Another task identified in the White Paper relates to the need to emphasise and enhance the importance of programmes involving health awareness, notably those concerning nutrition."
"Sound nutrition and a healthy lifestyle can prevent many chronic diseases."
"That is why educational programmes on how to watch one's diet and engage in physical activity from a very early age are so very important."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I thank the honourable Members for their contributions and I will deal with some of the points raised by them."
"Mrs Oviir and Mrs Grossetête said that the white paper was too general."
"But the aim of the white paper is to set up a number of general principles and objectives to guide Community health action for the years to come."
"It would be very difficult to set quantifiable targets on such broad and general objectives and on such a wide range of issues."
"The Commission does fully agree that quantifiable targets are a good means to drive change and to achieve results."
"We feel, however, that it is better to consider such targets within each individual policy initiative in the framework of the strategy."
"A number of speakers referred to inequalities in health, for example Mr Janowski, Mr Adamou, Mrs Belohorská, Mrs Doyle, Mr Kuźmiuk and Mrs Westlund."
"We fully agree with the concerns raised and with the need to help to bridge the health gap."
"The Commission will be presenting a communication next year but, in the mean time, we will help to channel structural funds for health."
"Mrs Willmott asked a number of questions."
"She made the point that there are too many work streams in health."
"But this is the reason why the EU health strategy adopted in 2007 aims to bring together, under a coherent framework, all policies that impact on health."
"The Commission is looking at the different structures in the health sector to achieve synergies between structures and to ensure that work is done in an efficient and an effective manner without duplication."
"Mrs Willmott also asked about the Carcinogens Directive."
"The Commission has consulted the social partners on the possible revision of the 2004 directive in this area and is currently commissioning a study to be concluded in early 2010 on the options for amending this directive."
"The results of this study will enable the Commission to decide on an appropriate way forward."
"EU legislation on health and safety at work, specifically the 1998 directive on all chemical agents, already covers protection at work against all chemicals, including those with a toxic effect on reproduction."
"Mrs Westlund raised the issue of antibiotic resistance."
"The Commission is working closely with the ECDC."
"The ECDC work plan for 2008 includes antimicrobial resistance among its priority actions."
"In addition it plans to organise, on an annual basis, an EU Antibiotic Awareness Day."
"This event is aimed at strengthening public perception and knowledge of issues relating to all antimicrobial resistance."
"The first Awareness Day will take place on 18 November 2008."
"We are also collaborating closely with the ECDC on the preparation of a second report on Member States' implementation of the Council recommendation of 2002."
"In conclusion I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Peterle, and all Members for their support for the health strategy that we have developed."
"rapporteur. - (SL) Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my sincere thanks for this rich and complex debate."
"I am pleased that almost all your contributions contained three key words: the first is 'together', the second is 'inequality' and the third is 'prevention'."
"'Together' means more cooperation at Member State level, as well as European Union level, more partnerships, including the regional and local communities, and more complementarity."
"I agree with all those who said that the competence of the Member States must not be an excuse for not doing jointly what the individual countries cannot do, and there are an increasing number of such challenges."
"The fact that there are so many inequalities, which we have been warning about, means that there is a lack of knowledge sharing."
"If the chance of surviving cancer is 10% lower in one place than another, it means that information and knowledge have not reached that place, even though it is available to others, including neighbouring countries."
"Here we have to achieve some kind of dynamics based on already available knowledge."
"The principal message and advice should be that we should use available knowledge and share good practice."
"As regards dynamics, I would like to add that diseases spread rapidly, which is why we also require political dynamics and political innovation."
"As regards the White Paper, I would like to say that it is a very good framework for what we aim to do."
"Its purpose is not to address all the specific issues addressed in other documents and other resolutions."
"It should give a framework, and, as someone said, we now have for the first time a comprehensive framework for the values, indicators, strategies and measures."
"This is the basis on which we can move forward."
"In conclusion I would like to add that I have particular difficulty with the amendments proposed by the Socialist Group."
"They proposed six amendments which were rejected by ENVI."
"I find it difficult to overrule the arguments which ENVI used to express a different viewpoint."
"I cannot support those amendments now, because this is a plenary session and this topic was covered by other resolutions."
"If these amendments are approved, we will have an unbalanced picture, because other categories of the population will not be treated with such attention."
"It is not only about workers but pensioners too, and schoolchildren."
"I insist, of course, on the arguments I gave at the ENVI meeting."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 11 a.m."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (IT) Health is something that has a cost but has no price."
"Investment in health is the most effective and efficient investment there can be for a society tailored to people's needs."
"This investment is a joint responsibility on the part of individuals who must adopt healthy lifestyles by behaving responsibly, healthcare staff who must abide by their code of professional ethics, and national and regional governments, which must pay particular attention to the sustainability of health systems."
"Careful attention must furthermore be paid to the need for integrated social and health policies catering adequately for new requirements."
"Overcoming inequality, coping with exacting health demands, keeping up with the epidemiological changes underway and ensuring ever more active cooperation among Member States and regions: all of these requirements are duly addressed in the report by Mr Peterle, whom I wish to thank for his excellent work."
"in writing. - (RO) It is encouraging to see that the European Parliament adopted the Resolution concerning the European Commission's White Paper ""Together for Health: A Strategic Approach for the EU 2008-2013”=."
"Beyond the provisions concerning the health-related strategy, I noticed a weak point in the paper: the absence of quantifiable objectives aimed at ensuring an increased efficiency."
"As a representative of a country whose medical system is of very poor quality, which is reflected in the population's worrying state of health, I would like to stress the importance of putting words into practice but also the need to show greater solidarity at European Union level in order to offer all citizens decent medical care services."
"Romania has numerous sad tales to tell in relation to health."
"It is the EU country with the highest number of tuberculosis patients and it is in the penultimate place when it comes to the quality of diabetes treatment although diabetes is the disease with the highest predisposition."
"One in ten Romanians suffers from hepatic disorders."
"A quarter of Romanian children have health issues."
"Cancer-related mortality has increased worryingly in comparison to the rest of the EU."
"The mortality rate for cardiovascular causes is 61% of the total number of deaths while in the EU it is 37%."
"Romania is the European champion when it comes to delivered prescriptions, hospital admissions and surgical interventions but it is also the country with the shortest life expectancy in the EU."
"in writing. - (HU) Allergy is the endemic disease of our time."
"It has marched steadily across Europe since the Second World War."
"A third of our children have an allergy, and if we do not take action, pretty soon a half of the population of Europe will suffer from one allergy or another."
"The causes of these allergies are chemically treated foods and polluted environments."
"The symptoms of allergy are triggered by chemicals, natural and artificial food additives, spices, pollen and other natural substances, and animal hair."
"In Hungary, ragweed is a particular problem."
"Unfortunately the European Union has no allergy strategy at present, as the Commission confirmed in response to my question."
"Allergy sufferer associations within civil society, and millions of affected European citizens, are counting on the introduction of allergy legislation at European level."
"Let us do something to help prevent allergies, to tackle the main causes and to safeguard those who suffer from allergies."
"Active engagement would underpin our focus on the health of the citizens of the European Union and their everyday concerns."
"in writing. - I would like to draw attention to the worrying tendency in Europe, where more and more young people suffer from mental problems."
"Many young people in Europe suffer from stress; indicators of substance abuse, especially alcohol and drugs, are increasing."
"These aspects, separately and combined, can lead to serious mental disorders."
"Recent tragedies in Finland indicate that more than ever Member States need to pay attention to young people in providing measures for preventing bad health, especially mental health."
"A holistic and proactive approach to dealing with the roots of mental problems and illnesses is crucial."
"A safe living environment (preventing domestic violence and substance abuse), reducing stress-causing factors in school and at home, prevention and awareness-raising should be of the highest priority."
"No school can replace a caring family where parents see their responsibility in teaching their children the basics of social and ethical values."
"It is important to include all actors in society to achieve the set goals."
"Various voluntary and youth organisations in particular are crucial providers of a safe environment in leisure-time activities and of non-formal education/awareness-raising on mental-health-related issues."
"Therefore I call for a holistic and proactive approach including guaranteeing better mental health and therefore a better future for young people."
"in writing. - (RO) I salute the fact that the Peterle Report approaches and emphasises the urgent need to take active measures to recruit and retain health professionals."
"According to the World Health Organisation, the migration of 2% of the physicians from a country should be a code red signal for the authorities."
"In Romania, 4% of Romanian physicians requested papers to leave and work abroad and the same percentage was registered in 2007 as well."
"Therefore, not only did we cross the level considered to be a code red threshold, but we also reached double that percentage."
"From the beginning of the year up until 1 September 2008, 957 persons asked the Romanian Physicians' College (CMR) for moral integrity certificates which will allow them to work abroad."
"It is obvious that a health system cannot function without physicians."
"I believe that this is a worrying phenomenon not just for Romania but for all of Europe and the absence of qualified individuals who can treat European patients must preoccupy the Member States and the Union to the highest degree."
"in writing. - (HU) First, I would like to say how happy I am that we have recently seen more and more reports and strategies on the importance of health."
"I myself as a 2009 Budget expert have tried to speak for the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI)."
"My initiatives have been received favourably by both ENVI and the Committee on Budgets."
"As Mr Peterle has pointed out, there is a close connection between the new health hazards and climate change."
"On 7 October, the Committee on Budgets adopted a research project I proposed, 'Comprehensive Research on Health, the Environment and Climate Change - Improvement in Inside and Outside Air Quality'."
"This 4-million-euro initiative will be managed by the Hungarian headquarters of the Regional Environmental Centre for central and eastern Europe (REC) and will cover nine countries (Austria, Bosnia and Hercegovina, Finland, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Serbia and Slovakia)."
"At the same time the project will examine the links between health, environmental protection, transport and climate change and their effects in schools."
"As regards ECDC ratification, I also support the rapporteur."
"So that the Agency can meet its increased responsibilities, I suggested releasing it from the margin set by the Commission."
"ENVI adopted this unanimously, and it is to be hoped that at the end of the October plenary Parliament will decide on this too."
"in writing. - (PL) Health is one of the greatest blessings a human being can enjoy in life."
"Unfortunately, worrying trends such as an increase in the number of cases of cancer, cardiovascular disease, obesity and diabetes are making us aware of the extent to which health is now endangered."
"We are confronted with the challenges of climate change, globalisation, the ageing population, along with the threat of pandemics and biological terrorism."
"The marked rise in the cost of medicines in recent years is also cause for concern."
"It has meant that many EU citizens simply cannot afford medicines."
"In addition, the healthcare systems of certain EU Member States need to undergo radical reform in order to eliminate tremendous inequalities."
"For example, there is a difference of 9 years in the life expectancy of women and 13 years for men."
"Investing in healthcare policies concerning the earliest years of a person's life should also be a priority issue."
"It is important, however, not to allow a situation to develop whereby preventing the birth of disabled children or children suffering from chronic diseases would be generally accepted."
"Aid for the parents of sick children should be promoted instead."
"In addition, I should like to emphasise the need to respect the competences of the Member States in the area of healthcare and freedom of choice of medical services."
"Clearly, health also has a bearing on the economy."
"Investment in healthcare should therefore not be perceived simply as an outlay, but also as an important element of investment in improving the quality of human capital and a key social and political issue."
"in writing. - (DE) In the interests of health protection, we must face up to the challenges identified."
"The main competence for maintaining and promoting health standards lies with the Member States."
"Nonetheless, there are many areas, especially as regards transnational problems, where it is our task to support the Member States as much as possible if they are unable to take effective action."
"The major problem we face is the grave inequalities between the Member States, on the one hand, and within the individual Member States, on the other."
"Life expectancy in the 'old' Member States is on average 10 years higher than in the new Member States."
"Our task is to diffuse, across the Member States, the tried and tested procedures which have proved their worth."
"Through appropriate awareness-raising measures for citizens, the intention is to adapt and harmonise standards."
"Health is a vital asset for all of us, and it is also a key economic factor."
"We must therefore do even more to curb the dramatic increase in the incidence of cancer, for example."
"For that to be achieved, it is essential to mainstream health in all policy areas and promote the development of new technologies and innovations."
"in writing. - I would like to take the opportunity to give particular welcome to certain provisions within the health strategy, notably the inclusion of autism spectrum disorders which are increasingly affecting children throughout Europe, and would like to mention the excellent research that is already being undertaken in this area, with the help of the Commission."
"I commend the new focus on rare diseases, Alzheimer's, and research into mental illness and men's health, as well as the continued focus on recognised conditions such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and cancer."
"I am glad to see carers mentioned as it is important to remember that medical conditions not only affect the sufferer but also those who love and care for them and hope that the mention translates into practical support for those at the coalface."
"I also applaud the constructive focus on prevention, especially in the avoidance of alcohol and drug use during pregnancy."
"in writing. - (RO) Health is one of the most important values in a human's life."
"The worrying increase of the number of individuals who suffer from cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and obesity in spite of the progress made with the cures for these diseases is an important issue to be dealt with."
"The problems linked to excessive weight and malnutrition, improper diet and HIV/AIDS are challenges that endanger the health of the European Union."
"The differences between the new and the old EU Member States in the survival rates for cancer patients are so large that we can speak of an ""iron curtain in the health sector”."
"The European Union must consolidate its actions to reduce inequalities between the Member States, especially by exchanging best practices in different fields and by promoting public education for better medical care by supporting innovations in the health systems, and it must also propose enforcement mechanisms for structured cooperation between EU institutions."
"We must define fundamental health values, a system of EU health indicators and ways of reducing the inequalities which exist in the health sector."
"We must invest in health, we must adopt methods for promoting health at all ages, and we must adopt measures related to tobacco, food, alcohol and other factors affecting health."

"- Before the vote:"
"rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, since the situation in Ukraine is quite serious, I would like to make a comment on this report."
"It is a purely economic report but we need a broader strategy which, following the example of Euromed, makes room for EURO-NEST, another union, which would be based in Lublin, Poland."
"We must learn from the crisis in Georgia and ensure that we do not wake up one day outside the political stage, having allowed another actor to take our place."
"To conclude, I would like to urge all my fellow Members to support this report in order to send a strong signal to the Ukrainians, who have Europe strongly in their sights and who now find themselves in an extremely difficult crisis."

"IASCF: Review of the constitution - Public Accountability and the Composition of the IASB Proposals for Change (vote)"
"- Before the vote:"
"(PT) I want to draw attention to the fact that there is a printing error in the voting list of the PSE Group."
"I would ask colleagues to follow the coordinator in terms of how they vote."
"- After the vote on paragraph 5:"
"Mr President, we have agreed between the groups that Amendment 4 by the ALDE Group does not fall even if Amendment 2 is adopted, because these are compatible amendments."
"So we should have voted also on Amendment 4."
"This change is made as an oral amendment, so if there is someone who objects to this, I can understand that, but we have agreed between the groups that Amendment 4 should also be accepted and should be voted on."
"I will not announce the result of the final vote until this minor problem is sorted out."
"I need clarification from the chairwoman of the committee responsible."
"According to our services, there is a problem with the introduction because the first amendment says 'regrets' while the other says 'expresses doubts'."
"Can you clarify this for us?"
"(FR) Mr President, I believe that Mrs Kauppi is mistaken because Amendment 4 by Mr Klinz relates to the same paragraph as Amendment 2 by Mrs Kauppi."
"As the House has voted on Amendment 2 by Mrs Kauppi, by definition Amendment 4 falls."
"(FR) I am pleased to see that the chairwoman of the committee responsible agrees with the analysis of the sittings services."
"Therefore, Mrs Kauppi, I am sorry but I cannot carry out your request."

"- Before the vote on Amendment 1:"
"Mr President, as an oral amendment I would like to propose that the protection of biodiversity in our amendment would be an addition to the original text of the paragraph."
"So, no deletion: just an addition."
"(Parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment, but subsequently rejected the amended amendment)"
"- Before the vote on recital D:"
"Mr President, people should have details of this oral amendment."
"It is to make clear why the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea is not sufficient on its own to deal with the Arctic."
"So it adds the words to Recital D: 'and which was not formulated with specific regard to the current circumstances of climate change and the unique consequences of melting ice in the Arctic Seas'."
"(Parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment)"
"- Before the vote on recital F:"
"Mr President, it is exactly the same subject and it is to add to the words in Recital F: 'whereas the Arctic region is currently not governed by any specifically formulated multilateral norms and regulations'."

"Lamfalussy follow up - Future Structure of Supervision ("
"- Before the vote on paragraph 2(c) of the Annex:"
"co-rapporteur. - Mr President, in the light of topical developments we have strengthened the text in an oral amendment about the deposit guarantee schemes, and it reads 'the Lamfalussy Level 3 Committees can take decisions on the basis of a fair ...'."
"Sorry, I have the wrong one."
"This one is about qualified majority voting in the Level 3 Committees."
"This text is brought in line with what should be done to guarantee that host Member States have an important say in the group supervision, and it reads that 'the Lamfalussy Level 3 committees take decisions on the basis of a fair and appropriate QMV system that takes into account the relative size of the financial sector and the GDP of each member State, as well as the systemic importance of the financial sector for the Member State'."
"From then on it is the same text."
"Mrs van den Burg, unless I am mistaken I do not think that you read out the correct text."
"co-rapporteur. - Mr President, it is the second one."
"It was indeed about the deposit guarantee schemes."
"We tried to strengthen the present text by asking that these rules in the European Union be 'urgently revised to avoid arbitrage between guarantee levels in Member States that may further increase volatility and undermine financial stability instead of increasing security and depositors' confidence'."
"Then it says they should also guarantee a level playing field for financial institutions."
"Sorry for this."
"(Parliament agreed to accept both oral amendments)"
"- Before the vote on Amendment 8:"
"co-rapporteur. - Mr President, also as an acknowledgement of the frantic search by EU Member States to rescue the banking system, but not in a sufficiently coordinated way, we have thought that it makes sense to introduce this amendment."
"It reads: 'whereas the increasing cross-border nature of banking in Europe and the need to respond in a coordinated way to adverse shocks, as well as the need to deal with systemic risks effectively, require divergences between the national regimes of Member States to be reduced to the greatest extent possible; whereas there is a need to move beyond the studies that the European Commission has already carried out in this regard and to amend Directive 94/19/EC as soon as possible to provide the same level of protection for bank deposits across the whole European Union in order to preserve financial stability and depositors' confidence and avoid distortions of competition'."
"(Parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment)"

"Together for Health: A Strategic Approach for the EU 2008-2013 ("
"- Before the vote:"
"rapporteur. - Mr President, I would like to inform you why I, as rapporteur, put seven minuses against the amendments of the Socialist Group."
"It was a question of my credibility because six of those seven amendments were refused in the ENVI Committee three weeks ago."
"There were no votes against, and I see no new reasons to change my opinion on this."
"The other reason is that we adopted a resolution on safety at work in January and I think that this subject is well covered there."
"I have no problem with the contents, but I do not think there is any need to repeat some elements in different resolutions."
"In any case, in order to have an appropriate structure to the text, I would like to table the following oral amendment, in agreement with the shadow rapporteurs."
"Amendments 1, 3 and 4 are to be moved after paragraph 32, amendment 5 after recital M, and amendment 6 after recital Q. This is just the replacement of that."
"To summarise the situation, our rapporteur is not proposing an amendment to the text."
"He simply wants to ensure that after the vote the services reorganise the final text as he has just proposed."
"Voting time"
"The next item is voting time."
"(For the outcome and other details of the vote: see Minutes)"
"(FR) Mr President, excuse me, I am not sure under which Rule I should address the House but I would like to make a statement to the presidency about the current situation in Parliament: it is turning into a permanent circus, which makes it very difficult to work calmly when trying to do serious things here."
"(Applause)"
"I think that this situation reached its peak yesterday evening and I would ask the presidency to take action in order to restore calm and a serious atmosphere in a House that should be an example to the whole world and that should be a serious House, not a circus."
"(Applause)"
"I imagine, Mr Hutchinson, that you are referring to the various displays in the passageways and corridors."
"You know that the Quaestors are responsible in this regard."
"We will of course pass on your comments."
"(FR) Mr President, I would also like to make a comment about calm and order in our work."
"Our sitting yesterday afternoon was marked by an extremely moving account, but the disruption to the agenda meant that the speeches on topics as important as the financial crisis were postponed by more than two hours, totally interfering with the order of speakers."
"That does not help things to run smoothly in this House."
"In this case, I will pass on your comments not to the Quaestors but to the Conference of Presidents as that is the body responsible for such matters."

"Explanations of vote"
"Oral explanations of vote"
"(BG) Mr President, esteemed colleagues, allow me to start by congratulating colleague Panzeri on his report."
"I was shadow rapporteur for the PPE-DE Group and voted in favour of this report."
"I voted that way because I think that through our work on the compromises we managed to introduce certain amendments and to achieve a more balanced approach on some of the proposals."
"At the same time, amendments proposed by our Group, which would have made the report more comprehensive, remained unapproved."
"The report should definitely have included a text listing the excessive burden of taxation and the high social security contributions among the principal reasons for the existence and even the growth of the grey economy in certain sectors."
"In the fight against undeclared work, we must enlist the business community as an ally."
"Small and medium-sized undertakings must be facilitated by reducing administrative burdens and simplifying procedures."
"Evidently, though, discussions and amendments cannot be proposed at this stage owing to the fact that the report was started under one set of rules and was finalised and voted under another."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted against the Zimmer report but nonetheless wish to endorse wholeheartedly the report's objective of promoting social inclusion and combating poverty, including child poverty, in the European Union."
"I expressly welcome an approach which advocates adequate minimum income schemes as the basic prerequisite for a life lived in dignity."
"This principle must apply to people in work and the unemployed."
"What I cannot do, however, is vote in favour of a report which repeatedly urges the Member States to introduce minimum wages, and which calls on the Council to agree an EU target for minimum wages."
"This demand violates the subsidiarity principle and the Member States' fundamental competence in the field of social legislation."
"The report also explicitly welcomes the Commission's proposal for a horizontal directive covering all forms of discrimination."
"I am opposed to discrimination, but I believe that this is the wrong approach."
"Mr President, thank you for giving me the opportunity to offer my explanation of vote."
"Just like the last speaker, I do not think anyone can disagree with the goals of the report in terms of promoting social inclusion and combating poverty."
"But what we really need to recognise is that we must get away from this idea that, whatever the problem, the solution is to be found at the EU level."
"Actually, the solution is often not even to be found at a national level."
"If we really want to tackle poverty, if we really want to encourage social inclusion, quite often we have to look to the solutions within our own communities."
"Right across the European Union, right across my own country, right across the city that I represent, London, the greatest city in the world, we see a number of local community groups tackling poverty 'at the coalface', without any intervention from the state."
"They understand the problems, and the communities are acting together."
"We have to create the right conditions for local communities to tackle these problems: if you want to look for the solutions, please go to the website of the Centre for Social Justice in my constituency in London."
"(PL) Mr President, poverty is a multi-faceted phenomenon."
"It is generally linked to unemployment, and in particular to long-term unemployment."
"That is why work is considered the best way of preventing poverty."
"Work is not the only way of preventing poverty, however, as illustrated by the many cases of poverty amongst working people."
"We should recall that 78 million individuals are threatened by poverty in the European Union."
"This represents 16% of the Union's citizens."
"All levels of public authority must join forces with the social partners, civil society organisations and individual citizens."
"Social policy and labour market policy need to be better organised and to become more efficient."
"Sustained and far-reaching efforts to combat poverty and social exclusion are needed."
"We should also remember that legislative social protection programmes should have a preventive role."
"They should serve to promote social cohesion and to facilitate social integration."
"One of the important points in the report concerns the elimination of child poverty."
"Particular attention should be paid to the cases of children being brought up by single parents, in large families or in immigrant families."
"Effective solutions are needed to prevent such people from becoming socially marginalised."
"(DE) Mr President, I can support this resolution from the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs because it includes my specific proposals to combat black market labour and particularly undeclared work."
"I am particularly gratified by the support for my proposal to ask the European Commission to develop a pilot tool based on models such as the 2 Plus project in Luxembourg, co-financed by the European Social Fund, which is aimed at curbing undeclared work by making it less appealing through a huge simplification of administrative requirements for employers, whilst guaranteeing social security cover for workers, attractive tax rates for the employer, including through the deduction of charges concerning locally based work, and a tax exemption for all work carried out for pay lower than an amount to be determined by the Member State."
"My proposal for a framework statute for spouses or family members helping in family businesses to guarantee their compulsory membership of a social security scheme has also been included, and I am very pleased about that."
"I am also pleased that we point out that running a family is itself a family business, and that recognising this atypical family work and including it in a social security scheme should be considered."
"The fact is that besides ordinary black market work, there are millions of Europeans, especially women, who work in family business and are left without any individual social security cover."
"I would just like to clarify one thing, my dear Astrid, speaking time is limited to one minute, not two."
"That is almost like undeclared work."
"(DE) Mr President, I voted in favour of the resolution as it represents an unequivocal call to the Belarusian Government to respect human rights at last."
"It is disappointing that hopes of democratic development for the Belarusian people who have to live under Europe's last dictatorship were not fulfilled by the parliamentary elections which took place in September and which were dubious, if not to say falsified."
"The same applies to the strategic repression of the opposition and civil society."
"We have also called on the Council and the Commission today to take further steps towards facilitating and intensifying people-to-people contacts and democratising the country and to consider the possibilities for lowering the cost of visas for Belarusian citizens entering the Schengen territory, which is the only way to prevent Belarus and its citizens from becoming increasingly isolated."
"(PL) Mr President, the defeat of democracy in Belarus is particularly painful in the context of the Union's new policy of reconciliation towards that country, following the events in Georgia."
"Mr Lukashenko failed to recognise the gesture made by Europe and the opportunity to emerge from isolation."
"The OSCE report states that the elections in Belarus did not meet democratic standards."
"The new parliament will therefore once again be composed of people subservient to Europe's last dictator."
"It seems necessary to continue the policy of thawing mutual relations despite these abuses."
"It must be emphasised, however, that the Union should not be the only one to make concessions."
"The President of Belarus needs to display clear goodwill as demonstrated by appropriate actions."
"The pressure on Mr Lukashenko ought to be stepped up, but at the same time benefits should be offered to the people of Belarus, so that Europe's offer is perceived as a better choice than the alternative of forging closer ties with Russia."
"(PL) Mr President, the successful completion of the negotiations in the framework of the Doha Round seems increasingly unlikely."
"Mr Mandelson's resignation from the post of Trade Commissioner is one reason for this."
"The talks will probably only resume after the start of 2010."
"The situation is further complicated by the fact that during the next two years elections are due not only in the United States but also in India and in Brazil."
"This means that the new negotiations will be conducted by a different group of people."
"For the first time, the European Union is not responsible for the breakdown of the talks."
"The United States and India are to be blamed for the collapse of the July ministerial talks."
"According to the experts, however, the main reason for the breakdown was a lack of progress on services and industry."
"Should there be a return to the negotiating table, priority must be given to consideration of how to help the poorest countries."
"At the same time, however, we must not disregard our own interests, notably those of the agricultural sector."
"Opening up our market unduly would amount to a serious threat to the stability of farm incomes."
"Many farms could be bankrupted as a result."
"Should that happen, how would we be able to guarantee the European Union's food security?"
"Failure to reach agreement on trade issues is an example of how difficult it is to reach a compromise on important matters when such a large number of countries with such varied interests are involved in the talks."
"Let us hope for a more positive outcome to the international negotiations on combating climate change."
"Mr President, thank you very much for offering me this opportunity to offer my explanation of vote on the suspension of the Doha Round."
"It is with great gratitude that I recognise that most of this House is quite sad at the suspension of the WTO Doha Round, because actually there were real goals to be gained from further liberalisation."
"Unfortunately, once again, it was agriculture that held us up, and, while the EU managed to avoid the blame, I think we have to recognise that we had our own internal politics and that, when Commissioner Mandelson wanted to go further on agriculture, he was held back by some of the most protectionist states in the European Union."
"We need to recognise that there is a greater goal out here; that services that make up so much of our economy need to be unlocked and liberalised."
"Unfortunately we have to unlock agriculture and goods before we unlock trade in services."
"We need further opening of trade."
"We need to stop protecting uncompetitive farmers."
"We need to make it easier for entrepreneurs and farmers in developing countries and poorer countries to trade with us, sell their goods and services, because only trade, not the large aid industry, will help these people out of poverty."
"(PL) Mr President, the report before us has already gained the approval of a majority in this House."
"Just before the vote, however, Mr Duff, a leading Member, ventured to express his surprise that Eastern European countries which have only recently acceded to the Union should be opposed to the introduction of the flag and anthem as compulsory in the European Parliament."
"I really must explain immediately to Mr Duff that there is ample justification for the simple slogan used during the campaign, indicating that rule from Brussels was no better than rule from Moscow."
"After all, the ease with which Brussels can introduce and implement changes that infringe European law is in sharp contrast with the difficulty in implementing the principles of solidarity, honesty and non-discrimination."
"A relevant example is energy policy whereby measures that will ruin Poland's energy industry were imposed on Poland pursuant to the force of law and in contravention of the aforementioned principles."
"(NL) Mr President, we have just adopted by a large majority, although I and a number of my colleagues voted against it, a report that introduces for this institution a flag, an anthem, a motto, a public holiday: all the symbols, the 'trappings' of a real state."
"There is a Dutch cabaret performer, Wim Sonneveld, who in fact would not be out of place in this Parliament, and he would say about something like this, 'Well, that is the limit'."
"However, I want to remind you that it was not so long ago, after the clear rejection of the European Constitution in the Netherlands and France at the time, that the provisions on the use of symbols were very carefully removed and they were no longer to be included in the Treaty of Lisbon because it was realised that the public did not want them."
"Now Parliament is going to adopt them again and even maintain in the text that they must be included in order to give a clear political signal to citizens."
"What a cynical joke!"
"The European 'nomenklatura' of privileged people is marching on but, ladies and gentlemen, the people of Europe stopped following them a long time ago."
"(NL) Mr President, in the debate on the Carnero González report it seemed at times as though we were talking about the European symbols themselves rather than their inclusion in our Rules of Procedure."
"Right now the debate is not about the symbols, although I can well imagine that a lot of people have questions about the Europe Day on 9 May."
"However, the point is that first of all it was promised that the outward symbols of a European superstate would not be included in the Treaty of Lisbon, which most Member States have ratified, and now suddenly they are going to be included and enshrined in the European Parliament's Rules of Procedure."
"That is simply showing contempt for the voters, the citizens of Europe."
"From our ivory towers in Brussels we have once again managed to alienate ourselves even further from the citizens in the Member States."
"This is sad."
"Mr President, we are generally encouraged to regard nationalism as arbitrary, transient and faintly discreditable - but, when it is Euro- nationalism, we take a completely different attitude and we are invited to revel in the emblems and trappings of statehood: a flag, an anthem, a national day and all the rest of it."
"I take particular exception to the appropriation of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony as the European anthem, which we are now all expected to stand to attention to."
"I am afraid it has rather the same effect on me as it has on Alex in A Clockwork Orange and for the same reasons, namely that it has bad connotations."
"But the point I want to make is this: the sole, and rather token, change that was made to the European Constitution when it was turned into the Lisbon Treaty was the removal of these European national symbols."
"In unilaterally putting them back in, this Parliament, this ageing and decrepit Parliament, is flicking two liver-stained and liver-spotted fingers at the electorates who rejected that European Constitution."
"If you want these symbols to have binding force, have the courage to put it to the people in a referendum."
"Pactio Olisipiensis censenda est!"
"Mr President, I voted against this report by Mr Carnero González, which seeks to reintroduce more extensively in this Parliament the European flag and the European anthem."
"In my country, the people were told that the Lisbon Treaty was so different from the European Constitution that it was no longer justified to have a referendum, and yet the only substantive difference that I can find between the Constitution and the Lisbon Treaty is the removal of these trappings of statehood."
"Now this Parliament is seeking to bring them back again."
"This illustrates the deceit on which the whole European project is based."
