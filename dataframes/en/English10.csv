"Text"
"Then comes a flowing sequence of other rights of which I am also proud: dignity, liberty, equality, solidarity, citizenship, justice."
"Economic and social rights take up their rightful place, but not only in the chapter on solidarity."
"They are also to be found throughout the text."
"They appear in the chapter on liberty, and in the chapter on equality, and quite rightly so, because this is a good way of promoting these economic and social rights."
"Then there is the right to proper administration."
"I believe, Mr President of the Commission, that you ought to be particularly alive to this right, which is one that we included in the chapter on citizenship."
"It is not aimed only at the citizen, it is aimed at all people."
"We have in a way extended and developed the notion of citizenship that was laid down in the Treaties, and which until now had no tangible form."
"It seems to me that drafting this Charter constitutes a major step forward which we must support and capitalise upon."
"A word on the method."
"As many people have already said, it is one that presupposes that the draft Charter currently on the table will remain intact, or that the Convention will be asked to rework it."
"It nevertheless seems to me that only the Convention should be able to amend certain points in the Charter, if by any chance this should be deemed essential, before the Charter is proclaimed."
"Let me remind you that we have not attempted to launch such an original process since the Assizes in Rome."
"But the difference is that this time around, in my opinion, the method has worked perfectly."
"It has not prevented the Heads of States and Government from giving their own instructions, and from having their representatives work together, but they have been doing so in a transparent manner, under the watchful eye of all the partners who, beginning with Parliament, have shown the extent to which they are able, in a process of this type, to perform their duties with a will to working towards and bringing about a result that is of value to everyone."
"Lastly, a word on incorporating the Charter."
"Much has already been said about this and, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you have just described the extent to which the Intergovernmental Conference has been involved in amending Article 7."
"There would seem to be no alternative but to open up this debate and address the status of the Charter."
"It would be paradoxical to turn it into an entity unclassified in legal terms, at a time when, on a daily basis, we perceive the need to validate a founding process based on our values."
"It would be paradoxical if you were, at Nice, to convene a new Intergovernmental Conference with a view to simplifying the Treaties, to possibly developing a constitutive process and to incorporating this Charter into the Treaties at some point in the future, but for us to remain where we are now, with the Treaty, pending the outcome of this hypothetical IGC."
"What does this Treaty, as it stands, actually say?"
"Article 6 lays down the principles on which the Union is established. It refers back to our constitutional traditions and to the European Convention on Human Rights."
"Can we accept, pending the incorporation of the Charter into the Treaty, a Treaty which only refers to the European Convention on Human Rights, when all the European Union institutions agreed to work together to draw up this Charter, which is a fine Charter which no legal expert could afford not to be aware of?"
"Mr President, what should Biarritz do with the Charter?"
"It should clarify what it means by proclamation."
"What is a proclamation?"
"Perhaps it is a glass of champagne and a string quartet, perhaps it is the first building block of Europe's constitution, but all this should be clarified."
"Parliaments are not used to proclaiming things."
"Secondly, Biarritz should reconsider the question of the European Union signing up to the existing European Convention."
"Thirdly, it should consider future revision and a procedure for revising the clauses of the Charter in future."
"Finally, it should request the Commission to launch a widespread campaign to inform the public of this great project."
"Mr President, I should like to say one word to the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi."
"All I can say to your speech is: finally!"
"Like many here, I have waited a long time for this clear statement."
"Mr Moscovici, from the outset the European Parliament has called for the Charter of Fundamental Rights to be incorporated in the Treaties, for it to be made legally binding and - when it is infringed - for people to be given recourse to the European Court of Justice."
"This demand is not a political position of any kind."
"It results necessarily from the nature of the matter, from the essence of fundamental rights, and it corresponds to the expectations and requirements of the people."
"Can you even proclaim rights in earnest without enshrining them in law?"
"Can you proclaim rights in earnest, but at the same time refuse to declare them part of your own law?"
"Can you recognise fundamental rights but deny people the instruments and means to defend them?"
"Each article of this Charter is already enshrined in international conventions, in the constitutions of the Member States, in international law or in EU treaties and protocols."
"None of them contain anything new."
"They represent the sum total of a 200-year tradition of fundamental rights in Europe."
"The only question which needs to be resolved is whether the European Union and its institutions are - like the Member States - going to submit to this European tradition of fundamental rights."
"Can it, Mr Moscovici, be true that governments are afraid of making long attested rights into internal European law which is actually in force and can be upheld by the courts?"
"If so, would the European Council and the governments of the Member States not be admitting to the whole world that all these international conventions have for decades been regarded as political confessional literature without any legal weight?"
"Would that not then arouse the suspicion amongst the people that the European Council and the governments of the Member States were trying to omit the section on governmental cooperation from the Charter on Fundamental Rights and protect their own power and their own absolute power from principles of the rule of law, judicial supervision and rules on fundamental rights?"
"That is the suspicion which persists!"
"Minister Moscovici, surely it is a little comical for the Heads of State and Government to wish to proclaim rights of defence against the State."
"It is a matter for parliaments to proclaim fundamental rights and to enshrine them in law."
"But I believe that in this situation the governments and the European Council would be well advised to regard Parliament's vote in favour of legal validity and incorporation into the Treaties as an extremely weighty argument and to accede to this demand."
"Mr President, I have to say that it was certainly a moving moment yesterday when the Convention was able to adopt the draft Charter in Brussels."
"As a member of the Convention, I have to admit that from time to time over the last ten months I had grave doubts as to whether this project would succeed."
"But the job has been done and I should like at this stage - with your permission - to thank very much the head of our delegation, Mr Méndez de Vigo, for his personal commitment."
"The Charter of Fundamental Rights is indeed an important political project for the future of the European Union."
"It makes the rights of the public in respect of the bodies and institutions of the European Union transparent, and it closes a loophole in the protection of people's fundamental rights."
"The text now on the table is undoubtedly a delicate political compromise between the different interests of all 15 Member States and between the views of the various political parties and forces in the Union with their different socio-political ideas and moral concepts, and the text of the Charter has both strengths and weaknesses."
"In my view, the social fundamental rights are misconceived."
"We are seeking in vain to establish a right to a fair remuneration, despite the fact that this has been established by all States in the 1961 Social Charter."
"On environmental and consumer protection there are no individual rights for the public, and it is also regrettable that the right to asylum is not established as an individual right for third country nationals."
"On the other hand, I do also recognise the strengths of the Charter."
"The level of protection of the public's fundamental rights will match that in the European Convention on Human Rights and will even guarantee a greater level of protection."
"There is the right to strike, there is the right to conscientious objection, and I am particularly glad that the absolute equality between men and women has found its way into the Charter."
"I would endorse what previous speakers have said."
"In my view, the Cologne Decision needs to be rewritten."
"In Biarritz we need to send out a twofold political signal: firstly, there needs to be a wide-ranging public debate on the Charter in the Union."
"The people must be included in this debate."
"Secondly, we need a decision to make the Charter an integral part of the Treaties."
"But in my view this question should also be decided by the people."
"For example, I could imagine a referendum being held in all our countries in 2004 alongside the European elections to ask the people whether the Charter should become an integral part of the Treaties."
"Mr President, in the referendum on the euro last week the Danes said no to the Europe of integration, no to the Europe of the super-state, and yes to a Europe of diversities, yes to a Europe that respects national democracies."
"The Biarritz Council and, three months hence, the Nice Council, which are to discuss the European institutions, must draw a significant conclusion from this."
"The response to enlargement is not increased supra-nationality, or an increase in powers, seated in Brussels, that are binding on all the Member States of the Union or even just on certain states that have joined together to form a hard core."
"The second lesson is one for the people of France, and, without doubt, one for other nations too."
"My compatriots voted for the single currency in 1992 because they had been told that this could work without a super-state."
"Well, that is not true."
"This is now quite evident with the slump in the euro."
"In 1992, the French came to a decision on the basis of spurious information."
"They must now, in the light of experience, come to another decision, but this time on the basis of frank and comprehensive criteria."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as President Prodi will remember, the Italian Radicals voted against his appointment last year."
"I do not know whether we would have done so, Mr Prodi, had you given then the speech which you have delivered today before the European Parliament."
"You have highlighted - and I applaud you for this - all the shortcomings of the process of European integration which have hitherto come to light and the implications for Nice if the method and spirit which, sadly, have pervaded recent Intergovernmental Conferences continue to prevail."
"Mr Barón Crespo was right to remind us that you were one of the signatories of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which established the position of Mr CFSP, and I would add to this that your government was one of the staunchest advocates of creating the new position held by Mr Solana which, despite his personal qualities, is highly irregular in legal terms."
"This is why your condemnation today of the intergovernmental method, which Parliament has never ceased to view as one of the principle causes of Europe' s impotence at both internal and international level, is even more welcome."
"If we continue with this method, President Moscovici, enlargement will not come about and, in Nice, you will at best be able to start all over again - you could even try holding another Intergovernmental Conference."
"President Prodi, as other speakers have already said, the Commission needs to firmly reassert its role as the driving force behind European integration, and today, you have set down the broad guidelines for this."
"Continue in this vein, speak out loud and clear at Biarritz and at Nice, draw on the wise, sensible positions adopted by the European Parliament on this matter, and this House will certainly not fail to lend you its full support."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, the questions which Mr Napolitano asked the Council and Commission on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs bear witness to a view of the Charter, which, unfortunately, our group is unable to share."
"It is quite unnecessary for this Charter to be established when it comes to stepping up the protection of fundamental rights in Europe."
"This is also the view of experts in the field of European constitutional law."
"If the Charter were to form part of the Treaties, this would be at the expense of the authority of the Council of Europe and of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms."
"In the long term, this is almost bound to lead to a competitive battle and conflict of interests between the European Union and the Council of Europe."
"A legally binding Charter is not only unnecessary, it even threatens to harm the enforcement of the fundamental rights."
"In order to ensure that these fundamental rights in Europe are protected effectively, all that needs to happen, now and in future, is for the European Union to join the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms."
"In this way, we will ensure that the EU institutions are actually monitored externally at the same time."
"We would therefore be in favour of the Member States discussing the European Union' s accession to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms as one of the subjects within the framework of the IGC."
"Negotiations regarding the Charter could, as far as we are concerned, be scrapped."
"We are all the more convinced of this when we take a closer look at the text of the Charter, which stipulates that the Charter is only suited to function within one European state."
"As a Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities, we hope, however, that such a federal state will never see the light of day."
"Mr President, personally I am pleased that following the lifting of the sanctions within the Union normal relations have been resumed, apart perhaps from a few minor exceptions which are not worth bothering with."
"I can therefore attend to the subject of the Charter of Fundamental Rights with a glad heart."
"People's opinions may well differ on the text which has been drafted."
"They might judge it to be satisfactory or less satisfactory; they might also consider it - compared with the huge effort involved - to be rather wanting."
"But they can make one objective statement: the actual aim will not be achieved for as long as this Charter is not accorded legally binding status."
"Until then it will in fact do nothing more than pay lip service to these ideals."
"Whether, incidentally, another Convention would be a suitable way of addressing the considerably more complex issue of a European constitution remains to be seen."
"The involvement of the national parliaments is obviously to be welcomed."
"Personally, however, I think it is doubtful whether a reasonable result can be achieved on this difficult issue working from such a broad basis."
"As far as Biarritz is concerned, I should like to point out that it is not far from there to Nice, but neither - more importantly - is it very long now."
"The question of whether the Member States will be able to agree on a new treaty in Nice is still completely open."
"The attitude of the French Presidency - that they would rather have no treaty at all than a bad one - is sensible in my opinion."
"However, people's views on what makes a good or bad treaty are still miles apart."
"In addition, the French Presidency is not escaping criticism from leading European diplomats because of the way in which it is conducting the negotiations."
"But it is precisely the conduct of this French Presidency which will determine whether especially the smaller Member States take the impression with them from the negotiations on the Intergovernmental Conference that less value is attached to their reservations and positions than to those of the large Member States."
"Mr President, the Charter has been a successful venture for all concerned and primarily, I believe, for Parliament."
"I see three benefits in it."
"The first has been the method selected, that of the Convention, which took the form of a judicious blend involving the competent representatives at national and European level, even if there was an extra guest at the table, as Commissioner Vitorino underlined."
"The three musketeers were in fact four, but they have indeed enabled a method to be set in place that we should turn to in the future to move matters forward within the European Union."
"The second benefit has been the work carried on by the committee."
"Tribute should be paid to Mr Méndez de Vigo for the work that he has done."
"In particular, we have seen the significant weight that the EP Delegation has in any case been able to carry with regard to the amendments approved."
"The third benefit has been that of the good work done by Parliament, something that any parliament would welcome."
"The quality of those who have spoken before me makes it unnecessary to linger on this point, but it is true that there is a real added value."
"The scope of the Charter respects the principle of subsidiarity and it was no easy task to draw up a text that was balanced in legal terms, but still attractive and accessible to the citizens."
"The counterpart of this threefold benefit is a threefold responsibility."
"The first responsibility concerns our comments."
"I believe that we must look beyond the frustrations inherent in any consensus in order to praise this Charter, rather than dwelling on what we would have liked to have seen and still envisage."
"The second responsibility is that of adopting the Charter."
"I would like to think that Parliament could, in November, adopt the Charter of Fundamental Rights with all due formality, because it is traditional for parliaments to act as the custodians of public freedoms, and the European Parliament must seize the opportunity to demonstrate this."
"Lastly, the third responsibility is to follow up on this Charter, and we must show tenacity in this regard."
"We have voted, by a very large majority, for a resolution that calls for this Charter to be incorporated into the Treaties."
"I am aware that we already have a lot on our plate at Nice, and I am not convinced that it would be wise to ask for actual incorporation as early as Nice."
"What we can at least call for at Nice is a very precise timetable for the eventual incorporation of this Charter, even if, as legal experts have confirmed, it will have legal effect as soon as it is adopted by this House and by the Heads of Government, as there is nothing to stop the Court of Justice referring to it."
"The end result is therefore a text that will be of great value within Europe, as many people have stressed."
"It is an asset for the people of Europe."
"I personally take pleasure in imagining that it could one day act as the preamble to a Constitution yet to be written."
"Lastly, with regard to the world outside Europe, I believe that human rights are the true message to come out of Europe."
"We now have a European handbook to send to our partners in their concentric circles - first to those who wish to join us and then to those with whom negotiations are being held."
"I would like to thank President Prodi for his powerful speech. It reflected a great vision shared by many of us."
"I also support what he said regarding the innovative value of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which enshrines the indivisibility of fundamental rights, overcoming the traditional distinctions between civil rights, economic and social rights and rights in new areas, and affirms the equality of men and women in all fields of human activity."
"However, today, the Charter is essentially a symbol, the symbol of the passage from the Europe of the single market to the political Europe, from the Europe of States to the Europe of the citizens."
"Made up of different peoples and nations which wish to retain their different traditions, languages and religions, the European Union' s identity is based not on belonging to the same ethnic group, the same land or the same race, but on shared principles and shared fundamental human rights."
"This is the model of European civilisation which, after centuries of bloody conflict, has guaranteed us lasting peace between our peoples, and it is this peace and this social model which is our gift to the candidate countries, whom we do not ask to share our traditions or beliefs but to accept the same rules as we do in order to safeguard the freedom and dignity of every human being."
"The unprecedented method - as it has rightly been described - followed in drawing up the Charter produced rapid results, thanks to the participation of the representatives of the peoples and their governments, the involvement and achievement of consensus among all the elements of civil society which wished to express their opinions, the transparency and collegial nature of the proceedings, the willingness to listen to different positions and the acceptance of sound compromises."
"The debilitating semi-secret or confidential negotiations which characterise the intergovernmental method do not produce the same results."
"Now, this symbolic document is a milestone in the process of constitutionalising the European Union - for, in my opinion, the Union' s Constitution will not come into being in a single document all in one go, but will be the result of the gradual consolidation of the common institutions and the definition of shared fundamental rules - and it must become practically enforceable law."
"Thanks to the Treaties, the Union has become an area of freedom, security and justice."
"This cannot continue to exist without an obligation to respect clearly proclaimed fundamental rights."
"It is the responsibility of the States, who are guardians of the Treaties, to establish this constraint by conferring legal status upon the Charter in the most appropriate way."
"The Charter is the soul of the Union and it cannot remain suspended in limbo indefinitely: it must be incorporated into current legislation."
"The governments must take human rights seriously and enforce them firmly and effectively to the tangible benefit of the European citizens."
"Only then will the citizens begin to look upon Europe as their common home."
"Mr President, the meeting in Biarritz is the half-time point in the struggle for a new Treaty."
"Unfortunately, the match has so far been goalless and not very exciting."
"The people of Europe are waiting impatiently for results."
"The candidate countries are waiting for positive signals showing that the way to membership of the Union is, despite everything, becoming shorter."
"In the Member States, we are all waiting for the Council of Ministers to show the political courage and will really to reform current cooperation."
"It is difficult at present to see whether that will is to be found."
"The negotiations concerning the new Treaty take place too often behind closed doors."
"The French Presidency therefore has a big responsibility for ensuring that genuine and tangible results are achieved in Nice, and the new Treaty must really create a European Union for new Member States."
"The institutional issues need to be solved and a clear mandate provided for continued work on a European constitution which is citizen-friendly and comprehensible."
"The Charter must be incorporated into this constitution, and I hope that a signal to this effect will be given in Biarritz."
"For us Liberals, it is an obvious fact, and one that needs to be crystal-clear, that the present intergovernmental conference must be the last before new Member States are admitted."
"Unsolved issues about the future of the European project may not be used as justification for further postponing our historic task to unite Europe."
"The EU will never be ready, but the candidate countries must participate actively in future discussions."
"The Convention method is perhaps more suitable than these intergovernmental conferences we have had in the past."
"Expectations prior to the meeting in Biarritz are running high."
"We all long for signs of progress."
"It is time to score a few goals in order to maintain hope and to sustain interest in the match as a whole."
"Mr President, I believe that body language can sometimes speak louder than words, but I do hope that Mr Moscovici' s distracted and condescending demeanour during this debate is not representative of the attitude of the Council of which he is the President-in-Office."
"I am sure that this is not the case, and I hope that those countries which have welcomed President Prodi' s speech with relief and enthusiasm will be able to take steps in the run up to Nice to ensure that it is a genuine success."
"I would just like to focus briefly on the appraisal of the Convention method."
"It is quite true that it is an improvement on an Intergovernmental Conference, but - take note, ladies and gentlemen - even the Convention was forced to achieve consensus on every single word and, in the end, particularly during the concluding phase, it turned into a sort of Intergovernmental Conference II: our Praesidium had to negotiate with the Member States instead of, or as well as, Members of Parliament."
"I therefore feel that, once again, the obligation to achieve unanimity on every single part of the Charter as well as on the final result will prove extremely hampering when we come to evaluate the content of the Charter itself."
"Mr President, Mr Prodi has referred to the referendum in Denmark, the outcome of which I believe reflects a malaise that extends far beyond that country."
"Many European citizens are questioning the point reached by the Union, its objectives and even the logic of integration."
"We say that there is a crisis of confidence with regard to the institutions, and I feel that this crisis is due in particular to the disparity between the expectations of society and the ability to live up to them."
"While growth continues apace, inequalities have become increasingly intolerable."
"The call for equitable distribution has become even louder."
"There are also great expectations as concerns cooperation, transparency and public debate."
"We must learn to listen more closely."
"Despite the method adopted, which I welcome, the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which should be the social foundation stone of the European Union would not seem to match up either to the expectations or to the objectives set."
"Despite the constructive changes made in the final draft produced by the Convention, there is still great disparity between the contributions made by citizens' associations, their hopes and the results actually achieved."
"I would even go so far as to say that this Charter contains many ambiguities."
"There is still time to enhance it and, in doing so, to be far more receptive to the proposals made by many associations, trade unions and the progressive movement."
"The same applies to the priorities of employment, social integration and lifelong learning - highly important objectives that have been set, but whose realisation has foundered on the cold logic of the stability pact, on the dogma of liberalisation."
"Following on from what my fellow Member, Mr Wurtz, has said, I would like to stress the extent to which the vital reform of the institutions should address the issue of making the Union more democratic."
"There has been one gaping omission in all the remarks made on the subject of how it would be possible to create institutions enabling citizen participation."
"This is the prerequisite for a Europe of the peoples that is built to last."
"Mr President, I have only one thing to say in response to the President of the Commission' s speech: bravo!"
"We know that things are not going well and it is better to admit it openly."
"The negotiating side of things has hitherto proved disappointing and yielded negative results: to our knowledge, on not one point in the total 75 cases of unanimous voting has total agreement been reached, and in Italy, for the first time, a recent survey has shown that, in one of the largest regions, the North East, Europe is falling out of favour."
"The truth is that Europe resembles an aeroplane taking off: either it accelerates and keeps rising upwards or it falls to the ground."
"And so, President, you who bear the greater responsibility, forge ahead right to the very end."
"You are committed, as are we, to absolute coherence, but there are two things which have to be done: firstly, you must make it clear immediately that, if Nice is a failure, there will be an internal crisis which may well involve resignations from the Commission, if necessary, and secondly, you must make it just as clear that enlargement is impossible without prior thorough reform."
"Europe is in danger of being defeated by compromises, not crises."
"When such crises are triggered by opposing views they are healthy."
"Mr President, like all top class cyclists, President Prodi knows the right moment to break away from the pack."
"This is what he has done this morning in this speech which has given us all fresh hope."
"I would like to focus on two facts which produce opposing reactions: satisfaction at the Convention and bitterness at the outcome of the referendum in Denmark."
"These are two different results which, however, I feel are closely related and herald new times."
"Almost 90% of the population took part in the Danish referendum, a level which bears unequivocal witness to the citizens' interest in contributing to European decision-making."
"On the other hand, the result, which we fully respect, may be an indication that the citizens do not yet feel in tune with the European ideal."
"The problem may well be a general one."
"It must be admitted that, after 55 years of Community life, there may well be a lack of feeling of belonging to anything other than a merely geographical Europe."
"The internal borders of today and the single currency of tomorrow are certainly useful, necessary symbols which will affect citizens' everyday lives in a practical way and contribute to reinforcing the European ideal, but they will not fulfil the citizens' call for greater heed to be paid to their views and for greater representation of their interests and, above all, of their hopes for the future."
"As we know, the objectives set at the current Intergovernmental Conference do not meet this demand fully, although the reform of the weighting of votes and the extension of qualified majority voting are steps in this direction."
"For a long time now, we have been talking about a post-Nice period during which institutions and operating procedures need to be reformed more effectively, also and especially with a view to enlargement."
"I and many others feel that the experiment of the Convention should be repeated, and that the formula adopted should be refined as we go along, so that the hope recently expressed by President Chirac that the reform processes will increasingly serve the purpose of bringing our institutions closer to the citizens will be fulfilled."
"The Convention was a Europe-wide success in terms of the formula adopted, the significant results achieved within the time allowed and the sense of accountability shown by all the participants."
"Let us endeavour to promote this model to ensure a future in which our hopes for Europe are realised."
"Mr President, I too am proud of the text of the Charter which is being submitted to the Biarritz Council."
"It is the first time that the indivisibility of fundamental rights has actually found expression; something for which a case has been made in the international arena, since the human rights conference in Vienna in 1993."
"I have argued strongly in favour of including social, economic and cultural rights alongside the traditional fundamental rights."
"This came to fruition."
"I do have two minor criticisms I would like to make."
"The Presidency has failed to carry out the wishes of the vast majority of the Convention, who wanted an unambiguous reference to the revised social Charter of the Council of Europe to be included."
"I think this is unwise, but I assume that the European Court will make up for this in its interpretation of social rights."
"Last-minute changes have been made to the text of the article on collective action and the right to strike."
"I will not go into detail."
"Commissioner Vitorino knows exactly what I am referring to."
"I expect that he will include corrections and clarifications in the memorandum."
"As an ex-trade union negotiator, I am used to defending the outcome of negotiations."
"Do not, therefore, expect me to come up with a whole list of points which are lacking or which have not been formulated as well as they could have been."
"I believe that we have a sound Charter before us."
"Its aim is to marry the entire breadth of European policy with the standards and principles of the constitutional state and of the social welfare state."
"This was the Cologne mandate and this is also what the Charter can do, whether it becomes binding or not."
"Naturally, the Charter must be incorporated into the Treaty and it should form the basis of a European constitution in future."
"But some Member States need slightly more time to get used to the idea."
"Those at the back of the queue threaten to dictate the pace, but this is no reason to relegate the Charter to the bin if it cannot be made binding right away."
"On the contrary, I believe we need to throw our entire weight behind the next step."
"So, I would suggest to Mr Moscovici not to ease off."
"The Charter should become a live instrument, both legally and politically."
"On a legal plane, I can think of forms of enforcement other than direct enforcement by the European Court on an individual basis."
"For example, in the Council of Europe and the ILO, there is a wealth of experience in terms of reporting procedures, expert committees and the collective right of complaint of trade unions and NGOs, and it is through these means that the Charter can be monitored from a legal perspective."
"Just as important is the fact that the Charter can establish itself as a political project as a means of involving people in Europe."
"The discussion which Mr Verheugen sparked with his statement on a referendum was a painful demonstration of how bad communication is between Brussels and the citizens."
"Similarly, the Danish referendum can be taken as a motion of no-confidence."
"I would like to promote the Charter as a Charter for setting a wide social debate in motion about what kind of a Europe we want."
"Mrs Pintassilgo and her Committee of Wise Men suggested this back in 1996."
"NGOs and trade unions are ready for this, as has become evident from the enormous commitment they have shown to the process so far."
"Let us hold on to this commitment and build on it."
"Last week, the Benelux governments proposed in an IGC memorandum that next year, under the Belgian Presidency, a plan for giving direction to Europe' s will have to be laid down which addresses these points, such as the anchoring of the Charter, but also the discussion on reforming institutions and authorities, which Mr Prodi was referring to."
"I think it is a realistic timetable to propose a project for the future of Europe under that Presidency, and the Charter will have a role to play in this."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, this is an important passage in the history of Europe, in the history of the world as well as of the Union."
"The drawing-up and approval of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, together with an Intergovernmental Conference which may lead to decisive changes and enlargement are historic events which may leave their mark on the start of this new century."
"There is, however, the possibility that the full potential of this decisive episode will not be realised if the Charter is not made legally effective, if the Intergovernmental Conference does not carry out the reforms and if, as a consequence, enlargement becomes liable to hold back political integration."
"The dilemma in the hearts of a great many citizens who want a political Europe, not just a great trading entity, is this: if the Intergovernmental Conference fails to produce the desired reforms, should we still proceed with enlargement?"
"Indeed, if we were to continue along the road to enlargement whatever happens, as is to be desired, closer cooperation would be our only hope."
"Therefore, this last prospect should certainly not be restricted by pre-set limits but rather, while remaining within the bounds of an accepted legal and institutional framework, enable the Member States who are ready to do so to set off along the path of deeper political integration, leaving the way open for the others to join them when they consider the time is right."
"We must allow everyone to follow his own political project in the Union, in a harmony of differences which, after all, has already proved to be a winning solution in the history of the European Union."
"Mr President, like many in the House I very much welcomed what Mr Prodi said to us this morning, both about the architecture of the Union and its institutions and about the Charter of Rights."
"I am one of those who believe that adopting the Charter, even in a declaratory mode, will be a welcome step forward because it will certainly lead in due course to a charter that is fully legally binding."
"I should like to draw the attention of the House and the Commission to the question which will arise this Friday when we are discussing the rights of the lettori, the foreign language lecturers in Italian universities."
"Here we have a situation where rights possessed by citizens of the Union have been denied for twelve years and more."
"It is no good agreeing a Charter of Rights at the highest level if individual citizens who are wronged by a state have no effective remedy."
"We insist, therefore, that as well as the commitment to the Charter we have heard from the Commission today, it also commits itself to protecting the rights of individual citizens."
"Mr President, the proposed Charter of Fundamental Rights does not mean that citizens' rights are to be reinforced."
"It adds nothing over and above what is at present implied in the EU' s, the Member States' and the Council of Europe' s policy in this area."
"This is also clear from Article 50 of the Treaty."
"Seen from a Left perspective, there is a lot missing from the text of the Charter."
"The Charter can therefore only be seen as an attempt to transfer responsibility for citizens' rights from the institutions in which they at present reside to the European Union."
"It is a development which we reject."
"It is aimed only at driving the EU towards a federal constitution."
"We believe there are better alternatives, namely for the EU to sign and, in that way, be subject to the Council of Europe' s convention in this area."
"This would also reinforce pan-European cooperation in this sphere instead of weakening it, as there is a danger of the EU Charter doing."
"Mr President, the result of the Danish referendum ought to be understood free from false interpretations."
"The Danish 'no' vote is not isolationist or nationalistic in character."
"It is not a sign that a majority of Danes are saying 'no' to European cooperation or that the Danes are not carefully informed about the ins and outs and development plans of the European Union."
"A majority of Danes have said 'no' , as they did in 1992 and 1993, to more European integration, 'no' to surrendering more sovereignty and 'no' to the tools which serve these purposes, that is to say the euro, majority decision-making and a European constitution."
"Allow me to stress that the 'no' votes were delivered by voters right across the political spectrum. Even half of the ruling Social Democratic Party' s voters said 'no' ."
"It should not be imagined that the European project, of which we have heard the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi give such a clear description, could have convinced the Danes and persuaded them to vote 'yes' ."
"The Danish Government and the parties in favour of the euro have done everything in their power to explain away the integration and surrender of sovereignty that are under way."
"In order to pacify a people who have been independent for a thousand years, it was declared that 'the Union is as dead as a doornail' ."
"If the Danish Government had spoken as clearly as Mr Prodi and Mr Poettering did in this Chamber today, there would have been many more people who voted 'no' ."
"Allow me, therefore, to say to you all: those who want more in the way of union must go further down that road alone."
"Mr President, I am sure that the informal Summit of Biarritz will not yield any breakthroughs at this stage."
"We are counting on Nice to fulfil this requirement."
"However, what the summit can do is to prepare the groundwork for Nice, and this is why this debate is certainly useful to get across our parliamentary message."
"With regard to Biarritz, I desperately hope that the Amsterdam leftovers can be resolved very quickly."
"Concerning the number of Commissioners, we believe that one Commissioner for each Member State is enough, and Parliament needs no more than 700 MEPs."
"Furthermore, and this brings me to the most important point, all EU legislation must be subject to qualified majority decision-making combined with - and this is a compelling point - Parliament' s right of codecision, because I have heard rumours here and there that these two do not automatically coincide."
"What I would also call for, however, is to look beyond immediate concerns in Biarritz."
"We know all too well that the present Treaties are inadequate and that the Union will need a better and different structure in future, a more constitutional structure which clearly distinguishes the powers of the Member States and those of the Union."
"In this respect, President Prodi set the right tone in my opinion."
"I would like to make a brief comment on the Charter."
"I had the honour of being involved in the preparatory work for the Charter."
"I would first of all like to thank Mr Roman Herzog and Mr Inigo Méndez de Vigo for their sterling work and for the way compromises were struck time and again."
"I would also like to commend the role of Commissioner Vitorino. The outcome was sound."
"The Charter provides for the dignity of the citizens, the ban on capital punishment, the citizens' liberties, education, labour and enterprise in all Member States, the very exhaustive anti-discrimination article, which is even more exhaustive than the one in the Treaty of Amsterdam, and the equal treatment of men and women; not only in traditional areas of work, remuneration and social security, but also in all areas of the Union. All this represents a step forward."
"I hope with all my heart, and I must say this quite emphatically, that an opportunity will arise when this document can be incorporated into the Treaties at some point in the future."
"Mr President, I would like to end by making a final remark on Professor Prodi' s cry from the heart."
"I have to say that his warning, a well-meaning one at that, to stop confirming and developing intergovernmental trends, has really struck a chord with me."
"These only exacerbate the EU' s anti-democratic disposition."
"Mr Prodi has put an emphatic stop to this kind of action, which has hopefully resonated with Mr Moscovici, and I truly hope that this trend can be broken and reversed at the Councils in Nice and Biarritz."
"Mr President, I want to begin by expressing my hope that the heads of government in Nice will turn the Charter of Fundamental Rights, that is to say the package as a whole, into one which offers direct protection to citizens as individuals."
"Our declaration of rights is the first of this millennium."
"It is the most modern in the world, and it has been drawn up in the world' s largest continuous legal area."
"It offers an important message to our citizens and to surrounding countries about the constitutional principles upon which our countries are founded."
"For the first time, citizens' representatives have actively participated in shaping the details of the European Union' s development."
"A democratic and effective model has replaced an old-fashioned, sluggish and one-sided model."
"Our European identity and community of values will be strengthened."
"However, the Charter will also have liberalising effects on the European economy."
"Individuals will have more opportunities to start up businesses and to stand on their own two feet."
"Increased support will be given to private ownership and to ownership under intellectual property law."
"This individual protection is an important basis for enlargement of the Union - the EU' s priority for the next few years."
"Citizens of the candidate countries will also be able to share in the EU' s freedoms and rights."
"European citizenship is taking shape here and now. In particular, it will give citizens of small countries the benefits enjoyed by the citizens of a large country."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, rarely can a Presidency of the European Union have been so burdened with challenges and chock-full of events."
"These challenges are, in essence, the Intergovernmental Conference and the preparation for enlargement, which are of course interconnected."
"The events are the problems currently being experienced by the euro, the surge in oil prices and, on a different level, the hopes for a transition towards democracy in Yugoslavia."
"In other words, the French Presidency's task is no easy one."
"We, as elected representatives, are at least as responsible for encouraging it to make progress in the face of adversity as we are for relaying the messages that we receive from public opinion in each of our countries."
"These are, first and foremost, messages of concern at the economic and social problems that we are experiencing, in spite of a period of sustained growth stemming from years of efforts by all our fellow citizens."
"During this French Presidency of the Union, we expect a firm unified response from the 15 Member States to these issues, which are of prime concern to our fellow citizens, one that will enable a rapid reversal of these trends."
"Should this fail to materialise, we should not be surprised if public opinion proves sceptical about Europe, or even rejects it."
"Then there are messages of encouragement concerning the IGC negotiations in preparation for the enlargement of the Union."
"These are, as we know, very tricky negotiations and raise fears of a setback or a watered-down agreement in Nice which, as you have already acknowledged, Mr Moscovici, would be even more serious."
"The European Parliament, and the peoples of Europe it represents, expect the extraordinary European Council Meeting in Biarritz to mark a leap forward, a political wake-up call for the Heads of State and Government."
"The policy of one step at a time no longer suits the scale of the challenges that confront us, but your determination on both counts is evident in your statements."
"Let us restore a human dimension to Europe."
"Incorporating the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the Treaties would be a major step in this direction."
"Let us, as a Europe of 15 Member States, organise ourselves in order to be able to welcome those countries who are knocking at the door into the fold under respectable conditions."
"Let us at last find the clarity of vision to define the borders of Europe."
"I started by mentioning the events in Yugoslavia."
"If only we could draw from the courage and perseverance in adversity shown by our friends in Serbia, Europe would be able to make better headway and be more readily understood and supported by its citizens."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, in experiencing the adoption of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the European Parliament we are seeing history in the making."
"The completion of this work is an important milestone in the history of the European Union, particularly for the people who live there."
"The work of the Convention under the leadership of the former German President, Roman Herzog, is to be welcomed."
"At this stage I should also like to thank Dr Ingo Friedrich who played a leading role in our group's contribution to the work of the Convention."
"But I should like once again to ask a very clear question here: do we want to create a charter of all immutable and inalienable human rights?"
"Or do we want a wish list containing everything that would be nice?"
"Are free education and free access to a job centre fundamental rights on the same footing as the right to life or human dignity?"
"In Germany an extensive list of fundamental rights already existed in the Weimar constitution which, however, because it was so extensive, degenerated into a simple set of targets which could not be legally enforced."
"That must not happen here."
"We want to ensure that the fundamental rights of the European public are genuinely protected."
"With an eye to recent events, the issue of petrol prices also seems to me to be particularly noteworthy."
"The current situation, which is intolerable, particularly for many independent haulage firms and for agriculture, does in any case need to be improved."
"It is not enough for the finance ministers to swear in Versailles that they will not lower taxes, only for the countries where the protests are loudest to give in afterwards."
"The Intergovernmental Conference - to address a third subject - on the reform of the European institutions is also of decisive significance for us in Parliament."
"Majority voting can only be extended in the Council if at the same time the European Parliament's powers of codecision are widened."
"Any other procedure would mean a huge democratic deficit."
"Responsibilities must be clearly delimited."
"Provision for social, cultural and charitable causes must be included in Article 87 so that the future of these important institutions can also be permanently safeguarded."
"Mr President, Mr Prodi, as has often been said in this House, the Charter of Fundamental Rights is the end result of genuine democratic cooperation."
"Representatives from both our own parliament and national parliaments and governments worked on it."
"This cooperation produced an excellent result, in spite of some misgivings."
"We might ask whether this model of successful cooperation should be continued in the future?"
"Many of our citizens feel the European Union is distant and bureaucratic."
"Their distrust of the Union must be taken seriously."
"We have to pay particular attention to relations between the people and the Union' s institutions."
"For that reason, I am very glad that the Charter on Fundamental Rights emphasises the principle of transparency, although it could still be put in stronger terms."
"Despite the demands made here today in this House, it would appear that the Charter is not going to be made legally binding, but is merely to be a political declaration."
"I use the word 'merely' , although I believe that, despite its declaratory nature, the EC Court will have to apply the Articles of the Charter in their judicial practices as self-binding principles, with which the interpretation of the court must naturally be in harmony. In this way they will gradually become de facto legally binding legal norms."
"The Charter is an indication that the Union bears a responsibility for and cares about human rights."
"For the implementation of human rights to be monitored in practice also, however, the Union must have clear rules regarding possible sanction mechanisms to be used against Member States."
"At present, the Council is talking about incorporating such mechanisms in Article 7."
"An agreement on procedures in itself is a good thing, but we must make sure that the system cannot be used as a political weapon."
"According to ancient Finnish wisdom, you should examine a person first before hitting him."
"At present I feel there is a danger that if the proposal by the Belgian Government on these sanction mechanisms were to be implemented, we would be hitting first and examining only afterwards."
"I hope that the sanction mechanisms will be discussed further before the summits at Biarritz and Nice."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the European Parliament delegation in the Convention and the President of the Convention, Mr Roman Herzog, for their committed work."
"The drafting of a European Charter of Fundamental Rights is an important and necessary step towards a Europe which is close to the people."
"Some people think that it is possible to create an internal market in Europe without agreeing on fundamental values and principles."
"The majority of the European Parliament has never supported this view."
"For example, with the directive on patenting biotechnological inventions - which was, of course, supposed to be primarily an internal market directive - we did not allow this directive to be adopted without fundamental ethical principles being enshrined in it, and without particular techniques which offend against human dignity being prohibited from patenting."
"Where modern genetic engineering is concerned, in particular, this was an important step towards establishing common values in Europe."
"The Charter is a further - certainly much more important - step."
"Many parts of the draft which we have before us are excellent."
"But the draft is worth improving precisely in respect of the protection of human dignity and the protection against its abuse by modern technologies."
"The wording is imprecise in some places, and I am particularly concerned that Article 3 of the draft Charter only prohibits the reproductive cloning of human beings."
"This can be interpreted as a step backwards compared with previous European legislation."
"In the directive on patenting biotechnological inventions, the cloning of human beings is prohibited as a whole, Commissioner Prodi, because it offends common decency and law and order - so it is not only the patent that is prohibited; the technique is too."
"Commissioner Busquin very kindly assured me of this once again in a letter this week, and that is why it is dangerous for us now to be weaker in the Charter than in existing European Union legislation."
"This is not our delegation's fault; it is not Roman Herzog's fault: it is the fault of the governments of the Member States."
"That is why pressure needs to be exerted on them once again to introduce an improvement at this point in the text."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with the approval of the courts in Luxembourg and Strasbourg, the Convention has put together a draft Charter of Fundamental Rights which is remarkably balanced, and has delivered it into the hands of the Council."
"Where does the added value of this Charter lie?"
"Firstly, it lies in the fact that a basic set of fundamental rights has been distilled from more than 30 legal sources which are currently in force."
"Secondly, it lies in its transparency for the public, who now know what rights they have in respect of those who create and apply European law, and in its transparency for those who do precisely that, draft or apply European law."
"They too now have a clear idea of the rights which they have to respect."
"Thirdly, the Convention has not confined itself to restating old rights - even the Council of Europe has recognised this - but has identified new dangers in connection with old rights and included them in the text: in the areas of crime, biotechnology, data protection and administration."
"The Charter therefore guarantees a greater level of protection than the European Convention on Human Rights - this needs to be said to all those who are asserting the opposite here in the plenary - and it formulates political and social rights in a balanced way."
"It is the first declaration of human rights of the new millennium and the most modern charter of human rights available anywhere in the world."
"It makes it clear to people that the European Union has always been a Community of values."
"Even so, the EU will have to do a great deal to keep it that way."
"Mr President-in-Office, I would ask you in all seriousness just to consider the following: if you now wish simply to go back to the Cologne Decision and reflect at your leisure on whether this should be incorporated into the Treaties, what encouragement will those who disregard human rights draw from the fact that we are hesitating to do this?"
"What Mr Baron Crespo said is right: why waste time?"
"All this is about, after all, is making law which is already in force more visible."
"Mr President, we have just had a debate that was both interesting and productive."
"I too would like to welcome Mr Prodi' s forceful and meaningful intervention."
"I have of course noted - and this is cause for great satisfaction - that the European Parliament is almost unanimously content with the Charter."
"This is not surprising because it has itself contributed to it, and because it is consonant with some of its values."
"That lends great weight to this text, and to the European Council as concerns furthering the Charter."
"I have noted your appeals and invitations to press ahead, to take advantage of the momentum generated and carry it to Nice and beyond."
"It is in this light that I will attempt to briefly reply to your interventions."
"Mr Prodi has spoken in favour of preserving the Community model, which met with great approval throughout this Chamber, and I would like, in my turn, to welcome this speech which will doubtless continue to be viewed as a major one."
"I agree with him on the need to maintain the institutional balance and enhance the role, in political terms, of both the Commission and the Council."
"I agree with him that the Commission must continue to play a pivotal role as guardian of the common interests of the Community."
"I agree with him on the need to guard against a return to intergovernmental methods, which some find appealing."
"However, without wanting to enter into a dialogue with him on a matter that will warrant further debate, I would also like to share with him some of the Council' s reactions."
"We must bear in mind the Community as a whole."
"The originality of the institutional system resides precisely in the sharing of responsibilities, relying on procedures that are sometimes subtle, but which are, I feel, tried and tested ones."
"Would it not be worth defining the responsibilities at each level in the decision-making process more clearly, rather than seeking to proceed with a legal allocation of powers on the basis of a traditional federal model?"
"Would we not then be closer to the model than the founding fathers intended?"
"A second observation. There are certain areas in which the sovereignty of the Member States could not be called into question without this conflicting with the spirit of European integration."
"On this issue I would like to indicate, if not my disagreement, then at least some slight differences in opinion on two points."
"The first concerns the common foreign and security policy, and the suggestion to integrate the High Representative for CFSP into the Commission."
"You will be aware that this was a deliberate decision taken in Amsterdam to clearly distinguish the two roles, with the High Representative, as opposed to the Commission, not speaking from a completely independent viewpoint, but under a remit to coordinate the common foreign and security policies that lie within the competence of the Member States, and there we should leave perhaps ample scope for an intergovernmental approach."
"CFSP, for reasons as much to do with history as with the nature of this area, will doubtless be the subject of coordination between Member States for some time to come."
"Perhaps one day we will have to abolish this function, but that day has not yet come."
"It is time, instead, to intensify this function."
"The second slight difference concerns the euro."
"The recent fluctuations in this currency have revealed the need for a more political style of governance, of management."
"For all that, we should not, I feel, steer clear of strong intergovernmental cooperation, cooperation in respect of economic policies, when seeking solutions."
"As I see it, reasoning in terms of governance, there is a need for both the Council and the Commission to have a firm hand on the tiller and, in this case too, to ensure that the Community as a whole is catered for."
"That is why I believe it is very important for the Chairman of the Eurogroup - which we chose to set up - to continue to play a full role in this area."
"There are many of us who want a federation of nation states, which means that each state must find the position that best suits it."
"A variety of opinions only serves to improve the quality of the debate, and I believe that we have just heard a very important speech."
"I was pleased to hear, Mr Napolitano, that we agree on the fact that we must not go too quickly, or risk jeopardising the Charter."
"You suggest that the Charter could provide the springboard for a future constitution, and why not."
"But we must reach agreement on what to put in this constitution."
"I am anxious to reassure Mr Poettering of my ability to chew gum while still listening carefully to what he has to say."
"He was quite right to emphasise the distance we have travelled since the fall of the wall and the reunification of Germany ten years ago."
"I hope now that democracy has gained a foothold in Serbia."
"He wanted the Presidency to outline the way forward at Nice."
"The presidency is, of course, aware that things will not come to a halt at Nice, that we must look to the future and handing over the baton."
"Once again, let us not take future debates as a pretext for not reaching - and this is not your suggestion - decisions that should be taken today within the IGC."
"It is clearly the aim of the Biarritz Council to contribute to these decisions, to prepare them."
"Mr Barón Crespo emphasised that the Charter was a fine document and one to be proud of."
"Why then does he want to put it under glass?"
"I believe that we must not forget, quite simply, that some Member States - it is not my job to name them - have already had to overcome considerable resistance and reluctance in getting this text accepted, which is why I am being, if not prudent, then at least patient, as I believe is necessary."
"As concerns the IGC, I do not fully share his point of view."
"I do not feel that we have reached a standstill, but rather that signs of a renewal are apparent."
"I moreover hope that these signs will be even more pronounced at Biarritz."
"As for the future, perhaps the method will indeed have to be reviewed, to comprise, perhaps, a convention rather than an IGC, even if it should perhaps not become a system."
"Mr Lannoye welcomed the view that I expressed with regard to a European constitution."
"I do not know whether, as one of the speakers said, I am representative of my institution, and must say that this is my own personal opinion."
"To my mind, the majority of Member States do not wish to start work on a constitution for the time being."
"On the contrary, Evian showed that there was considerable resistance to doing so."
"Mr Wurtz regretted that the citizens were not taken into account more fully, that there has been no attempt to find a way of consulting them more extensively."
"I for my part believe that it is precisely for this reason that the Convention method is a good one and that ample use should again be made of it in the future."
"The rapporteurs have already stressed the quality of the debate and the need to progress further, and I can only agree with them."
"I will now reply to Mr Méndez de Vigo."
"I am not a Christian Democrat, so I do not believe in miracles, but I do want to salute the European Parliament as such, because it has made a major contribution to this project."
"It has been no miracle, but the fruit of labour."
"Should one proclaim the Charter and see what happens, at the risk of it not being accepted throughout the Union as legally binding?"
"Mr Méndez de Vigo has asked me which countries would oppose it."
"I repeat that I am not here to name names."
"It is not the task of the President-in-Office of the Council to look for scapegoats, but rather to seek consensus and compromise."
"I would thus like to tell him that we should perhaps wait until the Council has discussed this Charter, and then we will be able to see whether we can proceed further, and more quickly, with it."
"I would respond in the same vein to Mrs Berès."
"She has said that the text of the Charter should not be altered one jot and that the Convention should have the final say on it."
"I would take a slightly different view, because the Convention should not be placed before any of the institutions."
"But I would indeed like to see the package remaining intact at Biarritz, because I genuinely fear that not doing so would spark damaging debates."
"She also made an extremely worthwhile suggestion concerning the link between the Charter and discussions over a future Article 7."
"I approve her suggestion, which I feel to be one that will enable us to progress, without going as far as incorporation, and to make a clear reference to the Charter."
"I will propose that we look into the idea of inserting such a reference, for example in Article 6."
"However, we still need, and I say this to the EP members of the Convention, to persuade the members of the European Council to do this, which will by no means be easy."
"I do not wish to reply in detail to the speakers, and moreover have no time to do so."
"I would simply like to emphasise that we do intend to be more receptive to associations' expectations."
"One could indeed wish for more and for improvement, but I honestly believe that we have made a good start."
"The satisfaction that this Chamber has shown in the Draft Charter is a powerful indication that there has been transparency, an opening out, that the method is a promising one, and that we have also gone some way to meeting the aspirations of the citizens, which are reflected in the method."
"Mrs Sudre voiced the concerns of our fellow citizens over the economic and social problems that have given rise to Euro-scepticism."
"That was not the subject under discussion today, but I must take the opportunity to remind her that, while it is true that the French Presidency has a major assignment to fulfil on the institutional front, it also has strong priorities in respect of the citizens."
"I would not want these priorities to be overshadowed by the institutional priorities."
"I could mention, for example, the social agenda which is a priority for us, or the setting in place of something that I would not call an economic government, but economic governance, to address these problems."
"I will end by saying let there be no doubt but that the French Presidency intends to give the European Parliament all the attention it deserves, and that I will be in this Chamber on 24 October to report on Biarritz."
"I would add that we want to work in the complete transparency you desire, and to carry on with the regular exchanges that we have held with you since July."
"This would seem to me essential if we want Biarritz to be a successful European Council, which is to say one that paves the way, under respectable conditions, for success in Nice, for it is the Nice Council that will determine the shape and the success of what follows."
"That is why I invite you, in spite of everything, not to throw yourselves headlong into the future, as this is a future that should be built step by step, and stone by stone."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your kind accolade and thank you also to those who have gently reproached me for not making this speech earlier."
"In reply, I would say that, before making a speech, one must identify all the major factors at work, familiarise oneself with them and weigh them up, for political discourse must always be realistic, respond to the real weight of the forces at work and relate to the aims we all set ourselves."
"I delivered this speech today because I can see that the hazards which have combined in recent months to threaten Europe have aroused in us a common determination with the potential to produce tangible results in the future."
"In today' s debate, I associate myself with the words of all those who have spoken - Mr Moscovici, Mr Napolitano and the heads of Groups - on the importance of the Charter of Fundamental Rights: this is something innovative and, moreover, unhoped-for."
"However, we cannot stop here: in addition to making the solemn political proclamation of the Charter, we need to assume a clear position regarding its incorporation into the Treaty of the Union."
"But we must also ask ourselves: into which Treaty?"
"As you are aware, the Commission has proposed to start work on a clearer fundamental treaty, placing greater emphasis on citizens' rights and defining the respective responsibilities of the Union and the Member States or, in the many cases where the responsibilities remain unchanged, to specify them more clearly."
"This is a feasible undertaking, and the University of Florence' s study would serve as an excellent basis from which to start work."
"I would stress that this undertaking is not only legally possible but also a political necessity."
"I therefore hope that the Nice European Council will associate itself with this project and decide to launch it as a practical project rather than an accomplished fact once, of course, the reforms of which we are currently in need have been adopted."
"I do not want to go into the details of the reforms today for I want to talk principally about the method: the Community method, the institutional triangle, mutual boundaries of responsibility."
"I would also like to make it quite clear that I have not given up on the matter: I have provided a careful analysis of the powers at work."
"I have therefore defined not only the major role of the Commission but the roles of all the institutions and I have also stressed - and I reiterate this once again because it is even more important - the need to mobilise the people and their consciences."
"The document on the forms of government which we have prepared and will present to you provides for this need, for it is a way of mobilising both institutions and consciences and it is an extremely important task."
"Then we will have to go to Nice and implement the programme which we have prepared."
"I repeat: we cannot be content with minimalist solutions."
"We fully support Mr Moscovici' s words: a minimalist Nice is unacceptable."
"After Nice, however, we are under an obligation to move resolutely on towards enlargement, establishing the timetable, defining benchmarking methods and setting goals, and in all this we must follow the Community method, which allows the peaceful coexistence of the different countries and different ways of thinking but also enables them to belong to our single European entity."
"We must work on closer cooperation and make it simpler and more effective in order to bring this about: closer cooperation is the immediate, simplest way forward if we are to take that additional step towards integration, the need for which has been confirmed by the many powerful speeches which I have heard today."
"I would like us to use closer cooperation to generate fresh potential for Europe."
"If this is what we all want, we must be ruthless in combating any trend towards the fragmentation of responsibilities or decision making."
"This does not mean that everything has to happen at once."
"I have been coherent and firm in my intentions but also realistic, outlining the stages of what can be achieved today and what must wait until tomorrow."
"In saying this, Mr Moscovici, I have no intention of giving the Community total control."
"I have a very strong sense of subsidiarity which is deeply rooted in my own life, and I shall respect it unfailingly."
"Even when I outlined the changes which are necessary, for the future of course, including the CFSP issue which you have mentioned this morning, I specified that change must take place within the framework of a specific Statute and described a way in which we might in time achieve this goal. I was certainly not for a moment advocating that we violate existing legislation."
"However, I also specified clearly that, as things stand at the moment, we can achieve extremely important objectives through the Community method as it is today, for example, to improve our action in the Balkans."
"I feel that it is a matter for our consciences to consider how great and yet how fragmented our undertaking is in the Balkans, and the sparsity of the results of the first stage of this undertaking at least, due to our fragmentation."
"Another example, as I have said, is the energy policy: how great is our desire and how great is the need for a common energy policy, especially now that, in place of the national oil companies, we have a genuine market which must be managed within the context of coordination of the market as a whole."
"I have given you some realistic, genuine examples and outlined a way forward, avoiding utopian aspirations."
"Everything I have said has been relevant and realistic."
"In recent months, the view that neither Parliament nor the Commission has democratic legitimacy has been voiced all too often. I say to you now that, from now on, I will not permit such talk ever, ever again."
"Parliament and the Commission have been far too patient in this regard: Parliament in that you are legitimately elected by the European people and the Commission in that we have dual legitimation, legitimation by the people through Parliament and the trust you place in us and legitimation by the Member States through the Council."
"These are the bases of our power and legitimacy."
"Thank you for your kind attention."
"I would just like to end, if I may, on a lighter note. I have been reading the sports pages recently, conscious that subsidiarity applies in full to sport."
"I certainly do not want to go overboard on this point, but I was pleased to note that in the Sydney Olympics, the first dope-free Olympics - I am informed - and therefore Olympics which we can define in the spirit of De Coubertin, the 15 countries of the Union won 239 medals and the United States of America only 97."
"If we were then to make a similar comparison between the 12 countries of the euro and the dollar area, the result would be an overwhelming victory."
"I would like to thank the athletes for their performance, which would appear to be a good omen for the future of us all."
"(Loud, sustained applause)"
"Thank you very much, Mr President of the Commission."

"Mr President, this report was postponed by this Parliament because human rights are being violated in Chechnya and international standards are not being adhered to, and in the knowledge - related to this - that a war is being waged against this people."
"Now this report has appeared on the agenda without there being a discussion on the human rights situation in Chechnya."
"This is astonishing because in September in the UN the subject of Chechnya was on the agenda and was not satisfactorily concluded."
"Last week in the Council of Europe there was a big discussion with the Russian delegation, the vote on the basis of a report by Lord Hewitt was not able to go ahead and the matter was postponed."
"Why is the European Parliament suddenly putting this subject on the agenda and acting as though nothing were amiss in Chechnya?"
"I move that this report be postponed."
"Mr President, the vote was actually postponed several months ago at my request."
"However, it was only the vote that was postponed, not the whole report."
"Neither was it referred back to committee."
"We only wanted to vote later."
"Why?"
"Because at that time the crisis was very acute."
"Now, however, we are seeing that President Putin is pursuing a policy of openness towards the West."
"We do not want researchers to suffer because of there being insufficient regard for human rights in Chechnya, and I would ask that we send out a signal here, a signal of openness towards Russia and openness towards cooperation."
"Only if we bind Russia to the West and to the European Union will we also be able to bring an influence to bear on its policies and remain in contact and in discussion with Russia."
"I would ask for the report to be adopted."

"Recommendation for second reading (A5-0230/2000) by Mr Knörr Borràs, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council regulation modifying the common principles of the European system of national and regional accounts in the Community (ESA 95) as concerns taxes and social contributions and amending Council Regulation (EC) 2223/1996 [8276/2/2000 - C5-0328/2000 - 1999/0200(COD)]"

"The Commission can partially accept Amendments Nos 5, 8 and 9."
"Amendments Nos 10, 11 and 15 are acceptable in principle."

"Motion for a resolution (B5-0767/00) by Mr Napolitano on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights"
". The draft regulations of the UN/ECE for approval of motor vehicle headlamps and other special equipment is only significant in terms of Parliament's participation in the drafting of Community legislation on harmonising motor vehicle standards throughout Europe."
"These standards are drawn up on the basis of the Revised Agreement of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN/ECE) of which the Community became a contracting party in March 1988."
"Consequently proposals are submitted to Parliament under the assent procedure, meaning that Parliament can no longer table amendments, as directives in this area were adopted as single market legislation under the codecision procedure on the basis of Art.100a TEC."
"However, this reduction of Parliament's influence is acceptable given the highly technical nature of the issues concerned and the Commission's endeavours to inform the EP in good time of plans to draw up new regulations via its competent Standing committees."
"I will vote to approve the draft regulation."
"Quisthoudt-Rowohl report (A5-0048/1999/REV 1)"
". Technical cooperation with Russia while the Chechen people are suffering a full-scale genocide is a cause of shame for the European Union at a time when this House has greeted the final version of the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"How can we ignore what is happening in Chechnya after the unanimous reaction against the killings of Palestinians?"
"Is this not a case of double standards?"
"I voted against this report."
"Not because I would object to scientific cooperation, but because of the explanatory statement."
"Mr Putin owes his election victory to the bloody war of extermination against the Chechen people."
"He is currently continuing this genocide and moreover he is also trying to completely eliminate the freedom of the media and the rule of law in Russia, which, as it is, barely exist."
". (IT) I abstained in the vote on the proposal for a Decision concluding the agreement between the European Community and the government of the Russian Federation because the proposal fails to deal with the extremely important area of cooperation over the removal of antipersonnel mines and the conversion of the firms which produce them."
"This is a particularly important point, also in view of past dealings between Russian and Italian firms, such as, for example, those directed by the former senator Claudio Regis, a well-known manufacturer of criminal devices such as these."
"A thorough, comprehensive agreement should have included a reference to this issue as well."
"Since this proposal does not, I have abstained in the vote."
"Knörr-Borràs recommendation for second reading (A5-0230/2000)"
"."
"(FR) National accounts are magical."
"With a few aggregates, GDP, GNP, consumption, income, capital formation, etc."
"They provide a small-scale model of the economic life of a country, making it possible to calculate tax pressures and the percentages of public deficit or indebtedness."
"This is to say that it is a major instrument in managing economic, budgetary and fiscal policy."
"It is the means by which the Maastricht criteria find application, and by which, above all, the European Community identifies the VAT own resource and especially its fourth resource based on GNP."
"It is, however, essential for the procedures for drawing up these national accounts, both in the transactions described and the institutional sectors summarised, to be identical from one country to the next."
"Otherwise, quite obviously, it is not possible to make a comparison."
"Hence the need for common principles for recording taxes and social contributions within the Fifteen. That, in a nutshell, is the subject of the Regulation being discussed here."
"It standardises the mechanisms of the integrated economic accounts within the European system of national and regional accounts."
"This European System of Integrated Economic Accounts, which dates back to 1970, was amended again in 1995."
"A great many problems arise."
"Should one assess revenue, for example, on the basis of the taxable event or on collection of the tax?"
"It is known that in France, for instance, the figure for tax receipts varies according to whether you use the statistics of the Direction générale de la comptabilité publique or those of the Comptabilité nationale."
"It is therefore all the easier to imagine the possible variation from one country to the next."
"Especially since it is in States' interest to 'cheat' and understate their basic taxable amount for VAT or the GNP levy."
"Indeed, the reports of the European Court of Auditors continually comment on understating of this type, from Greece to Portugal."
"In the case in point, the amendment of the 1996 Council Regulation before us, the Commission proposes to register taxes and contributions by taking account primarily of the revenue actually collected, rather than the tax calculated as due on the basis of the taxable event."
"The Commission also proposes to apply a coefficient to the 'non collectable' percentage in order to avoid understating the true level of deficit, compared with the Maastricht requirements."
"While it all seems purely to do with technical matters, there are nonetheless considerable political implications."
"Piecyk recommendation for second reading (A5-0232/2000)"
"Mr President, before I left for Strasbourg to come to this part-session, a pensioner from Cremona, a town in the Po Valley on the River Po, asked me to tell him when it would at last be possible to sail on the Po."
"In order to do something to meet the expectations of this pensioner, who is called Giuseppe Italia, lives in Cremona and would love to be able to sail on the Po, I voted for the Piecyk report, which concerns the expansion and development of sea and inland ports and intermodal terminals."
"I feel that it is extremely important for us to decide to develop inland shipping networks, for it would greatly reduce the intensity of heavy goods traffic travelling on roads and motorways and the damage it causes."
"Hatzidakis report (A5-0231/2000)"
"Mr President, I voted for this report, not just because of Mr Hatzidakis' remarkable abilities as Committee Chairman and expert on European Union transport regulations, but also because, as the representative of the Pensioners' Party in Italy, I am pleased to note that, by allowing 15-metre-long buses, which can hold 67 instead of 50 passengers, to travel on European roads, the cost of travelling would and will be reduced for elderly people who travel by coach, not just to come here to Strasbourg but also to travel anywhere in the European Union, in the manner which we already encourage but should do still more to promote."
"."
"(FR) We had nothing against the declared intention of this report to standardise disparate national legislation on the maximum legal length of passenger vehicles, quite the opposite."
"It must, however, be stressed that the proposed measures are not justified by passenger safety or the rational organisation of transport but by 'commercial reasons' , i.e. profits for road haulage undertakings."
"Standardisation would therefore be implemented by establishing the European legal length in line with the maximum provided for in the specific legislation."
"The European institutions contribute alongside the national States to promoting road transport over rail transport, yet this preference is damaging in ecological terms and wasteful in social terms."
"A policy which worked towards the rational, efficient and safe organisation of transport ought to prioritise investment in the European public rail service rather than confining itself to standardising the conditions of competition between road transporters, that are principally concerned with maximising their private profits."
"We did not, consequently, vote in favour of this report."
"."
"(FR) Our report discusses a proposal amending Council Directive 96/53/EC with a view to authorising buses with a length of 15 metres for circulation within the European Union."
"I welcome this proposal."
"Indeed, at the present time, the maximum legal length of passenger vehicles varies considerably from one European Union Member State to the next: in 7 countries (United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Spain, Italy, Portugal and Greece), the limit is 12 metres."
"In one country (Denmark), it is 13.7 metres."
"In two other countries (Sweden and Finland), it is 14.5 metres and in five other countries (with restricted use only in Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Austria, and unrestricted use in Belgium and Germany) it is 15 metres."
"This legal limit has not been explicitly harmonised at the European level, as it was not included in Directive 96/53/EC."
"To date, only 12-metre buses are authorised to circulate freely throughout all the territory of the Community."
"At the request of the Council of Ministers, the Commission has drawn up a proposal seeking to include passenger vehicles in Council Directive 96/53/EC in order to harmonise not only the length of rigid buses but also to create a clearer situation regarding removable attachments on buses and trailers."
"Even in countries where 15-metre buses are not allowed officially, in practice they are not refused or sent back at the border."
"In that sense one can say that this proposal formalises an existing situation."
"There are commercial reasons behind the extended length of buses."
"A 15-metre bus can take some 67 passengers, i.e. 16 more than a 12-metre bus."
"Obviously, some operators are driven to resort to longer buses by the imperatives of competition."
"It must, however, be pointed out that there is another way of increasing the number of seats per vehicle and that is to use double-decker buses and coaches."
"At the same time, introducing larger buses would make it possible to reduce the number of buses on the road, thereby reducing damage to the environment."
"In order to guarantee the safety of vulnerable road users and as far as possible to prevent problems relating to the existing road infrastructure, the proposal provides for limits, applicable to all buses, on admissible outswing when turning."
"Clearly, it will take time to implement such adaptations."
"That is why I think it wise to allow reasonable transitional periods that will enable the production facilities of the 15 Member States to adapt to the new criteria, thereby avoiding distortions of competition."
"In voting, therefore, I have attempted to reconcile respect for the environment, imperatives of completing the internal market, and to take account of the new restrictions placed on vehicle manufacturers."
"The result of the voting in this House makes the objective of the directive - which was recognised and supported by all the speakers and the Commission - unattainable."
"The rejection of Amendment No 3 means that, although the directive regulates maximum authorised lengths, it does not harmonise maximum authorised widths or heights for attachments such as skiboxes."
"Much more crucial, however, is the fact that the testing rules for cornering are not aligned with the current version of ECE Regulation 36.03 which has been used in practice since 1996."
"Instead the reference is Directive 97/27/EC which is based on an obsolete version of ECE Regulation 36.03 and is undergoing review within the Commission."
"This is tantamount to failing to adapt to technical and scientific progress, and it means that an old testing method which is not fit to be used in practice will have to be applied."
"This will make it impossible to authorise the rigid 15-metre buses!"
"I voted in favour of the report in the hope that Directive 96/53/EC will be immediately brought into line with the amended Directive 97/27/EC (once it is updated)."
"The statement made by the Commission representative following the debate, that he will be rejecting all the other amendments apart from one, left me rather shaken."
"For me it shows how superfluous a debate is if the Commission is not willing or able to reconsider its position or react to the debate."
"- (NL) Two buses or one articulated bus are more expensive than one long, rigid bus."
"I have seen these buses in the Finnish town of Tampere."
"The roads there are wide and as straight as an arrow."
"The buses can pose a risk to cyclists and pedestrians in low-traffic urban areas and on windy country roads."
"Moreover, without a compulsory second rear axle, they can destroy roads on soft soil, such as the Dutch peat polders."
"It is therefore entirely justifiable that a number of EU Member States only permit buses up to 12 metres."
"If these countries are forced to allow 15-metre buses, they will need to install extra road signs everywhere around the country."
"These buses may have access to that country, but in practice, they will be unable to reach many places."
"According to those in favour, such buses are not only cheaper and internationally deployable, they are also more environmentally-friendly because they use less fuel per passenger."
"This is why my group did not oppose the proposal initially within the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism."
"It now transpires that these proposals are mainly a cost-saving exercise, at the expense of safety."
"That is the main reason why I intend to reject the proposals."
"Skinner report (A5-0235/2000)"
"Mr President, I believe - and this also emerged clearly from the way in which people voted - that this is primarily about the fact that having losses recognised for tax purposes is a fundamental prerequisite, especially for small companies, because they risk a great deal of private capital."
"To risk personal capital, in particular, is a highly precarious business."
"That is why a facility to carry forward losses and enter them in the accounts would have a significant impact."
"Mr President, I voted for the Skinner report, as I explained during the debate before the vote, because I feel that risk capital is important."
"However, I would like to describe it as hope capital: it does not seem appropriate to describe as risk capital a financial initiative which is intended to improve the fate of pensioners and elderly people by making their pensions more secure."
"Let us call it hope capital instead, as I proposed to Mrs Kauppi, who agreed with me."
"I hope that, in the future, we will also be able to change the name of this financial initiative for the investment of pension funds intended to benefit not only the elderly, but also small and medium-sized enterprises as well."
". I welcome this excellent report from my colleague Mr Skinner."
"At Lisbon the Special European Council stated that ""efficient risk capital markets play a major role in innovative high growth SMEs and the creation of new and sustainable jobs""."
"The Heads of State and Government therefore agreed a number of measures to promote the development of risk capital in the European Union, with a deadline for implementing the Risk Capital Action Plan of 2003."
"The Commission Communication is an acknowledgement that concrete measures need to be taken to create a genuinely European and highly liquid risk capital market in the EU."
"The report supports the Council's and Commission's approach and emphasises that a number of regulatory measures need to be introduced, namely on pensions, cross-border prospectuses and a Community patent."
"He also calls for benchmarking to spread best practice across the EU."
". (NL) This proposal puts economic growth above equality for all."
"America is taken as a case in point, worshipping as it does at the shrine of venture capital and profits."
"It pins its hope on the model-function of multinationals in the fields of biotechnology and health care."
"Opting for direct government aid when acquiring risk-bearing starting capital for innovative companies means that this aid must mainly be funded by those paying taxes and pension premiums."
"This proposal sees companies first and foremost as benefactors, which have the welfare of society as a whole in mind and must be remunerated for it accordingly."
"In reality, they often have more in common with gamblers who hope to tap into goldmines."
"It is only natural then that they should carry the entrepreneurial risk themselves, rather than passing some of it on to the community."
"My colleague Mrs Armonie Bordes cuttingly pointed out yesterday that only a minority benefit from deploying community capital and pension premiums for entrepreneurial risks."
"Those on the lowest incomes suffer the most."
"As I see it, that is a good reason not to vote in favour of the agreement."
"Resolution ""Charter on Fundamental Rights"" (B5-0767/2000)"
"Mr President, on behalf of my group I want to state that the implementation of a new EU Charter of Fundamental Rights will certainly raise the status and visibility of human rights in the European Union."
"It is stated in Article 6 of the Treaty of Amsterdam that fundamental rights exist within the Union and must be respected."
"Citizens from the candidate countries in central and eastern Europe can also draw inspiration from such a charter."
"However, we should recall that the European Convention on Human Rights, which all Member States have signed and adopted in their national law, has now been operating for nearly 50 years and works hand in hand with the UN Declaration on Human Rights."
"The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg adjudicates on possible human right infringements in signatory countries."
"The European Convention on Human Rights has been a proven success."
"The citizens from Member States of the countries of the ECHR have confidence in this convention and jurisprudence has built up around it."
"Our primary concern with regard to the Charter of Fundamental Rights is that it must not conflict with the European Convention."
"This in itself would lead to greater legal uncertainty, which would be highly unwelcome."
"The division lines must be drawn between the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg and the Court of Justice in Luxembourg."
"The most difficult problem facing this new charter is not its actual content but whether it has legal status."
"A binding and all-embracing charter with completely legally enforceable rights could result in difficulties at a later stage."
"Certainly in Ireland constitutional amendments would be necessary if elements of the draft charter were to be legally enforceable."
"Referenda might also be needed in other Member States."
"This could lead to further uncertainty and failure to ratify at Member State level."
"We did not vote against this resolution because we did not want our votes to be confused with those of the extreme right, which objects to a number of fundamental rights even being affirmed or opposable to the sovereignty of States."
"We have absolutely no intention, however, of endorsing the Charter itself, as it is still vague on such basic human rights as the right to employment, a decent wage or accommodation, rights which affect the majority of the population, and is also vague regarding the social protection and freedom of movement and residence of third country nationals."
"It is quite specific, on the other hand, regarding the right to property and freedom to conduct a business, affecting primarily the capital-owning minority, the right to exercise this and to abuse it."
"The recognition of freedoms and human rights is nothing more than a recommendation of principle without being legally binding, i.e. without being made obligatory for the Member States."
"The European institutions are, however, quite capable of making binding decisions, such as, for example, the authorisation of night working for women, when such decisions are harmful or when they lead to pointless hassle."
"This is not, however, the case for basic rights such as the right of all employees to strike or join unions."
"The Charter will, consequently, be used more to enshrine the current practices, including the reactionary practices, of the national States than to represent genuine progress."
"Mr President, I, too, welcome this Charter, particularly the improvements made towards the end in adding ""social"" and ""the rights to the elderly"" to the Charter."
"It is important that the Charter addresses three audiences."
"Firstly, it addresses our citizens and tells them that this is not a Europe that simply does things to them but does things for them and respects their rights in carrying out its activities."
"Secondly, it sends a message to the applicant states saying that what they are joining is a community of values."
"That is an important message, given the history of some of the countries that wish to join us."
"Thirdly, it sends a message to the institutions of the European Union, that in carrying out their existing functions which will not change as a result of this Charter, they have a wider range of obligations to take into account."
"It makes clear the duties they have to respect in exercising their existing powers."
"I hope that the Heads of Government and the Heads of State meeting in Biarritz will take this seriously and consider making it a binding document but if not, at the very least, ensure at Nice that it becomes a declaration annexed to the Treaty of the European Union."
"Mr President, I voted in favour of this Charter, not least because of the influence which our colleague, Ingo Friedrich, and Professor Herzog have exerted on its content."
"I would thank both of them for their magnificent efforts."
"Of course there are some things which I have to fault."
"There is no reference to God in the preamble, no clear definition of marriage and the family, no rejection of all forms of human cloning and no rights on native countries or ethnic groups."
"But it has to be said that this Charter is a step in the right direction."
"The achievement of the colleagues whom I named just now and others has been outstanding here."
"Hence our ""yes"" in the hope that this is only a first step and that improvements can be made in the next few years."
"Mr President, I abstained from the vote on the resolution on the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union because I consider that this Charter is still extremely unsatisfactory, despite some progress."
"In particular I deplore the fact that in the Charter, social rights are emphasised less strongly than economic rights."
"Since I find this Charter generally unsatisfactory, I am opposed to its being incorporated into the Treaties."
"We must not elevate an unsatisfactory Charter to a higher level."
"Mr President, at last we have a Charter of the rights of the European citizen with an entire article - Article 25 - dedicated to the elderly."
"If, as I hope, this article becomes part of the Treaty of Nice, the elderly will at last be protected by a constitutional Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"I know that many of the representatives of the Committee which prepared the Charter contributed to this success."
"I would like, in particular, to thank Mrs Van den Burg, a Dutch Social Democrat who, together with others, worked particularly hard on Article 25."
"I will always welcome and applaud support for pensioners and the elderly, from whatever quarter it comes."
"- (DA) The Swedish and Danish Social Democrats have today voted against the request to the European Council to arrange for the Charter of Fundamental Rights to be incorporated into the Treaty at its summit in Nice in December."
"We have made it known in previous votes that we do not want this to happen, mainly because we do not want to see more topics on the agenda at the Nice Summit than is compatible with preparing the Union for enlargement."
"We are pleased to note that the Convention has succeeded in producing a draft Charter."
"Basic human rights are one of the foundations of the EU."
"It is therefore absolutely crucial that there should be a dialogue with the people of Europe about these basic issues."
"We believe that, as a political document, the Charter is a good point of departure for this wholly necessary dialogue, which is now about to begin."
"We do not, however, believe that the latter can be concluded in Nice in less than three months, for which reason alone we cannot vote in favour of incorporating the Charter into the Treaty at the Nice Summit."
". (FR) Scarcely has the 'body' entrusted by the Cologne Council with the task of drafting the Charter of Fundamental Rights completed its work than all the federalists, particularly in this House, go into collective raptures about the results."
"The content of this document, they say, represents a fundamental step forward for the protection of citizens' rights in Europe, to the extent that the matter should be referred to the Intergovernmental Conference and the Nice Council should decide to enshrine it in the Treaties."
"As to the form of the procedure, the same parties find extraordinary virtues in the working methods of the body, which included representatives of the European Parliament, the national governments, the national parliaments and the Commission, to the extent that they request the same set-up be used, after Nice, to draft a future European Constitution."
"As a member of the European Parliament delegation to this body, having worked, together with my fellow members, on the matter for eight months, I must say that the Charter of Fundamental Rights could well, in fact, have represented an added value for Europe but that, as things stand at present, we can derive no satisfaction from either its content or the working methods which governed its drafting."
"As I stated in the proposal I submitted to the Praesidium of the body, from the start of the work, peoples' rights are already adequately protected in Europe, both by the national legal systems and by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, which is an extension of these."
"We have no need of an extra instrument, intended primarily to strengthen the supranational authority of the Community institutions."
"What I would suggest we do need is a Charter of the Rights of Nations reminding us of the citizens' primordial allegiance to the democratic will expressed in the national context and affirming that the European Union is an association of nations."
"A text of this type would be extremely useful, not just in re-establishing the true meaning of democracy, but also in making the institutions ready for the future enlarged Europe."
"This is not, however, remotely the route that the Convention took."
"There has been a fundamental contradiction in the draft since work commenced, a contradiction which it has never been possible to eliminate."
"On the one hand it affirms that its provisions ""are addressed to the institutions and bodies of the Union"" , but on the other hand many articles mention purely national competencies which have nothing to do with those of the European Union."
"The real scope of application does not tally with the declared intentions, fostering some formidable ambiguity regarding the nature of the Charter."
"This text may initially seem benign, since it basically reiterates existing rights, but if it were to be incorporated into the treaty and to be made binding, as the European Parliament is urging, it would automatically tend to standardise national legal systems in Europe; it would give the Court of Justice disproportionate power; it would promote increased centralisation around the European institutions; it would restrict every nation' s margin for autonomous decision making."
"It would thus impel us towards a standardised Europe, the like of which most political leaders claim they reject."
"Even on the hypothesis that this draft gives rise to nothing more than a simple political declaration, we cannot accept it as it stands."
"We cannot conceive of a political declaration at the European level which does not make any mention of the key role of the national democracies, the rights they enshrine, nor of the implications for European institutions."
"This questionable draft, deliberately biased in favour of federalism, is the product of a poor working method which promoted confusion at every level."
"There is no doubt but that the body entrusted with drafting the Charter was made up in an original manner, but, from a legal standpoint it did not represent anything more than a Council working group."
"Yet, from the outset, it dubbed itself the ""Convention"" , in spite of my protests, and subsequently continued to act as if it were a sovereign body, ranking higher than the institutions which had appointed it, and even nations."
"It went on to operate according to a so-called 'consensus' method, i.e. without ever voting, even by way of indication, without ever being able to ascertain exactly who was for or against a particular provision, and without it being clear who, in the event, had decided to adopt, reject or amend it."
"Finally, the hearings that were conducted were determined in an arbitrary fashion according to the candidates that were present (or invited to attend?), and it would be impossible to claim that they provided a true and accurate reflection of the societies of the Member States."
"The Convention was thus a muddled system, generating irresponsibility, and not particularly favourable to well-ordered democracy."
"The final adoption of the draft Charter intended for submission to the Council, on 2 October this year, represented a monumental work of ambiguity, since apparently a number of members agreed on condition that it was a political declaration, whereas others agreed on condition that it was a binding text, and they skirted around this critical divergence in the same way that they skirted around the existence of an opposition to which I myself belonged."
"The federalists so successfully took advantage of this confusion that it is not surprising to hear the European Parliament today requesting that, after Nice, another identical body be set up to draw up a European Constitution."
"My Group is opposed to the idea of a European Constitution, intended to override national sovereignty, but it is also opposed to setting up a system of negotiating as badly organised as that of the Convention on this subject or any other."
"."
"(FR) The Convention entrusted with the task of drafting the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union yesterday completed its work in Brussels at the end of a formal sitting which enabled all the delegations (European Parliament, Commission, national parliaments and government representatives) to express their approval."
"President Roman Herzog was therefore able to officially convey the final draft to the French Presidency in readiness for the Biarritz Summit."
"The European Parliament will give its opinion on this text at a later date by giving their formal assent."
"Today, the two oral questions addressed by the chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, Mr Napolitano, to the European Commission and the Council, give us an opportunity to discuss the legal status of this Charter and, above all, to restate our determination to make the Charter binding and to have it incorporated into a treaty."
"We already expressed this desire when we voted on the last resolution on this subject on 16 March 2000."
"We are well aware that there is a great deal of reluctance and that there is a great risk that we shall see a purely declaratory Charter adopted."
"To avoid such a pass, which would disappoint the legitimate expectations of the citizens of Europe, we had to look to an alternative solution."
"That is why I voted in favour of this resolution and supported the amendment tabled by the chairwoman of the French Socialist delegation, Pervenche Berès, urging the Biarritz Summit to ask the IGC to examine all the ways in which the Charter might be incorporated into the Treaty, as a preamble, protocol or a reference to the Charter enshrined in Article 6, which stipulates that the European Union is based on the principles of freedom, democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as on the notion of the rule of law."
"The latter formula would make it possible to make the text binding in nature while, for the moment, avoiding a debate on the constitutive character of the preamble option."
"That would be an interim solution which would make it possible to work towards a binding Charter in the long term."
"In terms of content, this Charter obviously does not go as far as I had hoped."
"Incidentally, a number of not insignificant victories are attributable to the European Socialists."
"I am thinking of the inclusion of such rights as the right to strike, the right to work, the implicit reference to European trade unions, the entitlement to housing allowance."
"Certainly, the content of this Charter must be improved."
"This is the reason why we must support the debate right up to the Nice Summit."
"In this respect, there is another amendment which seeks to specify that the Convention should continue to be the only body authorised to draft the Charter until it is definitively adopted (in order to put a stop to the urges on the part of this or that institution to amend it)."
"I shall conclude by emphasising that the Charter of Fundamental Rights must be seen as the central element in the process required to endow the European Union with a proper constitution, which, as far as I am concerned, is still a priority objective for the next three to four years."
"The CSU's Europe group welcomes the tabling of the final draft of the Charter of Fundamental Rights because it summarises and makes visible the fundamental rights which the public are entitled to in respect of the institutions and bodies of the EU."
"However, we can only agree to the Charter being incorporated into EU or Community law if the EU's powers are first clearly described and delimited."
"The Charter aims to provide comprehensive protection of people's fundamental rights and different sections go completely or partly beyond the jurisdiction of the EU."
"We reject the fundamental rights included in the Charter which are appropriate but which do not justify granting the EU corresponding powers or conferring on it a duty to protect or act."
"The CSU's Europe group supports the horizontal provision which makes it clear that no new powers are being established for the Community or the Union."
"In some parts of the Charter additional significant shortcomings are to be found, which ought to be remedied before the Charter is proclaimed:"
"· The Charter should not be overloaded with detailed rules; these should remain the preserve of subordinate law."
"· In the section on social rights no clear line is drawn to show when the rights are defensive rights or rights to participation or protection."
"· The statement on the provision of social care is the responsibility of the Member States."
"· We wish to see the inclusion of a right to a homeland and to protection from expulsion."
"- (SV) We believe that the EU ought to subscribe to the European Convention on Human Rights."
"It is naturally in order for the Heads of State and Government of the EU Member States, meeting at the Nice Summit, to make a political declaration on human rights."
"We have abstained from voting in the final vote on the resolution because paragraph 1 implies that the Charter is to be binding."
"Contrary to the majority of the European Parliament, since Helsinki I have been of the opinion that the Intergovernmental Conference would have more than enough to do resolving the issues left over in Amsterdam."
"Developments have shown that the various wishes expressed to extend the agenda of this Intergovernmental Conference are still whistling in the wind."
"There is no guarantee even that a solution will be able to be found to the three ""left overs"" plus the problem of closer cooperation."
"That is why the hope that the Charter of Fundamental Rights will have life breathed into it in Nice is a vain hope."
"This is a state of affairs which we liberals deeply regret."
"."
"(FR) A Convention, made up of 62 delegates from the governments of the fifteen Member States and members of European and national parliaments draws up a Charter of Fundamental Rights for over 380 million Europeans."
"This Charter lags some way behind the European Convention on Human Rights, and behind national conventions or treaties."
"It is an accurate reflection of the liberal Europe which is being built."
"On subjects as basic as women' s rights, immigrants' rights, the right to education, the right to accommodation, the right to employment or a decent wage, this Charter is often inadequate and occasionally retrogressive."
"Because social rights are fundamental rights for a Europe that respects democratic and social rights and freedoms, we champion the idea of another charter to protect workers, women, foreigners, those excluded from society, national minorities."
"This Charter should be drawn up by the social movement, not by an inner sanctum of elected representatives."
"Because we think that the process of European integration warrants a genuine democratic public debate, there can be no political construction of Europe without social rights or democracy."
"This is why I did not vote in favour of this draft Charter."
"I shall be voting for an alternative charter by participating in the demonstrations in Biarritz on 13 and 14 October and in Nice on 7 December 2000."
". (IT) We are aware that the process of institutionalising the Union also requires definition of the concept of European citizenship and the institution of common values such as freedom, governability and stability."
"We would like to believe that the Charter of Fundamental Rights is genuinely intended to strengthen the competences of the Union and not those of the Member States, as the Convention stated when starting its work."
"Yet we are somewhat perplexed by the combined effect which would be produced by the Charter having binding authority over the Community countries, as the European Parliament requested on 26 March of this year, and the as yet incomplete and inorganic content of even the last draft presented, despite the commendable amount of work put in."
"A striking example is workers' rights."
"A further area of confusion is the potential overlap of legal systems implemented by the supranational Courts: the European Communities' legal system and the human rights system, although the latter derives from a Convention which does not make sufficient provision for social and economic rights."
"In other words, we would not like the pursuance of a noble, if unsolicited goal to serve, in the medium-to-long term, not to consolidate and expand those rights which the national constitutional charters and practices fully guarantee at present, but to undermine them."
"Pending further clarification, we therefore abstain from the vote."
"."
"(FR) I voted against incorporating the version of the Charter of Fundamental Rights we have before us into the Treaties."
"I would indeed have like to have seen a moratorium on this Charter to enable work to continue on it, as a great many non-governmental organisations in the various countries of the European Union have proposed."
"On many points this Charter lags behind the advances made regarding rights and freedoms in France and in other European Union countries, and many international texts."
"It cannot serve as a basis for the establishment of a European constitution."
"Not only does it not include any new rights, particularly social rights, but it also lags behind in terms of the status and place of immigrants and workers as well as public and private freedoms in general."
"That concludes the vote."

", rapporteur. (DE) Mr President, I should like to point out that I see this morning's debate in the context of the European Union's ability to reform."
"I believe that it has become clear to all of us, following President Prodi's excellent speech, that the European Union's ability to reform and success in Nice are essential prerequisites for the European Union to move forward quickly."
"In my opinion, even today there are a number of Member States which have still not understood that this link exists, and that the slow progress in the Intergovernmental Conference might make it very difficult for us to bring about enlargement in the necessary time frame."
"We think that decisions need to be made in Nice on those issues which are necessary for enlargement, even if this means not addressing all those issues which remain to be resolved - and which it is desirable that we resolve - in connection with reforming the European Union."
"This report needs to be viewed in a similar light."
"In this report too, which I am presenting to you, there are a number of points which it is desirable that we in the European Union - but also the accession countries - address, but not all of them are conditions for accession to the European Union, because the conditions for accession to the European Union are clearly set out in the Copenhagen criteria."
"The European Parliament would nevertheless like to say that accession to the European Union is conditional upon the Copenhagen criteria being satisfied in full."
"There must be no political waiver for any country."
"It must be clear that all of these conditions have to be met."
"Furthermore, it must also be clear that democracy and the rule of law are in fact the condition for negotiating and that other conditions simply have to be satisfied in the course of the negotiations, and here we do of course realise that - in the interests of the accession applicants as well as in the interests of the European Union - we will have to agree transitional arrangements in a series of sectors, as we have always done with accessions."
"This does not amount to discrimination against anybody."
"I also think, however, that we should make it clear when we talk about the Copenhagen criteria that each individual country has to be assessed on the progress it has made."
"For this reason we should also make an official break with thinking in terms of groups."
"It is true that in Luxembourg and then in Helsinki countries were invited to hold bilateral negotiations."
"But for me the Luxembourg and Helsinki groups no longer exist; instead, each country has the opportunity - in accordance with the catch-up principle - of becoming a Member of the European Union very quickly, if it fulfils the requirements for membership of the European Union."
"That is why it is also wrong at the present time to mention the names of countries which look today as though they are in a position to fulfil the requirements, because for internal political reasons a country which is in a good position today might fall back again next year, or vice versa."
"For this reason, it must be clear that full satisfaction of the Copenhagen criteria is the only essential point."
"That is why I should like to propose to you that from next year we in Parliament no longer present a general report at all but only country reports, to make it clear that we wish to see the negotiations proceed at differentiated paces."
"An amendment is proposed by the Socialist Group to make it clear that the European Union will be capable of enlargement at the beginning of 2003."
"I think that this is a good proposal which should be supported, and an equally good proposal is that from the European People's Party stating that if possible the first countries should be able to participate in the European Parliament elections in 2004."
"I believe that if we take these two dates together then we are giving the people there something to aim for."
"I am convinced that some countries will be in a position to prepare themselves adequately within that time."
"When I consider that it is already eleven years since the revolution in central and eastern Europe then we must also give these people the prospect of the process of change bearing fruit at some point."
"We said: ""If you throw off the yoke of dictatorship then Europe's doors also stand open for you."""
"I think therefore that holding out the prospect of accession to the people is essential, so as to encourage these countries to develop the enduring strength to push through political and economic reforms of the necessary magnitude."
"Although we need to discuss and resolve the issues relating to internal reform within the European Union in Nice, we will certainly not be able to avoid discussing Europe's borders either."
"We are now negotiating with 12 countries."
"We should also make offers to all the other countries. To make it clear that full membership is not the only possible way of being linked to the European Union at the outset, we also need to offer other kinds of cooperation - comparable to the European Economic Area in the past - covering economic and security policy issues."
"We should make offers of this kind."
"A country such as Ukraine cannot become a Member of the European Union today and perhaps not in the future either, but this country is so tremendously important for European development that we need to make sure that there is something on offer for it, as well as for many other countries."
"What I mean to say is that full membership should not remain the only means available for cooperating with the European Union."
"We will only be able to achieve all the objectives which I have mentioned so far if politicians and the elite both in the applicant countries and in the European Union - and in this limited context I agree with you, Commissioner - finally advertise the fact that the enlargement of the European Union is actually of benefit to Europe itself too."
"The political, economic and security policy stability which the enlargement of the European Union will bring is something which I certainly do not need to mention."
"European unity of this kind puts us in a position to create a zone of stability with a foundation so solid that it would have been barely possible at any other time in history, and we see that our aid is creating development opportunities in the accession countries which are enabling us to fund the reform process."
"On the other hand - and people hardly dare to say this - in recent years our balance of trade surplus with the accession countries has been greater than the public aid which we have granted these countries."
"We are beneficiaries of the enlargement of the European Union and should not always frighten people by only talking about cost."
"For once we should try telling the truth!"
"(Applause) It is my privilege to be presenting this report on the tenth anniversary of German reunification."
"This German unity only became possible because trust had been built up through the unification of Europe."
"But I think that we also need to make it clear that we are now on the verge of seeing the unification of the whole of Europe."
"Because what we have called the European Union up until now only encompasses a small part of this continent."
"We have the opportunity to create a new order in which no one loses their identity and whose wealth is derived from the diversity of its people."
"We will also be able to fashion an order in which war between us becomes impossible, in which people are able to discover each other in their common humanity and in which we can combine our strengths to represent our interests in the world, that is to fight for our common cause as Europeans in the world."
"I hope that we have the inner strength to forget the trivialities and to achieve the overall objective."
"I would ask you to support this report."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, Presidents, Commissioner, rapporteurs, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, let me thank you for organising this debate on enlargement."
"I have two reasons for welcoming this opportunity."
"Firstly, because the enlargement of the European Union, as Mr Brok has just said, is not just another priority, not that I need to remind the Members of this House."
"It is the backcloth and the goal of all the activity of today' s European Union, a political goal that conditions all our work, beginning, of course, with the work of reforming the institutions."
"I would agree with you in not wishing to separate this morning' s debate from this afternoon' s."
"In this respect, I wish to congratulate the European Parliament on the work accomplished in the reform of a report devoted to each of the twelve candidate countries which have entered into negotiations, and an overall report by Mr Brok, which I shall have the opportunity to comment on in further detail in my speech."
"I feel, then, that on the basis of the work undertaken by previous presidencies and by the Commission, the French Presidency will be in a position, or so I hope, at least, to offer a quite precise overview of the accession process at the European Council in Nice."
"I therefore propose, in order to make a useful contribution to this debate, to tell you quite specifically what the French Presidency is doing during these six months to achieve the results I have just mentioned."
"Our first guideline is that we must, of course, go as far as possible in the accession negotiations in order to draw up a report that is as accurate as possible, in Nice, country by country and chapter by chapter."
"With this in mind, let me firstly remind you that we plan to organise for each candidate country two negotiation meetings for alternate members and one at ministerial level, split into two phases, on 21 November and 5 December, back-to-back with the meetings of the General Affairs Council."
"The French Presidency will immediately inform the committee which you chair, Mr Brok, of the result of these negotiations, come Tuesday afternoon, according to the tradition that has developed between us."
"As you know, the Helsinki European Council stressed the principle of differentiation between candidate countries, and both the Presidency and I feel the Commission are truly working, hand in hand, on this matter as regards conducting the negotiations."
"I would like to emphasise in this House the complete convergence of our views with those of Commissioner Verheugen and I must congratulate him on the very high quality of his work at this point."
"This means, then, that each candidacy must be assessed and shall be assessed, in short, on its own merits."
"That is the wording adopted."
"I shall not, of course, go into the details of each of these negotiations."
"I shall perhaps leave that to the debate on the twelve reports which is to follow."
"I do, nonetheless, wish to outline in a few words the extent of the work undertaken along with those who, for ease of reference - though, like you, I thing this must come to an end, but using the terms 'Luxembourg Six' and 'Helsinki Six' does describe the timing of the events - I shall call the 'Luxembourg Six' , in inverted commas."
"With these six countries, all the chapters of the acquis communautaire bar one, the chapter on the institutions, have been opened, though some have been closed temporarily, between 12 and 16 depending on the country, and others are still being negotiated, between 13 and 18 depending on the country."
"I therefore feel that we are beginning to get a fairly clear picture of the problems that remain in each of these negotiations, both from the point of view of the candidate countries and from that of the European Union itself."
"I think these can be divided into three categories."
"Firstly there is the matter of adopting the acquis."
"What stage are the candidate countries at?"
"How in practical terms can we assess the commitments they are making as part of the negotiations and their ability to effectively transpose the acquis?"
"That is why, just like the European Parliament, the French Presidency wished to have access to the tracking schedules for monitoring adoption of the acquis, updated regularly, it being understood that the basic principle of the negotiations must continue to be the wholesale adoption of the acquis."
"Next there is the matter of the transitional periods. This is obviously related to the previous issue."
"As you know, the candidates have expressed a number of requests to this effect."
"This, moreover, is a sign that the accession negotiations have clearly entered a new phase and that henceforth, as the French Presidency wishes, we should go into substantive discussions."
"In this respect, I should like to point out that the Council has, on the basis of an initial document from the Commission, initiated a consultation process which should enable the European Union to make progress in the negotiations."
"Finally, of course, there are the negotiating positions, concerning the most difficult chapters of the acquis, taking particular account of their budgetary implications for the European Union."
"I am, of course, thinking of the common agricultural policy and the regional development policies."
"I have said, and I have no problem saying it again here today, that the French Presidency will not duck any of the problems that are raised. This does not, of course, mean that we shall have the time and resources to deal with each of them."
"As far as we are concerned, however, imparting a new dynamic to these negotiations means, particularly with regard to the issue of transitional periods, we shall do all we possibly can in order to make progress pragmatically."
"Next, let me say a few works on the 'Helsinki Six' , in inverted commas once again, who entered into negotiations at the beginning of this year."
"By the end of our Presidency, half of the chapters of the acquis will have been opened to negotiation."
"We in fact expect, in absolute agreement with Commissioner Verheugen, to enter into negotiations on 42 new chapters, i.e. between 4 and 9 according to country, just like the Portuguese Presidency before us."
"This should enable the best candidates to catch up the members of the Luxembourg group quite quickly and perhaps indeed, as early as next year."
"We know that this is a wish which some of you have expressed quite clearly in Parliament."
"Obviously the work carried out by each of the rapporteurs and by the parliamentary committees will serve a useful purpose in providing fuel for our own discussions."
"Let me now mention the second guideline along which the Presidency hopes the enlargement process will develop in these six months."
"I have just mentioned the very important technical work under way for three years now and I have also said that, with regard to at least some candidate countries, we shall very shortly have a quite precise overview of the remaining problems."
"We think the time has come to take this work to a more political level by combining all the information available to us."
"That is why we are organising a substantive ministerial debate, which will take place at the General Affairs Council on 20 November on the basis of the precise documents to be provided by the Commission concerning, in particular, the candidate countries' adoption of the acquis and the progress that each of them have made."
"Regarding the basis of this debate, the Presidency will have the necessary elements available to enable the Heads of State and Government in Nice to have a serious discussion regarding the continuation of the enlargement process."
"This too is the spirit in which the French Presidency has decided to organise two meetings of the European Conference, bringing together the 15 Member States and the 12 + 1 candidate countries - twelve that have already entered into negotiations and one candidate."
"One of these meetings will be at ministerial level, on 23 November this year, in Sochaux, and the other will involve the Heads of State and Government in Nice on 7 December."
"These meetings will be primarily an opportunity to inform the candidate countries of the state of progress in the reform of the institutions, which is of great interest to them as it concerns the European Union that they will be joining but also, of course, to initiate a political discussion with these countries regarding the operation of the enlarged European Union."
"It is not, of course, impossible that the candidate countries will seize this opportunity to once again bring up, as you said, Mr President - the subject of the dates for enlargement."
"This is, of course, a perfectly legitimate question, but it is one that must be answered quite properly and precisely."
"I should like to point out that, in a sense, this matter has already been settled, as the Helsinki European Council set the 1 January 2003 as the date when the European Union should be ready to accept the first new members, i.e. the ones that are the best prepared at that time, on condition, of course, that by that time a proper treaty has been signed in Nice and ratified by the national parliaments."
"This date of 1 January 2003 is by no means a random choice."
"I see no reason to go back on that decision either way."
"Personally, I remain convinced that, in the debate on the date of the first accessions, the European Union must avoid - with very great respect to the European Parliament - trying to make an impact so often."
"Everyone understands the value of giving the candidate countries a deadline, as an objective and a mobilising factor."
"The date of 1 January 2003, which is the only one on which the European Union has agreed, is, however, both for the candidates and for ourselves, an extremely ambitious objective and this is the deadline to which the Presidency will be working."
"Far be it from me and from each of us, I feel, to think that we will have completed all the negotiations in 2001, enabling the results to then be ratified in 2002."
"This is not the issue and, for a number of candidate countries, as we know, the negotiations will take a few more years yet."
"It is true, however, that the work which has been undertaken, and which we wish to boost, should make it possible, by the end of the year 2000, both to have a better appreciation of the overall balance in each of the negotiations and also, at least for the most advanced candidate countries, to clearly identify the problems to be resolved as a priority in order to bring these negotiations to a successful conclusion."
"What I therefore propose is to work towards this, bearing in mind that, with a view to 2003, we shall have to examine which candidates are ready to join us at that time."
"Finally, let me say a brief word on Turkey which, as far as the European Union is concerned, is now clearly part of the enlargement process and is the thirteenth candidate for accession."
"I am aware, furthermore, that Mr Morillon is currently drawing up a report on this country, and we await this with interest."
"We cannot but be pleased that, in Helsinki, a number of obstacles with regard to the recognition of this country' s candidacy were overcome."
"At the same time, we are well aware of the continuing obstacles to this accession, starting with the issues related to respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in this country."
"Admittedly there has been some progress, but they are still a long way from fulfilling the Copenhagen criteria."
"Once again, on this point too, in agreement with the Commission, the French Presidency will strive to achieve results in two areas: firstly in the adoption of an accession partnership, which is necessary both for Turkey and for the European Union, and then the implementation of the financial regulation which will enable the European Union to honour the commitments it has made to this country, and that we would like to see adopted by the end of the year."
"I share your view, Mr President: the European Union must not have a mean-spirited attitude or a narrow-minded mentality with regard to enlargement."
"Enlargement is a historic undertaking."
"Enlargement is a wide-ranging goal which we must approach with a great deal of generosity and with vision."
"Let us, however, at the same time be aware that the conditions for success must be laid down, both in relation to the candidate countries, in relation to public opinion, and in relation to what we all want, i.e. to maintain sound common policies."
"Enlargement is our future, on condition that the acquis communautaire and the common policies which we all value highly are not thereby weakened or watered down."
"That is why we must advance resolutely, declaring ourselves in favour of enlargement while establishing the conditions for it to succeed."
"I am quite ready, of course, to follow the very important debate we are all involved in here today."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, honourable members, I welcome the opportunity for an in-depth debate on progress in and prospects for negotiations on the enlargement of the European Union."
"I should like to thank the rapporteur of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, Mr Brok, for his clear, comprehensive report."
"My thanks also to all the other rapporteurs."
"Despite differences of detail, a common basic line is beginning to emerge."
"This debate offers a welcome opportunity to consolidate our resolve to enlarge."
"The development of Europe has entered a phase in which, now more than ever, we need clear objectives and decisive action."
"Our two major tasks, internal reform and external enlargement, are closely interconnected."
"Both tasks are indispensable per se but they need to be resolved together if they are to be resolved correctly."
"I should therefore like to establish straight away that the cornerstone which will allow the enlargement project to be completed is agreement on the institutional reforms of the EU."
"Unless they are reformed, our institutions will suffer a heart attack and will no longer be able to fulfil their purpose."
"A successful outcome to the Intergovernmental Conference in Nice in December will pave the way for more pro-active negotiations."
"But success does not depend on the time factor alone, however important it may be."
"A specific outcome is needed from the Intergovernmental Conference if we are to do justice to the tremendous pressure for adaptation."
"An unsatisfactory outcome or even failure in Nice would have fatal consequences in the candidate countries by playing into the hands of the eurosceptic movements in these countries."
"Populists will stand up and maintain that the EU has finally made it clear that, in truth, it does not want any new members."
"Action speaks louder than words when it comes to countering such arguments!"
"The present and largest enlargement round in the history of European unification is a morally-imperative, strategically-needed and politically-feasible move."
"This project has already made considerable progress and there is no turning back."
"There is no single case in the negotiations in which it is a question of ""if"" ; it is only a question of ""how"" and ""when"" ."
"Enlargement is the only answer to the two main historical changes which we have witnessed in our lifetime."
"It is perhaps a coincidence, and if so it is a happy coincidence, that this debate is being held on the 10th anniversary of the completion of German reunification."
"German reunification should also be seen as a part of and as a precursor to the wider objective of European enlargement; the events and developments which made German reunification possible also made it possible for us even to sit here today in this House and contemplate the admission of ten central and eastern European countries as members of the European Union."
"That is the reason why enlargement is the right response to the end of the Cold War and the break up of the Communist bloc."
"How are we supposed to explain to the people of Europe who only gained their freedom and self-determination in the last decade that the advantages of European integration are only available to those who happened to be on the ""right"" side of the iron curtain after 1945."
"We will not permit any new division of Europe."
"We do not want to replace ideological demarcation lines in the form of insurmountable frontiers with a new demarcation line, a demarcation line separating the haves from the have-nots in Europe."
"But that is not all that is at stake."
"We want to extend peace and stability to the whole of Europe."
"But not just any old stability."
"The Soviet empire gave the impression of being stable both to the outside world and internally for decades, but this stability had long been rotten and crumbling, precisely because it was not based on democracy, the rule of law, human rights and the protection of minorities."
"It is no coincidence; on the contrary, it is virtually a cast-iron rule that we only have peace and stability in Europe where these values have been put into practice and where Europe is already unified or is in the process of unifying."
"Peace and stability in Europe are the basis for a happy future for all the people of Europe."
"And if they do not apply throughout Europe, then they are in jeopardy throughout Europe."
"The second major change which we are witnessing and to which Europe must adjust is the meteoric speed at which the economy is moving towards a global market and global competition."
"This change offers us huge opportunities and the more we pool our strengths and interests, the better use we can make of them."
"An even bigger common market will make us stronger."
"Extending the euro zone will strengthen the euro."
"A larger community will have more weight when it comes to mastering global tasks."
"The enlargement of the European Union is not a post-dated cheque which has yet to prove that it can be cashed."
"The advantages are already there; they are visible and everyone stands to gain."
"I am firmly convinced that, without the prospect of European integration, the systems of central and eastern Europe would not have been changed as quickly or as successfully."
"When we see that the countries in the enlargement process have already stabilised their democratic systems in a short space of time, then that is their achievement."
"They alone have taken the courageous decision to shake off bureaucracy and a planned economy and create open societies, modern democracies and workable market economies."
"But they have also done so because the prospect of membership of the European Union gives them hope of solidarity with the people of Europe and because they are being offered a firm political and economic foothold."
"The advantages of political change can already be accurately anticipated from economic developments."
"The candidate countries of central and eastern Europe used to be on the fringe of the world economy."
"In the meantime, their foreign trade with the EU has risen to between 50 and 70%."
"We are achieving high foreign trade surpluses with all these countries."
"That translates into higher tax revenues, higher national insurance contributions and, most importantly, more jobs."
"The forecasts for growth in the area as a whole are extremely auspicious."
"Growth is expected to be well above the current EU average over the next ten years."
"These fast developing new markets create new supply and new demand; it is an all win situation for both sides right from the start."
"I do not think there is any particular need to stress at this point that these promising economic prospects are based solely on quantifiable and political stable framework conditions."
"The prospect of enlargement has resolved centuries-old conflicts, settled border problems and defused minority issues."
"These achievements deserve a positive response."
"I am certain that we all agree that these people, who have gone to so much trouble, should not be disappointed."
"I am therefore delighted to be able to tell you that the both the quality and speed of the enlargement process improved during the first year of the new Commission."
"The process has already acquired a momentum of its own and is now unstoppable."
"Allow me to recapitulate the principles which guide us and which are non-negotiable."
"First: we are preparing the new members for full membership with equal rights."
"Enlargement will not create an à la carte Europe or second-class citizens within the Union."
"New members must comply with all the conditions of accession."
"There will be no political discounts."
"Secondly: each country stands on its own merits in the enlargement process."
"No geographical or political groups are being formed."
"The terms Luxembourg group or Helsinki group are merely technical terms in order to differentiate between the countries invited to enter into negotiations in Luxembourg in 1997 and those which did not join until Helsinki in 1999."
"But that does not alter the fact that each country will only be ready for accession when it has made the necessary progress."
"Thirdly: we are abiding by the principle of differentiated negotiations."
"Chapters are opened and closed depending on the current state of preparations and actual progress in negotiations."
"Fourthly: this results in another principle whereby the countries which joined later have a fair chance of catching up with those that began earlier."
"I wish there to be no doubt about the fact that we cannot help them catch up by slowing down negotiations with those who are already further ahead."
"We can help countries catch up, but not by putting their neighbours on hold."
"The Commission will be presenting its progress report for the year 2000 and a new strategy paper on 8 November."
"Work is still under way."
"The reports for previous years set high standards which we want to maintain."
"These are reports, not report cards, and I too shall avoid any form of ranking of candidates in the future."
"The reports are intended to help candidate countries continue with the necessary reforms and rectify persistent shortcomings."
"They are also intended to help the EU institutions monitor their success and to act as a basis on which negotiating strategies can be further developed."
"Without wishing to anticipate the results, I can report on some of the trends in the new reports today."
"There has been progress on a wide front in securing the political criteria."
"I cannot see a risk of any one country descending into authoritarian structures."
"Neighbourly relations are developing well and quickly."
"Democratic basic values and rules are securely anchored."
"We shall, of course, continue to monitor potential risks and unresolved questions, which is why we are keeping a careful eye on the situation of national minorities and why we are working on concrete measures to overcome social discrimination, especially against the Roma people, in a whole series of countries."
"As far as the economic criteria are concerned, there has been clear progress here also."
"Nearly all the countries now qualify as market economies, even if the process of economic reform has not yet been fully completed."
"But that does not only apply to the candidate countries."
"A number of countries have made such good progress with the second economic criterion of their ability to compete in the single market that they are fast reaching the point at which they are ready for accession."
"As far as the third set of criteria is concerned, i.e. the ability to adopt and apply the whole acquis communautaire, a great deal still needs to be done."
"I am not criticising the fact that the public administration is often very weak and that the legal system does not yet offer the degree of legal security which we require in the Community."
"Obviously, changes in this area take longer than elsewhere."
"The work of creating institutions and structures is not yet finished."
"Above all, we need the right people."
"They need to be found, trained and, most importantly, the money must be there to pay them."
"High priority is already being given to these questions in the pre-accession strategy and we shall step this up."
"We need to be sure that the acquis communautaire is fully applied in practice, not just on paper."
"I should like to mention a problem in this respect which requires particular attention and is a matter of great concern to me."
"I refer to the widespread corruption in a not insignificant number of countries."
"Of course, I am aware of the specific social and economic causes of corruption."
"But there is also corruption in places in which there is no ready explanation in the form of pitiful levels of income."
"I do not hold with corruption as a sort of folkloric factor or as part of the cultural heritage."
"In modern societies and modern economies, corruption is a cancerous sore."
"The disease grows and spreads to what is still healthy tissue."
"Weak administrative structures, a lack of legal security and corruption are also negative location factors which deter foreign investors and hamper fast economic development."
"Obviously, the huge economic gulf between the Member States of the European Union and the candidate countries can only be closed if there is a constant flow of direct foreign investment to the candidate countries."
"The pace of the negotiating process itself increased considerably again last year."
"I should like to clear up a misunderstanding which sometimes creeps in when we talk of the pace of negotiations."
"The pace of negotiations cannot simply be extrapolated from the number of chapters dealt with."
"The content of the chapters in question is also a deciding factor."
"All outstanding chapters, with the exception of institutions and miscellaneous were opened with the countries in the Luxembourg group during the Portuguese Presidency: a total of 174."
"At least 84 chapters will have been opened with the countries in the Helsinki group by the end of the French Presidency, i.e. nearly half."
"I reckon that all outstanding chapters will also be opened with at least four countries in this group next year."
"We are now entering a new phase."
"Our intention now, during the French Presidency, is to start with negotiations in the stricter sense of the word, by which I mean decisions on applications, transitional periods and derogations."
"On 8 November, the Commission will present more detailed thoughts on the principles which should inform how we deal with derogations and how the corresponding decision-making process should be organised."
"I should like today to mention two sets of problems."
"Transitional periods, which affect how the internal market functions, and problems relating to comprehensive investment programmes."
"As far as the internal market is concerned, we must ensure that transitional periods are kept to a minimum in terms of both time and content."
"Where major, long-term investments are needed in order to attain EU standards, we must bear in mind that even the present members claimed long transitional periods in such cases."
"As regards the current situation in the monetary union, I should like to remind the House that monetary union forms part of the Treaty and, hence, part of the negotiations."
"All the candidate countries are keen to accede to monetary union and accession to monetary union is governed by special terms in the Maastricht Treaty."
"In other words, membership of the EU does not automatically lead to membership of the euro zone; on the contrary, the special criteria must be met."
"In any event, membership of the exchange rate mechanism comes first and requires a separate decision."
"It will not be long before we step up negotiations; as a result, we shall be concentrating on the outstanding - in some cases very complicated - issues: agriculture, the environment, regional policy, internal and legal policy and the budget, to name but a few."
"In preparation for this, the Commission is working on a new monitoring system which will allow us to assess the state of progress in negotiations and actual implementation in each country accurately at any given time."
"I should also like to say a few words on a subject which is very close to my heart: how best to sell the project ""Enlargement in the societies of the Member States and candidate countries"" to the public."
"That we have a communications problem can hardly be doubted, even if surveys do not convey a very accurate picture."
"The Commission has suggested a communication initiative in order to improve this situation."
"The legal and financial conditions for it are in place and we are in the process of deciding on the exact content."
"This initiative will basically be decentralised; i.e. it will be implemented in the Member States and in the candidate countries on the basis of their specific needs and circumstances."
"We are therefore looking to coordinate as closely as possible with the programmes of national governments, Parliament and other institutions."
"Because of limited financial resources, we are being forced to develop concepts addressed directly at opinion formers and multipliers."
"Buying media space is hardly an option."
"We must therefore count mainly on the involvement of all types of social groups and on the commitment of individuals."
"That instantly implies that the whole process needs to be democratised."
"Any communications strategy which fails to address what really moves people is doomed to failure."
"We must therefore identify what people associate with enlargement, what hopes and expectations and what concerns and dangers."
"Propaganda of any sort will not get us anywhere."
"We need political answers to political questions and we need to get them across properly."
"What sort of questions do I mean?"
"Will there be waves of immigrants and what impact will this have on job markets?"
"How will the competitive status quo between current and new Member States in border regions change?"
"Will there be environmental and social dumping?"
"What are the implications of open borders for the fight against crime and, finally, how will we pay for it all?"
"We have good answers for all these questions."
"Enlargement will reduce the number of immigrants."
"Problems which may arise in the early years can be controlled using intelligently-configured transitional periods."
"We must help border regions to make use of the new opportunities and meet the new challenges."
"The Commission is already working on the relevant proposals."
"There will be no environmental or social dumping because the new members will have to adopt our standards."
"Enlargement is good for the environment."
"Enlargement is also good for the level of social security in Europe."
"Border security and the fight against crime will also be governed by our standards and will benefit from European cooperation."
"Here too things will become better, not worse, as the result of enlargement."
"The costs of enlargement are set out in the current financial perspectives and will be reflected in the budget."
"No more can or will be disbursed than is allocated in the budget."
"Allow me to summarise the message to the citizens of Europe."
"Enlargement represents our only chance to change the course of European history and to secure peace, maintain stability and open up huge, new, once-in-a-lifetime opportunities for all the people of Europe."
"Enlargement is not a magical mystery tour."
"It will be prepared as thoroughly as is humanly possible."
"We would be embarking on a magical mystery tour if we were to abandon the project or postpone it indefinitely."
"We have a window of opportunity."
"It is open now."
"It will not stay open for ever."
"There are risks."
"No-one can avoid that."
"But that should not weaken our resolve."
"It would far riskier if we failed to do what needs to be done."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we are debating Mr Brok' s report on the progress made on the European Union' s enlargement process, an annually recurring theme."
"Based on sound analyses carried out by the European Commission, we measure the progress the candidate countries have made with regard to the preparations for the accession process."
"Every year - and this is shortly to happen again, on 8 November - each candidate country awaits with bated breath the judgement of the Commission with regard to the progress made."
"This process also bears the hallmarks of a technocratic process, where the political aspects can quite easily be overlooked in amongst the abundance of detail and criteria from the European Commission report."
"But as has been said, the discussion with the Commission today is business as usual."
"Today is also a very special day, because we are celebrating the tenth anniversary of Germany' s reunification."
"It is an important time to look back on a very special era in our history."
"As a Dutch person, born in a family which suffered badly from the effects of the Second World War, I am genuinely pleased that I can express my delight here today at Germany' s reunification."
"Helmut Kohl, together with the German parliament and German politicians, have made every effort to anchor Germany in the European Union, so that earlier fears expressed by neighbouring countries with regard to a reunited Germany having too much power, have fortunately proved unfounded."
"Let us not forget that it was civil movements in Central and Eastern Europe which brought about the fall of the Berlin Wall - I would particularly like to mention the Polish trade union Solidarnosc."
"The wish of the people to end the artificial division of Europe should remain a source of inspiration to us all in the enlargement process."
"Let us also recognise the huge progress we have made."
"Imagine how we would struggle to resolve the issue of Kosovo, Bosnia Herzegovina or our relations with Serbia in a state of cold war."
"Let us examine the trade flows between the European Union and the Central and Eastern European countries."
"Approximately 70% of exports from these countries goes to the European Union."
"The picture was quite different ten years ago!"
"A large number of Central and Eastern European countries now have much higher economic growth rates than the European Union itself, although these countries have experienced extreme lows and people have also paid the price."
"The Commission report is right in pointing out that all candidate countries have experienced major reform - and must do so in future."
"Let us therefore testify to the enormous efforts that these countries in Central and Eastern Europe have made."
"Nowhere in the world was there a manual to be found instructing us how such a process of change should come about."
"We have learnt a great deal from this exercise."
"Mistakes have been made and reform has not always been as forthcoming."
"I wonder whether we could have done a better job."
"I would like to extend heartfelt congratulations to Mr Brok and the rapporteurs who have contributed to this report."
"An essential part of the report is Paragraph 25 and the amendment which my group tabled in relation to it."
"My group has already said this morning that we want to tighten up the wording of Paragraph 25."
"The reason for this is that we have noticed that Central and Eastern European countries have made enormous efforts."
"We have also noticed that time and again EU representatives have raised the expectations - even up to parliament level of these candidate countries - as to when they can join the European Union."
"We were right in opting for the principle of differentiation, whereby each candidate country is assessed on its own merits."
"But at the same time we have set a process in motion whereby there is no longer any communication about when something will take place and this has removed any commitment to making an effort."
"This has a demotivating effect on public opinion in those countries."
"We are constantly saying that a great deal needs to be done at the IGC in Nice, that our own people have certain fears and that lengthy negotiations are still needed."
"Mr President, imagine you lived in a country such as this and you heard all of this and you were aware of all the efforts made."
"Would you feel at home?"
"Would you not then expect us to make an effort so that those countries can join the European Union at the earliest opportunity?"
"This is the message which the PPE-DE Group would like to put across."
"A commitment which emphatically stipulates that the European Union will be ready by 2003."
"We expect the first candidate countries to join before 2004 so that they can take part in the 2004 elections and they can participate as fully-fledged members in the new IGC round on the European constitution, for example."
"We would like other countries to join in the session after 2004 and negotiations with the candidate states in question to be completed more quickly."
"I would also like to call on the EU Member States to accelerate the ratification processes so as to shorten the whole procedure."
"And finally, I would welcome a debate on transitional periods in the European Union."
"I was pleased that Commissioner Verheugen raised this issue, because it can once again be interpreted as a new obstacle."
"We should start with a debate involving our own people."
"I was pleased that the Commissioner at long last started to dispel the aforementioned fears of the people."
"But this is where we need to make the effort."
"The hallmark of German reunification was that there were politicians who understood the Zeitgeist, who dared to act."
"Let this be a guiding example to us during the next two to three years."
"Mr President, President-in-Office, Commissioner, I am extremely pleased both with the tone of this debate today and with the level of consensus that is emerging among the key groups in the House, a consensus which my Group subscribes to."
"The challenge of reunification, even more perhaps than that of enlargement is so great that it suffuses and surrounds every debate in this House: this is why there is such depth and intensity to all our debates, including this morning's debate on our own need to prepare for this extraordinary challenge."
"To create a common space of freedom, security and of values by free choice is something without a parallel among democracies in all of our history."
"It is a matter of the utmost importance and yet has curiously attracted very little public attention."
"When we look at Eurobarometer statistics, we see that 60% or so of those who expressed a view say enlargement is not a priority, while only 27% say it is a priority."
"Moreover, the statistics are getting worse, not better."
"In the largest state of the Union, the Federal Republic of Germany, only 20% say enlargement is a priority."
"We as politicians must take possession of this debate and not simply leave it to the bureaucracies, for though it is indispensable to discuss the details of the acquis, this is not sufficient to engage the public."
"We need a dialogue of politicians and therefore we need to avail ourselves of all the information possibilities that Commissioner Verheugen spoke of in his very reflective and elegant speech today."
"We need, as Mr Hänsch has said, to provide ourselves with information about the cost of non-enlargement, not simply in terms of finance and budget, but of security as well as, of course, socio-economic measures."
"It was Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the American President, who once said that we have nothing to fear but fear itself."
"Much of our debate about fears about enlargement is based on exaggeration, but in order to confront the populists who exaggerate, we must connect with popular politics through reflection."
"We need the Commission's help here, because even though we have the will, we sometimes lack the ammunition."
"In respect of the principles involved, we of course support differentiation; of course, we support the principle of equality that there should not be a Europe of different classes of citizenship."
"My Group has 23 visiting MPs, our ""virtual MEPs"", sitting in the gallery now: I welcome all of you to this debate in the House."
"Finally, the critical thing now is to move to substantive negotiation, and we are making that important step."
"The critical thing is not to allow frustration to grow among the candidates - that they are always in the anteroom but never quite in the chamber."
"That is what we must accomplish in this debate, that is the result we must pursue."
"People joke that after the collapse of the Berlin Wall enlargement is always just five years away."
"We must show they are wrong."
"Let us take the first step in that direction during this mandate."
"Mr President, the purpose of today' s discussions, in the opinion of my group, must be that we restore faith in the idea that we are in earnest when it comes to enlargement."
"It is true that in talks with the countries involved in the first stage, which have lasted two years, we have not yet got around to dealing with the most difficult issues and we have not yet seriously managed to discuss agricultural policy, Structural Funds or issues of freedom of movement."
"Our job here today is to speed up the process whereby we can begin to discuss these issues."
"The process has to some extent lost credibility as a result of this sort of hesitancy and groping around in the dark."
"If we look at what is happening in our own Member States, we might say that quite often the remark is reiterated that, in fact, accession on the part of the new countries will only be by their own efforts."
"This should not be, however. We really must demand of ourselves, and the European Union too, significant changes as far as the Union is concerned."
"If we look at what is happening in the applicant countries we notice that they are not just awaiting membership enthusiastically."
"Let me mention Estonia, as an example."
"Estonia is a small country, which belonged to a sort of union."
"There they are very careful to point out they are unwilling to rejoin any sort of bureaucratic union."
"We also have to take this criticism seriously."
"Our group requires target dates to be set at the Nice summit or immediately afterwards, by which negotiations on membership should be concluded."
"This is vital for us, the European Union, in order for us to be able to set targets for ourselves with regard to completing our own internal reforms."
"Commissioner Verheugen mentioned corruption, but I would like to mention the fact that we cannot infect future Member States with bad administrative practice either."
"We must also take our own administrative reforms very seriously if we also wish to root out corruption in future Member States, as transparency and good administration are the best guarantee that there is no corruption."
"Secondly the target dates are necessary because we must boost the efforts of the applicant countries in their quest for membership."
"Our group believes that it is quite possible, if we are so determined, to include the first group of applicant countries already in the next European parliamentary elections, if there is determination on both sides to do so."
"Each country must obviously be appraised on its own merits individually."
"The next natural opportunity would be the European parliamentary elections that follow in 2009, but we would like to push for as many countries as possible joining in 2004."
"We support the Commission in its quest for a realistic, serious and honest debate on the political questions of enlargement."
"Commissioner Verheugen, you may rely on the support of our group when you say you want to find real political answers to real political questions."
"It is gratifying to hear your policy in this matter."
"Finally, I would like to speak about financing."
"Our group does not entirely believe that the present level of financing agreed in the financial framework is sufficient, and so we are prepared to discuss any amendment to the financial perspectives."
"One quite simple way to proceed would be - as funds have been set aside anyway for five new Member States after 2002, if they happen to join the Union - to use these funds in future for this support preceding membership."
"Above all we need commitment and that is what the European Parliament, for its part, must demonstrate in this debate and when taking decisions."
"Mr President, our Group, the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, shares many of the considerations and opinions on enlargement contained in Mr Brok' s report and we appreciate the enormous effort he has put into his courageous report."
"However, we disagree on some important issues."
"Our support for enlargement goes without saying."
"We are also in favour of a European Union that includes Russia, and which therefore includes all the countries which have built - albeit in conflicting ways - this historical, cultural, economic, social and political reality known as Europe."
"The only condition would be - in our view - that they share our democratic values and respect for human rights and the rule of law."
"Our disagreements with a portion of Mr Brok' s report range from points of detail to others of greater importance."
"We do not agree with Recital A where it says that Europe was divided by the Soviet occupation because, as everybody knows and as any history book will tell you, the division was a consequence of the Yalta Conference and the intransigence of Truman who was determined to follow a policy of confrontation."
"Furthermore, there are six basic aspects which worry us because of the method employed."
"Firstly, we are against the 'regatta principle' , which seems more like an entrance examination which every teacher puts their pupil through when it would have been better for the pupil to sit the exam in stages and to a previously established timetable, which would have aided the rapprochement of the two societies, thereby preventing the adverse consequences we are now seeing."
"Secondly, given the reality that the neo-liberal economic model established in Maastricht leads to the paradox of growth with more inequalities, the most likely outcome of the incorporation of these countries is greater unemployment and inequality, as is already happening."
"We should change our economic model in advance so that the cost of enlargement is not even more serious social inequality."
"Thirdly, the great differences between European agriculture and that of the majority of the candidate countries mean that the current common agricultural policy should have been improved in order to ensure both the viability of our agriculture and the successful completion of the agricultural reforms in those countries."
"Nevertheless, everything is moving in the opposite direction owing, amongst other things, to the World Trade Organisation, which complicates everything."
"Fourthly, and in relation to the use of FEDER funds, we believe that there should be more effort to show solidarity, and that is not happening, and the forecasts therefore seem to us be insufficient."
"Fifthly, we also feel that the budgetary forecasts are not sufficient, since this is the first time that a major enlargement is taking place with a budgetary reduction and we only have to look at what happened in the case of the reunification of Germany to see that, in fact, a greater economic contribution is needed in order for this process to be successful."
"Sixthly, we believe it has been a mistake to link enlargement in practice with the prior integration of these countries into NATO."
"This damages the Union, its future independence in relation to the United States and also a common European defence and security policy, since it also introduces risks with regard to Russia and other countries."
"We are therefore in favour of some aspects but not of others."
"We shall not be voting in favour of the Brok report, but certainly not because we are opposed to the idea of enlargement, which is, quite obviously, a historical inevitability, just as it is a geographical inevitability."
"Even the very name 'Europe' , by definition, includes all the nations from the Atlantic to the Urals, although this has apparently been forgotten by a tiny part of the continent, the most prosperous and, in many ways, the most arrogant part, which appropriated the name half a century ago."
"Our opposition to the Brok report is not an indication of ostracism of our partners in Eastern and Central Europe, or southern Europe, quite the contrary, it means that this report sets conditions which are absolutely intolerable, with regard to countries which have been European for centuries and of which we should not be making any other demand whatsoever except, perhaps, for the one condition that political pluralism be respected."
"We can understand there being political conditions, given a political undertaking such as European cooperation."
"We cannot, however, accept economic and social conditions especially as they are so stringent that they are continually pushing back the deadlines and consigning the States to upheavals that are ruinous for their economic and social structure, to the sole advantage, perhaps, of the German patron, who alone may be profiting from the current lack of organisation in Central Europe."
"To take just one example, the example of Poland, which moreover is particularly dear to us, it is, unfortunately, only too obvious that opening up frontiers too suddenly is likely to cause its agricultural structures to be ruined very quickly."
"One quarter of the jobs in Poland are provided by this sector."
"Last year the rural population increased by 5% in relation to the previous year, and if we wish to bring it in line with our model, then we are simply going to well and truly kill off what is still one of the best assets this country has, not to mention the social problems we shall be inflicting on a very large part of the population."
"On all these subjects, the Brok report confines itself to discussing adaptation and reform."
"In the final analysis, however, there are two possibilities, either we dictate a forced march rate of change and we disrupt most of the candidate countries, or we wait until the conditions set are fulfilled thanks to natural development, and that means postponing accession until the Greek calends."
"In actual fact, the thing we are rushing into is the very model of the construction of Europe, by which I mean to say the simultaneous integration of all sectors of activity whatever the traditions or special characteristics of the individual sectors, which once again has turned into a trap."
"Because we wished to do away with borders in just a few years, because we chose to disregard the differences between nations and their respective systems, we have arrived, once more, at a sort of all or nothing, a choice between two equally dreadful evils."
"Obviously, we should have chosen a political Europe, designed as a body for ongoing dialogue accompanied by a few à la carte cooperative agreements, as the programmes Eureka attempted previously."
"This would have been the option of a confederal Europe, which would have respected the frontiers of all parties, respected each nation' s rate and manner of development, and finally would have respected Europe as a whole."
"As far as the issue we are discussing today is concerned, this would have enabled us to welcome new countries as and when they applied to be candidates, as in NATO, moreover, for let us not delude ourselves, ladies and gentlemen, as far as we are concerned, the political battle is lost to the United States, who, by using the flexible method of political and military alliance, long ago ensured the enlargement of Europe, but to their advantage."
"It will be a long time before the matter of enlargement is settled, since it depends on our being able to backtrack on the ideological, and indeed rather puerile, concept of uniform integration, not to say the melding of all our nations into a compact whole that runs contrary to geographical and historical realities."
"That just shows you how pessimistic we are, for our part, so great is the blindness of the European institutions careering headlong along the most pernicious routes, and so great the blindness of the European Parliament which is incapable of issuing an opinion on the burning issues of the day, such as, for example, the unrest in Palestine, where a supposedly democratic State is murdering children in the streets on a daily basis."
"Instead, this Parliament is losing itself in wearying fancies at the expense of perpetual division."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament has done well to insert Mr Brok' s excellent report immediately after this morning' s debate on the Biarritz and Nice Summits."
"There is no point in pretending: this whole scenario described in such detail by Mr Brok and analysed point by point in the specific reports which we are going to hear conflicts with events in the field of negotiations, which are intended to ensure that the current European Union adapts its structures and institutions in preparation for the challenge of enlargement."
"In company with a large number of other Members, I greatly appreciated President Prodi' s declarations and I took note of Mr Moscovici' s words when, with diplomatic caution, he too warned us not to expect much in the way of results over the next two or three months."
"We hope that results will be achieved and that another Intergovernmental Conference will not have to be held in order to prepare adequately for enlargement."
"However, this factor indisputably pervades and conditions the whole of the rest of the architecture, all the prospects for the future, this acquired right which the peoples and countries of Eastern and southern Europe now have to join the European Union."
"For the countries of Eastern Europe, I would say that it takes the form of a sort of compensation for all the years that they had to suffer a dictatorship, which, despite being established in Yalta, was still a dictatorship for very many years."
"I would now like to emphasise another point: I feel that a major factor is own resources, as has already been stated."
"The Brok report hints at this, although rather diffidently."
"However, it also notes the fact that we have a ceiling of 1.27%. We are well below this figure and the governments of our countries are reluctant to even approach it."
"Now, in the previous enlargement processes, particularly when Spain and Portugal joined the Union, we were in possession of a very powerful budgetary tool, for the Delors I and Delors II packages provided an impetus which made it possible for struggling economies to make up for lost time."
"This political will is currently absent, and I feel that that is the central factor to be stressed in the debate on enlargement."
"Mr President, there is no doubt that the EU' s top priority at the dawn of the 21st century is the major historic project of its eastward and partly southward enlargement."
"This debate aims to underline this."
"Unmistakably, the personal commitment of the rapporteurs of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and the productive exchange of ideas in those circles, point in the same direction."
"The key year for this undreamt-of opportunity of close political cooperation within the Ancient Occident is the 20the century' s miracle year of 1989."
"As a former journalist, I hold special memories of that year. The words ""We are back in Europe"" resounded on the streets of East Berlin, Prague and Bucharest."
"The way in which this almost universal feeling found expression in Central and Eastern Europe in the late 80s still merits our gratitude to this day."
"Ten years have now passed since the fall of the wall and the dismantling of the Iron Curtain."
"The enthusiasm for Europe in the East has made way for fairly harsh criticism."
"The reason is clear."
"The road to the European Union, towards accession, is too long for the candidates."
"Marek Belka, economic advisor to the Polish President expressed this growing impatience and displeasure in very direct terms, when he said that the European Union expects them to implement the necessary reform measures at break-neck speed, yet fails to give them a target date for accession to work towards."
"His sentiments have been echoed by the President of the Hungarian national bank, who claims that the European Union must give off the right signals."
"Otherwise, Eastern Europe' s suspicion that Europe does not really take the issue of enlargement seriously might well end in a dangerous disappointment with regard to the Brussels pledges - according to my Hungarian spokesperson."
"How can we do away with these Eastern European reservations about the European Union?"
"I propose we do this by adopting a dynamic twin-track policy."
"The EU should make the necessary institutional preparations at the earliest opportunity in readiness for a good number of new Member States, and present these countries at long last with a realistic accession strategy."
"As for this strategy, I have in mind a phased enlargement in relatively small rounds of genuinely suitable candidates, spread out over a period of fifteen years or so."
"In this way, the European Union would run less risk of pre-empting the Copenhagen criteria than would be the case if no fewer than ten candidate countries were to join simultaneously - an idea which has already been floated."
"Would this automatically remove in one fell swoop the considerable concerns which the EU Member States and the candidate countries have with regard to the enlargement process?"
"Of course not."
"This is why I particularly like Amendment No 40 tabled by Mrs Malmström to the Brok report."
"She is asking the European Commission to carry out a major study into the cost of non-enlargement, plus to indicate what the economic gains and losses would be in the long term if enlargement were to be turned down."
"In addition, Mrs Malmström is urging the European Commission to give the European citizens plenty of information, because they need to be kept informed at all times of the current enlargement process, which has the overarching goal of Europe' s reunification."
"Such a vulnerable position, or rather, such political accountability would certainly do Brussels credit. It would also be an example worthy of imitation for the negotiating partners of the European Union in the East."
"Then the course of enlargement would truly run smooth, with public opinion forming its crucial social basis."
"On a final note, Mr President, the gains and losses of the EU' s eastward enlargement should not be deciding factors."
"If we are going to value the postponed enlargement, the postponed liberation of the other part of our continent properly, and if we wish to draw lessons from both world wars in the previous century, then we will have to roll up our sleeves and start helping, and be prepared to make sacrifices."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Council and the Commission have asked for the floor once again."
"I allowed the groups' spokespersons to speak for longer than planned, without paying too much attention to the speaking time, due to the importance of the debate."
"I would therefore ask the Minister and the Commissioner to take account of this and adjust their speaking times accordingly."
"I shall be brief, as indeed I was earlier, since my first speech was three minutes under the allotted speaking time."
"I should like, in turn, to stress the concomitance between our debate here, which is indeed a fundamental debate, and the tenth anniversary of German reunification, as both subjects are obviously related."
"It was the fall of the Berlin Wall, this fantastic historic event, which created the conditions for enlargement and for European reunification and which, once again, gives perspective and meaning to this task which will go down in the history of our continent."
"I should like to congratulate Günther Verheugen on his excellent presentation, which was, as ever, clear, precise and clearly highlighted the key points and the problems to be overcome."
"Enlargement, as I have just said, is a historic process, a duty."
"It is henceforth inevitable, and we should not allow new divides to appear in today' s Europe, ten years after the fall of the Berlin Wall."
"To make matters clear, however, there can be no accession on the cheap."
"We must not, on the pretext that we are making history, fail to make proper preparations for enlargement, and that means that the candidate countries must fulfil the requisite conditions: adopt the acquis communautaire and be in a position to implement it."
"Admittedly this will require transitional periods, as there have already been when we previously undertook enlargement to include countries that are now full Members of the European Union."
"We must, however, be reasonable."
"Regarding the duration of these periods, there is no room for demagoguery."
"We are well aware that definitive transitional periods, if I may use the expression, do not establish conditions that are favourable for an enlargement that will, once, again be successful."
"Another key point, public opinion in the various countries must indeed be informed and this must be done in such a way that they accept this enlargement."
"In speaking of informing public opinion, I am thinking, of course, of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, since they need to promote this cause which is fundamental for them."
"We must be able to count on an extremely strong allegiance in these countries."
"I am, however, also thinking of public opinion within the European Union."
"Let us not close our eyes to the fact that there is a certain amount of reluctance within the European Union, and this is perhaps one of the reasons why you said, Mr Cox, that we do not talk enough about enlargement."
"Perhaps, suddenly, there are some parties that do not dare to talk about it."
"It is also possible that this reluctance exists because we do not talk about it enough. My own conclusion is that we should discuss it more, but also discuss it properly and better."
"It is very important, and therefore I am pleased that the Commission is working on an information campaign which Commissioner Verheugen wishes to make both extensive and decentralised."
"Without wishing to tell him what to do, I believe that, in order to be efficient, it must fall in line with the expectations of public opinion and take on board the practical matters of concern to public opinion: security, as we must live in a Europe which is an area of freedom, freedom of movement, but also of security for its inhabitants; employment and the fear of social dumping, which I do not share, but which we must combat by means of rational arguments; the environment, for it is clear that everything to do with the environment, particularly nuclear safety, is a real requirement for the citizens of Europe; financing and, finally, corruption."
"In this information campaign, we must fight exaggerated fears, but also solve problems as they arise."
"The matter of the allegiance of public opinion to the enlargement process was also highlighted by Mr Hänsch, and I think it lies at the very core of the debate."
"The European Union' s credibility is implicated in this."
"With this in mind, I understand the feeling of impatience that some of you have - the chairmen, Mr Hänsch, Mr Brok, and Mr Poettering - who would like the countries of Central and Eastern Europe to be able to take part in the next European Parliament elections in 2004."
"This contains a powerful idea, which is also a fine idea, namely that we shall not carry out enlargement in the face of opinion and that, effectively, the best way to carry out enlargement with the assent of opinion is by involving it in elections, since elections are the expression of democracy and the citizens' means of gaining access to the political system."
"Personally, in response to this demand, I would say, 'Why not?'"
"Why not, indeed, if it is at all possible?"
"And on the subject, let me again remind you, bearing in mind that this comment is not, as I think I said, intended to be technical or pessimistic or restrictive - that the European Union has set a date: 1 January 2003."
"It is up to the candidate countries to make the necessary efforts to achieve this, and it is up to us to assist them and also to make ourselves ready to accept them."
"Once again, however, let us not indulge in too much demagoguery, even if we can understand this impatience, let us be aware that it is not very likely that many countries that are currently candidates will be able to take part in the 2004 elections, even though we might like to see this."
"Let us adopt a positive and proactive line, but also one that is realistic."
"Mr Cox wanted us to get to the heart of some difficult matters."
"I can assure him that this is the wish of the French Presidency."
"Mrs Hautala put her finger on a very sensitive issue: she suggested that the financial perspectives be reviewed in order to speed up the enlargement process."
"I need not stress, in this House, the strength of this proposal, or also the fact that it is perhaps a little risky too, with the danger of encountering certain problems here and there."
"That being said, I think it was not a bad idea to ask the question."
"Once again, we can understand, as Mr Belder stated, our Hungarian, or Polish, or Czech friends asking us for signs."
"Without these, we shall be calling our credibility into question."
"However, and this will be my last word, as I want to get my point across clearly: I am no pessimist on the subject, I do not want to do things by halves, I want to see a strong option with regard to enlargement - in order to be credible, we must also be serious, we must make ourselves clearly understood, and we must also be able to gain the allegiance of the nations, the peoples of the candidate countries and also our own peoples."
"So we must not rush things."
"Several years ago in Copenhagen we defined the requisite criteria."
"We are currently conducting serious proactive negotiations alongside the Commission."
"Let us create the conditions for success, for it is important that this enlargement is not a flash in the pan, not just a symbolic decision that will go on to create problems."
"This enlargement must be a genuine reunification enabling tomorrow' s Europe to operate with thirty Members as well as it works with fifteen, and even, with reference to this morning' s debate, perhaps better than it works with fifteen."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should just like to say a few words about the sine qua non for the scenario which many here have called for."
"The first sine qua non, of course, is that we ourselves must be ready."
"This has been stipulated several times already in the Councils in Berlin, Cologne and Helsinki and will again be expressly confirmed in Nice."
"We will be ready as soon the institutional reforms have been decided and have taken effect."
"We have a final date for that."
"Our final date is 2002."
"This implies that we shall not be setting any more conditions."
"In other words, if the reform process, which I welcome, is to proceed and we already start setting our sights on a post-Nice agenda, perhaps another intergovernmental conference, then we cannot create a link of cause and effect between any such intergovernmental conference and enlargement by saying that its results must come in before the first wave of enlargement can take place."
"That is out of the question."
"It would have all the negative consequences which several speakers have evoked in connection with failure in Nice."
"And it would be on our part."
"The financial conditions have been in place since Berlin; we have a budget of EUR 80 billion for the entire project and I shall not be asking for more money for pre-accession aid, for example, because I am satisfied that we can duly and properly disburse the resources at our disposal."
"I do not want to allow any backlogs to build up here, as has happened in other areas of foreign aid over a number of years."
"For now, I see no need to discuss the financial perspectives in connection with enlargement."
"We are assuming that we can implement the project up to 2006 within the framework of the financial perspectives."
"As far as the other sine qua non are concerned, they are not within our powers of discretion or disposal."
"For the rest, the candidates alone set the pace of the process."
"None of you should be surprised if the negotiators, prime ministers, speakers and members of your national parliaments complain that it is all taking too long - apart from the fact that it is a favourite pastime in Europe - everything takes far too long with the Commission, I know all about that!"
"You must not forget that these people represent interests."
"I would be most surprised if they did not exert any pressure."
"That is what they are there for, to exert pressure."
"But it is always worth asking, when someone complains that it is all taking too long, if their country has in fact supplied all the information requested, if their country has in fact already passed all the laws needed in order to adopt the acquis, if their country has in fact created all the structures needed in order to apply the acquis."
"If you ask these questions, you will frequently find that the other person is somewhat embarrassed, because they are often forced to admit that there is still work to be done back home."
"I would advise great composure when faced with candidates pressing for deadlines."
"We stand by what we have said: we will be ready to welcome new members by 1 January 2003."
"That applies to anyone who is ready by then."
"We shall also help everyone to be ready by then."
"But the fact remains that, as things stand today, 3 October 2000, I cannot tell you when any single country in the accession process will be ready for accession."
"I cannot say that today of any one country."
"You may of course conclude from this that we should set a date nonetheless."
"The problem is that, if you set a date, there is a danger that the enthusiasm for reform in these countries will wane."
"Why do you think certain politicians in these countries are pressing so hard for an accession date set in political stone?"
"They are pressing so hard for a date because they want, if possible, to avoid tackling certain, extremely difficult reforms which they have yet to make."
"We need always to strike the right balance."
"If we do not set a date, we may cause disappointment; if we set too early a date, a certain complacency may creep in; in other words, we shall address the question of dates when the time is right, i.e. if we can say when a country is ready for accession and when it is not with a sufficient degree of certainty."
"Unfortunately, now is not the time."
"But, as I have already indicated, all the countries are approaching the point at which they will be ready for accession relatively quickly."
"I should like to refer briefly to two or three comments made during the debate."
"Mr Hänsch said - in addition to much with which I agreed - that the safety of nuclear power stations was an important issue."
"Agreed! But just to be sure that there is no misunderstanding between us: you said that these nuclear power stations must be shut down before accession takes place."
"That is news to me."
"The policy was to agree with these countries on when nuclear power stations would be shut down."
"That was the condition for starting negotiations."
"And that is what happened."
"I hope that these countries will not be refused accession until the agreed closing dates have been reached, because that would be pretty late in some cases."
"I assume this was just a slip of the tongue."
"I should like to make one other point: We did not - as Mr Marset Campos said - pressgang candidates into NATO at the same time."
"I raise this point because it is an extremely interesting point."
"In fact, as you will remember, NATO and the USA were most reticent to grant the wish of central and eastern European countries to join NATO."
"It took years for them to make up their mind."
"The pressure to join NATO, the idea of joining NATO did not originate in Washington, London or anywhere else; it arose quite clearly in Warsaw, Prague and Budapest."
"And I can tell you why; because these people wanted to be on the right side once and for all, i.e. securely anchored in the family of democratic nations."
"Which is also why they expressed their wish to join the European Union."
"The last point which I would like to make concerns agriculture."
"It was said during the debate that opening the borders would cause the immediate collapse of agriculture in certain countries, such as Poland."
"Allow me to point out that the opening of borders to agricultural and other products has already been extensively agreed in the Europe Agreements."
"We have already done this to the widest extent."
"As far as agricultural produce is concerned, we have concluded an agreement with Poland whereby as much agricultural produce as possible - in fact nearly 100% of Polish agricultural produce - has free access to the European market even before accession and vice versa: our products have free access to the Polish market."
"In other words liberalisation of the trade in agricultural products has already been agreed and the Poles are not worried that Polish agriculture will collapse as a result."
"The problems which beset Polish agriculture are structural and social policy problems and we shall need to address them most intensively in due course."
"I am delighted with the turn which this debate has taken so far; it shows me that we can count on a great deal of support from Parliament for principles which inform the way in which the negotiations are handled and for our resolve to start tackling outstanding problems quickly and resolutely."
"Mr President, I have just one brief clarification and question to put to the Commissioner, with whose presentation I personally agree."
"We can only define the accession scenario if we ourselves undertake to be ready by the end of 2002."
"According to the motion presented here, the EU institutions, the Member States and the candidate countries will all help to ensure that we are ready before the European elections in 2004. That is what the motion says."
"That is not defining a scenario, it is endeavouring to achieve it."
"Perhaps this wording would allow us to reach a common position so that we can make the necessary effort."
"Mr Brok, I have no problem whatsoever with this motion because it states quite clearly what our common policy is."
"We will be ready as of a certain date."
"We hope that everyone else will also be ready by that date."
"We shall help them to be ready by that date."
"It is just that, as things stand, I cannot guarantee that they will be ready."
"Thank you very much for that clarification, Commissioner."
"The various rapporteurs will now speak."
"Mrs Carlsson has the floor first."
"Mr President, today when I flew from Stockholm, in over Germany and then drove on down to historic Alsace, I could not help but feel grateful for this Europe of mine."
"I was born at a time when, and in a place where, there has been no direct reason for thinking of war and calamity."
"Before I was born, freedom and democracy had triumphed over oppression and the insanity of war, and a European Union was being formed."
"Today' s young people take peace for granted, and mistrust has been exchanged for reciprocity."
"There have been strains but, on the whole, peace and trade have established a closer association between people, now further consolidated by means of the currency union."
"Today, when we are celebrating the united Germany and discussing Parliament' s attitude to the enlargement process, it is important to have an historical perspective in order to be able to look a long way ahead and understand that today' s generation of politicians too have perhaps at least as important decisions to make in favour of freedom, peace and democracy."
"Few people believed that it was possible to reunify Germany."
"Everyone was surprised by the dynamism of that process, which was so skilfully handled by Chancellor Kohl."
"Without his strong support for peace, Europe would have looked different today."
"What began with individual people' s courage and longing for peace led to the odious Wall' s being torn down stone by stone."
"Approximately ten tears later, we therefore now have a responsibility to history to join together in completing the reunification of Europe and strengthening the integration process."
"It will totally change the EU."
"As I see it, there are, however, no other alternatives and nothing else is more to be desired."
"If today' s European Union does not succeed with further enlargement, it will not be living up to its own ideals."
"In that case, it will, in my view, have failed in its mission and purpose."
"I have been entrusted with the task of acting as rapporteur where Estonia is concerned."
"In Sweden, we stood Monday after Monday in a number of squares around the country in order to show support for our Baltic brethren during the liberation process."
"Our support and commitment continue - to a large extent, for our own sake."
"More powerful cooperation is needed when it comes to our common sea, the Baltic."
"We have a lot to gain from more trade and more interchange."
"The Baltic States are small coastal States bordering on a powerful neighbour."
"They possess a rich source of culture, diversity and potential which the united Europe cannot do without."
"Each one of the countries is to be judged on the basis of its own merits. They are not to be judged en masse or on the basis of some special geopolitical position they might occupy."
"It must be the results of the negotiations which count."
"Enlargement ought not to be postponed because of the need to keep to timetables."
"As may be seen from the report, I am enthusiastic about what a country can achieve in the course of ten years of reform work."
"I am impressed by the political consensus that exists and by the leadership exercised by Prime Minister Mart Laar."
"The EU has a lot to learn from Estonia' s free trade agreement, the route the country is taking towards the new economy and the work it is doing on integrating its Russian-speaking population."
"Obviously, the foundations of the EU must not be weakened and the candidate countries must comply with Community legislation."
"However, many politicians in the EU seem more concerned with developing the Union still further and with raising standards."
"There seems to be no let-up in the desire to devise detailed regulations."
"This creates new obstacles for the candidate countries."
"As I see it, the enlargement process ought not to be dragged out unnecessarily."
"It is now that we are in a position to secure common values and benefits."
"As a conservative, I am incredibly thrifty with taxpayers' money."
"Through increased cooperation in combating, above all, cross-border crime and environmental destruction, we can make enormous gains."
"The environment is the area which will constitute a stumbling block in the negotiations."
"As I see it, decades of mismanagement due to planned economies and the inherent irresponsibility of communism are not Estonia' s fault and should not be a reason for delaying membership."
"If it completes the negotiations effectively and purposefully, Estonia has a good chance of becoming one of the Union' s new Member States."
"I should like to express my gratitude for the good will with which my report was received by the committee."
"The only amendment which has already been tabled is covered in my report, but I am pleased that the Greens wish to emphasise the importance of treating citizens equally."
"Finally, substantial progress is important if energy and will are to be demonstrated in the negotiations."
"I am a little concerned about the way in which Parliament has handled this report on enlargement."
"Many of the amendments and the committee' s proposals in the Brok report go beyond the level of what is required in the EU at present and may be seen as new hurdles."
"All credit to the rapporteur, Mr Brok, draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, who has tried, albeit without success, to get some focus into the report."
"Parliament' s task is now to reduce, not increase, the obstacles to successful enlargement across all borders."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we consider the progress made by Latvia since independence to be a real success story."
"In 1991, Latvia was still a province of the Soviet Union; since then it has built up a basic democratic order and its own state, introduced a market economy and created new ownership rights, to mention just a few points."
"Imagine if such radical economic and social change had taken place in your own country in such a short space of time."
"Only then, I think, can you have any notion of what the people of Latvia have achieved over recent years."
"In this context, it would be positively humiliating if the European Union failed to get started on the reforms needed in order to be able to receive the central and eastern European countries, Malta and Cyprus; and those who continue to apply the brakes here are merely demonstrating that they are much less capable of reform than any of the candidate countries, especially little Latvia."
"They are simply not entitled to chide this Baltic country like a stupid schoolboy."
"We would also be belittling the achievement of the Latvian people if we postponed accession indefinitely after Nice."
"Negotiations with Latvia did not start until after the Helsinki summit."
"Nonetheless, it is, in my opinion, in a position to move forward to the first enlargement wave in the enlargement process."
"The critical comments and the proposals in my report for urgently needed progress in administrative and social reform are designed to bring Latvia quickly and successfully into the European Union."
"In the present circumstances, one thing is clear: the key to this is to be found in a transparent administration at all levels."
"This does not just mean a law for the civil service; it also means giving young civil servants opportunities and paying them a decent wage."
"The basis for this must be a clear code of conduct which excludes corruption and, hence, gives citizens confidence that there is a truly independent administration taking decisions for the general good."
"Any such administration must be in a position to adopt the acquis quickly, to develop a stakeholder society and to provide proof of efficient auditing of accounts."
"This would enable Latvia to obtain more European assistance."
"As you all know, I have been calling for pre-accession aid to be correlated more closely with the mechanisms of the European Structural Funds for a long time now."
"I still fail to understand why two yardsticks always seem to apply here."
"Whereas we take decentralised invitations to tender for granted in our development areas, ISPA projects are decided in Brussels."
"Whereas we, in the meantime, are required to prove that the social partners are involved and that regional or local authorities help to implement resources, this arrangement is still not applied in the candidate countries."
"How are the people there supposed to experience the people' s Europe in situ?"
"A communications strategy is not enough, however good it may be."
"It is still hot air, Mr Verheugen; the actual agencies responsible for the project have not even noticed it exists."
"It is not enough; the whole strategy needs to be geared more to the citizens."
"It is of paramount importance for the candidate countries to be more involved in the area of employment policy."
"The process of economic change and fast transition has not only brought successes; it has also resulted in social differences, increasing regional disparities and huge hidden unemployment, which is why these issues must take priority in the pre-accession strategy."
"I see an urgent need to focus more on structural measures here and not to postpone implementing freedom of movement as a response to unemployment in Latvia."
"It is our job to continue to support Latvia with the integration of the Russian population."
"We should also bear in mind that the burden which we have laid on Latvia, namely to build ramparts for the European Union, - that this hurdle cannot be supported by infringing the principles of human dignity, including the human right to asylum."
"That applies to both Latvia and the European Union."
"Mr President, Commissioner, my report on Lithuania' s application to join the European Union closes with the following sentence: It is still too early to establish a position on when and with whom Lithuania should accede, but efforts should be aimed at making possible a broad first enlargement wave in which Lithuania is included."
"Lithuania applied to join the Union on 8 December 1995."
"Accession negotiations commenced in February 2000."
"Lithuania' s target date for accession is 1 January 2004."
"The assessment of the political criteria for meeting accession requirements is - I hope all will agree - without question unreservedly positive."
"This month, on 8 October, Lithuania will be holding parliamentary elections."
"Whatever the outcome of these elections, we may safely assume that the main parties will lend their unwavering support to Lithuania' s accession to the European Union."
"Lithuania is on its way to joining the World Trade Organisation."
"Before I go on, a quick update: negotiations between Lithuania and the WTO were successfully concluded yesterday, meaning that Lithuania expects to join shortly following ratification."
"Today the Lithuanian economy is on the mend."
"There was negative fallout from the Russian economic crisis in 1998, due to the high level of trade with Russia, and the gross domestic product was still falling in 1998 and 1999."
"The macro-economic situation is now stabilising."
"Lithuania has considerable potential for long-term economic growth."
"The International Monetary Fund has forecast growth of 2.1% in the gross domestic product this year."
"There is a good chance of this, but particular efforts are still needed."
"Policy still needs to concentrate on creating the right conditions for innovation and modernisation in key sectors of the economy."
"The fact that the Lithuanian currency is still pegged to the dollar is also important here, because as the dollar rises, so too does the value of the litas against the euro."
"As a result, revenue from exports from Lithuania to the euro zone is down and, similarly, producers are of course facing stiffer competition on the domestic market from exporters in the euro zone."
"There are plans to peg the litas to the euro in the second half of 2001."
"As I said, despite a number of shortcomings and weaknesses, Lithuania has made good progress in the economic area and is only a short way away from a working market economic."
"As far as the Ignalina nuclear power station is concerned, there is no doubt that the two Chernobyl-type reactors need to be decommissioned."
"Lithuania voted an energy strategy through parliament at the end of 1999 and, in May of this year, the Seimas passed a law to decommission unit 1 in 2004."
"A decision on the decommissioning of unit 2 will then be taken in 2004."
"I am most grateful to Commissioner Verheugen for clarifying the question of the closure of nuclear power plants."
"It is an important point here too."
"Now to Kaliningrad."
"This issue requires a special effort and, in my view, cannot be dealt with purely as a problem on the fringe of the issue of the accession of Lithuania and Poland."
"In the widest sense, what is at stake here is cooperation between the European Union and the Russian Federation."
"The point at issue is whether Kaliningrad should be enclosed and cut off or included in the development prospects for the region."
"The multi-faceted problems and the dangers inherent in the social and economic crisis in the region will not be averted, let alone solved, by isolating it."
"Our motto in this case must be: stabilisation through cooperation."
"That is the only way of giving Kaliningrad a chance to improve its development potential."
"Lithuania is playing a positive role here."
"Lithuania and Russia recently presented proposals for joint projects in various areas under the NIDA initiative."
"The EU is being asked to adopt them in the Northern Dimension action plan."
"Ways of fostering good neighbourly relations need to be found in the interest of the region as a whole."
"And also in the interests of cooperation between the European Union and the Russian Federation."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Poland, the country for which I am rapporteur, is the largest and most important of the countries which are preparing to enter the European Union, but it is also, as we know, the most problematic, so much so that there have been rumours that it might be excluded from the first group, the group of countries which are to join the Union first."
"These rumours are groundless and I am pleased to be able to tell you and, most importantly, our Polish friends, that we met with the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Lamberto Dini, yesterday, and he categorically denied ever having heard such a possibility being voiced during international meetings."
"Poland will join the European Union when both it and the Union are ready, but it will certainly be part of the first group."
"Having said this, we must not deny that there are difficulties, and my report is in fact a summary of the progress made and the difficulties encountered along the road to accession."
"The Warsaw government and parliament have done their utmost in recent months to speed up the transposal of Community legislation."
"The Polish authorities have also recently carried out major reforms and, although the Commission' s last annual report on Poland' s progress towards accession was somewhat negative, I hope and trust - and in this I am reassured by Commissioner Vergheugen' s words just now - that the report which is published in a few weeks time will be more encouraging."
"Nevertheless, as I was saying, there is still a great deal to do in Poland in terms of administrative reform, industrial restructuring and, of course, comprehensive structural change right across the agricultural sector."
"Therefore, in order to overcome these obstacles, to resolve these issues, the Poles - like the citizens of the other candidate countries - need incentives."
"If, for example, we place a question mark over whether it will be possible for the citizens and workers of candidate countries to move freely across the European Union right from the word go, if we want to continue to deny the citizens of Eastern Europe recognition of that right which is one of the fundamental principles of the Union, then we are further diminishing support for the difficult reforms which must take place before they can join the Union."
"This brings us to another sore point: public support, both within and outside the European Union."
"Support from the public is poor and fades with the passage of time, as Pat Cox and many of the Members who spoke after him pointed out, so roll on the information campaign announced by the Commission, although I must say that the amount of funding allocated to this campaign did seem rather low."
"Despite the words of the Commissioner, who declared himself passionately in favour of enlargement, Brussels sometimes gives the impression that it is trying to slow down the process, and this is reflected in the attitude of the candidate countries whose citizens become despondent and confused."
"We must convince the citizens of both Europe in its present form and the Europe which is to come, the Europe of the future, the enlarged Europe, that the costs - which are heavy and onerous - are still less than the benefits which will come in the immediate future."
"Many of us feel that it would have been a good idea to specify the dates for accession in order to encourage the countries and give them a sense of our continuing support."
"In the past, specifying dates has served to speed up the integration process, but it was difficult to come to an agreement on this point and so we decided unanimously to refrain from discussing the dates in our individual reports but to give a - if the truth be told - rather vague indication in Mr Elmer Brok' s report."
"In Poland, there is talk, at least at official level, of 2003."
"Even if accession does not come about in 2003 it must take place as soon as possible, and we must make every effort to make it happen for we are in debt to those countries - the countries of Eastern Europe - which are as European as the countries of Western Europe and whose only crime, as the Commissioner himself pointed out, was to find themselves, through no fault of their own, on the wrong side of an artificial line across the middle of our continent."
"There are too many promises which we have made to Poland, the countries of Eastern Europe, the former Communist countries, and failed to keep."
"'Rid yourselves of Communism,' we said, 'and we will help you' ."
"They got rid of Communism and we did not help them."
"So we cannot be surprised if, faced with the increasing divide between rich and poor and the spread of crime, prostitution and drugs, an increasing proportion of the citizens of these countries have reached the point where they would prefer to revert to the old regime and live under a Communist dictatorship."
"Should this trend gather momentum, it would be clear confirmation that our policy for Eastern Europe has failed."
"Ladies and gentlemen, let us do our utmost to avoid this."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the subject of my report is the Czech Republic and its request to become a member of the European Union."
"Not only are the Czechs my immediate neighbours; as a citizen of Saxony, I sat in exactly the same boat as them, as it were, for decades."
"I should now like the Czechs to come back on board as soon as possible, this time in a boat which is solid and the course of which the Czechs can help plot."
"My good wishes apart, a report on the progress of the Czech Republic towards accession to the European Union must, of course, be as objective as possible."
"The objectivity of my report is certified by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy."
"Plus, the report has been enriched by contributions from my fellow members in all the groups, whom I thank."
"I was delighted that my report was adopted unanimously in committee on 14 September."
"The criticism levied by the European Commission in its regular report in 1999, was not enthusiastically received by the Czech Republic, but it understood that it was meant to be helpful."
"There has since been a push forward in the Czech Republic."
"There has been progress in the economic area."
"After a three-year recession, the economy has turned around. In central and eastern Europe, the Czech Republic has the second highest per capita income after Slovenia."
"As a result of clever fiscal policy, direct foreign investment topped EUR 5.45 billion last year."
"There were also positive developments in the privatisation of the banking system."
"As far as cause for criticism is concerned, as I state in my report, the European Parliament stresses the need to ensure a high standard of safety at nuclear facilities and to carry out the relevant environmental impact assessments."
"It also calls for the judiciary to be improved in order to address the problem of corruption, which the Commissioner has already discussed, and to achieve more secure rule of law."
"One problem specific to the Czech Republic, especially on the German-Czech border, is the problem of prostitution, especially child prostitution."
"This problem does not exist solely on the Czech side, it exists on both sides and it is therefore a problem which we must resolve jointly."
"There is still one point which crops up constantly when talk turns to the Czech Republic and that is the problem of the Roma."
"We acknowledged in committee that this problem is a complex social problem, including in the Czech Republic."
"Parliament supports the Czech Republic in continuing efforts to improve the standard of living of the Roma minority, but calls on the Czech Government to take further specific measures to integrate the Roma economically and socially."
"There is also a paragraph in my report dealing with the decrees of the Benes government."
"We are delighted that the Czech government is prepared to review the decrees dating from 1945 and 1946 in order to ascertain whether they run counter to the EU law in force and the Copenhagen criteria."
"I should like to state quite clearly at this point that this is not some sort of attempt to rewrite history on our part."
"There is no question of that."
"It is Today and, more importantly, Tomorrow, which are at stake."
"What is important to me - and my colleagues in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy supported me here - is that the Copenhagen criteria, which the Czechs have also acknowledged, should continue to apply and I should like the Czechs themselves to review their own legal system, if necessary page by page, in order to ascertain if there are any laws which are discriminatory."
"We should not interfere, especially we Germans!"
"After the fall of the Communist system a decade ago, the Czech Republic underwent radical change which the majority of the people wanted and supported, but which also demanded huge effort and endeavour on their part."
"Numerous weaknesses still present in this country are the legacy of decades of dictatorship."
"In this respect, politicians from the part of Europe for which a happier fate was in store after the Second World War would do well to be sparing with their criticism of countries like the Czech Republic."
"Mr President, country rapporteurs are sometimes accused of being unpaid ambassadors of their candidate state and of being blinded by their love."
"There is that risk and I am going to try to prove the opposite is true in the case of Slovakia."
"Rapporteurs who take their work seriously develop close contacts."
"This is how understanding and compassion grow."
"Slovakia is not an object but a country where people actually live, people who are ambitious yet extremely frustrated and who, in the language of meetings, are weighed down by a long and punishing agenda."
"I do not want to encumber this agenda any more, nor do I want to lighten it."
"A badly prepared Slovakia cannot become a member of the European Union."
"We are in the middle of the negotiating process."
"Slovakia belongs to the so-called Helsinki group and would naturally like to reach the premier division."
"This is where that country should have been classified all along, but relations with the European Union were strained under the previous government."
"We support the ambition of the current government."
"Slovakia has not been condemned to the second division and it is logical that it should like to join together with the Czech Republic."
"The Slovak Government is trying to carry out an overtaking manoeuvre."
"We will assess this based on our criteria."
"Slovakia does not really gain from political exemptions either."
"The requested reform is needed."
"Next year, Slovakia must seize its chance."
"Then we will have the really important negotiating chapters to deal with."
"My report, which is before us today, contains some points of criticism which can nearly all be lumped under the same title of implementation."
"Many aspects have been regulated well, and still are, at least on paper, but when it comes to translating them into practise, that is where the problems arise."
"In fact Slovakia is not alone in this."
"I would like to list a few issues in no particular order."
"Slovakia is the transit country for many criminal activities."
"Policing must be stepped up, also in tandem with the European Union, and more investments must be made to improve border control."
"The government has set up an anti-corruption programme which has my admiration and appreciation."
"I applaud it, but we are waiting for the assessments with concrete results."
"As Commissioner Verheugen said before, the fight against corruption is a key priority, because corruption undermines democracy and also deters foreign investors."
"The situation of the Roma people leaves a great deal to be desired. This has been mentioned more than once already today."
"More funds are needed to implement existing government proposals."
"Once again, the plan is there, but the implementation has not quite got off the ground."
"Moreover, Slovakia needs to hold an open debate on how people perceive the Roma people."
"A distinction must be drawn between judgment and prejudice; otherwise we will continue to have a lack of understanding, which will stand between them and us like an invisible wall."
"The Law on the Use of Minority Languages is a large step in the right direction but the technical implementation of this act has been inadequate."
"I am also critical of Slovakia' s capacity to govern and its organisation of financial control. This was, in fact, confirmed when we debated other countries."
"I would also call on Slovakia to set up an active regional policy because the socio-economic discrepancies within that country are still far too pronounced."
"Now for the good news, because this actually eclipses the bad news."
"Slovak democracy is developing at a steady pace, which has not always been the case."
"We have noticed a great deal of improvement in macro-economic terms."
"The Commission reports have so far been very positive."
"The level of improvement has even been such that Slovakia has been admitted to the exclusive club of the OESO, and I would like to extend my warmest congratulations to Slovakia on this achievement. I believe that this decision came into force last week."
"The privatisation of public companies, including banks, is on the agenda."
"The reform of the legal system, as requested, is in full swing and the agreements on the closure of the nuclear reactors are being respected."
"I would like to concur with Commissioner Verheugen in this respect."
"The acquis is also being implemented at a satisfying rate."
"Moreover, the government is constantly working on maintaining social consensus - this is in itself a different matter - an important point in most enlargement countries, because without social consensus, it will not be possible to implement the heavy reform programme, and as is apparent in Slovakia, this can also be done in a way which is successful because the support for EU membership is still very strong in Slovakia."
"What Slovakia must now do is to bite the bullet."
"The overtaking manoeuvre which I mentioned a moment ago can now be carried out."
"The problems I mentioned are not insurmountable."
"Over the past few years, Slovakia has developed a new dynamic which will enable the country to move towards the European Union quickly and effectively and to turn its accession into a success."
"On a final note, I would like to take the liberty of making one comment on Slovakia' s home affairs policy."
"We do not make a habit of interfering in home affairs, but there are proposals to call for early elections in Slovakia. There has even been a referendum to gauge whether people are in favour of this."
"It is, of course, up to the Slovaks to decide."
"I believe it would be harmful to Slovakia to organise elections at this point in time."
"It would once again delay the accession process, which has happened before under the Meciar administration."
"It would be wise, therefore, if the present administration were to try to complete the task in hand."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I feel that it would be right and proper to begin my intervention by referring to the fact that, today, 3 October, we are celebrating the first ten years of German reunification."
"This extraordinary event, symbolised by the fall of the Berlin wall which separated two blocks of countries and also divided one nation, to a certain extent represented a pioneering step in the process of European enlargement towards Central and Eastern Europe."
"Despite the difficulties, the contradictions and the social and economic disparities, which, as everyone knows, still exist between West and East Germany, the truth is that a project for a collective future of peace, freedom and development triumphed. This would probably not have been possible if the voices advocating caution and those that supported a particular kind of technical and bureaucratic rationalism had not been pushed into the background."
"The European Council, which met in Copenhagen following this reunification, decided to integrate into the European Union any associated States of Central and Eastern Europe that wished to join."
"The 1993 Copenhagen Council made it clear that the accession of the countries from Central and Eastern Europe would depend on their meeting the obligations that are part and parcel of membership of the Union."
"In other words, these States would have to fulfil a range of economic and political conditions that were considered to be essential prerequisites for their integration."
"On 30 March 1998, a negotiation process was finally opened with the first group of countries, including Hungary, the country which is the subject of the progress report now under discussion in the European Parliament."
"I think I can say that this report, which has been duly discussed and improved upon in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy where it received unanimous approval, describes and analyses extremely thoroughly the current stage of Hungary' s path towards accession, in its dual approach to the issue."
"Firstly, Parliament has used it as a tool to assess the periodic report drafted by the Commission in 1999 on Hungary' s progress. Secondly, the report serves as both an expression and the result of the vision that the rapporteur has been putting together on Hungary' s current situation."
"In this speech, I propose to highlight and discuss the six aspects of Hungary' s changing situation with a view to its accession to the European Union, which warrant specific mention."
"First of all, in terms of fulfilling the political criteria that were laid down in Copenhagen, Hungary' s situation is, by and large, satisfactory. We have seen a consolidation of the democracy which is strengthening the positive trends that have already been shown."
"The problems that do remain are not therefore related to the exercising or safeguarding of civil or political rights but involve fighting more effectively against some less positive aspects."
"In this context, the issue of integrating the ethnic gypsy minority into Hungarian society has been central to the discussions held in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy."
"In our opinion, efforts to abolish all discrimination against the Roma community must be based on a raft of positive measures which have, in part, been launched by the Hungarian Government as part of a medium-term action plan which is supported by the PHARE programme, particularly in the field of education and in specific programmes to improve employment and housing."
"These policies must lead to the free and unforced assimilation of individuals belonging to the gypsy community."
"This was the idea that we wished to convey in this part of the report and, therefore, we cannot fully agree with the wording of Recital c, which is the result of an amendment approved in committee and emphasises the fact that a situation of segregation still remains in children' s education, as does severe discrimination in various sectors of society, the economy and the public sector. This is not borne out by my own observation of the current situation."
"Secondly, it is worth raising the issue of Hungary' s economic situation, which has seen improved growth and made Hungary the economic leader in the region."
"Public finances have been cleaned up and we have seen a marked improvement in the balance of payments. The pattern of consumption has changed as a result of higher salaries, lower unemployment and a reduction in the rate of inflation."
"Thirdly, with regard to agriculture, which has a lower level of productivity than in the European Union, we need to ensure that the agricultural market is fully opened up to the capital that is necessary for land privatisation, for the modernisation of farms and marketing structures and for improving yields."
"The prohibition on non-Hungarian citizens buying farmland is, however, an obstacle to setting a fair price for this land."
"Fourthly, there is the topical issue of the fight against organised crime, specifically crime that has its roots in Russia."
"The high level of crime and the considerable implications of this type of crime are perhaps Hungary's most serious domestic issue, despite the fact that the Hungarian Parliament has already voted in favour of a raft of measures on money-laundering, on longer sentences for drug-trafficking and prostitution, on confiscating funds and on a witness-protection programme for informers."
"My fifth point, which concerns the adoption of the acquis communautaire, is that we must acknowledge the fact that Hungary is continuing to act in a balanced way."
"Finally, there is the issue of the environment and the problems of cross-border pollution resulting from Hungary' s geographical situation."
"The pollution that we have seen in the Danube and Tizsa rivers, caused by cyanide leaks in Romania, is a classic example of this situation."
"I would like to say a final word in order to voice the concerns of some of my colleagues in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy regarding Soviet-made nuclear reactors."
"This issue needs to be addressed seriously but within a broader framework that covers not just Hungary but also the other candidate countries that still operate this antiquated and relatively unsafe technology."
"I am therefore pleased to see that it has been addressed in Mr Brok' s general report on enlargement."
"It now only remains for me to ask my fellow Members to ensure that we have an enlightening debate and a vote which contributes, both in its outcome and in the way it is expressed, to a meeting between the old democracies of the West and the new Democracies of the East, for the sake, ultimately, of the European Union' s enlargement process."
"The rapporteur for Bulgaria, Mr Geoffrey Van Orden, has asked me to speak on his behalf since he has to attend the defence debate at the Conservative Party Conference in Bournemouth, England, today."
"Bulgaria has made great progress in her preparations for accession."
"The current resolution and report focus on certain of the more controversial issues, namely nuclear safety, border controls, the treatment of minorities and the question of corruption."
"Economic issues will be dealt with later."
"Bulgaria is anxious to join the European Union and NATO."
"It has already demonstrated its commitment to regional security and stability through practical and political action, as was evidenced during the Kosovo conflict when Bulgaria sided with NATO allies, possibly to the detriment of her own short term interest."
"The after-effects of the conflict, particularly the obstruction of the Danube, damaged the Bulgarian economy and it is only right that urgent assistance should be given by the international community."
"But Bulgaria has made a wider contribution to regional security through the mechanisms of the Stability Pact."
"Turning to another aspect of security, Bulgaria has also made great strides in tackling border control, with the ambitious target of bringing border policing up to Schengen standards by 2001."
"This has been achieved by a fundamental reorganisation of the border police, once a demotivated conscript force; it is now a professional volunteer service."
"Much of this has been carried out with assistance from the European Union."
"The security of Bulgaria's borders and the effectiveness and integrity of its policing is of vital interest to the Union, bearing in mind Bulgaria's situation on the main through-route into Western Europe from Asia Minor and the Middle East."
"Within its borders Bulgaria is addressing the problem of minorities."
"The Bulgarian Government has made efforts to overcome the problems of exclusion of the large Roma community, comprising roughly 4% of the population."
"Much more needs to be done."
"It will take time for the benefits of the fundamental changes in Bulgaria to be felt by the population as a whole."
"Meanwhile, in a more open society with greater opportunity, people need to be assured that those in power, whether in government or in administration, are exercising their authority for the benefit of the country as a whole."
"Democracy and the market economy are vibrant forces in Bulgaria, but they are still young and need to be sustained by the confidence and trust of the whole population."
"The suspicion of corruption is a most destructive force and it must be tackled as a matter of urgency."
"This is nowhere more true than in the case of nuclear power, where legitimate concerns over nuclear and environmental safety are in danger of being hijacked by the anti-nuclear power lobby."
"In recent weeks we have all been reminded of the perils of over-dependence on oil and the need for diversity in energy provision."
"The Kozloduy nuclear power plant accounts for half the internal power generation in Bulgaria."
"Safety considerations must of course remain paramount but other factors must also be taken into account in determining the country's most suitable long-term energy strategy."
"I wish to emphasise how important it is that Bulgaria should be assessed in its own right in terms of its progress towards early membership of the European Union."
"If Europe is to embrace this historic opportunity for enlargement, removing the divisions created by the Soviet occupation and the communist experiment, candidate countries must be given a chance to accede within a reasonable timeframe."
"This applies to Bulgaria."
"Finally, I would like to mention a dark cloud that hangs over Europe and here I speak personally."
"23 years ago Bulgarian secret agents went on a murderous rampage in Western Europe, attacking certain individuals, including my friend Georgi Markov, the well known writer and broadcaster, who was murdered in broad daylight in a London street."
"Former Soviet agents have admitted their part in this dastardly crime but documents have been found incriminating Bulgarian citizens as well - Bulgarian agents of the communist government."
"No progress has been made in solving the crime."
"Successive presidents promised to take action but nothing was done."
"I will not myself be able to vote for this report unless progress is made in solving the murder of Georgi Markov."
"- Mr President, Romania's people welcome wholeheartedly the European Union's Helsinki decision to incorporate Romania in the first wave of the current enlargement countries."
"Indeed, 80% of Romania's people believe that Romania belongs in the European Union."
"Perhaps it is no coincidence that those same public polls show that the European Union Ambassador is the second most popular person in Romania today."
"Since last December, therefore, there have been many encouraging signs."
"Acute poverty has been a key problem in Romania since 1990 and under the present government, the economy is at last showing real signs of improvement."
"The substantial loans from the World Bank and the IMF and the European Union show that success."
"The current Prime Minister, Mugur Isarescu, is himself on secondment from the Central Bank and therefore has excellent relationships with the international financial institutions."
"The better economy should increase a still fragile public confidence in the democratic institutions and de-politicisation of the civil service must be a high priority."
"Romania enjoys a free press."
"This must be encouraged and supported."
"Tackling corruption at all levels will assist in building a free and open civil society."
"Romania nearly fails on the Copenhagen criteria with regard to children."
"Here we must remember that the collapse of the Soviet Union has left thousands of children in desperate straits throughout the Union; children whose families have given way unwillingly to pressures, children who have been institutionalised wrongly, children who are treated cruelly, children who die needlessly, children who are adopted by other countries illegally, children whose only future is to be exchanged for hard currency or household goods."
"Central and Eastern Europe and the West Balkans are a prime source for the international child slave trade."
"In Romania the government, with the active support of Commissioner Verheugen, the World Bank and the United Nations, have given us an opportunity to establish good doctrines and best practice in the region."
"The formation of a high level group is something that I commend to my colleagues."
"Romania has many strengths."
"It has a unique and flourishing culture."
"It has an established artistic and musical heritage."
"It has strength in adversity."
"Members will recall that our helping Kosovo was timely and was of great importance."
"This will be reflected in the coming challenge of the OSCE which Romania adopts in January 2001 and perhaps in 2002 when Romania's probable membership of NATO will be reviewed."
"We all applaud Romania for the Olympic gold, silver and bronze medals it has won in the last fortnight."
"We must look forward to Romania becoming a full and active member of the Union without undue delay."
"I therefore commend my report and its proposals to the House and urge Romania to make haste to implement the acquis communautaire and the Copenhagen criteria and become a member of the European Union."
"Mr President, Commissioner, your rapporteur endorses the contents of the Commission' s report on Slovenia and notes that the criticisms expressed in 1998 gave the Slovenian authorities a salutary shock, prompting them to speed up adoption of the measures necessary for accession to take place."
"This change of pace has placed Slovenia among the countries whose preparations to enter the Union are most advanced, and so, in my opinion, it is highly likely that this country will be one of the first to join."
"Certain issues are still to be settled, of course, but they have been discussed on various occasions both at meetings between the parliamentary delegations and in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy."
"They are the subject of amendments which we are going to discuss tomorrow and include the closing down of duty-free outlets before the end of the year, the restructuring of public companies and the adjustment of banking law and the insurance sector, and, more generally, the modernisation of the entire sector of the administration of justice, which has to guarantee independence and impartiality, and all the public administrations."
"I call upon the new parliament, which will take up office a fortnight from now, and the new government to make these matters a priority."
"We must insist on a timely, appropriate information campaign for Slovenia as well, in order to make all the citizens aware of the benefits of joining the European Union."
"Parliament could contribute actively to these initiatives by opening documentation units and involving the public through schools and via their cultural, professional, social and working environments."
"Parliament' s resolution of April 1999 stressed the convergence of the positions of the European Union and Slovenia on economic policy and security, and in this past year Slovenia has indeed made a major contribution to the Stability Pact for South-East Europe."
"Slovenia supported the action of NATO and the Member States during the war in Kosovo and, considering the difficulty of making such a decision, this can be taken as evidence not only of the important role played by this country in the region but also of the convergence of its interests with those of the European Union."
"I would like to take this opportunity to invite Commissioner Verheugen to make representations to the Commission and the Council of Europe so that the European Union can revise its position and invite the Serbian opposition, which has just won the elections, not to stay away from the second ballot, for that would be to hand Milosevic a virtual victory on a plate without a political fight, potentially providing him with dangerous grounds for remaining in power."
"The stability of the entire south-east region depends on the disputes that divide different, neighbouring countries being resolved."
"It is therefore important for the Slovenian authorities to come to a swift agreement with Croatia in order to bring all bilateral disputes, particularly border disputes, to a close."
"This will ensure greater stability, improve the climate for bilateral relations and provide all the peoples concerned with enhanced opportunities for economic development."
"Mr President, the report on the accession of Cyprus, which I am honoured to present to you, in comparison with the series of reports which you have heard about this afternoon, includes a special political aspect."
"This is a candidate country where a third of the territory has since 1974 been occupied by the Turkish army and where, because of a particularly impervious line of demarcation, the fundamental principles of the European Union cannot be applied across all of the territory."
"The report which it is my honour to submit, which was also unanimously adopted in committee, observes that the part of the territory controlled by the legal authority fulfils the Copenhagen political criteria."
"Cyprus has a viable and prosperous market economy and should not encounter any particular problems in adopting the acquis communautaire."
"I have a duty to point out, however, that transposing the acquis communautaire is taking too long and that Cyprus, like other candidate countries moreover, should tighten up its administrative, fiscal and legal systems."
"I am convinced that Cyprus' accession could serve as a catalyst and a driving force in finding a solution to the political problem of the division of the island."
"Perpetuation of the status quo following the Turkish invasion of July-August 1974 is not acceptable to the European Union."
"We therefore support the proximity talks which are currently being conducted under the auspices of the United Nations."
"We must however also point out that the definitive solution, a fair and lasting solution, must fully comply with both the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions, with this being, quite simply, the international law in force, and also the principles governing the European Union."
"I am thinking, of course, primarily of the political principles, but also the principles of freedom of movement and of establishment."
"Now that both Cyprus and Turkey are candidate countries, the Cyprus conflict ceases to be peripheral to Europe but rather an internal Community conflict."
"We must therefore have recourse to every means possible and to every asset available to us."
"Immediate confidence-building measures are essential as a way out of the current deadlock."
"The presence of one soldier for every six civilians, including the Turkish colonists, in the occupied zone of Northern Cyprus is unique in Europe, and even in the world."
"Your rapporteur therefore proposes that the series of confidence-building measures and measures to dismantle the status quo should begin with the demilitarisation of the island, something that has, in fact, been demanded by a number of Security Council resolutions since 1983."
"The Turkish Cypriot community has nothing to lose and indeed has everything to gain from accession."
"Both its security and cultural identity will be fully respected."
"Simply belonging to the European Union guarantees certain rights."
"Europe must become a responsible player in finding a solution to the Cyprus question."
"To this end, a key role will fall, without prejudice obviously to the Commission' s own role, to our High Representative for the CFSP, Mr Javier Solana."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I am speaking here in a dual capacity, as rapporteur for Malta and as chairman of the joint parliamentary committee for Poland, and I am therefore grateful that you have allowed me extra speaking time."
"Because of its geopolitical position as the last outpost of Europe, at the crossroads with the Middle East and North Africa, the importance of Malta goes far beyond its geographical size and its small population."
"The European Parliament and the European Council of Vienna, with Wolfgang Schüssel, who at the time was still serving as Austria' s foreign secretary, in the Council presidency, therefore welcomed Malta' s decision to reactivate its accession application, which had been frozen since 1996."
"It was only logical for the European Council in Helsinki in December last year to give the green light for the resumption of accession negotiations with Malta when the accession negotiations were extended."
"There is no doubt that Malta fulfils the Copenhagen political criteria and, as a functioning market economy, should be able to cope with competitive pressure within the Union by pursuing the steps under way to restructure its industry and to reduce the government deficit."
"Malta also has stable, working, democratic institutions."
"The national action plan to implement the acquis is creating the conditions needed to restructure and modernise the economy of this island republic."
"As rapporteur, I am naturally aware of the fact that Malta has the same problems adjusting to the EU as other candidate countries, except that they are much fewer in number and therefore easier for the EU to cope with."
"This small island has, of course, been used to protecting its economy from too much competition through protectionist measures and tariffs for a long time and the break up of these structures is a cause of concern to small retailers and family businesses."
"It is also a matter of concern to the shipyard and dry-dock sector which has been heavily subsidised for a long time, thereby contributing to the public-sector deficit."
"But reforms are under way here which will help this sector to become economically viable and to survive."
"Malta is also well on the way to opening up its monopoly of electronic media to the free market."
"One problem is, without doubt, that it has a great deal of catching up to do in the area of environmental policy and waste disposal, but these problems can be overcome, given time."
"Financial support under the pre-accession strategy is fundamental for Malta, as is the knowledge that financial aid for Malta should comply with the rules which apply to the other candidate countries."
"Malta' s main problem is still that the accession process is judged differently by the government and by the opposition, while the European Union just wants to be sure that the accession process progresses steadily."
"What is needed, therefore, is comprehensive information for the public on the political, economic and social aspects of Malta' s accession to the European Union, together with comprehensive dialogue with all sections of the population and relevant political groups and parties, in order to ensure that Malta' s accession becomes a matter of national concern and in order to pave a straight path for Malta to join the EU."
"Allow me now to jump across to Poland, which is without doubt a key country in the enlargement process, not just because it is the most expansive of all the central European economies but because of its size and geopolitical position."
"Poland has always been the first victim of the European conflicts which, until just recently, were played out on its territory. It is not its fault that it has taken so long to find its way to the European Union."
"With all the problems inherent in Poland' s adjustment to the European Union, we must not forget the historical dimension in the case of this country. It cannot be measured solely in numbers like a cost-benefit analysis."
"It makes sense, especially on the anniversary of German reunification, to remember that it was the Polish Solidarnosc movement which set the downfall of the Soviet superpower in motion 20 years ago and recently enabled Germany to unify."
"Two factors must be borne in mind: first the EU must complete its internal reforms, so that it is ready to accept new members from 2003 onwards, and the Polish public must be given comprehensive information on the advantages and opportunities of accession."
"The more difficult negotiations between Poland and the EU may now become, the more we, as representatives of the European Parliament, must do everything to make the process of integrating Poland credible."
"We are not talking about an exact annual figure."
"But there should be no doubt about the will of the European Union to extend its zone of peace and stability to central Europe and Poland."
"The tendency in the report on Poland, encouraging its politicians to speed up the harmonisation of its legislation with the EU and implement the acquis, and the successful conclusion of the agreement on the liberalisation of Polish agricultural trade a few days ago are positive signals here."
"Despite all the difficulties, there is one thing we should not forget: Poland' s accession should be completed with care but as quickly as possible, in the interests of the reunification of Europe."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, we wish to make our contribution to this debate."
"There is a debate, which is often fuelled here or there, to find out if we should examine the process for the accession of candidate countries to the Union with regard to the criteria for real convergence or for nominal convergence."
"The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs considers that this is not the real debate."
"We wish to ensure that there is both real and nominal convergence."
"Looking at the Copenhagen and then the Maastricht criteria, we feel that they contain the bulk of what we need to ensure that the accession of candidate countries progresses in favourable conditions, i.e. with respect for the interests of both sides, the candidate countries and the current members of the European Union."
"But if we want matters to progress smoothly, we must firstly foster real convergence, and in order to do that, we feel that the European Union must also contribute towards gradually upgrading the candidate countries' production base."
"The figures are impressive."
"Probably, according to the latest available estimates, it will take EUR 200 billion to bring the candidate countries' infrastructures and environment up to being in a position to experience real convergence, i.e. promoting a higher level of investment in order to enable these countries' economies to meet the Copenhagen criteria."
"We also think it appropriate for there to have to be some flexibility when examining the criteria for the reduction in the inflation rate or the exchange rate pegging."
"These are the elements for nominal convergence and, as we have seen from our experience within the European Union, this type of convergence may itself also contribute towards promoting real convergence."
"The experiences of Italy and Portugal obviously come to mind, and we can observe the same phenomenon with regard to the candidate countries, but for that a certain amount of flexibility is necessary in order to enable the necessary adjustments in the catch-up process."
"This is particularly valid with regard to the matter of prices."
"With this in view, we feel it is essential to implement a genuine macroeconomic dialogue among peers, among fellows, at the level of Ministers for Finance and the central banks, even before accession, and, no doubt, not only regarding the monetary issues, but also on what within the European Union we term the coordination of economic policy."
"This coordination covers questions of common interest, questions of unemployment, innovation, and the use of government revenue."
"The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs also thinks particular attention must be paid to upgrading monitoring systems in the as yet embryonic prudential and banking sector, which represents a potential risk for access to the financing of small- and medium-sized businesses."
"Finally, in Mr Brok' s report, Parliament requests that the liberalisation of capital, particularly in the short term, should be carried out gradually in order to prevent any speculative phenomena on the exchange markets."
"One final point, Mr President, regarding the implications of membership of the euro area, which we think is both a right and a duty."
"Once the conditions have been fulfilled, there is no reason why either candidate countries or the countries currently members of the euro should object to candidate countries entering the third stage of Economic and Monetary Union."
"Much more than this, that membership will establish a commitment to the political project and to the close coordination of economic and social policies."
"Monetary Union is not merely a monetary area."
"It is also an economic and monetary union."
"Mutual interest means no waiver for these countries, but as far as we are concerned too there should be nothing exclusive about membership of the euro area as long as the criteria which we have defined among ourselves are met."
"These countries aspire to join the European Union according to the criteria which we have defined collectively."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has discussed the question of extending the internal market to the candidate countries in a highly committed and serious manner, because an internal market between such different economic areas as the European Union and the candidate countries is unprecedented in economic history."
"According to calculations in a study carried out on behalf of the Commission, it will take 35 years to halve the difference in the standard of living between the EU and the candidate countries."
"Nowhere in the world is the income differential at a border greater than between the EU and the candidate countries."
"Even the levels between the USA and Mexico are closer together, which is why we are in favour of a considered, flexible strategy which does justice to the challenge in the area of the internal market."
"In its own initiative report, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market therefore calls for the instrument of transitional arrangements to be used in order to allow the economies to grow together harmoniously."
"These interim solutions are not intended to set the status quo in stone but to act as intelligent buffers which adapt to changing circumstances."
"I am most grateful to Mr Verheugen for assuring us today that eastward enlargement is being prepared carefully; he also gave the impression that he will resist political pressure when he is asked to turn a blind eye."
"He has the express support of our committee there."
"We welcome the progress which the candidate countries have made in harmonising with European law and we encourage them to continue this sometimes arduous and difficult work."
"I must say, I personally have been particular impressed with the success of Hungary, Estonia and Slovenia here."
"However, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market knows full well that merely passing laws is not enough."
"They must also be applied."
"European law is not just law in the books; it must also be law in action in the candidate countries."
"Allow me, as a member of parliament from a region which directly borders a candidate country, to draw your attention to the specific situation which prevails there."
"The average wage on the German side is about ten times higher than it is ten kilometres further on in our neighbouring towns in the Czech Republic."
"The region was cut off behind the Iron Curtain and its economy is now lagging far behind."
"That is why structural changes are now needed in record time and why these regions which, after all, are home to some 20 million people throughout the EU - the equivalent of a medium-sized member state -, need our support in training employees, with investments in small and medium-sized enterprises and with infrastructure."
"We want to encourage the Commission to go ahead with its plan to draw up a work programme for the border regions which, as in the case of enlargement southwards, will, of course, also receive specific financial commitments."
"By coincidence, there are some people from one such region - Upper Franconia - sitting in the public galleries right now."
"I was talking to them just now and, to tell you the truth, these people are worried about extending their region eastwards."
"It is not a question of a lack of information; it is a question of perfectly justified and specific causes for concern."
"We must ensure that the people there do not experience enlargement eastwards primarily in the form of lost jobs and closing businesses."
"I therefore ask for today' s resolution to clearly state to these citizens that the European Parliament hears their concerns; that way we shall also have these people' s support for the European goal of enlargement in peace and freedom."
"The European Parliament must vote in favour of the accession agreements."
"We stand for greater openness and greater transparency in negotiations and we expressly call on the Council of Ministers not to pursue a policy of concealing the facts as far as accession negotiations are concerned and to disclose what was discussed during negotiations."
"Then people will put aside their fears and support the huge project of enlarging Europe."
", draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a member of parliament from Brandenburg, an East-German Land, allow me to stress at this point how proud I am to act as spokesman for my committee in this debate."
"You might say that I represent a region which, ten years ago, represented a good part of enlargement to the east - I too lived on the other side of the Iron Curtain."
"Allow me also to say at this point that I have a great deal of respect for the citizens of the central and eastern European countries who, ten years ago, had the courage to go into the streets and start this process."
"They deserve my thanks, as of course do the Member States of the European Union at the time and the Commission and Parliament, for the solidarity which they have always demonstrated with our regions."
"I am speaking on behalf of the Industry Committee - to abbreviate its full title - on the areas of industry, external trade, research and energy."
"This is a broad political field which includes highly explosive smaller issues and covering this broad spectrum for the twelve different candidate countries from central Europe, Malta and Cyprus was a huge challenge."
"Allow me to comment on a few focal points."
"Industrial change in the industrial sector is already in the final stage, although it remains on the agenda and needs to be implemented more intensively."
"This change places heavy demands on the people in the candidate countries but, at the same time, it guarantees their future and their children' s future."
"The economic changeover is not for the EU' s sake, a point which needs stressing."
"The competitiveness of their own country is at stake, irrespective of whether or not they join the EU."
"Three points need highlighting in the industrial sector."
"First: industrial structures must continue to be adapted at least as quickly as hitherto."
"Secondly: there must be guaranteed improvements to and simplification of the legal framework for market access and financing."
"Stability fosters economic success."
"Thirdly: supplementary measures, such as training people, social protection and hence social stability, and an active job market policy are also extremely important."
"In the trade sector it must be stressed that a national trade policy is incompatible with EU-membership."
"It is vital for trade policy between the EU and candidate countries to be coordinated pending accession and this is being done to an increasing extent."
"A few comments on new technologies: these countries too are moving from an industrial to an information society."
"This process runs in parallel to enlargement."
"If we are to have a common information area, we must make huge joint efforts in this sector."
"The information society is important to old as well as new sectors."
"The public sector should set an example in the central and eastern European and in the other candidate countries."
"Research must be strengthened overall, especially in new technological sectors, and it is vital for these countries to be included in the European networks."
"Allow me to make one more comment on the energy sector, which has already been addressed once today."
"Energy generation and distribution must continue to be made more efficient, while complying with environmental standards."
"The whole European energy market will change on accession."
"The energy mix will no longer be the same."
"A sensitive area has already been addressed today. I refer to nuclear energy."
"The most important aspect is compliance with current safety standards and the agreed closure of unmodernised plants."
"I too should like to stress on behalf of my committee that I am not in favour of linking accession dates to closures."
"They are two separate issues."
"However much some people wish it did, diversifying out of atomic energy does not form part of the Community acquis."
"Hence, if we are to be honest, we cannot keep setting up new hurdles in these areas."
"The process of change and the momentum of this process of change will cause structural adjustment difficulties on both sides."
"Particular attention - and here I agree with the previous speaker - needs to be paid to border regions."
"Although there are excellent medium-term prospects for the border regions within the European Union, huge adjustment difficulties will need to be overcome in the short term."
"We already have experience of both from enlargement to Spain and Portugal."
"We - the Member States first, but also the EU - have a duty to provide suitable support for border regions."
"On balance, our conclusion is this: the candidate countries have already gone part of the way."
"The EU must continue to give them permanent support and must not neglect its own duties as regards structural change, including that of the institutions."
"Mr President, Commissioner, social policy is a cornerstone of the social model within Europe."
"It is also a productive factor which contributes to economic development, and although the candidate countries have made huge efforts in this respect, a great deal of effort is still required in order to reduce the developmental chasm between the European Union and the candidate countries to acceptable proportions."
"To give you a few examples: their wages are four times lower than ours, their purchasing power is two and a half times less than ours; and only Prague and Bratislava equal the EU' s average standard of living."
"Compared with the European Union, participation in the labour market in Central and Eastern European countries is approximately five percent lower, and about twenty percent lower in the case of women."
"Child mortality in Eastern Europe is double that in Western Europe."
"In Romania, child mortality is, in fact, four times higher than that in the European Union."
"Technologically too, there are still discrepancies between East and West: there are four internet connections per one thousand inhabitants over there, as opposed to sixteen over here."
"If the idea of swift accession is mooted - and the date of 2003 has been mentioned, even if the Commissioner does not want to commit to that date as yet, but that does stop some Western European governments from putting that date forward - this will presumably involve transitional measures or periods, and that is still a grey area."
"What procedure, for example, will be used to decide on these transitional periods?"
"If the acquis communautaire has not been completely transposed, or cannot be fully transposed, or if it has not been implemented in practice, on what basis will a decision then be taken as to what part of the acquis communautaire must be implemented at all events, and what part, further to research and interpretation, could be subject to a transitional period, if necessary?"
"We would welcome some clarification in this area."
"We should not be blinded by the percentage figures of community law transposed into national legislation."
"One example is the social dialogue. Social dialogue is not so much a matter of establishing and recognising social partners, but mainly a problem of culture, of familiarity with employers' delegates and employees' representatives, of experience with providing information, consulting, debating and negotiating."
"What I am trying to say is that despite the transposition of a number of directives, these are not always carried out in reality."
"Finally, enlargement is not just a game of words, because we cannot improve the human rights situation in Tibet just by translating the human rights declaration into Tibetan."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the EU' s enlargement, to include ten Eastern European countries and the two Mediterranean countries Malta and Cyprus, is upon us."
"Negotiations involving the European Commission and the governments of those twelve countries are now under way."
"Three major stumbling blocks in these negotiations are the environment, agriculture and free access of employees of the new countries to the labour market of the old Fifteen."
"With regard to the environmental aspects, I have drawn up a report on behalf of the Committee on the Environment."
"Only once before has Europe faced a similar dilemma."
"This was nearly ten years ago when the GDR became part of Germany."
"The European Commission then spelled out that the internal market rules would apply as from day one of the GDR joining the EU."
"Very often, Europe' s environmental rules were subject to five-year transitional periods."
"In that situation, West Germany backed the former GDR financially on a massive scale, by no less than DM 150 billion annually."
"The ten new countries in Eastern Europe can only dream of having a rich sugar daddy such as that."
"At present, the EU spends approximately EUR 500 million annually on the environment in the twelve new countries together."
"In order to meet all 200 environmental EU requirements, all Eastern European governments together need to spend another EUR 120 billion."
"In this light, it is understandable that they are applying for longer transitional periods of ten to fifteen years in order to accommodate those expensive environmental requirements."
"This means that the environment in Eastern Europe will not undergo any noticeable improvements until fifteen to twenty years from now."
"This is an unacceptable period of time."
"It is logical that the Environment Ministers of the new countries will be putting the brakes on after their countries have joined the EU, whether their political persuasion is green or conservative."
"They will argue that they should first of all introduce the old EU environmental requirements before Europe adopts new environmental requirements or tightens existing ones."
"In order to solve this dilemma, the Committee on the Environment has proposed that the inexpensive cheap environmental requirements, such as environmental effects reporting, environmental information, animal welfare, the habitat and bird directives, should be effective from day one and that five-year transitional periods should be introduced for the expensive environmental requirements."
"Environmental aid will need to double in order to help the new countries."
"If longer transitional periods prove necessary after all, the European Commission should table these requests to the Environmental Committee."
"The proposal which has attracted most controversy is that which stipulates that the old, soviet-type nuclear power stations have to be closed down from day one."
"In the negotiations held so far, it has been agreed to leave this type of extremely dangerous power station, such as that in Lithuania, in operation until 2009."
"Mr President, we might be inclined to think that when new countries join the EU, this automatically means that they will have to introduce more stringent rules to protect the environment and nature."
"This may be true in part, where the protection of the environment is concerned, but when it comes to protecting nature, it is a different matter."
"The candidate countries want to experience quick economic growth, even if this is at the expense of previously stipulated nature protection policy."
"Of those candidate countries, it is mainly the Eastern European countries which have a rich tradition of identifying and protecting nature reserves."
"Accordingly, their decision in favour of rail transport, which takes up less space and emits less polluting substances than road transport, was a sound one."
"This head start has been put at risk over the past decade, mainly by the impoverishment of a large section of the population and by the wish for a new, car-oriented infrastructure."
"Some candidate countries would like financial support from the European Union for projects which will need to be abandoned once they join the Union."
"One example is the motorway in Bulgaria between Sofia and Thessaloniki, which cuts right through the vulnerable Kreshna gorge."
"In some countries, the state of the natural world and of the environment is treated much like a state secret."
"This is why it is important for the citizens of those countries to become actively involved."
"The fact that non-governmental organisations for the protection of nature, the environment and animals are set up and developed, therefore, deserves our active support."
"Any transitional periods which postpone compliance with nature and environmental requirements could also freeze and obstruct the policy within the EU' s current Member States."
"The next few years in Eastern Europe might well see the depopulation of rural villages and the large-scale purchase of agricultural land for mechanised production-intensive farms."
"In addition, new industrial sites are being built."
"And the transport of arable produce and stock breeding products over long distances will take off in a big way."
"This also applies to the inhuman transport of live animals to slaughterhouses."
"Watercourses, hedges and stone walls, which are the traditional land dividers in the countryside, have already been partly destroyed by large-scale collectivisation, but the remainder thereof is now also at risk."
"The habitat directive and bird directive will not apply to the new Member States until the areas and animals to be protected have been listed in an appendix."
"This requires swift action so that these directives can enter into effect as from day one."
"We need to try to protect the countryside and the natural areas from any negative impact."
"I welcome the broad approval from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and I hope for the same from Parliament as a whole."
". Mr President, when Pandora opened her box all the ills of mankind were released."
"Sometimes, in health terms, that is how it must have felt when the borders opened after the Iron Curtain was ripped apart."
"We had a two-way traffic of bad habits, many of them linked to health."
"Bad habits of course move fast and good practice moves more slowly afterwards."
"Many of those bad habits were linked to health - infectious diseases, some drug-resistant and some we thought we had seen the last of."
"And there was drug abuse, the horrors of Aids and syphilis and the problems of tobacco and alcoholism."
"That would happen with or without enlargement."
"You cannot erect some new curtain, some cordon sanitaire, to protect west from east and east from west."
"Enlargement or no, it is in our mutual and collective interest that such problems are dealt with."
"It is my belief that enlargement can help that process."
"Since the 1950s in Europe we have introduced standards on health and safety and over the years we have extended competences and standards from public health to health promotion, tobacco to blood safety, rights from mobility of doctors and patients to human rights and laws such as those for mental health."
"Pharmaceutical companies have been regulated, medicines for people and animals licensed, and a range of measures taken in research, dissemination of good practice, education and training."
"We are building a compendium of directives and regulations on matters wholly germane to health, such as pollution, emissions of radioactive and other dangerous substances, waste disposal, water, air, soil quality, food safety and novel foods and product liability."
"Now we are moving to a requirement for health impact assessments for all major legislation."
"It is a long list and one that is often more honoured in the breach than in the observance by Member States."
"There is a message for EU governments and indeed for the Commission: for governments on compliance and the Commission on enforcement."
"More importantly there is a message for all of us who are interested in enlargement: we need to use all the channels available to us to support progress among the accession countries."
"That is why my report devotes a lot of its recommendations to the need to encourage the Phare programme to do more in the health field and to bring the countries into partnership now in the health action programmes and other areas."
"This includes bringing the European Investment Bank into the partnership."
"Mr President, with enlargement on the horizon, today' s debate forms an excellent opportunity to reiterate what the representatives of the European people regard as being the key points."
"I will focus on the area of consumer protection, as I am responsible for this particular section in the report and resolution."
"When the European Union is enriched with many millions of Central and Eastern European citizens in a few years' time, these countries will also add as many consumers."
"Although the acquis communautaire on consumer protection is relatively limited, consumer interests touch upon many other areas of policy."
"I therefore believe that the ultimate goal we should strive towards with regard to these countries, these new accession countries, is for the consumer to become a fully-fledged partner in the market economy, which will help bring about a sound social mainstream."
"In order to reach that position, it is necessary for structured consumer organisations to be in place. These consumer organisations should be independent from national governments and should, in my view, be given more encouragement by the EU, but also by Member States and other NGOs."
"There are three other areas which I would like to outline briefly. First of all, the area of telecommunications."
"Telecommunications and technological developments only surpassed by time itself should not be kept from the consumers of the enlargement countries."
"They should not lag behind."
"So I would call for a concerted effort in that field."
"In fact, the same applies to the financial sector."
"In conjunction with industry, we should make extra efforts to set a sound form of organisation in motion."
"Mr Bowis echoed this very sentiment a moment ago: food aid and food safety are top priorities, not only for the public, but also because the internal market will soon need to take these products into consideration."
"European unification has a great deal of potential with many opportunities which we must seize with both hands."
"- (DE) Mr President, honourable members, we all know that the agricultural sector is one of the most difficult sectors when it comes to enlargement."
"But there is no point in running scared; the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development takes the view that, if we estimate pre-accession aid correctly, we can do it."
"However, we must be clear about a number of things: structures in candidate countries vary considerably; in fact they could not vary more, which is why everything we do must be geared to the structures which currently exist in the individual Member States."
"In the import-export sector, only Hungary has a positive balance of agricultural trade with the EU-15 at present."
"All the others import more agricultural goods into their countries than they export to the Union."
"That should give us food for thought, because so many of our farmers are afraid that, if we unify, we shall all go under because they are all fully paid-up agricultural economies."
"That is not the case."
"The dangers lie elsewhere altogether."
"We in the Committee on Agriculture are firmly convinced that we should give these countries as much as we can from SAPARD resources and that we should give it to the right agencies."
"We need to restock structures in the positive sense, from abattoirs and dairies to processing."
"It makes no sense to import pig carcasses into the EU-15, create the added value here and then send the finished products back to the shops in these countries."
"That way they will never be able to stand on their own two feet."
"Everything we do to start this process now will save money later."
"We must also clarify openly and honestly in discussions with these countries, that the common agricultural policy does not imply that the same payments have to be made everywhere from day one of membership, without checking if there are price losses in the individual product segments."
"That would be unfair to other structures in the EU-15."
"This can be reasonably regulated with reasonable phasing-in."
"Then, of course, there is the problem of transitional arrangements."
"In the veterinary sector, in the phytosanitary sector, these countries need transitional periods of 10, 12 or even 15 years."
"Obviously that is out of the question."
"And because it is out of the question, it is important to do what we can now so that any unavoidable transitional arrangements needed can be as short as possible."
"It is better to introduce measures now than to start a long fight five minutes before accession."
"All these purely agricultural matters should not obscure the fact that the following applies in the agricultural sector: Unless institutional reforms are properly regulated before the first candidate countries accede to the EU, there will be much that we are unable to regulate as we would like to."
"Of course, no-one will be surprised to learn that the Committee on Agriculture takes the view that the important area of the agricultural economy, which continues to account for almost half the budget - and this will basically remain the case -, should come under the codecision procedure."
"I have been instructed by our whole committee to express this view emphatically for the attention of all the agricultural ministers in the Member States, irrespective of which political hat they wear, because that is where those that are holding back and oppose this are to be found."
"The future Member States, our candidate countries, are joining a changing common agricultural policy and it would be a poor show of parliamentary democracy in practice if they continued to be excluded from the democratic process of shaping the future common agricultural policy in an area which is far more important to them than it is for most of the fully paid-up Fifteen."
"That is a most important point."
"And I have something else to say: we need to say this loud and clear to our member governments, especially our agricultural ministers, in the first phase of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"We shall have a fight on our hands in some areas; we already have."
"It is a question of money."
"The assumption is that we did not want to grant them the same blessings of the common agricultural policy in euros."
"That is wrong."
"But justice does not mean that everything is measured with the same yardstick."
"It means that every candidate country will receive aid, according to its needs, which puts it on an equal footing with the Fifteen."
"And that does not mean that the same numerical sums must be paid per hectare, per tonne or per head."
"That is not necessary and would create injustices."
"On balance then, we have nothing to fear, but we must reform, otherwise accession will not work in the agricultural sector."
". (ES) Mr President, enlargement is essential for the construction of a strong and united European continent."
"The economic and social cohesion laid down in the Treaty, the basis of the policy of European solidarity, must be one of the basic elements of that construction."
"However, we must not forget that, after enlargement and as a result of the low standard of living in the candidate countries, the average Community GDP is going to be reduced by at least 18%."
"The immediate consequence will be that more than 20 of the current Objective 1 regions will exceed the ceiling for receiving aid - 75% of the Community average - without having increased their income in real terms."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we are not always able to clearly explain these pitfalls to our citizens nor propose clear and acceptable solutions."
"Somebody said here today that enlargement is not a priority for 60% of the people consulted by the latest Eurobarometer."
"The report on the opinion of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism - of which I am rapporteur - has therefore had to play a dual role."
"Regional policy, the policy of European solidarity, is, of the common policies, the one which is most familiar to the citizens and one of the most valued."
"My report on the committee' s opinion therefore talks not only of what the candidate countries have to do but also of what the European Union has to do."
"The candidate countries must now embark on their own regional policy, develop the appropriate administrative structures, move ahead with the process of decentralisation and regionalisation, open up channels for participation to local and regional authorities and to social agents and create effective programmes of transnational and cross-border cooperation amongst themselves and with the Member States. They must do all of this because, after enlargement, we will not only have to combat the inequalities which those countries have inherited from the past, but also those which are being created at this very moment."
"This is not only a result of their internal policies, but above all because of our investments, European investments, or, if you prefer, Member States' investments, which are accentuating the internal differences between the regions of those countries to the highest possible degree."
"That is why my report encourages them to create their own regional policy and move forward in this process."
"My report is also bound to discuss the European Union and has to demonstrate that the European funds for regional development cannot continue to be granted on the basis of a simple distribution of money between regions or districts."
"If we do not establish priorities from a continent-wide perspective and straightaway, we will waste precious time, a few very important years in the task of constructing a strong and united continent."
"It is essential, ladies and gentlemen, to create a genuine European regional planning policy, of which the Structural Funds are a component, an element, but which gives rise to ambitious actions in favour of balanced and integrated development of the European area in its different dimensions."
"It is necessary to develop this European plan, link it clearly to regional policy and to the reform which is going to be implemented in 2006."
"We must begin to discuss this integrated and polycentric European development."
"The moment to move forward will perhaps arrive after the next Intergovernmental Conference."
"The European Parliament and its Committee on Regional Policy, which also has competence in the field of transport and the Trans-European Networks, is aware that it is necessary to coordinate the different Community sectoral policies in favour of a global policy of regional planning."
"The European Commission works on the basis of this same hypothesis and will put forward some of its proposals in the second triennial report on cohesion which it will present to Parliament in December."
"We know that this is perhaps not the ideal moment politically, but there is also a need to discuss the current financial perspectives negotiated at the Berlin European Council, which do not seem to us to be sufficient to confront the challenges of the regional policy and the economic and social cohesion of an enlarged European Union."
"Ladies and gentlemen, cohesion and European citizenship are one and the same thing."
"Helmut Schmidt and Valéry Giscard d'Estaing put it another way: the only way we can create realistic and viable integration is through political will and socio-economic conditions which are almost identical."
"Mr President, allow me to start with a preliminary comment, not on the subject of Austria, but on another political matter."
"The French Presidency changed its political presence here in the House prior to the reports on the two candidate countries of Cyprus and Malta."
"I trust that this is not an indication of how the grande nation intends to treat small partners; it would be the wrong signal."
"But now to the right signals."
"Elmar Brok rightly started his intervention by saying that we all stand to benefit from enlargement, especially those of us on this side of the current external borders."
"Commissioner Verheugen, you rightly stressed that it was no longer a question of if, but of how and when enlargement will take place."
"But it is precisely with the ""how"" and ""when"" that we need to ensure that enlargement is prepared carefully and implemented seriously, in order to guarantee its success."
"The Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has tried, within its remit, to take account of two sub-sectors which Mr Brok addressed and which must be borne in mind if enlargement is to be a success."
"We have just heard something about the ""carrot"" in the regional policy and promotion sector."
"If that is our classification, then transport and tourism come in the ""stick"" category, because in this sector we have a huge amount of acquis and it will be a question - and I shall come back to this - of actually applying this acquis."
"But first a reminder that transport infrastructure will be instrumental to the success of enlargement."
"A huge internal market with over 500 million European consumers needs transport routes if it is to function."
"Some of the infrastructure is already in place, at least in one half of the future Union."
"Here we have developed and are in the process of improving the basic infrastructure needed in the form of TEN."
"We must make similar arrangements and, more importantly, we must forge connections with central and eastern Europe."
"The TINA report covers these prospects."
"The financial perspectives make provision for some of the funds."
"Whether or not they will suffice remains to be seen; in any event a sound basis has been laid for the candidate countries with PHARE, ISPA and other funding programmes."
"But there must also be a sound basis and it is particularly important for the infrastructure to be created in the candidate countries, in order to ensure that acceptance of the Community acquis is not and does not just remain acceptance on paper."
"The committee has basically endeavoured in the individual transport strategies to highlight the most important aspects."
"There are two very important aspects in connection with road and rail transport which deserve special mention here: as regards road transport, which has already been liberalised and opened up to an extensive degree, care must be taken to ensure on accession that the provisions of Community employment, social, fiscal and tax legislation are actually applied in each Member State because, if they are not, this will lead to distortions of the market in the European Union and in the candidate countries which, where possible, we shall then have to spend a great deal of money rectifying."
"Similar early action is needed and will be needed in order to join the western and eastern European railway network and render them compatible."
"We must ensure that the present rail infrastructure in central and eastern Europe is not replaced by road transport, resulting in a great deal of effort at a later date in an attempt to put things right."
"Internal waterway transport will be important for environmental reasons, because we must get heavy freight off the roads and, if it cannot be carried by rail, then we must use waterways."
"Once Malta and Cyprus join, the Union will have the biggest merchant fleet in the world."
"It is important that it should not just become a flag of convenience and that all measures prescribed in the acquis are taken to ensure that safety is writ large."
"We do not want to live through another accident like the Erika."
"There is a series of further points which the Regional Committee has mentioned in its report."
"I hope that the candidate countries and we too will take them to heart."
"Mr President, I would join the chorus of those who say that the forthcoming enlargement is now the main task of the EU."
"If this does not succeed, then nor shall we."
"We could make ourselves comfortable in our little club, but its whole raison d' être would then be lost, and we should not be able to secure the large perspectives of peace, freedom and stability."
"Nor shall we succeed, however, if we do not appreciate that enlargement should, first and foremost, be for the benefit not only of a few people but of all people in the candidate countries, or in any case the majority of them."
"And with all due respect for what is being said and written in Parliament, a broad democratic base is something we do not have."
"I therefore also listened very carefully to Commissioner Verheugen' s words about 'selling' the EU to the candidate countries, for the majority of Central and Eastern European countries - if not all of them - have, of course, said that they want to hold referenda, or in any case have not said that they do not, and I personally think that this is a good idea. One should be clear, however, that there is undeniably a danger of people voting 'no' ."
"So what were the problems Mr Verheugen thought were of concern to citizens?"
"He mentioned migration, competition, social dumping, prices etc.. All obviously real concerns, but I think there is one thing which overshadows all others, that of how they can survive as countries, nations and States."
"Now, I am, admittedly, talking partly against the background of the fact that I come from a small country which has just voted 'no' in a referendum."
"This 'no' will now be analysed carefully in the days to come."
"There is no doubt at all that right-wing forces have been involved. We have also seen who has paid for the advertisements."
"Egoism and, especially, populism have also played their part. Nor, certainly, has the falling rate of the euro helped things in the right direction."
"Even though there are, of course, many of us who are aware of the historical basis for the euro and of what the whole thing is about, it has not been enough to convince people."
"But having said all that, it is questions about how we can survive as a State that have occupied people' s minds."
"How is one to get around the fact that it is really politicians in the big countries such as Germany and France who make the decisions?"
"I think it is incredibly important that we bear this factor in mind when negotiating with the candidate countries."
"I can fully guarantee you that, in those countries, the spectre of union is very easy to conjure up."
"They have in fact experienced it at first hand for a very long time."
"Another lesson from Denmark, which is directly relevant to the Committee on whose behalf I am speaking, is that everything suggests that there are far more women than men who have voted 'no' ."
"If we are not to risk a repeat performance in the candidate countries, it is crucial that we be clear about the fact that enlargement should not be of benefit only to men but also be of benefit to women."
"I believe that, up until now, all objective investigations have shown that the transition to a market economy has had a greater impact upon women than upon men."
"A great deal of pressure has been placed upon traditional social values in the former planned economies of Central and Eastern Europe."
"The rapid restructuring of the old State-run industries which is at present taking place has of course resulted in serious unemployment for both men and women, at the same time as the private sector has still not managed to fill the vacuum. And, as I say, the figures suggest that there are a great many women who have become unemployed."
"Even in countries such as Lithuania, where there is an economic upturn, it is not women, but men, who get to fill the jobs in the private sector."
"For one reason or another, it is evidently thought that men are the ones who really possess the entrepreneur gene."
"We therefore need to realise that women are much more vulnerable in this process of readjustment and therefore much more vulnerable in relation to the Union project as a whole than we have indicated up until now."
"I would strongly urge the Commission to be alert to this in all its negotiations with the candidate countries."
"If we do not secure jobs for women, if we do not ensure that the non-governmental organisations are there to talk about the Union project, then we can forget all about obtaining a democratic endorsement."
"We shall not succeed. It is therefore also important, of course, that, in connection with enlargement, we ensure that the legislation on equality is implemented sensibly so that the enlargement we are all hoping for - and I would here point out that one of the countries in which there is most support for enlargement is in fact Denmark - can also in actual fact take place."
"This cannot, however, happen by itself, and I would very much urge that attention be given to the position of women."
"Mr President, the aim of the Brok report, as with other reports on this subject, is to get the message across that the candidates are welcome, although we do not hide the fact that the groundwork leading up to their joining is a momentous task."
"This is why the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats is of the opinion that all amendments and viewpoints which implicitly tighten criteria and raise barriers to accession should be scrapped or voted against."
"This is how we came to go through the text, and attempted to cut down on certain items in the process."
"Our message to the accession candidates is the following: do not get overwhelmed by the number of reports and dossiers before us."
"All we have done is to make an attempt to give you sound advice as best we could, with the best of intentions, and in many cases we have succeeded in doing just that."
"Within the Union institutions, the views on enlargement continue to be positive and you must therefore contradict every ambassador from your countries who believes otherwise."
"The Commission has cherry-picked its officials for the task in hand and Parliament remains passionate about this project, which is the best proof that the political climate has not been so favourable for a century."
"I have already warned colleagues in Central Europe about this; when the tone sobers down, then this is only proof that we are moving from the honeymoon period into a life of domestic normality within Europe."
"It is all starting to become very real, and this requires both negotiations on specific practical matters as well as level-headedness."
"The PPE-DE does not want to take on the responsibility for pacing accession from the candidates because we cannot set any dates in this respect."
"People, especially from the relevant countries, often ask about accession dates because they would so much like to share some of the responsibility for these dates."
"We should not do this as this is outside our remit."
"We can at best promise accession scenarios and, in fact, we must draft these anyway in order to clearly mark the path to the Union."
"We can also pledge to make every effort to make accession or ratification before 2004 possible, so that at the 2004 elections, some candidates will be seen to take part in these Parliamentary elections."
"Needless to say, all of this will also require thorough institutional reform - and this by 2003."
"We must keep this date in mind for our own sakes."
"The President-in-Office of the Council replied that this reform cannot, of course, take place without involving the citizens."
"Thinking along constitutional lines, I thought he was validating the right of Parliament to monitor these reforms democratically."
"After all, we have been given the citizens' mandate to do this."
"But I am not sure whether the Minister was thinking along such constitutional lines."
"Reform is not the only change we need, of course."
"We want an effective communication policy which enables the citizens in the European Union and in the accession countries to take part in the political debate in a meaningful manner."
"Policy in this respect is still not sufficiently in tune with democratic standards."
"There are now forces in the Member States, both present and future, which want to exploit existing uncertainties."
"We all know it: to play on people' s fears is an electorally useful exercise and parties which have no political goals other than gathering seats, like to indulge in manipulating people' s feelings of uncertainty."
"This is inexcusable."
"Mr Burenstam Linder, a former Swedish colleague of mine who was an expert in this field, explained to me that any enlargement of the European Union, whenever it took place, has always resulted in an excellent cost-benefit analysis on the part of the new participants and those already in the Union."
"It makes little sense to start to doubt in public the value, including the direct value at a material level, of this enlargement."
"Unfortunately, there are too many parties at the moment which have shed their ideological feathers and, as a result, display too little ambition and too much materialism."
"President Havel from the Czech Republic recently mentioned in his speech to the IMF the lack of spirituality in our culture, the lack of standards and goals which transcend the pursuit of immediate gain."
"We can gauge our Parliament' s depth and spiritual engagement by the way it handles enlargement."
"The tasks facing us in this debate are so great that they spell out the importance of political views."
"Do we react as overfed Westerners who only care about our own fast-growing prosperity and certainties or do we take a wider view?"
"A wider view of the kind that was held at the start of European integration by its pioneers."
"Well, Mr President, let us spread the word that it is precisely these new opportunities arising from enlargement, to include former dictatorships and countries under totalitarian regimes, which can help us broaden our horizons."
"I hope our debate will give the new candidate states a shot in the arm."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I only have two minutes and must dispense with references to honeymoons."
"Nonetheless, I should like to thank the general rapporteur, Elmar Brok, who is also chairman of the committee, for the farsightedness and astonishing sensitivity with which he has conducted the debate, including and most importantly, in committee. As a result, we can now take up a coherent position for the European Parliament which is supported by all political groups."
"After such a comprehensive debate, I should just like to address and highlight two questions, which now have no or the wrong meaning in the public eye."
"The first is the question of the reforms needed in the European Union itself."
"As a result of the Intergovernmental Conference, the conditions needed in order for the European Union to be able to enlarge will be in place."
"All too often we stand with raised finger pointing in the direction of the candidates and lecture them on their obligations, when what we should do is point in our own direction and understand once and for all that, when it comes to fulfilling obligations, our turn comes well before theirs."
"The second point concerns the setting of dates."
"I am resolutely in favour of setting one date, i.e. the date by which the European Union will have completed its reforms and will therefore be ready to receive new members."
"To set a total of a further twelve dates would, in my view, be irresponsible, for the reasons which numerous speakers have cited here today, and would increase the candidates' frustration rather than motivating them."
"Mr President, those of us in the Liberal Group have recently been receiving visits from future MEPs from the candidate countries and, let me tell you, they are impatient."
"They see support for this massive peace project dwindling, both in the current Member States and in their own countries."
"We should remember that it is not only for their sake that we should enlarge the Union. It is, to a large degree, also for our own sake."
"We are so preoccupied with what we should demand of them and with what we can teach them."
"We should perhaps concern ourselves a little more with what they can rightly demand of us and with what they can teach us."
"They are proud of their new-won freedom and democracy and their impressive economic growth, and remember that it was not we who obtained freedom for them. They did that for themselves 11 years ago when they amazed all the diplomats and observers by seizing the opportunity to break the Communist yoke and, in that way, also paved the way for German reunification."
"We believe we must teach them about democracy, but do you not think that countries which have experienced dictatorship know better than we do what is important in democracy?"
"What we need, of course, is for the new Member States from the East to help us keep to what is the purpose of it all, namely a Union of free and sovereign Member States in which the freedom of the people and the nations is given pride of place."
"They can perhaps teach us to use the proximity principle somewhat better."
"If there are rules which are unsuited to the new countries, then it is perhaps the rules which should be adapted and not the new countries which should adjust."
"If there is a need for long transitional arrangements on certain points, then let us have long transitional arrangements."
"If there is a need to postpone the free right to acquire land and property for family use, then let us do that."
"The most important thing is to get the new countries around the table with us, so that they can be involved in shaping Europe' s future."
"That is important not only for them but also for ourselves."
"Mr President, we must have a clear timetable for enlargement post-Nice."
"The group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is calling for negotiations with the first group of countries to be completed by the end of 2002, so that the first accessions can take place before the next European elections in 2004."
"I must say, in all honesty, that I am rather astonished, Mr Verheugen."
"Was it not your suggestion to set clear timetables with interim and target dates after Nice on the basis of the progress reports, in order to motivate rather than delay reforms?"
"We know ourselves from monetary union how important that was."
"There is another reason."
"Common environmental standards and social rules can only be implemented if these countries are full members."
"We know that from Temelin."
"As far as I am concerned, it is out of the question to have to use additional resources from category 8 from 2002 as part of the pre-accession strategy here."
"Mr Verheugen, in my view it is pie in the sky to believe that the liberalisation of trade alone can modernise agricultural production and strengthen rural development."
"In truth, it needs far more measures, which should be much more financially focussed and improved under the SAPARD regulation."
"Mr President, we all know, to borrow a phrase from Mr Brok' s report, that accession will mean a major shock to economic, social, political and cultural development in the countries in question and just how deeply that shock will reverberate."
"I would gladly discuss the specifics of the Council' s enlargement policy but that would presuppose that there is an openly and clearly-defined policy and if reference was made today to the huge significance of Gorbachev' s glasnost for subsequent German reunification, then we too should demand that glasnost be practised in the Council and in connection with enlargement eastwards."
"I am not surprised, under present circumstances, that enlargement has hardly penetrated the consciousness of our citizens or that it is increasingly accompanied by worry and suspicion, whereas today' s debate and all thirteen reports demonstrate the common commitment of large sections of the European Parliament to enlargement to the east and to enlargement configured in a responsible, forward-looking manner."
"As far as I am concerned, three criteria are more important in relation to all the problems than the not insignificant criticism which I have on individual points."
"First, the democratic wish of the countries and people in question must be respected after their accession to the EU."
"It exists so far, but will possibly be jeopardised by a bureaucratic lack of transparency and the obvious, but not public resistance of certain governments."
"It is therefore urgent and imperative not to allow institutional reform of the EU or enlargement to be postponed."
"I also call for individual countries to be given possible target dates."
"Secondly, I am one of those who are disquieted by current neo-liberal trends in the EU."
"The various reports reflect this mainstream attitude."
"Nonetheless, the truly historic opportunity of enlargement must be defended for the sake of stability and security and the chance to develop cultural diversity and configure a new large economic area in Europe."
"Thirdly, acceptance of enlargement and its positive prospects for the individual countries and for the EU as a whole basically depend - and Denmark demonstrated this - on dismantling the social and democratic deficits of European policy."
"We cannot therefore just make demands on the candidate countries."
"Enlargement is basically a challenge for the EU itself to reform and an opportunity to steer the social, employment policy and democratic aspects of European integration as a whole."
"Provided that the reports, especially Mr Brok' s overall report are not spoilt on these points during tomorrow' s vote, I shall vote in favour of them all."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are gathered here today to discuss the applications for membership of the European Union from twelve European countries: ten in Eastern Europe and two from the Mediterranean, Malta and Cyprus."
"These countries see the present European Union as a guarantee of future prosperity."
"Some of them, a short while ago oppressed by Communism and subjugated by the Soviet empire, or still divided by military occupation like Cyprus, also see it as a guarantee of independence and security."
"Well, quite frankly: they are wrong."
"They are wrong because prosperity is not generated by the European Union and its 80 000 pages of directives and regulations."
"For where are the millions of jobs promised by the Maastricht Treaty?"
"Prosperity is created by restoring economic freedoms and nothing else."
"Nor is freedom and security created by the European Union - as Austria, on the one hand, and the Balkans, on the other, know full well - because the European Union is, alas, totally subservient to the United States Government and the nations which have just recovered their sovereignty are soon going to realise that, tomorrow, they will be asked to renounce it in the name of subservience to the supposed world order."
"Today, then, to these European nations, where the right wing have not ceased to defend national freedoms at a time when almost every other political persuasion put up with their enslavement, we are tempted to shout a warning, ""Do not enter this house which is already suffocating us."
"Now that you have just emerged from your former prison, do not rush to enter a new one."
"Do not make an irreparable error."
"Mr Verheugen told you on behalf of the Commission that there is no going back."
"He also told you that expressing a point of view other than his was to indulge in populism."
"Populism is how technocrats choose to denigrate the will of the people when it is expressed in a direction which does not suit them."
"Remember, then, to safeguard the expression of the will of your peoples, now that they are free at last, since tomorrow they may, like the Danes, wish to free themselves of this yoke."""
"If, however, the candidate countries were to persist in their intended course, we would confine our reservations to this brotherly warning."
"We should certainly not wish to give some false impression that we were in some way hostile to these nations that belong to our family, these nations that are European in terms of their peoples, languages and geography, that are Christian by faith and Western by civilisation, and, we hope, immune to all modern forms of totalitarianism, including those that are now approaching, after decades of terrible suffering."
"So, if you really do want to, then come on in!"
"But hold your heads up high and do not let yourselves be impressed by the speeches on corruption which the Commission representative has just addressed to you, for there is not one European Union Member State that is in a position to preach to you."
"Do not let them inspect your human rights record at a time when the Council Presidency aims to remove the Member of the European Parliament, Jean-Marie Le Pen, from office after an unfair procedure."
"Either refuse to enter or enter with your head held high, unabashed, and thereby become our companions in misfortune."
"Mr President, yesterday six States, today fifteen and tomorrow twenty-eight, but what sort of a Europe are we building?"
"Have we managed to establish the Europe of diversities which the peoples of our countries are hoping and praying for?"
"This is more than a question; it is a real challenge, and it is up to us to accept it."
"Reducing enlargement to the adoption of the acquis as we are currently doing, means indulging in the highly technocratic exercise of making the candidate states take on thousands of Community regulations, while being incapable of implementing them ourselves."
"The increasingly strong reservations expressed by our peoples and Denmark' s recent rejection of the euro serve to remind us of that."
"Now that we are engaged in reviewing the Treaties, some States are already calling for a new reform."
"Once again, this constant groping around shows either that we do not know where we are going or that we know only too well and that it is too shameful to mention."
"It would be just as irresponsible to wish to go further."
"Quite rightly, the Commission has stressed the risk of quality and speed being incompatible."
"I think specifically that in going too quickly to six then to fifteen we have displayed our inability to build a Europe which respects the disparities between its initial members."
"Is it reasonable to move ahead in the same manner?"
"I do not think so, and we therefore refuse, today, to follow you down this road which, in the long term, will do nothing but smother the hope of a lasting peace on the continent of Europe."
"Tomorrow will tell."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we shall now stop for a break and something to eat and shall resume at 9 o' clock."
"I trust that there will be a full turnout!"
"(The sitting was suspended at 7.05 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)"
"Progress towards accession by the 12 candidate countries (continued)"
"We now continue with the joint debate on progress towards accession by the 12 candidate countries."
"Mr President, Commissioner, many people form the impression that enlargement of the EU is a project which is going to cost an incredible amount of money."
"That is not an entirely correct description of how things look in reality, as noted as early as during the Berlin Summit in March 1999 when the budget guidelines were drawn up."
"It was then clearly shown that we can in fact tackle enlargement successfully within the EU' s budget."
"In the opinion on the Brok report, for which I was responsible and which has been backed by the Committee on Budgets, the conclusion is the same."
"The vast majority of international investigations point to macroeconomic gains in connection with enlargement."
"This applies to the candidate countries, but in fact it also applies to all current Member States."
"To these should be added all the other advantages which cannot be measured in figures or assessed in economic terms."
"Through enlargement, we shall be participating in the largest common market in the world, with almost 500 million people and 25 per cent of world trade."
"We shall obtain increased competition and a more rapid process of reform in Western Europe too."
"Better conditions for economic growth will be created throughout Europe."
"Albeit in a somewhat longer time-scale, we shall be obtaining a common currency for the whole continent."
"Together, we shall be able to solve Europe' s cross-border environmental problems."
"We shall acquire an extended and stable democracy and, with it, opportunities for enduring peace on what has been a constantly war-torn continent."
"The composite picture of enlargement does not therefore point to insuperable costs but to gains, however the calculations are carried out."
"They are so great that enlargement ought to be undertaken as soon as it possibly can be."
"Mr President, Slovenia has succeeded in achieving the majority of the short-term priority objectives of the pre-accession partnership and this positive evaluation is helping to provide fresh impetus for the negotiations."
"I am focusing on Slovenia because I have been involved in that country' s accession process and because it is a fine example of how realisation that the end is in sight can speed things up."
"There are only a few days to go before the Slovenian general elections."
"This is not the most opportune moment for it to focus on foreign policy and the interchanges between the different parties could become heated and exploitative."
"However, with the exception of insignificant minorities, no political group is questioning the principle objective of the Slovenian policy which is to join the European Union as soon as possible."
"The political line therefore remains unchanged."
"The speeches of all those who have contributed to today' s debate on enlargement paint a not-dissimilar picture."
"The report on Slovenia presents us with a problem which is also part of the Czech question, the Croatian question and the situation of other nations."
"However, at various different stages, always during or immediately following the Second World War, measures were adopted which do not clearly meet the Copenhagen criteria, given the prevailing spirit at the time, and yet the political and ideological architecture of the period, including the peace treaties, was founded on precisely those laws."
"The third amendment to the Slovenian document, for example, welcomes the Slovenian Government's intention to ascertain whether the laws and decrees currently in force, which date from 1943, 1944 and 1945, are in conflict with the Copenhagen criteria."
"Internal battles are being sparked off in the individual countries over these issues."
"While an amendment, as we said, welcomes the Slovenian Government's intention to ascertain whether the laws are in conflict with the Copenhagen criteria, the Slovenian parliament' s Foreign Policy Committee, which has decision-making power, stresses that the bases established between 1934 and 1935, upon which Yugoslavia was created, are fundamental, and requests that the Slovenian Government firmly enforce this position in its entirety, that part of the country ..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, people have spoken about a very fast timetable in the discussions on enlargement."
"On the other hand, it has been demanded of the new Member States that, prior to accession, they should have adopted and implemented the whole of the acquis communautaire and that the transitional periods should be few and brief."
"There is an irreconcilable conflict between these points of view."
"Some have suggested that this conflict should be resolved by offering the applicant countries membership of the EEA first."
"This is not a realistic idea."
"The EEA would not suit the applicant countries and, besides, they will be satisfied with nothing less than membership of the European Union."
"Rapid enlargement of the EU is a political inevitability."
"That is why I have asked and I am now asking why we could not change the terms of membership."
"We could specify a basic version of the acquis, which would contain core parts of the EEA agreements and a common foreign and security policy."
"In addition to adopting and implementing this basic version, the new members would obviously have to fulfil the Copenhagen criteria, agree to adopt the acquis in its entirety as a longer-term objective, and commit to the political goals of the Union."
"In this way we could create preconditions for membership of many or even all the applicant countries in the next few years."
"In splitting the body of EU law in two, the level of integration achieved by the present Member States could be guaranteed and cooperation could be further enhanced."
"If the Union were to enlarge rapidly it would have to decentralise dramatically, as was stated in the ELDR Group' s position on enlargement."
"Thus, the tasks and competence of the Union would have to be curtailed and it would then concentrate on the core issues that can only be dealt with at EU level."
"This would mean that the Union would obviously also become differentiated, so that some present Member States would move further along the path of integration than others."
"A Europe of enlargement would be one of both decentralisation and differentiation."
"Talk about the fast accession to the Union on the part of the applicant countries is just empty words unless the conditions of membership are changed."
"Mr President, the members of the Communist Party of Greece do not intend to vote in favour of Mr Brok' s and the other reports; not only do they state that people in candidate countries have much to gain from integration, they also support the way in which they are preparing for integration, by assimilating the acquis communautaire and, more importantly, promoting wholesale privatisation, the reversal of everything society has fought for and much else besides."
"However, this form of preparation, as experienced at grass roots level, is having exactly the opposite effect."
"National sovereignty and independence are being eroded, multinationals are wading in and unemployment, poverty, wretchedness, corruption, pornography and trafficking in human beings are rising to new heights, while governments are generously offering up health, education, culture, industry and the agricultural economy in return for the support of the new, often Mafia-style master class of the USA, the European Union and ÍÁÔÏ."
"It is for these reasons and, more importantly, because of our own experience in Greece, that our opposition to the enlargement of the European Union is meant as an expression of brotherly solidarity to the workers and people in general in the candidate countries."
"We call on these people to join with the people of the European Union in fighting a European Union which exploits and interferes, including militarily, which fleeces the people of their wealth and the fruits of their labour and which abolishes the social rights for which they have fought so hard and sacrificed so much for so long."
"We call on them to fight for a different Europe of all the people, a Europe without this inhumane side, in which people will defend their destiny and live with each other in peace, freedom, comradeship and mutually beneficial cooperation."
"As far as Cyprus is concerned, despite the fact that the Poos report contains much that is true, we feel, in addition to the foregoing, that the process of integration into the European Union and the decisions taken at Helsinki will not only fail to resolve the problem of the occupation in accordance with UN resolutions; they will legitimise the occupation and the definitive partition of the island."
"And, for the record, we note that the question of the withdrawal of the occupying army was hardly even touched on when the occupying force was granted candidate status."
"Finally, because there has been much talk today of the tenth anniversary of the reunification of Germany, I should like to ask the Council and Mr Verheugen if they have any idea when this unified Germany intends, having occupied Greece, to pay the loan needed for war reparations."
"Mr President, I want to focus my remarks on the orphanages in Romania."
"I believe that the Romanian Government has problems in estimating the number of orphans who are presently in the orphanage system in that country."
"In correspondence received by the European Commission delegation office in Bucharest from the Romanian Government it is estimated that there are between 100 000 and 140 000 orphans in Romania at present."
"The brutality of the Ceausescu regime ensured that so many children were orphaned in Romania since the late 60s."
"There are up to 100 000 people employed within the Romanian orphanages themselves."
"This is a complicating factor when one addresses this issue."
"I visited Romania at the end of July to see at first hand the workings of one of the largest orphanages which is in northern Romania."
"It is clear to me that the institutional, ordered regime which operates in that country results in many long-term health consequences for orphaned children."
"It was also clear that the staff who work in Romanian orphanages need further child care opportunities."
"Many of the orphanages in Romania are old, antiquated buildings."
"New, modern facilities such as those built by the Romanian Challenge Appeal are going to be needed if the quality of life for orphaned children is going to be improved."
"I visited two of these houses that I can recommend to anyone."
"I saw at first hand what benefit these homes - and they are homes - are bringing to the orphaned children."
"It is imperative that the accession negotiations between Romania and the Union detail exactly what the Romanian Government needs to do to improve the standard and quality of orphanages in that country."
"It is not sufficient to make commitments. They must act."
"I had the opportunity of meeting with non-governmental organisations in Romania which are working with the orphanages."
"I publicly commend the work of these and, in particular, the Romanian Challenge Appeal based in Birmingham and others from Ireland supported by a number of people including Daniel O'Donnell, the Irish entertainer, who has pledged GBP 1 million and has raised that in Ireland and other parts of the world."
"It is people like this who have done so much."
"We must ensure that Romania is not allowed into the European Union unless it addresses this issue."
"Mr President, I take my hat off to the general rapporteur and his team."
"I regard the report as a great achievement."
"Not only will enlargement affect human beings, it will also have an impact on the plant and animal kingdom."
"This all-round view demonstrates the enormous complexity of the issue of enlargement."
"There are many individual aspects to be taken into account."
"The Committee on Fisheries wants to have its say, but has no intention of putting a brake on things."
"We have some quite specific proposals."
"We are not going to start back at square one, but we do insist on upholding the Community patrimony, which is of course known as the acquis communautaire, as does the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"After all, although the Brok report contains ten points concerning the agricultural policy aspects of enlargement, the common European fisheries policy goes unmentioned."
"Now that is a real Community policy, and an all-encompassing one to boot."
"It encompasses all aspects of our daily life and directly affects the European labour market."
"The consequences of failing to take the fisheries policy into account could prove disastrous and should not be dismissed merely by referring to solidarity amongst the nations."
"Unfortunately, so far, the report has failed to take account of these aspects, apart from the fact that the unanimous opinion of the Committee on Fisheries reappears as the annex."
"That is not enough."
"We therefore call upon the rapporteur, the Commission and the Council to supplement the agricultural policy section with the fisheries policy section, for example by changing the title 'Agricultural Aspects of Enlargement' to 'Agricultural and Fisheries Aspects of Enlargement' ."
"It should not prove difficult to make the necessary editorial changes."
"After all, the Committee on Fisheries believes legal provisions and information obligations, for example, to be of fundamental importance too."
"I would urge you to support the relevant amendments."
"Mr President, I would like to make another comment about Poland."
"The Polish people believe that the country will be ready for accession with effect from 31 December 2002, and Poland has certainly made great strides since the accession negotiations started in March 1998."
"There are already a number of progress reports available to us, and Parliament, which plays an important part in this process, has repeatedly made its feelings known on the subject."
"Parliament supports the Commission' s strategy, according to which, each candidate state should be dealt with and assessed on the basis of its own progress and merits."
"However, there are also problems requiring a cross-border solution."
"In Mr Gawronski' s report, the Commission is urged, by the rapporteur among others, to examine measures for furthering development and for strengthening the synergy between Poland, Lithuania and the Russian region of Kaliningrad."
"I feel it is entirely reasonable to ask this of the Commission, and that the Commission' s response should be to put forward a proposal."
"I have already made this point once this afternoon, on another occasion."
"All in all, when it comes to the question of how positive people are about the enlargement process, it is worth pointing out that opinion polls in several candidate states show that enthusiasm for accession to the EU is on the wane."
"Not in all countries but in several."
"That comes as no surprise, because a whole decade has passed since the historic turning point of 1989/1990, and there is still no comprehensive information and communication strategy for the people."
"Mr Verheugen said the same this afternoon."
"Now, all hopes and expectations are pinned on France."
"Above all, the Nice Summit must clarify whether, and how, the EU, for its part, can get itself completely ready for enlargement in good time."
"When the current Intergovernmental Conference finishes, institutional reform should create the necessary institutional conditions for an enlarged EU, i.e. for a Union comprising 25 Member States or more."
"It is absolutely essential for an enlarged European Union to be able to function effectively and have the capacity to act."
"Not only does the success of the French Presidency depend on it, the progress of the entire enlargement process is at stake for all concerned, including Poland."
"Mr President, let us no longer use the word enlargement, but rather talk about accession, or even better, the reunification of Europe."
"The candidate states have spared no effort to meet the requirements."
"It is clear, though, that some countries have made more headway than others."
"This is why it is impossible to set a general date of accession; each country is welcome as soon as it has met the Copenhagen criteria, either before or after the European elections."
"It is remarkable that the national documents are often far more upbeat than the Brok report."
"We do not do the candidate countries any favours by scaling down the requirements or making out that the situation is better than it is."
"A great deal still needs to be done."
"This includes issues such as democracy, the constitutional state, decentralisation, the fight against corruption, EU regulations, industrial changes, consumer protection, environmental measures and agricultural reform."
"The EU must pull out all the stops in order to support the candidates in these areas and not raise any new barriers, of course."
"And all parties must aim for the shortest possible transitional periods, if any at all."
"It is better to have a sound accession at a slightly later date than a premature one which proves inadequate."
"I have noted a dangerous trend."
"Frustration in the candidate countries is mounting because they feel the accession process is taking far too long."
"And at the same time, there is growing resistance to accession among the population within the Member States."
"And even the European politicians have insufficient insight into the negotiating process."
"If this situation does not change, the whole reunification will be up in the air."
"I would therefore call on the government leaders to assume their responsibility and to stop this trend in its tracks."
"They must enter into a dialogue with their own people, and thereby convince them of the huge importance of peace, stability and prosperity across the entire continent, and of the historic importance of the reunification of Europe."
"Commissioner Verheugen, as chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I took advantage of the opportunity to visit the countries that want to accede to the European Union."
"It is rumoured that you are no stranger to these countries yourself."
"I believe you will join me in my assessment that a great deal has happened in these countries, but that this can largely be attributed to their own efforts, also on the financial front."
"The EU largely makes its presence felt as a result of reduced agricultural products, which drive the prices down in these countries."
"This is particularly true of the time we had the pig crisis, when pigs that were almost paid for finally ended up in Poland, having gone via the Soviet Union."
"The debate intensified as a result."
"When we now talk in terms of liberalising trade, the so-called zero option, then this is because the Commission did not satisfy Parliament' s demands early on, for it to refuse point-blank to grant export subsidies to the applicant states."
"People in these countries - and especially in Poland - are now discussing what has become of the compensation payments."
"The Polish people are asking themselves whether they will receive these payments once they are members of the EU, or whether they are regarded as second-class citizens."
"I have tried to impress on them that it will take a good deal longer yet, and that in fact it will not be discussed until after their accession, which will be several years hence."
"I have told them that it is more important for the time being, to concentrate on the structural funds."
"It would be a good idea if Poland were to request an increase from SAPARD, and perhaps a modification too, in order to tailor these funds more effectively to the conditions, in Poland in this case, but the same applies to the other candidate countries."
"Just to compare: Poland has EUR 168 million available to it in SAPARD funds."
"The compensation payments amount to EUR 1.5 or 1.8 thousand million, are widely dispersed, and will do nothing to aid the development of these countries."
"It would make sense if we were to fulfil Poland' s demands for us to increase these structural funds now, and if we were to adapt our instruments and also begin to incorporate the compensation payments into the structural funds, at the next agricultural reform, which will take place earlier, by my reckoning - or at least the planning stage will - than the accession of these countries."
"We would then share a common goal with these countries in the common agricultural policy, and it would also enable this agricultural matter to be settled once and for all by speaking to Joschka Fischer."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the question of enlargement is a multi-faceted question and cannot be covered in two minutes."
"I shall therefore confine myself to the subject of Cyprus."
"My congratulations to Mr Poos on such a thorough and objective report."
"Mr Poos brings a European vision to bear on the subject of Cyprus."
"I think that the Poos report will set a precedent for the European Parliament and I am sure that the House will support it unanimously."
"When Cyprus was still a British colony, a poet wrote, ""Masters you have changed many, hearts you have not"" ."
"Cyprus' s heart has always beaten in time with Europe."
"Cyprus is Europe, it is part of its history and it is time the island came into the European fold."
"Cyprus has close links with the people of the eastern Mediterranean and integrating the island will heighten the Union' s profile in this vital area."
"Cyprus will be a sort of bridge with the countries in the area."
"I have no need to raise the economic dimension, it is covered thoroughly and dynamically in the Poos report and the reports by the other institutions of the European Union."
"I would merely remind the House that, of all the candidate countries, Cyprus comes first as regards meeting the economic criteria and qualifies for immediate membership of EMU."
"Cyprus will have no trouble adjusting to the acquis communautaire."
"The Poos report notes that the State operates smoothly, respect for human rights and freedoms form the cornerstone of the social and cultural tradition of the island and the country' s social structures are, first and foremost, humane structures."
"There is still, of course, the question of the partition of the two communities."
"However, I am sure that, with good will and the help of the European Union, a solution can be found which will allow the two communities to live together peaceably and prosper, as they have done for centuries."
"The Poos report rightly stresses that both communities will enjoy the benefits of membership of the European Union."
"The Greek-Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriots have nothing to divide them."
"It is foreign intervention which is to blame for the partition of the island."
"Let us hope that the island will soon reunite within the extended family of the European Union."
"Mr President, I join with my colleagues in their broad support for the concept of enlargement."
"It is a natural progression for existing EU Member States and, when fully operational, will contribute significantly to the economic and social development of the entire European Union."
"As a member of the Maltese delegation and, coming as I do from one of the most peripheral islands in Europe, I support the country's application for membership."
"From an EU perspective, Malta's admission will bear further testimony to the goals, ideals and aspirations of the European Union's founding fathers."
"Malta's application for membership, after a disruptive start, is now fully back on course and in my view meets the Copenhagen criteria for membership."
"It has considerably more work to do in meeting the requirements of the acquis communautaire."
"Nevertheless the speed with which Malta has addressed the enlargement requirements is a positive indication of its commitment to European integration and its desire to be a full partner in the European project."
"I support the view of the rapporteur that Malta should be admitted to membership in the first tranche of enlargement and that negotiations should be completed by the end of 2001."
"I wish the negotiators continued success with their work in this important area."
"Mr President, in my committee, very few things are subject to Community law."
"In other words, a great many issues are based on subsidiarity, and that is how it should stay."
"Accordingly, we have confined ourselves to a handful of issues and I only intend to pick out two particular aspects."
"The audiovisual sector is very important."
"We have established that the candidate countries have simply not made enough effort on the legislative front, and the legal provisions governing the audiovisual media fall a long way short of meeting the requirements of the acquis communautaire."
"That was my first point."
"My second point is that there has also been precious little effort made to approximate the legal provisions on the intellectual property front, i.e. with regard to copyright."
"We have also addressed the issue of minorities, because the integration of these minorities - including their linguistic integration - in these countries, is also of significance."
"We have included a number of comments concerning the Russians in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and concerning the Roma in the other countries."
"Criticism and questions aside though, I would also like to highlight a positive development."
"In fact we have some positive feedback for you on the educational and cultural front."
"For years now, we have had links with these countries through the Tempus programme, and likewise, for a year and a half now, they have been entitled to participate fully in the educational, cultural and exchange programmes for young people."
"I believe we have been truly successful in building bridges here."
"We must not concentrate on economic matters alone, for it is in the very areas I have mentioned that we must find common ground and build on it."
"Indeed it is already there."
"I would like to make the honourable members aware of how unsatisfactory it is that the exchange under the Socrates programme always involves people from Eastern Europe visiting Western Europe, and that we must encourage our young people to visit the countries of Central and Eastern Europe instead."
"Only then will we truly find common ground in Europe."
"Mr President, one of the comments made recently by Commissioner Verheugen during an interview, which caused quite a stir, was that there was no real communication, or discussion, about enlargement, particularly between politicians in the Member States and their people."
"He could not have said a truer word!"
"There has been no communication, it is still not happening, and I believe it is absolutely essential to have this discussion with the people."
"The politicians should really take this message to heart, and show they have understood it, not just through words but also through deeds."
"We recently completed a study in my country, Austria - which, in point of fact, shares its borders with the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Slovenia - according to which, the idea of enlargement meets with far greater approval in the border areas, where discussions are being held and there are initiatives and investments in place, than in other regions left untouched by these activities."
"It is for us to determine a communication strategy for enlargement, through words and deeds."
"Of course the second form of communication we need is that between the Member States and the candidate countries, in order to convey what it is that is important from the European Union' s perspective."
"It is certainly not just about having general objectives, or simply being present, because the acquis communautaire is also very important."
"I sometimes hear our neighbouring countries asking why we are so bothered about the acquis, when all that matters to them is having it confirmed that they are ready for accession."
"But the acquis communautaire is the yardstick we use when assessing whether a country is ready for accession or not, and that is very important to my mind."
"The third form of communication I wanted to discuss is that within the candidate countries."
"It is often the case there that the government and the opposition, or the government and the public, are unwilling to talk to each other, and so this is also something that needs to be better organised."
"The social partners must become involved, as must all social groupings, so as to be able to convey to the candidate countries' own citizens what enlargement is really all about."
"It will be a difficult journey, and one that will undoubtedly claim victims, but, at the end of the day, it will surely take us to where we want to be."
"With that in mind, I believe we parliamentarians should do our bit to ensure that there is better communication and dialogue in future."
"Mr President, today' s debate concerns the major challenge at the turn of the millennium: to unite Europe in order to create peace and security, together with social, economic and environmental development."
"Unfortunately, these sentiments have had to yield to technical arguments in the course of the negotiations."
"The requirement for becoming an EU Member State is that of complying with the basic Copenhagen criteria."
"Negotiations must, in the first place, be aimed at easing the way to accession by the candidate countries."
"Naturally, they must comply with EU legislation, but I think it is sometimes rather hard to say that these countries must do this from day one."
"There are Member States of the European Union which have not in actual fact complied with everything, in spite of their having been Member States from the beginning."
"This debate has been going on in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"It is being said in certain quarters that a country must meet the requirements before it becomes a Member State."
"I think it is important to note that the condition of the environment will not improve as a result of these countries staying outside a little longer."
"Instead, we ought to try to help them as much as possible and as early as possible, as well as perhaps opting to accept rules that specify rather longer transitional periods."
"In this context, it is a question of rousing public opinion in favour of enlargement."
"We cannot afford to lose more of the momentum that existed at the beginning of the Nineties."
"We have already lost quite a lot of this."
"I believe it is a matter of urgency that those of us in this Chamber, in the Commission and in positions of national leadership should take responsibility."
"We must no longer hide behind democratic considerations and say that we must listen to public opinion."
"It is time to lead European opinion in the right direction."
"It has more to do with political objectives and political will than with technical solutions."
"We must explain this to people in the candidate countries and especially in our own Member States if the enlargement process is to be successful. And there is no time to waste."
"Mr President, as a member of the Lithuanian delegation I would like to support the remarks made by Mrs Hoff in her report."
"There has been remarkable progress in several areas, but one of the aspects which was not covered in the report was equal opportunities."
"We heard about the benefits of enlargement, and this is one of the issues where we can learn from Lithuania."
"17.5% of the members of Lithuania's parliament are women, which is well above the average of the applicant countries and also better than many current Member States."
"Lithuania has appointed an ombudsman to ensure equal opportunities, to which it does not just pay lip service - it actually enforces it."
"As Mrs Hoff said, the major problem remains the Ignalina power station."
"The Lithuanian government has committed itself to the closure of unit one, albeit later than originally scheduled."
"This has been a difficult issue, but there is no doubt that the plant must close, and further delays are unacceptable."
"In addition to the financial support being given by the EU for the closure programme, we must also provide support to develop a genuinely sustainable energy strategy."
"Mr President, enlargement will not be achieved in a controlled and organised way in accordance with the timetable the Commission is proposing."
"The talks do not need to reach a conclusion at the end of 2002 simply for the sake of political ambition, if the problems are not solved by then."
"We must keep political urgency at bay."
"The biggest problem is the different level of development of the countries. The best illustration of that is the reunification of Germany."
"In Germany the economic, social and cultural differences have not been as great as those among the present Member States and many of the applicant countries but the process has nonetheless come to cost EUR 600 billion."
"Where will we find the money for still much greater sums, to reduce the much greater differences in levels of development?"
"Commissioner Verheugen' s idea of a referendum on enlargement was heavily criticised, and the reason is obvious: those who have to pay cannot be let to decide on the matter."
"I propose that the model for enlargement be the same that was implemented in connection with the previous round of enlargement."
"The applicant countries first should join the European Economic Area, where they can harmonise their economies with that of the EU, without political commitments or coercion."
"Mr President, first of all, as Socialist rapporteur for the report on Romania, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent report."
"I believe that Romania has embraced the challenge of a transition to an open democratic market economy."
"It has successfully embraced reforms which are essential to secure a more prosperous and safer future."
"As both the Commission report and Baroness Nicholson's report acknowledges, some progress has been made in improving conditions for some minorities."
"Romania has ratified major human rights conventions such as the European Convention on Human Rights and the revised European Social Charter."
"But ratification is not enough."
"What matters most is implementation of the rights contained in those conventions."
"I also believe that the Commission wrongly defines minority rights solely in terms of the Roma and Hungarian communities."
"The rights of these minorities are essential to a free, open, democratic and European Romania, but I am also particularly concerned about the rights of other minorities such as the groups listed in Article 13 of the TEU: those who suffer from discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religious belief, disability, age or sexual orientation."
"Laws do not in themselves solve the problems."
"Indeed, the Romanian Upper House refuses to act on removing homosexuality from the penal code."
"This is nothing short of scandalous."
"Blatant discrimination occurs in other countries such as Poland and Malta."
"In Poland recently, the former President, Lech Walensa, told a campaign rally, 'I believe these people (gays) need medical treatment."
"Imagine if they were all like that!"
"We would not have any descendants.'"
"That is as ignorant as it is misinformed and we must make every effort to ensure that when we look at the accession countries human rights and the treatment of the minorities are at the top of the agenda."
"Mr President, first of all I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Elmar Brok, and all the rapporteurs who examined the files on the individual candidate countries."
"Even though they contain the odd contradiction, this range of texts gives us the opportunity to draw up a detailed and customised progress report on the negotiations."
"At the same time, they enable us to gauge the extent of the work accomplished by the Commission and its departments in the context of screening and the negotiations."
"We now, Commissioner, impatiently await your own progress report on the subject."
"The accession of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, Cyprus and Malta, provides us with a historic opportunity to unite all the nations of Europe on the basis of shared ideals, and to make the whole continent a more stable place."
"As a member of the delegation to the EU-Latvia Joint Parliamentary Committee, I should also like to briefly mention this specific case, by way of example."
"Significant steps have been taken in Latvia towards meeting the political criteria."
"Admittedly, some progress still has to be made in other areas, such as, to mention just one area which the rapporteur, Mrs Schroedter, did not raise, the modernisation of legal procedures and infrastructures."
"Nonetheless the political authorities in Latvia are unquestionably determined to bring the process of reform to a successful conclusion, and this bodes well for the future."
"In the face of the twofold challenge of both the enlargement, which must enable Europe to come to terms with itself, and the institutional reform, which must increase democracy and efficiency within the institutions, the European Union now, as it often does, stands at an important turning point in its history."
"The institutions, the Member States, and all of us, have to live up to this challenge, also in relation to the fears of public opinion in our own countries and to rediscover the inspiration, the ambition and the vision of the founding fathers of Europe."
"Mr President, do excuse me for arriving late."
"Unfortunately, I am still at a loss as to how to find my way out of the maze of garages by the shortest route."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to address a problem that is largely to be found in the Baltic States, in particular Latvia and Estonia."
"It concerns the existence of a relatively large Russian-speaking ethnic group, supplemented by people from Ruthenia and the Ukraine."
"The vast majority of these people are there as a result of a decade of occupation, which is why they keep themselves very much to themselves."
"In the course of the last few years, it has been possible to bring about a distinct improvement in the situation, due in no small part to the influence of the European Institutions."
"I would remind you that only a few years ago, the language law contributed to the negative assessment."
"I would also ask you to cast your minds back to the great difficulties attending the nationality law, which had to be amended and tailored to European standards."
"These legal hurdles have now been overcome, as a result of which, many Russian-speaking citizens are now prepared to recognise the citizens' rights and duties, both in Latvia and Estonia, which are the countries worst affected."
"It is a process that is having very mixed success, but it still inspires great hope, because it will mean that these citizens will also become citizens of the Union in the future, and will therefore be called upon, in a special way, to establish ties with their homeland, where their forefathers come from."
"I have a shrewd idea that these citizens will become agents of cross-border cooperation in a future enlarged European Union."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I too should like to thank and congratulate Mr Brok and the other rapporteurs, but I would mainly like to focus on Slovakia and the policy on minorities, to be more specific."
"Respect for the cultural identity of a community, even if that community constitutes a minority, increases the self-respect of those who belong to that community, and that self-respect is needed if they want to take their own self-development seriously. This wish for emancipation and self-realisation then motivates people to give something back to the community."
"This is the philosophy one should adopt when looking at minorities - that would be far more positive."
"In many enlargement countries, these minorities are labelled as problems. This is the case for the Roma people and others."
"This is also true of Slovakia."
"The report - and I am referring to that by Mr Wiersma now - considers a fundamental change of attitude with regard to the Roma to be essential."
"This says something about the long road ahead, but the Hungarian minority also fears that, despite the 1999 Law on the Use of Minority Languages, it will remain curtailed in its social, cultural and economic development."
"I come from Belgium, a country where language laws have been unable to solve the problems between the peoples; it takes more than that, education from the top down, including universities."
"This required more autonomy."
"I am only referring to this to illustrate that simple solutions do not generally help solve complicated issues."
"There is no doubt that the diversity of cultures and peoples in Central and Eastern Europe, and in the Balkans, is, within the framework of a unified Europe, being given new opportunities, but at the same time, Europe will also need to realise that a problem such as the Roma, for example, is a problem of a nation without a country and that is our problem too."
"We cannot simply pass the buck to Slovakia, Romania or the other countries."
"Mr President, I have no intention of digging over old ground a month before the next progress reports are due to be published."
"As shadow rapporteur for Lithuania, on behalf of my group, I would, however, like to congratulate Mrs Hoff on her report."
"Above all though, I would like to bring various expectations and reservations that I have, to the attention of the Council, which, I am sorry to say, is largely absent."
"Unfortunately, it seems to me, that for all the fine words and industrious opening and closing of chapters, the Council is not applying the political pressure needed to drive this enlargement process forward."
"There is a risk that the window of opportunity referred to by Commissioner Verheugen will simply be allowed to slam shut, because the first loyalty of the protagonists in the Council, in particular the Heads of Government, is to their national agendas, and sadly they do not have the ambition to raise their own profile for the sake of the whole of Europe."
"Since Helmut Kohl, Europe' s citizen of honour, stepped down from the European stage, Jean-Claude Junker is the only other Head of Government I can think of off the top of my head, for whom the European project is a matter truly dear to their heart."
"Nonetheless, I call upon the Council as a whole to demonstrate the political leadership we need to do justice to the size of task."
"Put aside any thoughts of replacing the principle of 'Each according to his/her merits' with that of 'Each according to his/her merits, but not until my elections are over' ."
"This applies both to the French Presidency and to the German Bundestag elections."
"There is no reason to delay the conclusion of negotiations until after these elections."
"Those who subordinate historic decisions to petty national, or even party political considerations, will not earn their place in the history books."
"I urge you to set a deadline in Nice by which you intend to conclude negotiations with those candidate countries - naming no names - that have made the most progress."
"Let us all stop asking them for things that do not fall within the scope of the acquis communautaire."
"Whilst there are certain honourable members here who should heed this, the message is intended primarily for the ears of the national Council delegations attending the negotiations."
"The way individual governments allow particular lobbyists to manipulate and take advantage of them to a certain extent, in the course of negotiations, is sometimes unworthy of them."
"Again I call upon the Council to show political leadership and give the candidate countries a specific deadline in Nice, which they can work towards."
"Incidentally, the French farmers and all their counterparts will still be there, before and after every election!"
"Mr President, I would like to begin by talking about Bulgaria, which in recent years has made notable progress in its transition to a free market democratic society, but not without economic and social problems."
"Nevertheless, Bulgaria now has an economy which is developing at a steady rate."
"This is not reflected, however, in a balanced improvement in the standard of living of the whole population."
"Perhaps a constructive dialogue between the government, the opposition parties and social representatives could provide a positive impetus to move things in the right direction."
"This dialogue would also contribute to the creation of the necessary administrative capacity for the effective management of the country, creating structures which do not currently exist and reducing cases of corruption."
"Many countries have faced similar problems at some time in their development and can advise Bulgaria in order to help it to overcome those problems it is facing at the moment."
"In Bulgaria, 20% of the active population is out of work."
"In addressing problems such as this, which have no easy solution, it is essential to create an environment conducive to the work of industry and to there being competitive economic structures."
"Bulgaria also has an important geopolitical role to play in the future of the Balkans."
"Its cooperation with the international community during the Kosovo conflict, and its balanced role at that time, are of great importance for the whole region."
"In fact, Bulgaria uses its position as a bridge between Central Europe and the Balkans in a way that is fruitful for everyone."
"The European Union must continue to help Bulgaria in its progress towards joining the Union and, of course, to ensure that the planning of that aid becomes even more decentralised."
"Mr President, having talked about Bulgaria, I would not want to end without a more general comment. I would like to restate our support for enlargement."
"If we want the process of enlargement to take place in a serious and honest way, we will have to give a commitment to two essential issues."
"Firstly, that enlargement should take place hand in hand with a deepening of the Community."
"The Intergovernmental Conference must therefore be an effective step forward on the road to political union."
"Secondly, the Union should tackle enlargement with sufficient budgetary resources."
"Enlargement will thereby have credibility in the eyes of those who want to be with us in the future, and credibility in the eyes of our public from this very moment."
"Mr President, I intend to concentrate on the democratic aspects of Malta' s accession."
"What happened in Denmark has demonstrated that, as matters stand, the EU' s grasp of democracy meets with criticism and rejection on the part of the citizens - and I would say these are citizens who take a special interest and are well informed."
"Malta is only to be allowed four MEPs, if the proposals tabled by Dimitrakopoulos and Leinen are anything to go by."
"If the Leinen proposal is adopted, then this will lead to discrimination against the small countries and against the new small parties in the smaller Member States."
"This will reduce the political diversity of debate."
"If Malta is only permitted four MEPs then this will further entrench the two-party system over there, which has been founded on confrontation for decades, and it will hinder political innovation."
"Malta should be represented by a minimum of six MEPs, like the other smaller Member States."
"Democracy is not just about majorities, more than anything it is about minorities being given commensurate codecision powers."
"I hope that is the spirit in which Malta will accede to the European Union."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, 'from problem child to model pupil' , that is how we could characterise the determination of the Slovakian government and the Slovakian parliament to swiftly tread the path to EU membership, and to spend the past two years making every available effort to fulfil the Copenhagen criteria."
"We hope that the Slovakian parliament and the government will pursue this course resolutely and find the patience they need to overcome opposition and strengthen the Slovakian people on their way to Europe."
"It follows from this though, that there must also be privatisation and restructuring of the economy."
"The banking and financial sector must be completely reformed, and fiscal consolidation must be continued."
"The dialogue between the social partners, the other groups within civil society, the government and parliament will play an important - and as we see it - positive part in the process."
"The small and medium-sized enterprises must be the main beneficiaries of economic diversification."
"In the long term, Slovakia should earn an ever-increasing amount of its foreign currency from economic sectors that have nothing to do with the processing of oil, or weapons production."
"We welcome the fact that there is now close cooperation between Hungary and the Slovak Republic."
"We are particularly delighted that Slovakia has made a start on granting the Hungarian and the other minorities rights, which are gradually approaching the standards prescribed by the Council of Europe."
"It is important for this condition to be fulfilled if Slovakia' s membership of the European Union is to proceed smoothly."
"Incidentally, the Slovakian government is making remarkable efforts to modernise the state apparatus and to bring on the peripheral regions."
"We have noted with satisfaction that the Slovakian parliament is conscious of what needs to be done for Slovakia to be able to accede to the EU, and has set about trying to accomplish this systematically and rapidly."
"We are also aware that, being a transit country in Central Europe for those on their way to Western Europe, the Slovak Republic has a special duty to take a pro-active stance against trafficking in human beings, and to fight corruption and organised crime with even more determination than before, and we have noted that the executive judiciary has been further strengthened by recent changes in the law."
"On a final note, allow me, on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party, to thank our rapporteur, Mr Wiersma, for his excellent and comprehensive report, and to assure him of my group' s support."
"Mr President, Members of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, enlargement beyond the former Iron Curtain is the work of peace."
"Peace brings hope and war destroys it."
"As we are demanding obedience to the law and an end to corruption of the applicant countries, we ourselves also have to establish the principles of equality and honesty."
"But differences in income among us have only grown, as has the information gap in many cases."
"Enlargement should not be achieved, however, by choosing the new NATO countries first."
"That would be tantamount to compliance with the logic of the war machine."
"Neither can we base enlargement on the idea that a given applicant naturally has priority over another as if, without it, the whole process could not start at all."
"The applicant countries must have equal status and their accession must depend only how much progress they have made."
"Certain notorious parties offering a shortcut are like dishonest judges at a sports competition."
"The Union will not be ready to accept new members if our unemployment rate remains as high as it is."
"It will inevitably lead to conflict, and even more instability caused by extremist movements."
"This is where we have to set to work."
"We must bring down the iron curtain that exists among us, as getting rid of social and educational inequality is a much more important condition than all the weight of the votes of the Commission or the Council."
"The ignorant and the excluded cannot make up the information society: they are a sure sign of its failure."
"I wish to warn all those who are ripping the Union in two, into an inner circle and the rest."
"We are just doing away with a divided Europe, and we are not going to create a new one now."
"The best way to simplify bureaucracy is to concentrate on those issues for which we must find a solution together."
"In the Member States and the local authorities it is essential to take decisions on those matters that relate to these common problems. Otherwise we will be moving towards a terrifying, controlled society, ruled by an ever-darkening core."
"Mr President, I suggest that the Commission give Parliament its assessment of how the internal preconditions of enlargement are developing, in the light of unemployment, exclusion and digital discrimination."
"Mr President, the challenge facing the European Union in the 1980s was to complete the Single Market."
"The challenge in 1990 was to achieve a single currency."
"The challenge in the first year of this millennium is to enlarge the European Union in a way that enhances the peace and stability and prosperity of the continent and does not undermine that stability."
"To that end enlargement now has to be the absolute priority."
"We should not miss the window of opportunity that Commissioner Verheugen has referred to."
"That does not mean that we should proceed blindly."
"No country has an absolutely guaranteed right to join. They have to be ready."
"That is why many of us were concerned about the criticisms made by the Commission of the efforts made by the Czech Republic in their last report, which indicated a certain slackening of effort."
"We only hope that the tremendous efforts made by the government of late will be reflected in the next Commission report."
"At the same time we should recognise the efforts made by countries like Lithuania to, as it were, make up for lost time."
"That was reflected in the last Commission report and hopefully will also be this time."
"We must make sure that the countries are ready to join and in particular that they have the administrative capacity to deal with the acquis communautaire."
"That is why some of us were concerned that the Czech Republic has delayed implementation of its civil service law and has slowed down its judicial reform whilst, on the other hand, Lithuania has made tremendous strides in that area, recognising the importance of administrative capacity."
"Member States could do more in their twinning arrangements to assist the applicant countries in developing their administrative capacity."
"Finally, it is crucial that we sell the applicant countries to the electorate of the European Union."
"Too many people have a view of the applicant countries that is 10 years out of date."
"They are now much more modern economies, in many ways ready to take up the challenge of European Union membership, and we have to sell that idea to our citizens if they are to support enlargement in the future."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Romania will certainly not be among the countries that accede to the European Union in the first round, but it just goes to show that the Commission hit on the right strategy when it decided to put twelve countries on the same footing as negotiating partners, and then to determine, on the basis of certain criteria, which countries should become members and when."
"Firstly, this allows us to dispel any fears our citizens may have that twelve countries, extending as far as Bulgaria and Romania, are to join the European Union in one fell swoop, overwhelming it in the process."
"At the same time, we can argue that a country has to meet a set of very clear standards before becoming a member."
"All this is to be found in the report by Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne, and on behalf of my group, I would like to thank her warmly for this report."
"Romania did not set out on the road to Europe until a very long time after the fall of the Iron Curtain."
"The democratic government has only had since 1996 to catch up on all the things that other countries were able to make an early start on, and with that in mind, it has achieved a considerable amount of success these past four years."
"A word about how matters stand on the security front: Romania was one of those countries that gave Europe, and the Atlantic Alliance its backing during the Kosovo conflict."
"We should therefore take this opportunity to think about sending out a signal."
"If Romania' s accession is not going to be for some time yet, then the Atlantic Alliance should give thought to incorporating Romania into its mechanisms earlier than originally planned."
"The same goes for our European security and defence policy."
"Since we are aware that Romania and Slovenia have already been involved in discussions on the first round of NATO enlargement, as countries applying for NATO membership, NATO must not allow its enlargement process to come to a standstill."
"We can use Romania to lend weight to our argument when seeking to impress on our citizens that it is in our interests to stabilise Europe."
"After all, Romania will form part of the European Union' s external border in the future."
"It is an important factor in the stabilisation of the Balkans as a whole, and of the region of South Eastern Europe as a whole."
"That being so, it is in our interests to extend our system of rights and freedoms as far as Romania, and this is certainly an argument we can use in a critical debate with our public."
"If we do not give countries such as Romania and Bulgaria any hope for the future, the situation will remain unstable and that is no good to Europe."
"Mr President, Commissioner, what with the enlargement reports which are the subject of today' s debate, together with the Brok report and the debate on institutional reform, today can be described, without fear of exaggeration, as a day for celebrating Europe in the 21st century."
"The reports all contain many positive points and we can now safely say, enthusiastically and without fear of exaggeration, that it is time to move on to the next stage."
"The reports are steeped in optimism and the grumblers need to make way."
"We need to look at the wood, not the tree."
"History and politics are marching hand in hand."
"Now is the time to move up a gear."
"Now is the time for Europe to go forward and meet its destiny and put ideological flesh on the bones of enlargement."
"Allow me now to move from the general to the specific question of the last two islands in the Mediterranean which are island states, Cyprus and Malta, which have now set their cap at membership of the European Union."
"If any area of Europe is ready, they are, especially Cyprus."
"From this point of view, it is here that the logic of enlargement will be judged not only on the basis of economic or other criteria, but also on the basis of respect for more general principles which should govern our perception of the future of Europe, a Europe of peace, a Europe of the people, a Europe of states, a Europe of equality and a Europe which respects human rights."
"In this sense, I think that, if anything, it will be Cyprus on which Europe' s ability to look itself in the face politically will be judged."
"Cyprus and Malta will prove to Europe that it accepts enlargement on general terms, not for reasons of geographical symmetry, but in order to achieve the political integration of united peoples, united cultures and united prospects."
"Mr President, the debate that has taken place today will be remembered as one of the most significant demonstrations of the European Parliament' s work on the enlargement process."
"I wish to express my gratitude, mainly to the authors of these two reports, but also to Mr Moscovici and Commissioner Verheugen, for their interventions."
"They managed to be both realistic and pragmatic in their analyses, without losing sight of the far-thinking objectives that give real meaning to the European project."
"Despite the obvious differences in points of view, we have seen broad consensus on the fundamental aspects of the issue."
"Amongst these, I would highlight the following: the full inclusion of each new country in the European Union means complete commitment, bringing together economic convergence and partnership in a political project."
"This project has various characteristics which the candidate countries and current Member States absolutely must respect, otherwise enlargement will do nothing but dilute our current strengths."
"Amongst the characteristics that must define the identity of the European project, the most prominent are cohesion and solidarity between Member States, democracy, the ethic of responsibility, the social dimension and equal opportunities."
"Lastly, Mr President, the fact that this debate is taking place at a time when Germany is celebrating the tenth anniversary of its reunification should give us food for thought."
"We have exorcised the ghosts of the past."
"Although the twentieth century was marked by the greatest possible disunity in Europe, with two terrible wars, the twenty-first century will see the peoples of Europe unite, if we want this to happen."
"They will unite in a common project, which is unmistakably a project of peace between Europeans and between Europe and the rest of the world."
"Mr President, I come from a country, Sweden, in which there is still quite a lot of scepticism about the EU project."
"People do, however, rally in large numbers around one issue, namely that of enlargement."
"One might well wonder why."
"I believe that the opportunity for transforming the EU into a form of pan-European cooperation lends legitimacy to the enlargement process."
"The gains are mainly to be found at the political level."
"It is fantastic that countries on this continent which only ten or so years ago were divided are to make joint decisions on matters of common interest in the near future."
"This transformation has benefits in terms of democracy and provides the opportunity to create peace and stability in the future."
"It has to be recognised that it is about joining forces economically, but this can also give rise to major economic gains in the future as our market increases and there is increased growth in Europe."
"We shall see benefits in terms of the environment."
"I myself live close to the Baltic, which matters to us all."
"When we devise common rules which improve the environment, we create better conditions of life for the future."
"That is our common task."
"The report states that each country must accede to the EU on its own merits."
"It is important that this should happen and that a country should be able to become a member of the EU when it is ready to join."
"We now have two tasks before us: firstly, to encourage the Member States not to abandon their efforts, which is why we need to present a target date soon; and secondly to lead the debate with the people in our own countries so that this project enjoys legitimacy in the future too."
"Mr President, Commissioner Verheugen said this afternoon that there would be no social or environmental dumping as a result of enlargement."
"I believe this is an important goal and all those involved must do their bit to ensure that we achieve this goal."
"The points raised by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy in the Brok report are the steps we need to take to this end, and it is essential that we take them if we are to counteract any slowing of the pace on the European environmental policy front."
"My group therefore supports the proposal to limit the transitional periods in the environmental sphere to a maximum of five years."
"Our political demand is for the problem areas of water, air and waste to be made a priority."
"If transitional periods are to be granted, then it would be both necessary and helpful to include realistic interim goals in the accession treaty, and to regard failure to attain these interim goals as a violation of the treaty."
"Parliament must be given the information it needs to be able to assess the situation in the candidate countries."
"Annual reports from the Commission allow us to follow the implementation process."
"The issue of nuclear safety is one of the major challenges facing the enlargement process."
"The efforts that have already been made in this sphere demonstrate that this is another area where the enlargement process represents a golden opportunity to achieve greater security in the candidate countries, and indeed in the whole of Europe."
"This translates into greater security for the people in the candidate countries and greater security for all the people of Europe."
"Nuclear power stations of first generation Soviet construction are a particular danger as far as Europe is concerned."
"We call upon the candidate countries to shut down those of their nuclear power stations that they cannot refit, by the date of accession at the very latest."
"I have three particular nuclear power stations in mind, and they are Bohunice, Ignalina and Kosloduj."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we cannot afford to underestimate the importance and potential implications of this historic opportunity to unite our continent and live in peace."
"As politicians, we must give this momentous process our unequivocal support, even though there are still many aspects to be discussed and negotiated."
"The political vision endures."
"The responsibility that we parliamentarians bear at this time must enable future generations to live in peace and freedom on our continent."
"The standard of living will rise in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe as a result of a market-orientated economy, and underpinned by democratic forms of government."
"Even though it will not be easily won, we have chosen the right path."
"We Austrians are particularly interested in and affected by enlargement in view of our geographical position."
"I personally remember the Iron Curtain only too well, because my farm was only a few kilometres away from it."
"I would still much rather face the problems that have arisen as a result of opening the borders, than have to continue living with my back to the wall of the Iron Curtain, as we had to for decades."
"As well as giving enlargement unequivocal support, I would stress that it should take place as soon as possible."
"Agriculture, in particular, has an important role to play, because far more people are employed in this sector in the candidate countries than they are in the EU."
"We must tell the candidate countries that they must make the necessary structural changes, so as to be competitive in the future market, and they must increase the number of employment opportunities available in rural areas."
"The SAPARD programme provides an excellent opportunity to this end, and I welcome with open arms the fact that the Commission has already approved six programmes."
"Transitional periods and arrangements should be kept as short as possible, but one thing I would stress is that the acquis communautaire must be adopted in full."
"Particular attention should be given to health, plant health and, above all, the environmental conditions and issues that are so important to us as consumers, and also as farmers, so as to maintain consumer confidence."
"The reform of the common agricultural policy must form an efficient basis for the multifunctional activities that the farmers perform in all areas."
"The fundamental alignment of the European agricultural model and the development of the rural area will not produce a conflict of interests between the farmers of the EU and those in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe."
"We want to solve problems together and go forward into the future together."
"Mr President, it is essential for us to adopt a positive approach to enlargement."
"The environment, for example, is an area that will benefit enormously from enlargement, along with many others."
"Nevertheless, it will mean we will require clear rules governing the way enlargement takes place."
"It is vital for the environment that we have a well-defined arena for transitional measures and that it is clearly stated how to proceed during the transitional period."
"We speak a lot about how enlargement should be financed."
"We have assets allocated in the budget according to the requirements of Agenda 2000, but we have to take care that the funds we need, which are required particularly in the area of the environment, are available specifically prior to membership."
"The funds have to be channelled more strongly to action preceding enlargement than is presently the case according to the proposals in Agenda 2000."
"Only in this way can we ensure that the acts will be implemented."
"And, in addition, we really must see to it at the same time that the proper administrative practices are in place."
"Overall the costs of enlargement have been highlighted very considerably in public debate."
"So it was very cheering to hear Klaus Hänsch, speaking for the PSE Group, hope that he Commission would make a real appraisal of the effects of enlargement, including the economic impact if enlargement were not to take place."
"Just consider the costs we would incur if the divide were to continue, and what this would mean both socially and in terms of the environment."
"Mr President, Commissioner, many of the Members have already pointed out that enlargement is a major, ambitious goal."
"I would like to add that it is also a moral duty of Western Europe: 11 years ago, the Soviet system came to an end and the countries involved turned to us in hope."
"We must respond to this hope with generosity and farsightedness."
"Certainly, we must not disregard the difficulties involved in the project."
"For our part, we must implement the institutional reforms and they, on their side, must carry out major internal reforms respecting the Copenhagen and other criteria."
"In this respect, I would mention the amendments tabled by Mrs Oostlander to the reports on the Czech Republic and on Slovenia, calling for the issues regarding the minorities, which have not yet been resolved, to be tackled."
"I refer, for example, to the long drawn-out dispute involving the Italian community in Slovenia."
"In addition to the details and more specific issues, we must not lose sight of the historic import of this process."
"The debate which has been developing recently has thrown up four key issues: the date for the conclusion of negotiations, the accession date, the order in which the new countries are to join the Union and the transitional periods."
"My Group announced its desire to see the first negotiations concluded by 2003, making accession possible by June 2004."
"Certainly, the debate over the order in which the countries are to join the Union remains open, partly because the state of progress of their internal reforms will have to be assessed."
"I would consider it wise to adopt a solution which is a good compromise between an enlargement process which is not too spread out over time, which would certainly prove traumatic for our institutions, and an enlargement process which takes into account the legitimate timetabling expectations of the countries."
"As regard the transitional periods, I feel that we must be careful not to fall into the temptation to use them to reduce the impact of enlargement, thus detracting from the fact that the new countries belong to the European Union, in an endeavour to comply with the timetable we have set ourselves."
"On the other hand, it is true that these transitional periods can, if granted appropriately and in moderation, with great transparency, balance and a sense of accountability, prove to be in the general interest of all the countries."
"Mr President, our task in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, was primarily to assess the situation in the candidate countries with regard to the internal market and the relevant legislation."
"But, as has been stressed repeatedly here today, since this concerns one of the key aspects of European enlargement, and the progress made here can only really be assessed with reference to detail, I would again express my regret that we are having this enlargement debate at a time when the Commission' s progress reports 2000 are as yet unavailable."
"Only on the basis of these could we form a just impression of the progress made in the individual States."
"We must therefore content ourselves with a rather sweeping assessment that probably does not give an accurate reflection of the situation in the individual States."
"We can take it as read that considerable strides have been made, particularly since the last reports were published."
"As Vice-President of our joint parliamentary committee with the Czech Republic, I can vouch for the fact that this is true of the Czech Republic, but I assume the same applies to a number of other States too."
"The internal market is a key component in the success of enlargement and it is therefore clear to me that we must tread extremely carefully when it comes to exemptions and transitional periods."
"However, in common with our rapporteur, Mr Wuermeling, I believe that it would not be in the interests of either party to the treaty for there to be no transitional periods, and being a delegate from a border region, who, like Mrs Schierhuber, owns a farm in the vicinity of the Czech border, it is a matter of concern to me that the formation of close, common economic areas should be managed without any major problems, and lead to a positive outcome on both sides."
"I would like to close with a comment from the report by Mr Schröder, which pleased me enormously, and which, as I see it, also captures the spirit of what Commissioner Verheugen said at the beginning of this debate."
"Although the following statement by Mr Schröder only relates to the Czech Republic, I believe the same applies across the board: 'Many weaknesses that are still discernible in the Czech Republic are the legacy of decades of dictatorship."
"This being so, politicians from the part of Europe which after the Second World War enjoyed a happier fate, - and this is particularly true of Austria - would be well-advised to be moderate in their criticism of the countries such as the Czech Republic.'"
"Mr President, I am pleased to be able to make my two-minute contribution to this hotch potch of a discussion, which, given the time of day - and I intend to spend one of my allotted minutes on making this criticism - certainly underlines how little regard we have for the importance of the issue."
"It is simply disgraceful that we are debating the enlargement and expansion of the European Union - which affects 100 million people - at midnight."
"We ought to stop and think whether it is right for our parliamentary debate on this issue to be treated as if it were a kind of afterthought."
"It is little wonder that the people beyond these walls do not give us the respect and attention befitting a Parliament, when that is how we behave."
"I will now use my second minute to talk about Slovenia."
"I am delighted that the report has turned out to be so positive and that Slovenia - and as leader of the delegation I was able to check this out repeatedly, and in fact the Commissioner was there with me on more than one occasion - has made truly enormous efforts to fulfil the criteria."
"There are certainly still a few things to be done and there are still a few issues that need to be clarified."
"After all, the Copenhagen criteria are not just something static that countries have to achieve once and then keep to; they are to be used, or rather, applied on an ongoing basis."
"We in the European Union also undertake regular checks as to whether human rights are being upheld in the proper manner everywhere."
"In this sense, it is a process of development, which we follow attentively, but we hope that Slovenia will continue to hold this positive position and that it will be in the first group."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have picked the right moment to discuss enlargement."
"The fact that there has been a reunited Germany in the European Union for ten years now, bears witness to the solidarity between us. Other countries should now be given the chance to share in this, even though enlargement is not just about solidarity."
"The Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism incorporated its position on the Rack report into the Brok report."
"As a Social Democrat, there are three points I would like to highlight."
"Firstly, we need a more ambitious transport infrastructure programme for the candidate countries."
"That is why the Financial Perspective does not appear to us to go far enough, because there is a huge disparity between the diagnosed infrastructure requirements and the financing instruments made available by the Union, together with the candidate countries' own means, and it will only be possible to implement public private partnership financing models to a limited extent."
"However, it is politically unacceptable for there to be development periods in excess of 50 years."
"Secondly, the transeuropean corridors are defined intermodally."
"We should make a virtue out of something that was born of necessity; i.e. there was a need to localise major trends in goods and passenger movements. In other words, we should keep the integration of modes of transport in mind right from the start."
"In addition the traditionally robust sector of goods transport by rail should receive the most support."
"In this way, we might avoid having to implement as many regeneration measures at a later stage, as we are having to do in our own countries now."
"Thirdly, we want transitional periods for goods transport by road, which will enable there to be a gradual opening up."
"They could even start in the pre-accession period. It is in the interests of both sides to achieve economic and social balance during integration of the transport markets, because we are already waiting with bated breath as to the consequences of distorted competition on our roads."
"Mr President, there was relatively little comment regarding Elmar Brok' s idea expressed today of an arrangement similar to the EEA Agreement as an alternative for those applicant countries that do not meet the Copenhagen criteria."
"I think the suggestion is worth looking into."
"The EEA Agreement is definitely no substitute for proper membership and must not leave countries in a waiting room for an eternity, from which there would be no chance of moving forward, but it could act as a sort of tool for encouraging the applicant countries, in a way that promises a reward, to implement the acquis communautaire."
"The EEA could act as a kind of hatchery, where EU embryos would mature into fully fledged members"
"If full membership is granted in the context of a brief timetable, a big cause for concern for companies in the Member States will be the long transitional periods, as competition will be distorted."
"On the other hand, a slow pace is also an obvious problem, leaving the candidate countries frustrated."
"The good sense of the EEA model was born of this tension, as it rewards the applicant at the stage of aspiring to accession."
"This would mean greater commitment to the implementation of EU legislation than what is required in the present convergence agreements."
"The EEA, which contains issues relating to the first pillar, would give businesses in the applicant countries access to the Internal Market and youth and science the right to engage in exchange programmes, but, on the other hand, would not yet oblige the EU to extend their agricultural aid schemes to these countries."
"Thus, the EEA Agreement could act as a positive stimulus mainly to the economies of the applicant countries - they need growth to make their societies fit for accession - but also to the EU economy, as through economic growth we can reckon to cover as much as two thirds of the costs of enlargement, perhaps even more with the EEA model in place."
"The eastern Central European markets are said to be so open as a result of the convergence agreements that western businessmen might selfishly wonder why enlargement is still required."
"The answer is the implementation of the acquis communautaire."
"If the markets were opened up even with restrictions without the proper means of regulating them socially and ecologically, nothing would protect the citizens of an applicant country against social and ecological dumping."
"In the end we also need to protect ourselves from it."
"The good sense of the EEA model is based on the idea that efforts to implement legislation should be rewarded immediately."
"Benefits and responsibilities go hand in hand."
"An EEA model, which led to membership, and, at the same time, was a reward scheme, would be productive also as far as public opinion was concerned."
"As the positive aspects for the economy would be highlighted already prior to membership proper, it would be a basis for justifying enlargement to the greatest possible degree."
"This holds good for both the citizens of the applicant countries and those of the present Member States."
"Mr President, it is to be hoped that the fact that the issue of equal opportunities is the last point to be discussed in the report on enlargement, is no reflection of its status, although it sometimes looks that way."
"It is therefore all the more important that equal treatment for men and women should be incorporated into the acquis communautaire as a fundamental human rights issue, and that establishing the necessary institutions in this sphere should be a crucial precondition to the implementation of the acquis communautaire."
"Accordingly, equal opportunities must be accorded the same importance, and be discussed with the same level of commitment as all the other issues that feature on the agenda of the accession negotiations."
"The candidate countries' legislative programmes and guidelines must include implementation mechanisms that allow for equal opportunities and clearly prohibit discrimination."
"We must facilitate this process through dialogue with the European Parliament and back up from experts, and through the involvement of NGOs, associations and organisations, and financial aid."
"The public and private institutions in the candidate countries must strive for equal opportunities in all political spheres, and involve issues specific to women in all social, economic and cultural areas."
"It is well worth setting up public advice centres for women, which offer women on-the-spot advice, help and mediation."
"Special attention must be given to employment policy."
"Equal access to education and training, and in consequence of this, the same pay for the same work, is a must."
"The candidate countries should also be encouraged to participate in the Community programmes for equal opportunities, and particularly those concerned with violence against women."
"It is statistically proven that since the détente with countries of Eastern Europe, there has been a 10% increase in violence against women there."
"Likewise, business is booming in the brutal trade in women."
"Both the EU and the candidate states should now be doing their utmost to condemn and fight these forms of violence and the trade in women."
"A great deal of progress has already been made, I am glad to say, but these countries must not direct all their efforts at economic harmonisation alone."
"Mutual respect, consideration for, and fair treatment of, each other, must form one of the main pillars of our European Community."
"Mr President, for Sweden' s Christian Democratic Party, eastern enlargement is the EU' s main priority."
"After two horrific world wars and fifty years of Communist oppression and dictatorship when - in the name of an oppressive class struggle - democracy, religious freedom, the environment and our Christian and universal dignity as human beings were trampled on, it is now finally time to unite our continent and our part of the world."
"I want to address Commissioner Verheugen personally with a few comments but, before that, I wish to affirm that we Christian Democrats in Sweden have never doubted that Mr Verheugen wants to see enlargement towards the East and that the criticism that has been directed against him has been partly motivated by malice."
"I should now like to comment on the following points."
"Firstly, allow each candidate country to negotiate on the basis of its own merits."
"Let it be worth a country' s while to be ambitious in achieving the EU objectives."
"Secondly, say no to the big bang idea of incorporating candidate countries simultaneously as a large group, since that would militate against the principle that each country should be admitted on its own merits."
"Thirdly, gradually devise target dates for each candidate country."
"Fourthly, demonstrate strong European solidarity by means of financial contributions in favour of better environmental conditions in the Eastern countries, bearing in mind the appalling environmental legacy from Communist times from which they suffer."
"Fifthly, and so as to be able to admit new candidate countries, make no new demands for a further intergovernmental conference and for further Treaty changes after Nice."
"Sixthly and lastly, ensure that existing Member States display solidarity and discernment regarding deepening cooperation so that we do not create an EU again divided into A, B and C teams."
"Let us unify Europe."
"Mr President, Commissioner, allow me to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Brok, and the rapporteurs of the individual reports on each candidate country for their extremely thorough and balanced work."
"In particular, I trust and hope that, understandable difficulties notwithstanding, the negotiated procedure with Bulgaria and Romania will proceed smoothly and without delay so that, once the necessary conditions are in place, these two Balkan countries can join the European Union, thereby consolidating progress, security and peace in south-eastern Europe as a whole."
"Finally, I would especially like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Poos, and to express my satisfaction at the success of accession negotiations with Cyprus, which have advanced further than with any other candidate country, with 16 chapters already dealt with, which doubtless augurs well for an auspicious final outcome."
"Naturally, we all hope that the Cyprus question will be resolved in the meantime in accordance with the UN resolutions and the summit agreements, so that all the indigenous - I repeat indigenous - population of the island, Greek-Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot, can enjoy the benefits of membership."
"If, however, the universally-acknowledged constructive stand of the Cypriot Government notwithstanding, this proves to be impossible due to unwavering refusal on the Turkish side, then I believe that the European Union should not allow the integration of Cyprus to be held hostage to Turkish intransigence and that, on the contrary, it should immediately accept the Republic of Cyprus as a member of the Union pending integration of the island as a whole at a later date, as happened with one of the founder members, the anniversary of the unification of which we are celebrating here today."
"Finally, I should like to take this opportunity to endorse the thoughts and concerns of many of my fellow members regarding the need for an assiduous and long-overdue examination of the question of the borders of Europe and, consequently, of the extent of enlargement, and the need, if any, for a special report on the subject by the European Parliament."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as the last speaker, I would like briefly to go into four particular points again."
"Firstly, as we see it, enlargement is not merely an obligation."
"It is true that we are motivated by moral considerations, but we are also committed to enlargement owing to deeply held political convictions."
"Enlargement is a win-win situation."
"Both sides: the Member States of the European Union and the candidate countries, stand to benefit from enlargement once it has taken place."
"Secondly, enlargement - both the enlargement of the European Union and that of the Economic and Monetary Union - is about fulfilling criteria."
"There are the Copenhagen criteria to be fulfilled on the one hand, and those of Maastricht on the other."
"It should be made clear to all countries that accession to the European Union is not quite the same thing as accession to the Economic and Monetary Union and to the euro zone, and that there are different deadlines."
"It is clear that there is to be no opting out of the Economic and Monetary Union, and no bargaining during either set of negotiations."
"Thirdly, we must do our utmost to prepare the European Union for the enlargement process, by 2003, in the spirit of the splendid speech made by President of the Commission, Mr Prodi."
"Fourthly - and it is very important to me to make this point by way of conclusion - notwithstanding the pacts that are to be fulfilled, the enlargement process is a political process."
"It is about people' s hopes and fears, opportunities and risks, prejudice and fact."
"We must accord this political process the historic importance it deserves and enter into discussion with the citizens."
"We need to politicise the politics of the enlargement process if we are to have the ability to engage in meaningful conversation with the citizens."
"The enlargement process and the Economic and Monetary Union are not just a matter for the European institutions."
"I call upon the Member States and all public mandate holders and media at all levels to become more actively involved in this process, because only then will we be able to do justice to public confidence in these initiatives, the objects of which are in the interests of us all."
"That concludes the joint debate."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"(The sitting was closed at 10.45 p.m.)"
"Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting"
"The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, with regard to yesterday' s debate on Slovakia, I should like to point out that Belgium and other countries have introduced a visa requirement for Slovakia."
"I regard that as discrimination."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in his policy statement yesterday, Mr Prodi, the President of the Commission, said that whoever weakened any institution of the European Union weakened the Union as a whole."
"We have, of course, debated the relations between the Commission and the Council here."
"I should like to refer to the relations between Parliament and the Council and to highlight the fact that there have recently been considerable delays in the Council's replies to our written questions."
"Let me cite two examples."
"In September 1999 I asked a question on the subject of Hombach."
"It was answered in February 2000."
"I submitted a written question on the subject of European flight safety in February 2000 and am still awaiting a reply."
"Whoever weakens any institution weakens the entire Union."
"I have the impression that the Council in particular has now decided to ignore questions from Parliament."
"That is unacceptable!"
"If we are to preserve the balance between the institutions, I believe we must take steps to ensure that this defect is rectified."
"Thank you."
"Are there any other comments on the Minutes?"
"There are none."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Mr President, this very day we are going to enthusiastically approve - and with great interest in my case - the reports on enlargement involving candidate countries such as the Czech Republic, which is the subject of Mr Jürgen Schröder' s report."
"However, I must express my concern - and I ask that the Presidency communicate this to the Prague authorities - at the fact that two young Spaniards, Gaizka Azcona Cueva, 22 years old, and Mikel Oliva Martínez, 21 years old, have been detained arbitrarily since last Tuesday - nearly ten days."
"It is worrying that this can happen in a country which is going to join the European Union."
"Mr Marset Campos, we shall certainly take note of your statement."
"I am sure that Mrs Fontaine will do all that needs to be done."
"Agenda"
"The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has requested that the debate on the oral question to the Commission on the rights of language teachers, which is currently scheduled to take place on Friday morning, be postponed until the next part-session."
"I give the floor to Mr MacCormick, who will present the request on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"Mr President, the question concerning language teachers which has been put down for this Friday comes from the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"It was the intention of those who tabled that question in the committee that it should come before the House accompanied by a motion for a resolution."
"We are discussing a serious matter."
"From time to time it is rightly said in this House that a citizens' Europe would be a Europe in which rights were properly enshrined in the law of the Union."
"That would be no good if rights already in the law can be flouted by the Member States."
"Twelve years ago the Court of Justice gave a judgment against Italy in the case of the foreign language lecturers."
"There have been two further judgments since then and the rights of these lecturers have not yet been satisfied."
"In my opinion, and I say it in the presence of a former attorney-general of Ireland, the Commission has not yet shown sufficient resoluteness in pursuing this matter."
"It is important that we have a question and debate with a resolution at the end of it."
"I ask it to be sent back to committee for preparation."
"We have now heard Mr MacCormick' s proposal, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"Does anyone wish to speak in favour of this request?"
"Mr President, it may surprise you to learn that I do indeed wish to raise a point of order."
"I note from the Minutes that the aforementioned ..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"I am very sorry, Mr Wuermeling, but the Minutes have been approved."
"I asked three times if there were any comments and the Minutes are now deemed to be approved."
"I am genuinely sorry, but I must stop you there."
"I was asking if anyone wished to speak in favour of the committee' s request."
"Mr President, I rise to support the request by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market that this item be delayed until the next part-session in order to provide the opportunity to propose the inclusion of a resolution on this subject."
"Excellent."
"Does anyone wish to speak against the proposal?"
"No one does."
"I shall now put the request from the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market for a postponement to the vote."
"(Parliament gave its assent)"
"Animal nutrition"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"(A5-0257/2000) by Mrs Paulsen, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on a proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on undesirable substances and products in animal nutrition (COM(1999) 654 - C5-0344/1999 - 1999/0259(COD))"
"(A5-0256/2000) by Mrs Paulsen, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on a proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 1995/53/EC fixing the principles governing the organisation of official inspections in the field of animal nutrition and Council Directive 1999/29/EC on undesirable substances and products in animal nutrition (COM(2000) 162 - C5-0165/2000 - 2000/0068(COD))."
"Mr President, today we are to discuss, and perhaps vote on, a total of three reports which deal with this subject, two of them mine."
"They constitute the first steps on the long, long road towards ensuring food safety for all 370 million inhabitants of Europe."
"We might well hope that, before the whole of this package is in place, there will be very many more of us, as citizens, who are affected by these rules."
"This is the first step, and it is now also a question of establishing incredibly important principles before the work as a whole begins."
"The first of my reports concerns foreign substances in animal nutrition."
"The most important changes which the Commission has proposed and which I support are to the effect that the directive should include absolutely every imaginable product intended for animal nutrition, including products used to feed what I call small animals, that is to say cats, dogs, guinea pigs etc.. The rules are designed to apply in the first place, however, to feedingstuffs for those animals we eat ourselves."
"After what has happened in the European market, it ought to be crystal-clear to us all now that, as human beings, we get to eat what we give to our animals."
"The other important principle is the so-called dilution ban."
"This means that, if a batch of raw materials for foodstuffs has unduly high limit values, it should not be diluted down in undamaged batches in order in that way to escape the limit values."
"The Commission' s proposal removes those rules which entitle local and national authorities to local derogations."
"My report supports this."
"We know that the foreign substances in question are very rarely acutely poisonous substances, but are long-term and long-lived substances which can build up, such as dioxin and aflotoxin and heavy metals such as cadmium, lead and mercury."
"We know that the levels of these substances are constantly increasing in our food chain."
"The percentages are increasing slowly and continually in the earth, in feedingstuffs and in food. It is therefore important that we start the preventive process by removing a portion of these products from the chain."
"The percentages must not constantly increase in the body throughout life."
"We know, for example, that, in the long term, cadmium obstructs the kidneys in both animals and human beings."
"We know that dioxin and aflotoxin are carcinogenic etc."
"I totally agree with all the proposals tabled by the Commission on this issue."
"Moreover - and this is important because it is to come up at the vote - the Commission wants to introduce something called an intervention level."
"For all these substances, there is, as it were, a natural background level of constant 'white noise' ."
"We shall never escape this altogether."
"We have therefore set a limit value which may not be exceeded."
"The intervention level is a level at which vigilance is to be exercised and provides an opportunity to launch an investigation when it is discovered that a substance in a product or in a geographical area is increasing above the background level but still remains below the level at which it must be banned, that is to say the limit at which we must intervene."
"This is a crucial and important point in preventive work."
"In the long term, it is very important that we should be able to begin an investigation in peace and quiet and try to stop the increase in a particular substance before it reaches this emergency limit value."
"This is something which everyone at each stage in the food chain should in fact help with."
"If we let the matter rest until the limit value has been reached, the measures to be taken become very drastic."
"It is then a case of catastrophe intervention of the 'dioxin in Belgium' type."
"It is important for us to apply the precautionary principle in such a way that we can cope successfully with increases in foreign substances."
"In both of these re-worked draft directives, I have tried to use a form of language which is readable."
"A legal text should be precise enough for it to be possible to comply with it."
"I also believe, however, that it is Parliament' s responsibility to try to produce laws, rules and regulations in the European Union which can be understood by our fellow citizens who have to comply with them and who need to read them."
"I have therefore made a lot of the language more straightforward and tried to simplify matters and make them crystal-clear."
"When it comes to limit values, which must be set extremely rigorously in the future to check unwelcome developments, I would ask you to take account of the problems which low limit values, for example for dioxin, will mean for, for example, fishing communities in the Baltic, in parts of the North Sea and probably in Mediterranean coastal areas."
"I would also ask you to take account of farmers whose fields border either very busy roads or industries which have contaminated large areas."
"Many of these instances of poisoning or cases in which heavy metals were dispersed occurred before there was sufficient environmental awareness and before it was known what the effects would be."
"We cannot find the culprits."
"I would ask that we take account of these individual fishermen and farmers in future because they are innocent and are being hit by financial ruin."
"When it comes to the directive on the official control of the field of animal nutrition, it is important that we really do have a form of inspection which is implemented and which is the same throughout the European Union."
"If inspection is not complied with and we are not in a position to inspect the inspectors, then all the thinking being done in connection with the safety of our fellow citizens will be undermined."
"The people of Europe cannot, however, properly rely upon such control' s really being carried out if there are major differences of approach between Member States and regions."
"The second thing we must take into consideration is the fact that differences in the application of these inspection rules will mean serious disruption of the internal market."
"There will be a price to pay for safe food at every stage in the chain."
"It would therefore be dangerous if certain countries, areas or industries were to be able to escape inspection and compete over prices at the expense of safety."
"That would be an extremely undesirable situation."
"Mr President, as Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I am delivering this opinion for Mrs Auroi, who drafted it for the committee."
"The majority of the committee adopted amendments to the opinion, amendments to which Mrs Auroi did not wish to subscribe."
"That is why it now falls to me to deliver the opinion, and I want to make the House clearly aware of this conflict of views."
"The problem we have been considering is that of minimum and maximum values and the issue of dilution."
"You know that, during the BSE crisis, Parliament constantly called for these stricter directives and regulations for animal feed, and we also insisted that there must be no dilution, because maximum values, of course, always mean that something is in the feed and that we are making animals or people the final repositories of such substances, however minimal their volume."
"At that time we said that, if we accept maximum values, there must also be a dilution ban."
"Our rapporteur had proposed that basic substances, components, which were not authorised for human consumption should not be used in animal feed either and would therefore have to be diluted with other substances until their content fell below the maximum permitted value."
"She also examined the other side of the coin."
"There are areas where farmers grow basic substances which exceed these maximum values."
"What about the people who produce these substances?"
"Mrs Auroi said that they were helpless to prevent the excessively high values."
"At the same time, those who obtain these feed products cannot help the fact that the farmers are unable to alter the nature of their produce!"
"That was the essence of the conflict."
"I can understand why the rapporteur dissociated herself from the amended opinion."
"Let me make a suggestion to the Commission as to how this problem could be tackled."
"If this type of dilution is permitted, there must at least be a requirement to notify the monitoring bodies, and the fact that such dilution occurs must be made public, because the public also need to be aware of this problem and discuss it."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we should bear in mind the fact that one of the new features in the White Paper on food safety was the 'farm to table' idea, which made farmers directly responsible for the quality and the safety of the animal and vegetable raw materials that they produce."
"Almost a year after the publication of this paper and following many food crises, many of them linked directly to animal nutrition, Mrs Paulsen' s report is the first investigation of the role of animal nutrition in food safety."
"This is something we must all welcome."
"One of the strong points of the proposal is the principle of non-dilution, which prohibits using healthy feedingstuffs to dilute a batch of animal feedingstuffs contaminated by, for example, dioxins."
"This is the position Mrs Paulsen, from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, has adopted."
"This was also my position as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture."
"The amendments proposed by members of the Group of the European People' s Party, Mrs Klass, Mrs Jeggle and Mr Sturdy, have made it possible to reintroduce dilution in the proposal adopted by the Committee on Agriculture."
"As I personally am not prepared to sacrifice food safety on the altar of the agri-food lobbies, I have withdrawn my name from the report."
"Try as I might, ladies and gentlemen, I cannot understand the Group of the European People' s Party which, despite the successive crises, involving Belgian chickens contaminated by dioxins, French sewage sludge in animal feed or Dutch sump oils in cooking oil, wishes to continue to poison European consumers to some extent."
"Their idea is that we should not have to destroy a batch of products just because it is contaminated with dioxins!"
"It would be much better to add healthy products until an acceptable level of pollution is reached."
"Ladies and gentlemen of the Group of the European People' s Party, now that we have the White Paper, the precautionary principle and the principle of food safety, the only acceptable level of pollution in feedingstuffs for animals that will end up on our plate is the zero level measureable today. This is because dioxins are products that build up in the body."
"If we were to continue to allow dilution, this dioxin present in animal feedingstuffs would first build up in the animal, and then, to an even greater degree, this toxic product would gradually accumulate throughout the consumer' s body."
"We must therefore join Mrs Paulsen and the Commission and adopt the principle of non-dilution in order to make animal nutrition safe and to effectively protect European consumers."
"With regard to inspections, the Commission' s proposal for a directive on inspections in the field of animal nutrition stems from the report by Mr Staes."
"This reiterates and specifies the factors that are essential if we are to overcome the kind of aberration seen in the dioxin crisis in the summer of 1999."
"This report seeks to prevent poor coordination between national and European institutions."
"As draftsman of the opinion, I approve of the main amendments proposed by the Commission, such as the establishment of national contingency operational plans, giving the Commission the option to adopt interim protection measures, the obligation on Member States to inform the Commission as soon as contamination or serious risk thereof is detected, and the creation of a legal basis in this field."
"It should be emphasised that inspections must take place on three levels in order to enable an emergency system to be established."
"The first level of inspection is the responsibility of the animal nutrition producing companies themselves as well as the farmers, who ought to be the most directly concerned with ensuring the quality and safety of the products that they use."
"The second level, of course, involves the Member States, who are responsible for carrying out inspections of food safety."
"The third level, which is the subject of this amendment, establishes the Commission as the supreme guardian of food safety, authorising it to intervene in emergencies, without necessarily consulting Member States, and to adopt any interim measures necessitated by the emergency."
"This is all well and good, but Parliament must nevertheless identify its new role in this process."
"A slot must therefore be provided, at least at the end of the process, for the Commission to inform Parliament of the decisions that it has taken."
"What will the role of the European food agency provided for in the White Paper be, once it is up and running?"
"We must ensure, on the other hand, that this process does not cause the Member States, businesses or producers to shirk their responsibilities."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we want to guarantee the safety of animal feed and human foodstuffs, and to that end we need a workable European regulatory framework."
"The crises of recent years have made everyone, including ourselves, more keenly aware of the situation."
"One thing must be clearly emphasised: the dioxin crisis was the result of criminal infringements of the existing rules and regulations."
"The time has come for a review of the directives on food safety."
"In all our deliberations, however, we must be mindful of the entire supply chain; in other words, we need what Mr Glavany, the French President of the Council, has called a quality pact between society, industry and agriculture."
"The correlation must be seen, from natural production via industrial processing to marketing."
"When setting maximum values, we must remember that nature has its own set of laws, that harvests vary from year to year and that farmers are ultimately harmed by environmental effects over which they have no control."
"For that reason I call on the Commission and the Council to create liability provisions which protect farmers and their land, by which I mean that they must make the compensatory regimes workable and ensure that the provisions are based on the polluter-pays principle."
"The 1999 Directive was well thought-out, and it has already scored its first success by demonstrably reducing pollution levels."
"For that reason, I am starting to wonder whether we actually need tighter rules."
"What I think we really need is action against criminal offences."
"I should like to inform the House that Amendments Nos 41, 42, 43 and 44, which the PPE-DE Group tabled, have been withdrawn."
"What is new in the present proposal is that it gives Member States scope to operate with action thresholds, which would enable them to use their own discretion as long as the established ceilings were not exceeded."
"In the context of a necessary European regulatory system, such discretionary scope surely entails a risk to producers as well as jeopardising trade and transactions."
"There are dangers, and from this dangers in the internal market as well."
"A prescribed European regime must therefore lay down the line that we all have to follow."
"It is absolutely imperative that undesirable substances which are extremely toxic should be neither traded nor used in mixtures, and the withdrawal of the amendments does nothing to alter that position."
"Farmers have a right to flawless animal feed."
"Their economic success depends on healthy livestock."
"No rules can achieve anything if they cannot be strictly and comprehensively enforced."
"That is why the PPE-DE Group advocates effective controls, and we echo the rapporteur' s call for the food safety auditors in the Commission to be able to conduct unannounced on-the-spot inspections in close and constructive cooperation with the inspectorates of the Member States."
"Mr President, may I thank my colleagues who have already spoken."
"Now that I have heard Mrs Klass, I am now in a somewhat calmer frame of mind. Looking over towards Mr Böge, with whom I cooperated very closely, and towards the coordinator, Mr Goepel, I wish to express my thanks to them too for the withdrawal of Amendments Nos 41 to 44, which would have permitted the various blending options."
"I also say that very clearly in the context of the two reports we are dealing with here today. We want food safety, which means safe production from beginning to end of the food chain."
"That is something which this House has always unanimously advocated."
"During one of the greatest of all food crises, namely the BSE crisis, the House managed to cooperate in a spirit of mutual confidence, irrespective of party affiliations, and I should have found it very regrettable if, at such a juncture as this, a pseudo-interest group - for it would not have been a genuine interest group - had carried the day."
"During the BSE crisis, we always said - and Mr Böge was the foremost proponent of this view - that dioxin-contaminated milk must never be mixed with non-contaminated milk as a means of reducing the level of the undesirable substance below the maximum permitted value."
"We dealt in exactly the same way with all other matters relating to the blending ban."
"That is why I am grateful to the Commission for introducing this new element to its legislative proposal and to the rapporteur for her master strokes which have introduced slight additions and improvements to the proposal at several points."
"So what do we actually want?"
"Of course we do not wish to treat the manufacturers of compound feed and other animal feed in any way unfairly, nor do we wish to be unfair towards the poor farmers."
"But it is not the answer simply to permit blending."
"Perhaps a register showing contaminated areas would actually be a solution."
"But I will not accept waste incinerators!"
"Waste incinerators are no longer permitted to emit dioxins."
"If they still break the rules, it is not only to the detriment of farmers but to the population as a whole."
"Mrs Klass, would you be so kind as to listen to me?"
"I listened very patiently to you, although I sometimes find that difficult!"
"We must establish a register."
"We have long been demanding a dioxin register in the European Union which would show where contamination is occurring."
"And of course, where fields are close to motorways, we must look and see where heavy-metal contamination is occurring."
"In such circumstances I can certainly accept that farmers in those areas will go to their regional authorities and will tell the Commission too that regional planning, transport, road traffic and other factors are affecting the fields they have inherited from their fathers and that damage is occurring through no fault of their own."
"How shall we compensate them for this?."
"Mr Goepel here is making a gesture to indicate money."
"No question about that."
"Nor do I have any problem with allowing dilution or blending in the case of certain products, provided it is always carried out under the control of the Member State and of the Commission."
"That is something to be examined in due course."
"Let me say again that we shall be doing nobody any favours, nobody in this entire world - neither manufacturers nor farmers nor consumers - if we act here as if this were a conflict between farmers and manufacturers of food products or consumers."
"We all want the same thing and we have to say this very clearly here in Parliament."
"One more word on inspections."
"Yes, the Commission must be able to take protective measures."
"It can do that in the domain of foodstuffs, and it must also be able to do it in the domain of animal feed."
"If all of us were served animal feed in the canteen downstairs for a period of time, if we were able to see on our own plates exactly what animal feed is, we should perhaps deal with the issue rather differently and be just as hard and as stringent as we are on the safety of food for human consumption."
"Mr President, ""healthy and properly monitored from stable to table"" . That is now the phrase that sums up the policy on protecting consumers and the food chain that the European Union wanted."
"This was absolutely vital."
"The dioxin crisis that struck Belgium over a year ago made a deep impression on people all over Europe."
"This crisis not only cost billions of euros, but also resulted in even more suspicion about what we eat."
"More than ever before, the public is calling on us to act and is demanding strict standards, which will guarantee healthy food."
"This directive is the first link in a long series of decisions to be taken on food safety."
"What can I say in one minute?"
"Very briefly, we must insist on Amendment No 37, concerning dioxins."
"The standards that we are demanding are, admittedly, extremely high but, until more accurate scientific studies are available, we must not take any risks."
"PCBs and dioxins are toxic substances, even in very small quantities."
"Our rapporteur expressed what we should think of the principle of dilution. This would, to my mind, be an appalling message to send to consumers and producers."
"More than ever before, this consumer needs reassurance."
"This directive will contribute to food being, as I said before, healthy and of high quality from the stable to the table."
"This is what the public demands."
"Mr President, I should like to join all the other Members who have congratulated Mrs Paulsen, both on the quality of her report and on her openness to the various amendments that have been tabled."
"I would like to state at the outset that when we talk about undesirable substances and products, we immediately tend to think of dioxins and PCBs, but there are also heavy metals and, more generally, long-lasting organic pollutants which are by and large, as we know today, hormonal disrupters. In other words, even tiny amounts of these substances can have an effect."
"We must therefore adopt limit values, which are arrived at realistically, since our environment is already polluted by this type of substance, but which, at the same time, must also be as low as possible in order to limit the risks."
"I find it quite strange that the Commission' s proposal does not specify any limit values for PCBs and that it proposes limit values for dioxins only in the case of citrus pulp, which is really quite bizarre."
"The truth is that this is the result of a disastrous event that occurred two years ago."
"Incredibly high levels of dioxin were found in citrus pulp from Brazil due to the drying process to which they were subjected."
"Where heavy metals are concerned, there are many inconsistencies."
"The value limit for fish meal, for example, is different to the level proposed for non-marine animal derived products."
"On all these matters, my Group has tabled amendments, which, broadly speaking, have been accepted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy - to whom I am grateful - despite the vote against by the PPE-DE Members."
"I hope that the latter will change their minds for the plenary sitting, because I cannot see any arguments that could justify the inconsistencies in the Commission' s draft proposal."
"I therefore think that, given the prevailing attitude in the House, we can face the vote with confidence and hope to achieve a majority, which will enable us to put our point of view across at second reading."
"Mr President, I wish to congratulate Mrs Paulsen on her report."
"The detection of dioxins in citrus fruits that have been imported into the Community to serve as animal nutrition revealed the loopholes in current legislation on inspections."
"The public is worried and is demanding guarantees."
"Any threat to animal health will also automatically endanger human health."
"Zero risk is, of course, impossible, but an early warning system must nevertheless be put in place."
"Member States must, moreover, pay close attention to monitoring the implementation of texts."
"On this point we are in agreement."
"We do not think that it acceptable, on the other hand, to take advantage of this opportunity to extend the already myriad competences of the European Commission even further."
"It is all a pretext for further harmonisation as if viruses, germs and polluting particles were subject to the concept of freedom of movement."
"Let us dwell for a moment on the profound thoughts of those who are obsessed with harmonisation."
"If there are germs, let us harmonise health services!"
"If there are risks to food safety, let us harmonise what we eat through a common nutritional policy!"
"Let us harmonise away and, to monitor the outcome of all these acts of harmonisation, we shall have nothing less than the obedient uniformed Community crack troops to ensure that our way of thinking is properly implemented, because our Member States are naughty little rascals we need to keep an eye on!"
"Well, we will not put up with this cult of harmonisation any more!"
"Today, this idea of bringing everything into line, which is completely cut off from reality, is leading some people to call for spot checks, with no warning to the States in which Brussels has no confidence."
"This is unacceptable."
"But remember, ladies and gentlemen, that the legitimacy of our Community institutions and our own legitimacy depend entirely on the will of the peoples whom it is our duty to represent."
"It is time to break with a misguided interpretation of the principle of subsidiarity, which attempts to increase Brussels' s hold on our nations a little more each day."
"The amendment tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is today emblematic."
"You intend to destroy the sovereignty of our States by any means possible."
"Did you not hear the political warning given on 28 September by the Danish people?"
"Or do you think that there is ""something rotten in the State of Denmark"" ?"
"Maybe you have the same idea of democracy as the revolutionary Pierre-Louis 'Prieur' de la Marne, who told the Convention under the Terror, ""The people must be made happy, despite their wishes. The people must be forced to be free"" ."
"Our citizens are fed up with being forced to be happy, of being hampered a little more every day in their activities by petty, pernickety and stifling red tape."
"You ignore people' s sense of national allegiance and the role of the nation-state and the 'single mindset' which you embody is out-of-date and dangerous."
"It is smothering the idea of Europe."
"So for goodness' sake, save Europe, by ceasing to offer up harebrained and fanciful ideas to the idol of harmonisation."
"Mr President, I hope that the future will bring increasingly frequent and effective dialogue between the different elements in Parliament, for once again, this morning, I was listening to Members speaking, and can be little - or rather no - doubt that the position of the European People's Party was misinterpreted."
"We do not oppose the Paulsen report - we fully support it."
"There is a significant reason underlying our contribution, particularly regarding Article 5, which stems from the fact that, although this is a major, coherent instrument, its scope is still limited, for it concerns production measures and does not deal in any way with the commercial side of things."
"As a result, we European consumers will find ourselves continuing to buy meat and milk and their derivatives that are produced on the world markets using animal feedingstuffs which are in no way subject to the thresholds and limit values defined by the European Union, under a system which allows raw materials to be acquired on the international markets, where producers are free to mix all types of ingredients and formulations before selling their products on Union territory."
"We are calling for a comprehensive assessment of the issue precisely in order to afford better protection to farmers."
"In actual fact, a major measure such as the Paulsen report ends up having the adverse effect of opening the market to production systems whose quality is not sufficient to comply fully with the limits and threshold values which we require."
"This was the reason for our discussion in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and, when all is said and done, we would not like a repetition of what usually occurs, which is that when it comes to major measures it is always the farmers who pay the price, when they are the only guarantors of a production/agricultural land ratio which Parliament must preserve at all costs."
"I therefore invite all the Members to discuss the issue responsibly."
"We have absolutely no desire to defend specific interests; we simply want a compliant production system which does not involve going outside the market with measures of this kind."
"Mr President, it is the duty of this Parliament and this Commission to protect the health of all citizens of the European Union."
"That is what we are trying to do in this report, on which I congratulate Mrs Paulsen. Certainly the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy was the correct committee to bring these proposals forward in view of what we have heard."
"We have had to learn lessons from the dioxin scandal."
"The Commission has now proposed deleting the derogation for compound foodstuffs and having the option of fixing action thresholds below the maximum permitted limits in cases of real emergency."
"Like the rapporteur, I believe that there is a case for doing all these things and for looking at the substances she referred to when they are not in themselves toxic but show increases in the aggregated levels."
"Animal feed, which has proven to be unsafe, should certainly be removed from the food chain."
"That is not just a precaution, it is common sense."
"I want to sound one note of caution."
"Common sense has two sides."
"If we are going to propose that, for example, there should be a tenfold reduction in the materials which are permitted to enter the European Union for blending down by approved food manufacturers, we ought to be certain that there is a sound scientific basis for that proposal."
"The Commissioner will know that in my country the Independent Advisory Committee on Animal Feedingstuffs was worried that such a ban may actually drive out blending-down procedures into the world outside the EU where they are less likely to be correctly monitored and controlled for any future entry into the Union."
"The committee agreed that there needed to be upper limits for undesirable ingredients, above which the materials would have to be destroyed."
"By the second reading we need to have the Commission's view on how the risk assessment will be carried out."
"That is a very simple request which is not connected with any specific amendment proposed this first reading."
"It may well determine, however, how we can vote at that stage."
"I suspect it will also determine how we are able to make the case which the Commission quite properly wants to make for clean food in Europe, outside the European Union, to those third country exporters who will be affected by the new levels and to the WTO, if any challenges to what we are doing are mounted there."
"We look forward to hearing from the Commission how it will demonstrate that its response here is not only precautionary - which it clearly is - but also proportionate."
"Mr President, I agree with the idea that legislation in this sort of area needs to be all-embracing and comprehensive, but, as a farmer, I do not agree with everything in the report, for example, that farm-produced animal feed should also be covered by the measures."
"I think it is something that cannot be practically applied or monitored."
"For that reason, we should look into legislation which is reasonable in the sense that it could be monitored and implemented in practice."
"The sort of legislation that cannot be monitored or implemented in practice will naturally erode Parliament' s credibility, as will the fact too that we should draft such legislation."
"I will cite Amendment No 18 as an example."
"How can we monitor what a domestic animal roaming freely drinks or where it drinks?"
"The basic idea is right."
"Legislation must be all-embracing and comprehensive, but it must also be such as can be put into effect and monitored in practice."
"The application of legislation to feed produced on a farm is something that cannot be practically implemented or monitored."
"Otherwise I do agree very much with this overall policy and the basic idea behind it."
"Mr President, we can only obtain safe and healthy food by taking account of the whole chain, that is to say the way in which we cultivate our crops, the soil we grow them in and the seed we use, as well as the conditions in which we breed our animals and the nutrition and water we give them."
"Residual poison, pollution, poor animal husbandry and poor hygiene will result sooner or later in sick animals and, consequently, also in an increase in illnesses among human beings."
"Unfortunately, a lot of inherited knowledge and farmers' lore has been lost in industrial agriculture, where animals have been reduced to production units and commodities."
"I am convinced that, with ecological agriculture, we should not have had the major problems we have today."
"The situation is now as we find it."
"The two proposals we are discussing today, concerning foreign substances and products in animal feed and official control of these, are therefore necessary and welcome."
"These proposals also mean a step towards a complete package of measures in favour of food safety."
"I want to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Paulsen, on the consistent way in which she has worked to improve the Commission' s text and on the insightful knowledge she has displayed."
"I am pleased that the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats have withdrawn the amendments concerning the problems associated with dilution."
"That saves me a very great deal of speaking time."
"However, it would be unfortunate if, for example, Amendments 39 and 40 were adopted, for this would mean that the opportunities for Member States to intervene quickly to combat newly discovered dangers would disappear."
"Experience has of course shown that it is precisely this that we need to do."
"We need to act incredibly quickly because people' s health is at stake."
"We must also constantly bear the precautionary principle in mind."
"I support the rapporteur' s proposals but shall vote against the amendments tabled by the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats."
"Mr President, I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution to this debate, which highlights the important role of the European Parliament in the crucial area of food safety, public health and environmental standards."
"It is in the interests of farmers and consumers to restore consumer confidence in food."
"In this very sorry saga, farmers have in many cases been the innocent victims of circumstances beyond their control."
"Central to this very wide debate is the White Paper on food safety which will for the first time propose an ethical framework putting Europe and its Member States at the forefront of world food safety."
"It has been brought about by the clear and unequivocal concerns of 370 million consumers in the European Union on the safety of the European food chain."
"Member States must conduct specific target inspection programmes in the implementation of these directives."
"They will be required to inform the European Commission when a serious risk of contamination is detected."
"The Union must also, by means of directives, establish a legal basis to harmonise the transmission of information on feed controls and food safety."
"I should like to comment briefly on the directive concerning undesirable substances in products and animal nutrition."
"The chicken dioxin crisis highlighted the shortcomings in Community legislation and animal nutrition. It will end the possibility of authorising the use of raw materials for animal food in excess of the maximum limits laid down."
"These directives are part of the most radical shake-up of the Community's food safety hygiene rules for at least 25 years."
"The new regulations will merge, harmonise and simplify very detailed and complex hygiene requirements which were previously scattered over numerous directives."
"We have all learned our lesson from the food crisis of the 90s."
"I am confident that with this systematic set of uniform rules we are laying the groundwork for filling the gaps in the existing legislation and enhancing food safety throughout the food chain."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the wake of numerous food scandals, consumer awareness has heightened very considerably."
"In the domain of EU consumer policy, I believe 'from stable to table' has few rival claimants to the title of Expression of the Year."
"If, however, we want to apply this principle of transparency consistently, our commitment must stretch from the farmer' s pitch fork to the consumer's table fork."
"Consumer safety begins with animal feed, with its ingredients, the declaration and, last but not least, the official inspections."
"These three reports place us on the horns of a dilemma."
"As far as feed content is concerned, let me say that food safety is a highly sensitive issue."
"If scientific studies come out unequivocally against the use of certain substances, the precautionary principle must apply."
"I doubt, however, whether we shall succeed in introducing a zero-tolerance threshold."
"That would be dubious consumer protection and, what is more, it would surely be impracticable."
"I believe it would undermine the very legislation it was intended to reinforce."
"As for the declaration of feed materials - the open versus the semi-open declaration - our dilemma is surely between consumer protection and economic viability."
"With today' s analytical methods, Commissioner Byrne, any recipe is as transparent as can be."
"Any manufacturers who therefore wish to discover precisely what a competing company is offering its customers have long been able to acquire this information."
"I should like to conclude by dealing briefly with two problems relating to the declaration."
"The number of those who seek precise details on ingredients is relatively small, according to my research."
"This brings me to the other point."
"The full declaration certainly costs money, and the farmer ultimately has to foot the bill."
"The official feed inspections are the final link in the chain of transparency in the sphere of animal feed."
"Unfortunately, however, despite all our efforts, it will never be possible to completely eradicate criminal practices."
"For my own part, finally, the quality of our food concerns me less than the eating habits of our citizens in general."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Paulsen' s report on undesirable substances and products in animal nutrition deals with an important subject, which, like all important subjects, is highly controversial."
"Irrespective of whether we eventually reach agreement, let me take this opportunity to thank all of the honourable Members whose constructive preparatory work has brought us to the present point in this discussion."
"Speaking for my group today as the draftsperson of the dissenting opinion in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I should like to make five points."
"Firstly, the new proposal which was introduced by the Commission in December 1999 and which forms the basis of Mrs Paulsen's report seeks to change the system completely less than a year after the introduction of the existing directive in April 1999."
"The report abandons the distinction between feedstuffs, feed materials and feed additives."
"The new directive that will be put to the vote today does not materially alter the quality of animal feed in any way, since the proposed limit values applicable to the final feed product are the same as those in the present directive."
"The same is true of dioxin."
"What we are discussing so fastidiously is not going to be changed here."
"Moreover, in my eyes a crime is a crime!"
"Secondly, for farmers, who are, of course, the producers of primary feed materials, there will in fact be a change, because in future they will have to destroy considerably higher percentages of their feed materials."
"What we want is a comprehensive, prudent and practicable arrangement for all concerned."
"The question whether the text we are now being asked to adopt is appropriate, especially from a food safety or macroeconomic point of view, is extremely debatable."
"I believe it is not."
"From my own conversations, however, I know that I am not speaking for a majority of the House on this particular point."
"That being the case, it is important at the present juncture to make emphatically clear that compensation for these additional losses and shortfalls suffered by farmers, to which Mrs Paulsen rightly referred, is essential, that we must create directives to regulate this and that we must reflect on how we should deal with these things at the WTO negotiations and how we should regard imported products which contain such undesirable substances."
"Mr President, this directive forms part of the consistent set of measures which is planned actively to render all stages of the food chain safe."
"We must attempt to improve food safety and to rule out any crises which not only put the confidence of the consumer to the test but also bring the entire agricultural sector into disrepute in the long run."
"The discussion on Mrs Paulsen' s sound report was emotionally charged at times, and I believe that now, with this discussion behind us, we can assume that, although the requirements prescribed for the feed industry are strict, we can ensure that by admixture, the quality will change in future."
"I believe that the consumer is not prepared to wait for this to happen and I also have the feeling that, whilst the compound feed sector is still creating problems at the moment, it is ultimately the farmer, in fact, who ends up footing the bill for the damage done to consumer confidence."
"I therefore welcome this regulation, because I believe that food safety is a question of choice."
"This means that, in this case, the interests of producer and consumer, farmer and product buyer must go hand in hand, and I have a feeling that the derogations provided for in Articles 6 and 7 make it possible not only to take a more flexible stance on certain points but also to adopt a harder line at the same time."
"Mr President, the directives before us relate to the Union' s aim to restore consumer confidence in European food, and, at the same time, public confidence in the Union' s ability to act in this matter, which is one that affects the lives of our citizens."
"Marit Paulsen has played a very creditable role in this work by drafting her report on undesirable substances in animal feedingstuffs and the monitoring of feedingstuffs."
"In practice it is impossible to demand that animal feedingstuffs should contain no undesirable substances at all."
"Now we are confirming the maximum quantities beyond which a batch of feed could not be used."
"The Commission is proposing at the same time that the option of diluting a batch of feed that exceeds the maximum levels with one that does not exceed them should be abolished."
"This sort of practice has fortunately been unknown in the animal feedingstuffs industry up till now in many Member States."
"The Commission' s proposal is a welcome one, and clearly preferable to the amendment tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, which would allow the practice of dilution to continue."
"Dilution would simply lead to unhealthy effects in the use and treatment of raw materials."
"The committee proposes the Commission' s proposal on this matter should be put into practice."
"After the committee meeting I really felt we needed just to extend a helping hand to the producer."
"The farmer must obviously be compensated for the destruction of a batch of feed that is so contaminated that it is unfit for use, just as in the case, for example, of the destruction of animals with TSE."
"Compensation is necessary, although it is obvious that farmers themselves are concerned about the wellbeing of their animals."
"The committee also adopted the amendment we tabled, reminding everyone of the division that exists in respect of rules for feedingstuffs produced on farms and commercially produced feedingstuffs."
"The good quality of the former is regulated by legislation on hygiene and the directive on undesirable substances in animal nutrition is most essential with regard to the latter."
"This division should also be maintained in the future."
"If hygiene legislation is inadequate in this area it will have to be amended."
"Mr President, today the House has discussed three very important proposals with implications for food safety: proposals on undesirable substances, inspections in the field of animal nutrition and finally the marketing of compound feedingstuffs."
"Individually and collectively, these three proposals will address major shortcomings brought to light by the dioxin crisis."
"Turning to the first proposal on undesirable substances, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Ms Paulsen, and the draftsman, Ms Auroi, and the committees for their very comprehensive report."
"The proposal amends the current legislation on undesirable substances."
"It forms part of the work programme of the Commission, which was welcomed by Parliament and the Council."
"The main principles of the proposal are: the introduction of the principle of non-dilution, the deletion of possible derogations for local reasons, the introduction of the possibility of establishing action thresholds besides maximum limits to act as an early warning tool and the extension of the scope of the directive to fix maximum limits for undesirable substances in feed additives."
"This proposal will without doubt enhance the safety of feed."
"Prohibition of dilution will reduce the overall contamination load of animal feed."
"Operators at every stage in the production chain will be forced to put systems and practices in place to ensure that the feed materials and feedingstuffs they produce are safe."
"It will encourage a proactive approach to reducing contamination in the feed chain."
"I am therefore very pleased that Ms Paulsen's report endorses these main principles of the Commission proposal."
"The Commission can accept many of the amendments proposed in the rapporteur's report."
"However, let me first address the amendments with which the Commission cannot agree."
"Amendment No 18 explicitly proposes to include water in the definition of feedingstuff."
"I fully agree that the same rules concerning the quality of feedingstuffs have to apply to the quality of water consumed by animals."
"Although the definition does not preclude water being considered as feedingstuff, it is clear from the Community legislation that water has not until now been considered as feedingstuff, as is clear from the fact that Council Directive 96/25 of 29 April 1996 on the circulation of feed materials, containing a non-exhaustive list of the main feed materials, does not include water in the list."
"The Commission cannot, therefore, accept this amendment, but will consider it in the context of a future amendment to that directive."
"Secondly, the Commission cannot agree to Amendment No 27, in which Parliament proposes to delete the possibility of defining acceptability criteria for feed materials which have undergone certain decontamination procedures."
"In my opinion this amendment misses its purpose."
"In any case the Commission cannot accept an amendment which would prohibit decontamination."
"However strict quality criteria need to be laid down at Community level for these decontamination procedures."
"Amendment No 33 deletes the possibility of exporting non-complying consignments to the country of origin."
"The Commission cannot accept this amendment."
"The possibility of re-exporting non-complying consignments to the country of origin should remain open."
"However, in order to meet Parliament's concern the Commission accepts that it is appropriate to insert an additional provision that re-export is possible after informing the competent authority of the country of origin and receiving assurances that the contaminated lot will be safely disposed of"
"Finally, the Commission cannot accept Amendment Nos 35, 36 and 37, proposing to amend the maximum limits for cadmium, mercury, lead dioxin and PCBs in certain feedingstuffs, since amendments to the annexes have to be based on a scientific risk assessment and have to be made by the Commission following the committee procedure."
"In relation to PCBs, work is currently being undertaken by the relevant scientific committee."
"It is expected that this committee will report in October, by which time we will be in a position to consider what appropriate action can be taken under comitology."
"The Commission will review the current provisions concerning cadmium and mercury as a priority and will ask the Scientific Committee for Animal Nutrition to provide a scientific risk assessment for these heavy metals."
"This has already been done for dioxins and PCBs and it can be expected that this scientific risk assessment will become available, as I said, in October."
"On the basis of these scientific risk assessments the Commission will propose to the Member States appropriate measures to limit the presence of these substances in feedingstuffs."
"The European Parliament will, of course, be fully informed."
"More generally, it is appropriate that the provisions of the annexes are periodically reviewed in the light of the developments of scientific and technological knowledge."
"Amendment No 38 is unacceptable as it falls outside the scope of this directive."
"Amendments Nos 39 and 40, proposing to delete the possibility of establishing an action threshold are similarly unacceptable."
"These action thresholds will act as early warning tools, alerting competent authorities and operators so that they actively prevent further contamination of the feed chain by identifying sources of contamination and measures to avoid repetition in the future."
"Amendments Nos 41, 42, 43 and 44, proposing to reintroduce the possibility of dilution under certain conditions of contaminated feed materials are also unacceptable."
"I understand, from the contribution from Mrs Klaß that these amendments are being withdrawn."
"I am glad of that because they go against the main principle of the Commission's proposal, namely total prohibition of dilution of contaminated feed materials."
"In order to protect public health it is important that the overall contamination of food and the feed chain is reduced to a level as low as reasonably achievable."
"Dilution does not reduce the overall load of contamination in the food and feed chain."
"However, I noted also the objections in Council to the total prohibition of dilution, but I am convinced that an acceptable solution can be found in order to prevent feedingstuffs becoming the waste bucket for contaminants."
"In the second stage we will be able to address the issues raised by Mr Whitehead in relation to these particular matters."
"Having extensively explained why the Commission cannot accept the Amendments Nos 18, 27, 33, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43 and 44, I am glad to say that the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 34 and 45, as these amendments constitute an important clarification of the Commission's proposal with the understanding that with some of these amendments, in particular Amendments Nos 3, 4, 30, 34 and 45, further editorial changes may improve the text."
"Regarding Amendment Nos 20, the Commission can accept the insertion of a definition for consignment but the proposed definition itself needs further consideration as does the need to include other definitions."
"To conclude, I wish once again to thank Mrs Paulsen for the excellent report which can be supported by the Commission to a very large extent."
"Now I want to turn to the second major proposal for discussion today with important implications for food safety."
"Once again I would like to thank Mrs Paulsen and Mrs Auroi for the broad support given in their reports to the Commission proposal concerning controls in animal nutrition."
"This proposal is the follow-up to one of my first commitments to improve food safety and provides for a system to exchange information in the field of animal nutrition, with particular reference to a rapid alert system and a legal basis to enable the adoption of safeguards measures for products produced within the Community and also the obligation for the Member States to have in place contingency plans to deal with feed emergencies."
"Considering the amendments tabled for adoption in this plenary session, I appreciate Parliament's support of the proposal."
"On behalf of the Commission, I can accept Amendments Nos 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 23, 25 and 26 because they provide clarification and increase transparency."
"The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 2, 14, 17 - the first sentence in particular - and 19 concerning the deletion of the adjective ""serious"" when clarifying a risk for consistency with our general policy laid down in the General Products Safety Directive."
"In other terms, not all risks need immediate action at Community level."
"The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 5 and 22 on the rapid alert system as they are currently worded."
"The Commission agrees to the addition in Amendment No 5 of the reference to changes in the current rapid alert system and I quote ""after certain changes""."
"This should be sufficient, considering our commitment to establish a rapid alert system covering all the food and feed chain in the new proposal on the food authority."
"In principle, I am not against Amendments Nos 15, 16, 20 - last paragraph - concerning the change from ""decontamination"" to ""rendering the product harmless"" however we will introduce some editorial changes in relation to that."
"On Amendment Nos 17, I accept the principle that the use of dangerous products shall be prohibited and that they should be recalled."
"The amendment needs editorial changes to make clear that these actions are within the responsibilities of the Member States."
"We cannot accept Amendment No 21, second indent, (a), because there is a linguistic misunderstanding: ""cross-contamination"" is the appropriate wording to be used."
"I accept Amendment No 24, subject to editorial changes, in order to make clear that the possibility for the Commission to carry out inspection ""without prior notice"" only refers to operators and not to the competent authorities."
"Finally, we cannot accept Amendment No 27 introducing in the recitals, reference to civil and criminal liability in the event of loss or damage."
"It is not necessary."
"The basic Directive 95/53 already stipulates in Article 19 that penalties for non-compliance shall be commensurate and have a deterrent effect and when a responsibility is proven in the court civil and/or criminal liability apply."
"Overall therefore, the Commission can fully accept 15 of the 27 amendments."
"I am grateful to the rapporteurs and to the honourable Members of the committees involved for their substantial support."
"I hope that our cooperation will continue with the same positive results when this proposal is discussed at the second stage."
"Compound feedingstuffs"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0233/2000) by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 79/373/EEC on the marketing of compound feedstuffs (COM(1999) 744 - C5-0020/2000 - 2000/0015(COD))."
"Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has the floor."
"Commissioner Byrne, in this directive on the marketing of compound feed we find our old problem lurking, namely the question of open declarations."
"It is gratifying for me personally to be able to serve as rapporteur for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, since this problem has been with us now for decades."
"As Mr Böge knows, in our time in the Landjugend, the young farmers' association in Germany, we used to discuss this, because there were open declarations at one time."
"They were then abolished to suit the interests of the feed industry."
"The computer put together the cheapest feed mix at current prices, and so that the consumers - in this case the farmers - were not irritated by the constant changes in ingredients, the required information was reduced to the basic components, which were the carbohydrate, protein and fat contents."
"That certainly covered the substance of the compound feed."
"The computer worked this out, but it was no longer clear which ingredients made up this substance."
"We always stressed the need for openness."
"Then we would hear the most specious of arguments - it was impossible to prove, it was too difficult, it would distort competition - all the things we are hearing again today."
"Then, in the Committee of Inquiry on BSE, we demanded for the first time, and here I quote from a recommendation made by the Temporary Committee of Inquiry on 6 February 1997, ""... the inclusion in labelling of a mandatory explicit declaration for feedingstuffs by their manufacturers, which should facilitate the clear identification of components and of the origin of ingredients, and on user instructions."""
"This was our view, but the recommendation was not adopted by the Commission."
"We then pressed this point again in the temporary committee which was created with a view to following up the recommendations on BSE, but the Commission asserted in 1998 that declarations were already open."
"Not even the BSE scandal could compel it to subordinate the interests of the compound-feed industry to those of public health."
"Then we had the dioxin scandal on top of that, and it was fortuitous that the Commissioners had to introduce themselves to Parliament at that very time, as you will no doubt recall, Mr Byrne."
"And those who drafted your remarks on this point and the remarks of the other Commissioners were wise enough to include an indication that you were in favour of open declarations."
"We immediately started probing. We asked whether you really meant it."
"Yes, you did mean it, and now we have a draft on the table, a draft that is entirely in line with our wishes."
"We have tabled a few small amendments."
"I should also like to thank Mrs Roth­Behrendt, who drafted the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"We accepted the bulk of your amendments in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, but the substance of the Commission draft is fine, and we shall support it in this form."
"The compound-feed industry, however, has been trying yet again to exert influence through the Council and to overturn the principle of open declarations."
"I assume that they will not succeed this time."
"What is most clearly apparent is that components are no longer lumped together into categories."
"That has been the worst part of the present regime, because it meant, for example, that the term 'fats' could cover all sorts of fat and that there was no indication at all as to the origins of the fat content."
"The same applied to protein."
"In the Committee of Inquiry on BSE, we had always objected to the evident inclusion in feed mixes of animal protein, in the form of animal meal, not as a means of meeting the required percentage of protein but to reduce production costs and to increase the nutrient content as cheaply as possible."
"And we all know the results of that."
"Commissioner Byrne, we are highly satisfied."
"This is a report and a regulatory procedure based on codecision."
"I hope that we shall reach agreement with the Council and that the final outcome in the form of our joint draft, which the Commission presented and to which we have added, will be upheld, so that we can say, ""Yes, it took years, it took decades, but open declarations are now enshrined in the law of the European Union""."
"I should find that particularly gratifying."
"Mr President, what I enjoy most about this House is that I am always learning new things."
"Today, for instance, I learned that, at the time when my esteemed colleagues Graefe zu Baringdorf and Böge were in the Landjugend - in other words until very recently, in a manner of speaking - there were open declarations."
"So that in itself has already made my morning."
"Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, the rapporteur from the committee which was ultimately entrusted with responsibility for this report, said that we have long been pressing for this open declaration and that we have redoubled our exhortations to the Commission on the marketing of compound feed since the BSE episode."
"He rightly praised the Commission for its more or less prompt fulfilment of its mandates."
"The Commission's proposal is sound, and I am convinced that we shall muster enough agreement within the House on the few amendments to be able to stand up to the Council on this issue."
"I entirely fail to comprehend why the manufacturers of compound feed - who have spoken to many of us, as you know - believe that resistance against open declarations will achieve anything."
"It will get them nowhere."
"As we have all been saying in our speeches, whether here in the House or in our home constituencies, we must begin to win back the public trust that we have lost, and we must be unstinting in our efforts to do so."
"That entails a host of measures."
"One such measure is the introduction of open declarations, and an open declaration is not merely an indication of the percentage of various content categories or generic classifications but clear and precise details of the ingredients contained in the feed mix."
"It is unacceptable to have 'starch' , 'fats' or 'protein' on the packaging; the manufacturer must state which protein and which fats are in the mix."
"Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf made that quite clear."
"But we need more than that, which is why both the Agriculture Committee and the Environment Committee have stated once again, rather in the fashion of a Tibetan prayer wheel, that we need a white list."
"We need a white list of the additives and ingredients that are authorised for use in feed mixes."
"The Commission has pledged itself to work on this list and has also said it is not something that can be done in a couple of days."
"We do not expect that either."
"What we do expect, however, is that the Commission will give us regular updates and that it has an approximate timetable for the accomplishment of this task."
"After all, it would be unacceptable if, in the meantime, we were plunged back into a situation in which the Commission had to write to the Member States to find out how the Directive on sewage sludge was being interpreted."
"We will have none of that!"
"We must have a clear and unequivocal white list, and both committees - the Agriculture Committee and the Environment Committee - have reiterated that point."
"It naturally means a large investment of time and money in monitoring, which is why both committees have stated that manufacturers also have an obligation to provide evidence."
"This obligation involves furnishing precise details of the composition of compound feedingstuffs on request, and is designed to shift some of the burden of proof as well as to minimise the cost of monitoring in the Member States."
"We naturally have no wish to spend vast amounts of time and money on monitoring and to be constantly setting off to conduct inspections all over the place."
"So if we were to do what we intend, if we were to implement it quickly and then pass quickly through the codecision procedure too, that would certainly be a huge step forward, and I feel sure that we shall be very strong and united in our dealings with the Council."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is a proverb which says that good things come to those who wait."
"The words of Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf certainly illustrated the aptness of that proverb to the present situation."
"Besides the week's major topics, namely our discussions, decisions and votes on enlargement and institutional reform, there have been other subjects that the public has also been following with interest, subjects on which the position of the general public can also be said to have moved perceptibly."
"Over the past few years, public awareness of food-safety issues in particular has heightened considerably, and this naturally extends to animal feed as well as human foodstuffs."
"Just think of BSE or dioxin, and you will know what I mean."
"The discussions on the Paulsen reports, of course, clearly illustrated this."
"The marketing of animal feed, or perhaps it would be more accurate to say the trading of animal feed, also engenders this awareness."
"When mixing takes place, in the case of compound feedingstuffs, I believe the need for caution is even greater, whether these compounds are functional foods or feed mixes."
"In the case of these products, more detailed labelling is expected."
"Higher priority must be given to verifiability."
"The mandatory open declaration is essential, and the greatest possible degree of transparency is necessary throughout the supply chain."
"I believe, too, that transparency will ultimately strengthen competition; it stands to reason that transparent competition creates a greater incentive to manufacture the best possible mixes."
"Farmers quite simply have to know more precisely what is in their compound feedingstuffs, and they must also be able to find out, at least on request, the percentage content of each ingredient."
"That is their right as purchasers as well as being consistent with the interests of consumers."
"Equally important, of course, is the food-safety aspect - beef is another issue here - and traceability."
"This, at least, is well embedded in the proposal."
"The amendments make the proposal better still."
"The PPE-DE Group approves Amendments Nos 1 to 5 but cannot support Amendment No 6."
"The question of genetically modified cereals should be regulated elsewhere."
"We support the amended Graefe zu Baringdorf report and the legislative resolution."
"Let me express our thanks and appreciation to the rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, and to Mrs Roth-Behrendt."
"Nevertheless, it is essential that we continue to stand firm."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it can still happen, or at least it cannot be ruled out, that contaminated primary products will find their way into animal feed again at some future juncture."
"Whether this will be intentional, in other words a criminal act, or accidental is not the subject of today's debate."
"If this does happen, however, it will be crucial to know which amounts of which contaminated primary product have entered the feed in question."
"An indication of components, summarised according to category and listed by descending order of percentage weight, would not, in our view, suffice for this purpose."
"It is therefore absolutely imperative that full details of all the primary products contained in compound feedingstuffs, together with the percentage volume of each, should be a statutory requirement."
"The Socialist Group endorses the statements made by the rapporteur in his conclusions on the open declaration of feed ingredients."
"This mandatory explicit declaration must be part of a comprehensive safety system governing the production of animal feed."
"Livestock feed is, after all, the main input in the production of meat."
"Defects in the safety and verification system increase the risk of further food scandals and ultimately lead to a loss of consumer confidence in meat as a food product."
"And it is always the farmer who suffers in the end."
"Farmers not only have to be able to rely on the information provided by the feedingstuffs industry; they must also be able to check, on the basis of the declaration, which volumes of which raw materials are contained in livestock feed."
"We believe that complete transparency for farmers is essential."
"Finally, I should like to express my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, as well as to Mrs Roth-Behrendt, for their contributions, and I hope that the Council will adopt a constructive position on this matter, so that we can jointly arrive at a transparent system of declarations for feedingstuffs."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, speaking for my group, I assume that the report on the proposal for a directive on the marketing of compound feedingstuffs will obtain the consent of the European Parliament."
"I also expect the Commission to stipulate the necessary measures along with a strict timetable in order to ensure that the directive is applied in the Member States of the Union."
"The basis for the introduction of open declarations, in other words the full listing of all feed materials, differs extremely widely between Member States."
"The standards are scarcely comparable, let alone transferable."
"In the long production chain for compound feedingstuffs, there are sharply divergent degrees of interest in the traceability of feed materials."
"The BSE scandal was the worst and most notorious example."
"Farmers are still suffering today from that utterly criminal failure to protect consumers."
"As we have seen, it took years to rectify matters."
"Let me say categorically that the application of the numerous necessary rules and regulations on the control and monitoring of feedingstuffs must, in my opinion, proceed from the premise that transparency for the consumer is paramount."
"When it produces its own report, the Commission can prove that transparency is not a modern word for bureaucratic procedures and that danger exists, since the legal provisions on food safety are supposed to cover the entire soil-plant-animal cycle."
"The report does not make it immediately clear to everyone precisely whom or what this transparency is intended to benefit."
"Let me finish by stressing that the report, like the labelling of beef, will come down on the side of the consumer more than on that of the production chain."
"Given the surplus production in Europe, this is the safer bet and will pay dividends in the long run."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, after the issue of the composition of feedingstuffs for animals, if we are to eliminate mercury, lead, arsenic, DDT, etc., we must address the question of the way in which these products are marketed."
"This is, of course, all due to the BSE tragedy that turned into a real saga, with several episodes."
"Mr Böge dealt with the episode of the committee of inquiry in 1997, there was the episode of the ban on British beef, the episode of the labelling of meat and now we have the episode of labelling animal feedingstuffs."
"Of course, farmers have the right to know what their cows are eating and the right to know whether their pigs are eating car sump oil, which contains dioxins."
"Food must therefore be labelled to show the precise contents."
"This is a simple thing, but for ten years, we have sat and twiddled our thumbs."
"Admittedly, there are labels that tell half the truth, stating ""contains oil"" , but that could mean fish oil, vegetable oil, tallow or grease."
"Common sense, as our rapporteur said, would suggest that labelling should make a clean sweep and list all the ingredients."
"On this issue, however, we have been told that the intellectual property of manufacturers' formulas must be protected, that monitoring compliance would be difficult, that the label would be covered with the list of nutritional values and raw ingredients and that the contents would vary according to the market in which they were sold."
"In short, then, people have tried to win some time."
"Today, we have found a good solution, although nothing has been said about animal feedingstuffs containing GMOs, such as soya flour."
"Nor has anything been said about the responsibility of manufacturers, particularly in Britain, who were primarily responsible."
"Even if we are pleased with this progress, however, how can we forget that before we finally adopted measures it took ten years and 80 deaths, and in two years' time we may well yet discover a zoonosis, a health disaster?"
"I do not know, Mr Byrne, if the European Commission is at risk of dying from Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, but given the slow pace of your lives, I can take pleasure in the fact that you will surely not die of a heart attack."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by saying that this Commission proposal is most welcome."
"Indeed, it addresses a long-standing concern of Parliament, which has at times, in 1997 and 1999, asked for a review of current legislation on the marketing of compound feedingstuffs."
"We all agree that there is a need for compulsory labelling that clearly indicates the various components of compound feedingstuffs and their nature."
"We shall not, of course, complicate matters and demand unnecessary details on the labels, but we shall demand everything that is essential, such as an explicit, open declaration strictly indicating the percentage of each component and its intrinsic nature."
"As we all know, these measures are fundamental for increasing consumer confidence."
"There is in fact a general lack of confidence, which is particularly marked in relation to intensive production processes, not only in meat production but also in fish farming."
"It is possible, through clear, transparent and responsible labelling, to give consumers this confidence."
"This subject was in fact discussed during the Portuguese Presidency of the European Union, and the conclusion was that the Council' s position was unfortunately rather timid in this respect, rather fainthearted, showing that ultimately the ministers had not learnt much from the past."
"It is essential that the Commission and the Council should fight for these same rules to apply to all partners worldwide, especially in the framework of the World Trade Organisation."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a surfeit of scandals has shaken public and consumer confidence."
"In the interests of farmers and consumers, we need clear and transparent rules for animal feed too, but it should be said that farmers are always the first to suffer when abuses occur."
"As far as the directive on undesirable products and substances in animal nutrition is concerned, let me say from the outset that we need a more workable solution here which strikes a fair balance between the interests of producers and those of consumers."
"We must create a realistic statutory framework."
"Contaminants which affect human and animal health are unacceptable."
"You know I come from a Member State where very high and strict standards are imposed, which I fully support, and those standards have certainly proved their worth."
"As far as checks on feedingstuffs are concerned, I should like to state that the problem is not so much the lack of a European legal framework as the failure of the individual Member States to transpose the existing provisions."
"I cannot but warmly welcome the pressure for the creation of a European information system for food crises, the standardised transmission of information on the monitoring and safety of animal feed and the dissemination of information on cases of contamination and of damage to public health and the environment."
"I take a more critical view, however, of the escape clause which would give the Commission the scope to take measures of its own without consulting the Member States."
"Lastly, I should like to say a word or two on the conflict of competence between the Agriculture Committee and the Environment Committee."
"I believe the specialised knowledge and the powers of judgement of the members of the Agriculture Committee on farming matters, and hence on animal nutrition too, are beyond question and that the Agriculture Committee is therefore the body which is best qualified to arrive at a practical and practicable solution that the farmers in question will apply and which consumers will understand."
"For that reason, subjects such as animal feed really ought to be dealt with under the direction of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"What we feed our livestock is just as important to us farmers as it is to the consumers who subsequently buy our meat."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur for his efforts and praise the important work of the institutions in their approach to animal health which also, of course, facilitates the protection of human health."
"This proposal falls within the framework of the legislation intended to strengthen the rules on feedingstuffs, included in the White Paper on food safety."
"Therefore, Parliament, as well as the Commission, demands mandatory labelling which specifies the composition - as a percentage by weight, as Mr Cunha said -, the quantities and the origin of the ingredients of the feedingstuffs, rather than indicating the categories of the ingredients with no further detail, such as, for example, by proteins or by oils and fats, which has had so much to do with previous scandals such as the cases of BSE and dioxins."
"The demand that manufacturers provide proof of the composition of foods, and that there be an exhaustive and up-to-date list of authorised raw materials and rigorous controls of suspicious materials - and their immediate withdrawal from the market - must from now on be essential issues for us."
"I am grateful that this matter is finally coming to its conclusion and that we are going to have a solution as swiftly as possible."
"Mr President, the proposal before us and the rapporteur' s reaction to this proposal are a step in the right direction but, at the same time, they expose the weak structure of European enforcement."
"But let us begin with the good news."
"The Commission proposal to lend more transparency to the information given on labels and on feed content, so that everyone knows where they stand, is a step in the right direction."
"It is also what we want, namely trust between the producer and consumer."
"The tighter measures which the rapporteur announced in his report and which encompass, for example, an exhaustive list of products, for which he calls on the Commission for help, is an interesting proposal and will only reinforce this policy."
"A second, necessary step in this process is to have exact data at one' s disposal."
"It is unfortunate, however, that we are still not, in fact, taking matters one step further and establishing certain labelling obligations with regard to energy and foodstuffs, too."
"This is the good news."
"The bad news is that those who tamper with cattle feed will not - now or in future - specify on the label whether the product contains dioxin or substances which have not been effectively processed."
"That means that in Europe, there is definitely room for improvement with regard to policy on enforcement, but also on penalties, and it means that whoever tampers with animal feed or food commits a crime."
"You could say that you can put anything on paper, but in the final analysis, power will also need to reside in enforcement and penalties when the rules are broken."
"Finally, I would like to note that, with this legislation, Europe is probably going a great deal further than many other parts of the world."
"It imports a great deal of its cattle feed from the developing countries, among others, and the question remains of how we can put our legislation on the agenda at WTO level and how we can solve this problem in an adequate manner, because it very definitely creates a difference in cost price compared to other parts of the world, and this will also need to be given due attention within the Commission and in future discussions with the Council."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I regard this amendment of the Directive on the marketing of compound feedingstuffs as a step in the right direction on a long road."
"Its aims are clear and undisputed."
"The first aim is to create traceability of foodstuffs back to their origins, in other words maximum transparency."
"The second is to restore consumer confidence in European food products after the BSE crisis and the dioxin scandal."
"I believe that reversal of the burden of proof, as proposed in Amendment No 4, is absolutely essential if these aims are to be achieved."
"The food industry has the necessary information to hand."
"For those outside the industry, it is sometimes utterly impossible to obtain this information."
"The present proposal is the first in a series of initiatives based on the White Paper on food safety."
"It is a start."
"The Union certainly cannot rest on these laurels."
"A long road lies ahead of us."
"I would like to thank the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and their rapporteurs, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf and Mrs Roth-Behrendt, for having examined the Commission proposal and delivered their opinion on it and to the Members of Parliament who have spoken this morning and have warmly welcomed these proposals."
"I am pleased about that."
"As stressed in the report by these two committees, this proposal was initiated by the European Parliament out of a concern to improve both traceability and the provision of information through the labelling of compound-feeding stuffs."
"The Commission proposal does not enjoy the unanimous support of all parties concerned."
"In the Council, a very substantial majority of Member States is opposed to the introduction of an obligation to systematically indicate on labels the precise composition of the compound feedingstuffs intended for productive livestock."
"If a compromise were to be reached, it would be highly desirable to give stock farmers the opportunity to obtain all the information they desire on the composition of the feedingstuffs used to feed their animals. In my opinion, this is a legitimate right to information which must be satisfied."
"As far as the amendments presented are concerned, the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 1, 3, 4 and 5 that improve the Commission proposal."
"However, the Commission cannot accept Amendment No 2 calling on the Commission to present, forthwith, a proposal setting out an exhaustive list of the materials authorised for feeding animals."
"I must stress that the Commission is in no way opposed to the actual principle of drawing up an exhaustive list of materials."
"The Commission is convinced of the usefulness of a positive list."
"In this connection, I would like to quote from the White Paper on Food Safety which states ""The materials which may or may not used in animal feed production, including animal by-products, need to be clearly defined."""
"A positive list of feed materials would give the clearest response to the current lack of definition of feed materials, however, it goes on to state: ""This task is complex and time-consuming."
"In the short term, the current negative list needs to be rapidly expanded and the Commission is committed to working towards a positive list over the medium term."""
"Regarding the timetable, there is no way that a proposal on a positive list of materials can be envisaged before the end of 2002."
"The procedure whereby this can be done is the amendment of 1996/25 to convert the current non-exhaustive list of feed materials into an exhaustive positive list."
"This can be done by codecision under Article 152."
"Any updating of that list would be accomplished by comitology."
"I hope that Parliament will understand that the Commission cannot agree to give commitments on timescales which cannot be reasonably kept."
"Finally, in relation to Amendment No 6, this amendment is not acceptable as it falls outside the scope of this directive."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 11.00 a.m."
"(The sitting was suspended at 10.55 a.m. and resumed at 11.00 a.m.)."
"Madam President, unfortunately I have to inform you and the House of a new tragedy at sea."
"A few days ago, a French vessel, the An Oriant, based in Brittany, was shipwrecked."
"Eight of its crewmembers died."
"Yesterday, the fishing vessel Arosa, which was flying the British flag - and like the An Oriant, was fishing in Irish waters - was also shipwrecked. The majority of its crew were Spanish."
"The result could not have been more horrendous, Madam President."
"Of the thirteen crewmembers, only one survived."
"Five bodies have been found and the rest have disappeared."
"On my own behalf and on behalf of my colleagues in the Committee on Fisheries, I would ask you, Madam President, to send Parliament' s condolences to the families of the victims and to the local authorities in both Brittany and in Marín, Galicia, from where the majority of the victims came."
"I also wish it to be noted, Madam President, that the European Parliament' s Committee on Fisheries, which it is my honour and responsibility to chair, is very sensitive to these accidents at sea."
"This is demonstrated by the fact that we are currently producing a very significant own-initiative report, the rapporteur for which is our vice-chairperson, Mrs Miguélez, on the causes of accidents involving fishing vessels in the European Union."
"Mr Varela, I have taken your words to heart and I can assure you that I will pass on your message."
"Vote"
"I wanted to point out to you, ladies and gentlemen, that the quaestors have taken a decision to prohibit mobile phones in the Chamber."

"Swoboda (PSE)."
"(DE) Madam President, I only wanted to ask whether we all agree that the order of the paragraphs should be changed - I refer to the first vote - as the Socialist Group requested."
"You did not take a vote on that."
"Mr Swoboda, we quite agree."
"When we vote on these paragraphs, I shall ask if there are any objections to inserting them after paragraph 1."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Mr President, may I just make a brief comment."
"In connection with human rights, only a brief mention was made here of the Romanies."
"During the IMF Summit, people came out of prison with broken ribs."
"This means that they had not been allowed to exercise their rights of free speech and freedom of assembly."
"This report does not ...."

"With regard to Amendment No 3"
"Mr President, I would like to make an editorial change to an amendment which I tabled."
"It concerns Amendment No 3."
"Where it says that this should lead to ""a certain level of political autonomy"" , this should read ""a certain level of cultural autonomy"" ."
"Are there any objections to this oral amendment being tabled?"
"Mr President, I believe the change made by Mrs Maes is a very judicious one."
"The term ""political autonomy"" had thrown me."
"What does it mean?"
"But as Mrs Maes now points out that it should read a certain level of cultural autonomy, I can go along with that."
"My recommendation with regard to this amendment was negative at first, but I would now like to change this into a positive one."
"(Parliament gave its assent to considering the oral amendment ) (Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Report (A5-0248/2000) by Mr Queiró, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the European Parliament resolution on Hungary's membership application to the European Union and the state of negotiations (COM(1999) 505 - C5-0028/2000 - 1997/2175(COS))"
"Before the start of the vote"
"President."
"Mr Queiró wishes to table an oral amendment, in his capacity as rapporteur."
"Mr President, the reason for this amendment concerns the fact that recital c) highlights the persistence of segregation in children' s education and serious discrimination in the various sectors of Hungarian civil society, from the economy to the public sector, which in its seriousness does not correspond to my perception of the current situation, which I have had the opportunity to observe as rapporteur and during my visits there."
"The formulation that I now propose does not try to hide or deny the existence of discrimination against the Roma community, which unfortunately still exists, but it stresses the need to adopt a set of positive measures leading to the free, unforced assimilation of the Roma into Hungarian society."
"The recital would therefore read as follows: ""recital c) whereas insufficient attention continues to be paid to the situation of the Roma, whereas discrimination against the Roma must be tackled seriously by the Hungarian Government through the adoption of a set of positive measures that may lead to the free assimilation of the individuals belonging to this community, whereas it should be possible to find a solution given that a Minorities Office has been set up and medium-term legislation has been passed which will help them to become integrated into Hungarian society,""."
"I must just point out to the House that this last part is taken word for word from the recital as laid down in the report and approved by the committee."
"Are there any objections to this oral amendment being tabled?"
"Mr President, I wish to oppose this oral amendment."
"In the appropriate Delegation committee, we explicitly discussed all these questions and arrived at a common position after lengthy discussions."
"I was in Hungary four weeks ago and saw for myself the immense efforts being undertaken by the Hungarian Government."
"I am therefore opposed to our accepting an oral amendment."
"I would remind you, ladies and gentleman, that we cannot debate an oral amendment."
"All that the Presidency is asking you to do is to state your opinion on whether the oral compromise amendment should be voted on or not."

"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"President."
"We shall now adjourn the voting in order to make way for the formal sitting."
"(The sitting was suspended at 12 noon and resumed at 12.35 p.m.)"
"Mr President, my intention is to combine the three amendments tabled by the Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats in a new formulation, which would make Recital A a new paragraph."
"I propose to call this paragraph Paragraph 1 and therefore to renumber all the subsequent paragraphs accordingly."
"The new wording of Recital A, which would become Paragraph 1, and which I propose to the House, would read as follows: 'Whereas Slovenia must continue to meet the Copenhagen political criteria also in those areas where questions remain open, as specifically mentioned in the Commission' s 1999 report.'"
"This is the wording jointly agreed with those who tabled the three amendments of the Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats."
"It combines the three amendments and turns Recital A into a new paragraph, to be called Paragraph 1."
"Are there any objections to taking this oral compromise amendment into consideration?"
"Mr President, I should just like to clarify the point that there is no longer a recital A but, by agreement with Mr Martelli, a new Paragraph 1."
"You are quite right."
"That is how the rapporteur explained matters to us."
"(The House gave its assent to taking the oral compromise amendment into consideration) (Parliament adopted the resolution)"

"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Explanations of Vote - Brok report (A5-0250/2000)"
"Fatuzzo (PPE-DE)."
"(IT) Mr President, I am very pleased to announce that I voted for the resolution on the procedure for admitting these important new States to the European Union."
"I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Brok for his report and to stress the emphasis which, in the process of integrating all these States into the European Union, must be placed on precautionary measures ensuring that the pensioners and elderly people of all these States which are going to join the Union are given their due worth, so that their right to life and to the means necessary to support them - that right which was sadly taken away from them with the end of Communism, when their pensions became worthless - is preserved."
"Mr President, I wish to congratulate Mr Brok on what is a full and very interesting report."
"From reading his report it is clear that if three conditions are met, there is every reason to be optimistic that we can make a success of enlargement."
"These three conditions are firstly that the Commission makes a success of its own pre-accession strategy, particularly in the areas of regional policy, agricultural policy and environmental policy."
"Secondly, that the candidate countries continue to make the good progress that they are making towards meeting the Copenhagen criteria and towards the full and complete enforcement of the acquis communautaire in advance of accession."
"Thirdly, perhaps the most difficult, that the Council agrees new institutional arrangements that allow the Community to function efficiently, effectively and democratically after enlargement."
"The Brok report gives us grounds for satisfaction, but no room for complacency."
"Almost all the reports on the twelve countries that are candidates for membership of the European Union express satisfaction with the progress that these countries have made in order to fulfil the necessary conditions."
"The rapporteurs choose to ignore the fact that all of these countries are riddled with social inequality, that the standard of living of the majority of the population is very low and that unemployment is rife in all of these areas. They underestimate the ethnic minority problem."
"They say nothing about the resurgence of nationalist tendencies, and do not even bother to name the large Turkic-speaking minorities in the Balkans, and the ethnic Russians in the Baltic States, in order to avoid having to comment on the ordeal imposed on such people as a result, for example, of their being denied the right to citizenship."
"Even if these countries, in particular those in Eastern Europe, are integrated, this will occur in line with the balance of power. By this I mean they will have a subordinate role in relation to the three great powers: Germany France and the United Kingdom, either individually or all together."
"The economies of these countries are already at the mercy of the law laid down by the great European trusts."
"Integrating these countries into the Union will do nothing to change the nature of these relationships in any way."
"So, whether we limit the European Union to 15 countries or enlarge it to 27, it will always be a creation designed to serve the interests of capital, and the workers of Europe have no hope of improving their situation."
"That is why we voted the way we did."
"I voted against the Brok report on the enlargement of the European Union, because whilst it may be very clear-sighted in technical terms, it is nevertheless prompted by mistaken political ideas about the future of Europe."
"Admittedly, this report has the merit of providing an insight into the immensity of the task that awaits us if we wish, not even to bring the candidate countries of Eastern Europe up to the level of development of the West, but simply to establish conditions for peaceful coexistence and a gradual rapprochement between the two areas that would not be too destabilising for either side."
"Most of the report' s technical amendments deserve our wholehearted support, for example, those on food safety, the dismantling of first generation nuclear power stations, environmental protection, the fight against social dumping and the crucial code of conduct for Western businesses operating in the East, etc. The task is huge and also a matter of the utmost priority."
"If we had to give reasons for the existence of the European Union today, top of the list would be the huge task of closing the gulf that Communism created between the two halves of Europe."
"Unfortunately, from the institutional point of view, the Brok report falls in completely with the standard Brussels ready-made way of thinking: it takes the view that enlargement consists of bringing Greater Europe into the institutions of Little Europe."
"The problem is that these institutions were not designed for that purpose, and their capacity is far too limited."
"The statements that we find most unacceptable are to be found in the combination of several paragraphs of the resolution for which the European Parliament voted: firstly, paragraph 27 and those that follow, which imply that full participation in the single currency, even if not immediately, must be a condition for membership."
"Then there is paragraph 19, which ""emphasises that acceptance of the provisions laid down regarding Economic and Monetary Union rules out any possibility of opting out and represents a commitment to a global, irreversible political project."""
"It is unacceptable that participation in the euro should be a condition for accession, since several Members already benefit from exemptions."
"It is even more unacceptable to seek to turn this participation into a commitment to a global and irreversible political project."
"This paragraph alone justifies all the fears that our Danish friends have expressed in recent weeks during the referendum campaign, and which, quite rightly, were the reason for their ""no"" vote."
"If they had been able to read this report beforehand, the amount of people voting ""no"" would probably have been 80% rather than 53%."
"Many other passages in the European Parliament' s resolution are equally unacceptable."
"Paragraph 45, for example, requires candidate countries to grant the freedom to purchase land to nationals of Member States."
"This provision raises a very serious issue, given the disparity between levels of purchasing power."
"Furthermore, this is the type of problem that was taken into account in 1992, in Protocol No 1 of the Maastricht Treaty, in order to grant an exemption allowing the Danes to maintain their restrictions on the purchase of second homes by non-residents."
"Here too, we do not see why exemptions that already exist in the Union could not be granted to candidate countries, in order to help them."
"Paragraph 65 is another example of Brussels' s desire to dominate and unify, stating that the non-discrimination clause provided for in Article 13 of the EC Treaty is part of the 'acquis communautaire' and insisting that ""legislation derived from this article be fully implemented in the CEECs"" ."
"Even if one approves of the principles of Article 13, it is quite clear that derived legislation that the European Union may draw from it sometimes goes too far, and that there are no grounds for refusing candidate countries the right to cultural diversity."
"All in all, the Brok report gives a completely mistaken and even dangerous vision of enlargement, which consists of unilaterally imposing every last aspect of the legislation and the institutions of the European Union on the countries of Eastern Europe."
"What we should be doing instead is creating institutions for a Greater Europe, which, whilst stimulating development in Eastern Europe, will allow sovereignties and differences to be expressed."
"This excellent principle should, moreover, be applied within the European Union as well."
"So that there should be no doubt about the fact that we are sympathetic towards admitting the new applicant countries, we have voted in favour of Mr Brok' s report. We nonetheless think that there are a number of factors in the report that are particularly open to criticism, as well as in the overall negotiations in connection with enlargement."
"We find much to criticise in the fact that the EU is going in and setting the agenda for internal factors, as well as linking participation in Economic and Monetary Union with the coordination of social policies."
"I refer in particular to paragraph 19 of the report' s draft resolution in which it is stated that the European Parliament 'emphasises that acceptance of the provisions laid down regarding Economic and Monetary Union rules out any possibility of opting out and represents a commitment to a global, irreversible political project ... which does not mean mere membership of a currency area but which greatly entails coordination of economic and social policies' ."
"The process of European integration has moved on apace in recent years."
"Enlargement towards the countries of Eastern and Central Europe (CEEC), Cyprus and Malta has been called an 'historic task' for the European Union."
"This phrase gives us an idea of the scale of the issues that have been grafted onto the process."
"Extending the European Union, at least in the first stage, to more than 100 million new citizens, will provide new impetus for the development and integration of the European economy as a whole."
"The accession of new Member States will provide the Union with further weight and influence on the international stage."
"At the same time, there are still considerable difficulties to overcome, particularly in terms of budgets."
"The first wave of new Member States could increase Europe' s population by more than a quarter, taking it to almost 500 million people, whilst the total GDP of the European Union would increase by only 5% at the most."
"Despite the enormous efforts that these countries have made, integrating them into existing structures and programmes will be a particularly tricky task."
"The report we have been debating today seeks to provide an update on the progress that has been made in accession negotiations with all the candidate countries."
"The report urges the Commission and the Council to ensure that the principle of differentiation, as defined in Helsinki, is implemented to the letter, so that each country is judged on its own merits."
"The candidate countries themselves must continue their efforts to strengthen their administrative capacities for the implementation and enforcement of the Community aquis."
"They are also asked to build up effective financial control and audit procedures in order to effectively control the use of the pre-accession funds."
"Furthermore, they would under no circumstances be able to demand an opt-out clause in the context of the EMU."
"We are making many demands of the candidate countries, but at the same time, the European Union too has its duties: it is obliged to implement the reforms necessary for enlargement."
"The forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference is due to look at improving the European Union' s institutional framework."
"To return to the budgetary aspect, I think it is crucial that we study the budgetary consequences of such a large number of new Member States joining before the end of the current financial cycle in 2006."
"Lastly, I wish to stress the fact that the enlargement process must be a gradual one, following the pace at which the candidate countries are making the necessary changes."
"That is why I, like several of my fellow Members, do not feel it would be wise to set deadlines."
"I should also like to remind you that this process must not cause us to neglect the cooperation with the countries on all sides of the Mediterranean to which we are committed!"
". (FR) I wish to congratulate Mr Brok on the remarkable piece of work that he has produced."
"His report clearly sets out the issues and the objectives of enlargement in the field of regional policy and he does so in both political as well as financial terms."
"I would say that this is both a forward-looking and realistic report."
"Enlargement with the addition of thirteen countries changes not only the geopolitical framework of the European Union, but also its structure, because the total population will increase (by 28%), but so will the number of 'disadvantaged' regions."
"We must be aware of this!"
"The rapporteur tells us that out of the 50 regions in the candidate countries, 48 have a per capita GDP that is less than 75% of the average in the Europe of Fifteen for the period 1995-1997."
"The only regions to have higher levels are Prague (119%) and Bratislava (96%)."
"This shows us once again that the disparities between rich and poor regions are also enormous in these countries, and that these disparities will not cease to exist after these countries have joined the Union."
"We must therefore try to ensure that the administrative structures of these countries are able effectively to absorb Structural Fund appropriations."
"In order for this to happen, candidate countries need aid, particularly through the PHARE programme."
"They must have a sound and responsible administration, staffed by men and women who are trained in Community procedures and in budgetary rules."
"Furthermore, the report reminds us of the need to devise new criteria for regional policy for the period 2006-2013, because once enlargement has taken place, the approach to a regional policy for 25 countries will not be the same as it was for 15!"
"We need to devise a new strategy based on the European Spatial Development Perspective (ESDP)."
"A global vision of Community territory would therefore seem essential for better regional development."
"This report forces us to face our responsibilities and that is why I voted in favour of it."
". (ES) In the current context and given that we are beginning to hear enlargement being questioned in certain quarters, it is important that this Parliament sends a clear political signal in support of it."
"That is why I have voted in favour of the Brok report. This is an excellent report which, as well as analysing the progress made and the difficulties still facing the countries with which negotiations have begun, also serves as a reminder to the public of the political and ethical commitment which the European Union, this Parliament, has made, not only to the candidate countries which wish to share our European history, and have the right to do so, but also to the political project of European integration itself."
"I believe that enlargement will not only favour the prosperity and economic growth of the candidate countries and, by extension, that of the current Member States of the Union, but will, above all, also provide a guarantee of peace and stability in Europe and thereby offer the European Union the opportunity to finish the task of ensuring peace in Europe, which began fifty years ago."
"We must remind those people who have no sense of solidarity and are concerned about the economic cost of enlargement, that the prize of peace fully justifies this cost."
"As we have already seen in connection with the integration of Western European States into the European Community, agriculture and food is one of the most complex areas of negotiation."
"Each enlargement has required long-term preparatory measures as well as transitional and special arrangements, often lasting for several years."
"I believe that we are right to expect the applicant States of Central and Eastern Europe to implement similar special and transitional measures."
"We should also do well to remember that, because of the great economic and social significance of farming and its output, a competitive agricultural and food-supply structure will be a vitally important factor in the success of these countries' transformation and restructuring processes."
"Agriculture is a domain which is largely regulated on the basis of uniform binding European rules and regulations."
"National powers are greatly restricted."
"Whether we like it or not, almost 50% of the EU budget has to be spent on the maintenance of this agricultural policy."
"It was decided in Berlin to allocate approximately EUR 3.1 billion a year to the gradual integration of the applicant countries for the period from 2000 to 2006, which amounts to a total of about EUR 21.8 billion, and to earmark a further EUR 58.1 billion for enlargement from the year 2002."
"From where we stand at present, this financial framework will not suffice in resolving the complicated processes involved in the forthcoming round of integrations, especially from the point of view of ensuring that they are socially acceptable."
"The financial framework for the enlargement of the Union, however, can only be facilitated through a rise in the current Member States' contributions and not through constant cuts in planned expenditure on the various Community policies."
"This is a truth that has to be told."
"The opposite approach would drive a wedge through the farming community and endanger the social development of rural areas throughout Europe."
"According to an old German saying, if the farmers are thriving the state will thrive."
"There is a great deal of wisdom in that saying, and it is still applicable today."
". (FR) Since its inception, the European Union has sought to bring peoples closer together."
"Although it may be difficult to have the various sensitivities, histories and, sometimes, contradictions live side by side, enlargement must adhere to this concept of peace and take part in the creation of a community that transcends ancient geographical and ideological borders, guided by common values and rules."
"Nevertheless, in order to prevent Europe becoming nothing more than a free trade area, the European Union must provide clear answers to the institutional, social and economic questions that enlargement is bound to raise."
"We must, as of now, adopt a pragmatic approach to the implications of a Europe not of 15, but of 25 or 30."
"We must respond in an appropriate way to this enlargement which will considerably increase the number of poorer regions, and think carefully together about the risk of accentuating imbalances in Europe, in order to ensure that Europe does not become one huge heterogeneous mass."
"This is why we must show imagination in reformulating the criteria for granting structural aid, in order to guarantee appropriate support for the poorest regions of the candidate countries, as well as those in the current Member States."
"For this reason, I hope that the outermost regions, six out of seven of which always feature amongst the ten poorest in the EU, benefit from the Structural Funds, no longer just according to the sole criterion of GDP but also according to geographical, demographic and, especially, social indicators."
"Enlargement must not be financed by the poorest regions."
"This concept must guide institutional, economic and financial reforms throughout the accession process."
"Only on these terms will it be understood and accepted that the principle of solidarity, which aims to improve economic and social cohesion within the EU, will become a reality."
"Mr Brok' s report addresses the concerns I have just shared with you and, consequently, I voted in favour of it."
"The real political objective of the EU' s enlargement project is the economic and political subjection of the applicant countries' people."
"It is about formalising a system which allows financially strong EU companies to dominate neighbours in the East and South, at the same time as the EU develops into a military superpower."
"The most important task for the Popular Movement against the EU is to internationalise popular resistance to the overall EU project."
"We voted against this report, but not because we are opposed to the principle of European enlargement."
"On the contrary, we feel that integrating peoples that have the democratic means to discuss and resolve this type of issue would be a positive step."
"The European institutions are not in the least bit interested in the opinion of the peoples of Euroep, whether they are Members of the European Union or not."
"French workers have no more had the chance to say what they think about the Charter of Fundamental Rights than the people of Lithuania have about joining the Union."
"What this report is actually proposing is to enlarge an economic market."
"The criteria laid down at the Copenhagen Council in 1993 on democratisation or the ability to withstand competition actually strengthen the hand of unrestrained, destructive capitalism, in the guise of acquis communautaire."
"The rapporteur is furthermore forced to acknowledge that ""the changes taking place in the candidate countries have led to social problems and in particular to marked social stratification and in some cases high unemployment."""
"The various structural adjustment plans demand forced privatisations in all strategic sectors: finance, insurance, industry, education, and public services, etc., and impose budgetary restrictions."
"Ultimately, underdevelopment is on the increase and there is an explosion in poverty even in countries such as Poland and Hungary, which are meeting their targets for 'growth' ."
"So where is the 'progress' for the populations of these countries who have never been consulted?"
"For years, in this House, we have been constantly proclaiming the perversity of this Europe of yours, which is centralising and bureaucratic one day and federalist the next, this Brussels-ridden Europe which, despite its fine proclamations, denies national identities and cultures, the history of the nations of Europe and history in general."
"Because we reject this Europe in the interests of the French people, we cannot in all conscience endorse its enlargement to include the countries and the peoples of the East, which have only just emerged from Communist dictatorship and cannot yet know what a technocratic and totalitarian trap it is that they are wanting to enter."
"We want another Europe, an alternative model of European integration, a Europe that is great, the Europe formed by the cooperation of independent sovereign nations, whose aspiration is to include all the countries of Europe, just the countries of Europe."
"The Europe we want is a real Europe as opposed to your pernickety, pen-pushing Europe, a Europe of freedoms as opposed to your centralised eurocracy, a Europe of the nations as opposed to your undifferentiated 'europoidal' jumble, a Europe of the people as opposed to your Europe of civil servants and technocrats."
"I abstained from the vote on Mr Brok' s report because the fundamental question of our peoples' agreement to EMU was never raised."
"Consequently, in most Member States, neither the citizens not the parliaments have deliberated on the principle and conditions of enlargement."
"The issue of time limits is crucial both for the citizens of the countries of the East and for the European Union."
"A number of major preliminary conditions must be lifted."
"Until the definition of a political and social Europe is made clear, not only in order to overcome the obstacle of the proper technical operation of the decision to be taken at 23 months but also in order to define the framework of the values, common social and citizenship models, enlargement will entail running more risks than it creates opportunities."
"There is a risk of the European Union being watered down politically and of social dumping, and, lastly, that the project of European integration will be reduced to the creation of one large marketplace, an area of free competition."
"That particular plan is one that the public rejects. It is a dangerous route."
"A headlong rush into enlargement, under such conditions, would be liable to aggravate the sidelong shifts towards the populist and fascistic which are appearing here and there."
"As a matter of urgency, we must unambiguously consult the national parliaments and the citizens."
"As a matter of urgency, we must review the time schedule. As a matter of urgency, we must set a framework for social convergence, harmonising social standards upwards."
"As a matter of urgency, we must intensify political cohesion and give the Charter of fundamental rights a legal status."
"Enlargement must be considered in this new context and a transition strategy must be defined."
"Less would have amounted to more!"
"I abstained in the vote on this never-ending resolution on enlargement because I believe that Parliament would be doing a disservice to the politically important and worthy cause of eastward and southward enlargement of the European Union to the south and east with this semi-digestible screed of paper."
"I even fear that this collection of country reports and comparative reports will prove counterproductive, particularly in the countries that have applied for membership of the European Union, and more especially in the applicant countries of Central and Eastern Europe."
"The impact of this long-winded resolution of 127 paragraphs, indeed, is liable to be in inverse proportion to its length."
"We should have made do with the country reports, adding at most a short, yet succinct resolution."
"Our purpose, after all, should be to send the right signal from here, saying that we want these countries' accession and that it should not be delayed, but also making it clear that enlargement must be economically, socially and financially manageable, both for the applicant countries and for the Community."
"A realistic approach to manageability is not procrastination - it is quite the opposite."
"For many good reasons, not least among which is the desire to safeguard a lasting peace, we want the unification of the whole of Europe, which is the only way to exclude the wars that my parents and I have experienced."
"That, in a few words, should have been our message today."
"We cannot and should not expect the applicant countries to go further than we ourselves have been able to go in implementing the established body of Community law and practice - the acquis communautaire."
"Reading the section of the resolution entitled 'Enlargement and Equal Opportunities' , which states that the adoption of the Community acquis in the area of equality is a sine qua non for accession and makes other demands of the applicant countries, I have the impression that all this could be interpreted by those countries as the ultimate bid to block their accession."
"They should know that in this domain, to which I attach great importance, the Community has not actually come very far."
"On paper, a great deal has been achieved in the area of equality of treatment and equal opportunities for men and women, but how do things stand in practice?"
"It so happens that we have a report on equal opportunities for men and women on the agenda for this very sitting, a report which once more illustrates how stunted the body of Community practice still is in this particular area."
"So it would be nothing less than arrogance on our part to expect more of the applicant countries in this domain than we ourselves have been able to achieve in the 25 years since the adoption of the first directives relating to equal opportunities."
"This is my view, and the purpose of my abstention was to emphasise that this Parliament would have done better to produce less paper but more substance."
"I also wanted to send a signal that would be properly understood in the applicant countries, to convey the message that we are in favour of accession but that we, like they, must first be in a position to create the necessary conditions for their membership."
"When I look at what has been done so far to that end at the Intergovernmental Conference, I feel that we have little cause for pride and that we should put our own house in order before imposing prior conditions on the applicant countries, especially when we ourselves have been unable to satisfy these conditions."
"I have voted for the whole package on the enlargement of the EU eastwards for the following reasons:"
"1. because I regard this process as a political necessity, and"
"2. because I wanted to send the applicant countries a positive signal, since they have made considerable progress on the charted course towards accession."
"Despite the problems which undoubtedly exist and which actually affect the present EU Member States more than the applicant countries, I believe that these are outweighed by the opportunities which this enlargement process offers."
"As a member of the EU-Slovenian Joint Parliamentary Committee, may I say that I believe the progress made by Slovenia in incorporating the acquis communautaire is exemplary, a view that is corroborated by the report."
"I beg to differ slightly from the rapporteur in my assessment of the outstanding restitution claims and of the state of the legal system, because I know from my experience as an East German that, ten years after the unification of the two German States, the same difficulties still exist in the federal state of Brandenburg too."
"Objectively, this complex process can take up to 20 years to complete."
"I cannot subscribe in any way to the amendments to this report that have been tabled here in Parliament, because"
"it has already been noted on several occasions that Slovenia is satisfying the Copenhagen criteria,"
"the question of decommissioning the nuclear power plant is not part of the acquis, and"
"while the legacy of the Second World War can certainly be regarded in diverse ways, we can hardly expect the results of that war to be brought into line with political positions that were articulated 50 years later in the Copenhagen criteria."
"The enlargement of the European Union to include the ten countries of Eastern Europe plus Malta and Cyprus is a great project."
"For indeed, who could deny entry into the European House to States such as the Poland of Copernicus and John Paul II, the Hungary bullied in Budapest in 1956 or the capital that has become a symbol, Prague, when popular democracies threw the Head of State out of the window and crushed the nation of Jan Palach, sacrificed in the name of freedom."
"It is, however, precisely because of this harrowing past that our affection for our European brothers in the East, might induce in us some unease at seeing them, having just emerged from the bureaucratic totalitarianism of the Soviet Empire, fall into the clutches of another form of totalitarianism, just as bureaucratic, that of the free trade empire of untrammelled ultraliberalism."
"Is it really in the interest of farmers in Poland or Hungary to condemn themselves to becoming redundant within two decades of entering the Union?"
"Is it really in the interest of the Greek Cypriots, who, like their fellow countrymen in Thrace, have known for more than a century what Turkey signifies, to become members of a European Union which will tomorrow allow their former torturers to travel freely and reside freely in their land?"
"This is why I and my fellow Members of the European Parliament from the Front National would like to spare the nations of Eastern Europe the mistake of being 'disintegrated' within the American-European Union."
"Everyone has free will, however."
"We are warning them, as friends. We shall welcome them, as friends."
"As friends, however, we are too dubious about the wisdom of their decision not to refrain from putting them on their guard."
"The size and breadth of the problems raised by enlargement are incompatible with the duplicitous language that has been used about it within the European Union."
"It is in fact totally unacceptable that doors should have been opened and that candidate countries should have been given false expectations, while at the same time, with the aim of effectively postponing enlargement, an insurmountable tangle of difficulties and conditions should now be put in the way of its implementation, or obstacles should be raised that have been known about since the beginning, to the extent that proposals have already been put forward to analyse the costs of non-enlargement."
"We, for our part, have always stood by the logic of truth, however hard it may be to accept."
"That is why, even though we do not object to enlargement in principle, we have always argued right from the start that a definitive position on this will depend on the conditions in which it actually takes place."
"We say this because we have never ignored the fact that obstacles to its implementation would arise at all sorts of levels, and it is true and inevitable that to overcome them will require strong political willpower, new financial means, and above all a thorough analysis of its effects both on the current Member States and on the candidate countries, particularly at the institutional, economic, financial and social levels."
"By way of example, let me repeat that it will not be acceptable to us if it takes place at the expense of the less highly-developed Member States - as suggested by the failure to review the financial perspective - or if it entails an institutional change such as the one that some people are advocating."
"I would like to echo the positive opinion expressed by my group regarding Mr Brok's report, and emphasise the political priority which must be given to the European Union's decision to enlarge, a priority which cannot be conditioned or diluted by any reasons other than the rigorous assessment of whether the candidate countries fulfil the criteria laid down by the Community acquis."
"In addition to this, I would like to stress three points."
"Firstly, enlargement cannot be separated from a coherent policy of openness and attentiveness on the part of the European Union towards the east and the south."
"Cooperation and friendship with the former USSR nations and the Mediterranean must progress alongside the enlargement process."
"Secondly, enlargement inevitably involves revision of the European Union's financial perspectives, which were conceived and established before the prospect of enlargement was even on the horizon."
"A larger Europe with more tasks and responsibilities will require fresh, increased financial resources."
"The urgent need therefore arises to revise the financial perspectives and to increase the financial allocations for pre-accession operations."
"Thirdly, the implications of enlargement for the Union's regional policy cannot be overlooked."
"The policy of cohesion is, at present, necessary and will continue to be so with regard to a large number of regions which are currently classified as Objective 1 areas and which are to be removed from this category after enlargement."
"We must henceforth seek out new types of measures and new tools to benefit all the areas which are lacking in infrastructures and service networks such as, for example, the south of Italy."
"The enlargement of the European Union is a great project."
"A Europe of this type would be a guarantee of peace and would signify the rejection of any ethnic nationalism."
"The prospect of uniting nations around a common political project, on a democratic basis and in order to promote the prosperity and welfare of the various peoples is an exhilarating one."
"This must be the objective of a greater Europe."
"What is shaping up at the moment, however, is unfortunately more like the formation of a purely economic and liberal Europe, without any real political power which might democratically decide on major political, economic and social objectives."
"The problems and hold-ups we encounter in our endeavours to make our common institutions more effective, more democratic and closer to the citizens are a striking illustration of this."
"In such circumstances, if we take the fast track to enlarging Europe, this will be detrimental to the interests of the peoples and their social rights."
"I therefore abstained from the vote on this report."
"Enlargement has been a recurring theme in our debate and our discussions today: each one of us, even those who have not spoken, will surely have been moved to reflect upon what Europe means for them, for their party and for the State that they represent."
"For me, enlargement is not a question of whether to endorse the entry of certain countries into Europe."
"Europe and the European Union are two different things: the European Union is a political entity conceived 50 years ago whereas Europe is a geographical, historical, political, cultural and social entity whose origins lie in the mists of time."
"To become part of the European Union one needs to apply, whereas one becomes part of Europe by birth, through a blood tie which unites all the people of this wonderful continent."
"Let us not forget this when we discuss enlargement."
"We are here - and this is right and proper - to assess economic, political and social criteria, but we must be careful not to empty of all significance an act which is in many respects inevitable and preordained."
"Take Poland, Hungary or the Czech Republic, to mention but a few of the 'candidate' countries: how could we deny that they share our history, our culture and our origins?"
"This is not, of course, an invitation to shirk our responsibilities: we cannot forgo evaluating the transposal of the Community acquis, just as it is necessary for the Union to make good the commitments it has made to these States under the pre-accession strategy."
"We must not underestimate the need for healthy pragmatism in our handling of this extremely delicate transition stage, to avoid unnecessary clashes of principles."
"In general, we are all in favour of enlargement, but this will only fully come about when the candidate countries have carried out the necessary structural reforms, when the European Union's institutions and decision-making processes are capable of handling such a situation and, most importantly, when we at last realise that Europe is not a question of political status but, more than anything else, a story of roots and common history, blood, sweat and tears, dreams and visions, which unite us above and beyond political and economic issues."
"Carlsson Report (A5-0238/2000)"
"Mr President, I am very pleased to be able to announce that I voted for the measure on Estonia's application for membership of the European Union."
"I would like to take this opportunity to extend a greeting to the pensioners and elderly people of Estonia, in the hope that we will look after their interests once they join the European Union."
"I would stress, in particular that, as Mrs Carlsson's report states, 99% of all Estonian companies are small and medium-sized businesses."
"This is certainly positive and we should congratulate the Republic of Estonia on this and its other merits."
"Opening up the European Union to new members will increase stability and wellbeing on the continent we share."
"It is therefore very positive that accession negotiations with all applicant countries have made progress."
"The applicant countries must be able to join the European Union according to the headway they have made."
"In the talks, therefore, the principle of differentiation must be applied."
"Bunching the applicant countries geographically and staggering their accession dates according to regional criteria are unacceptable."
"Enlargement will also benefit the present members of the European Union."
"Its political and macro-economic benefits will be greater than the additional costs the Member States will incur."
"The EU already benefits from the growing surplus in trade with the applicant countries."
"It is to be hoped that the governments of the applicant countries will continue strengthening their administrative capacity so that the EU' s acquis communautaire can be implemented in these countries prior to accession."
"Estonia' s rapid progress in preparing for membership is especially positive for Finland."
"Our neighbouring country has struggled with determination over the last decade to meet the criteria of membership."
"With respect to the question of Estonia' s minorities, the important language law, which was passed in June 2000, is in accordance with all international norms."
"Furthermore, the economic transition process has been a positive one."
"A speedy solution to the questions that remain is to be hoped for from the point of view of all parties."
"The government of Estonia should pay added attention to the fight against corruption and drug trafficking."
"I welcome the Carlsson report on Estonia's application for membership of the European Union and share the majority of conclusions that she draws."
"I note that Estonia now meets the Copenhagen criteria and is making good progress towards fulfilling the acquis communautaire."
"Once the European Union has adjusted its institutional structure and policies in order to cope with enlargement I can see no reason for Estonia not being admitted to the Union."
"I look forward to early Estonian membership."
"Schroedter Report (A5-0239/2000)"
"Mr President, both on behalf of the Pensioners' Party and on my own account, I voted for the report on the Republic of Latvia's application for membership of the European Union."
"I would like to take this opportunity to extend a greeting to the pensioners and elderly people of Latvia, who, I am sure, will find the European Union particularly attentive to their problems."
"I would mention the low birth rate - 7.5 per thousand, which is highlighted in the Schroedter report - a problem which aggravates the situation of the social security pension system."
"I hope that this matter will be more successfully resolved by the Republic of Latvia than it has been in certain countries of the European Union."
"I welcome the Schroedter report on Latvia's application for membership of the European Union and share the majority of conclusions that she draws."
"I note that Latvia is making progress to meeting both the Copenhagen criteria and meeting the obligations of the acquis communautaire."
"If Latvia continues to make progress and the European Union adjusts its institutional structure and policies in order to cope with enlargement I can see no reason why Latvia should not be admitted to the Union."
"I look forward to Latvia joining the Union in the not too distant future."
"Like the rapporteur, I should like to express my pleasure at the considerable progress which Latvia has made in recent months in order to be included in the first wave of enlargement that the European Union is shortly to experience."
"Even though this good report masks an occasionally disparate real situation - Mrs Schroedter' s report highlights the difficult situation of rural areas or again the slowness of the necessary adaptation of public administration - the fact remains that Latvia has, nonetheless, reoriented its policy in such a way as to become, unquestionably, a member of the European family in the way this is usually understood in this Parliament."
"And it is this feeling - or lack thereof - much more than meticulous analyses of the accounts, which should, when the time comes, govern our choices regarding enlargement as European integration ceases to have any meaning if it is no longer primarily political."
"The pettifoggery intended to alter the frame of reference used to view events when they run counter to the slightly too rigid technocratic and monetary dogma - this House' s astounding indifference in the fact of the outcome of the Danish referendum is a splendid, worrying example of this - should not be used as a benchmark for a debate of this importance."
"Latvia is entitled to its place in this forum, not only because, on the whole, the progress it has made has earned it the right to this 'allocation of confidence' that is essential in order to successfully concluded negotiations of this type, but more especially, and above all, because Latvia is at home in Europe as a European country."
"And so, in agreement with the observations and comments made by the rapporteur, I therefore welcome this dialogue and the prospects it gives rise to."
"I hope that Latvia will have the opportunity to add the wealth of its own special characteristics to a European Union which I too hope will, in the meantime, have opted to reorganise itself into a coherent political body that respects nations and their sovereignty, rather than a muddled board of shareholders of unequal standing that have lost sight of their primary objective, which is to build a strong, independent Europe."
"Hoff Report (A5-0240/2000)"
"Regarding the stage reached in the agreements on Lithuania's accession to the European Union, I would like to take this important opportunity to extend a warm greeting to the pensioners and elderly people of Lithuania."
"As the rapporteur, Magdalene Hoff, declared, it is important for the Ignalina nuclear power station to be closed down, as it is particularly dangerous."
"I hope that, as the Republic of Lithuania has agreed, this nuclear power station will indeed be shut down."
"I welcome the Hoff report on Lithuania's application for membership of the European Union and share the majority of conclusions that she draws."
"I note that Lithuania is making good progress to meeting both the Copenhagen criteria and meeting the obligations of the acquis communautaire."
"If Lithuania continues to make progress and the European Union adjusts its institutional structure and policies in order to cope with enlargement I can see no reason why Lithuania should not be admitted to the Union."
"I look forward to Lithuania joining the Union in the not too distant future."
"Gawronski Report (A5-0246/2000)"
"Mr President, I was very pleased to be able to vote for the report on the current status of Poland's application for membership of the European Union."
"I would like to take this opportunity to extend a greeting to the pensioners and elderly people of Poland, some of which belong to a Pensioners' Party which is similar to the Pensioners' Party which I represent in the European Union."
"I must emphasise the importance of Mr Gawronski's report."
"I feel that, out of all the States which have applied to join the Union, Poland is the one which most deserves our support and our commitment for, without Poland's crucial initiatives, Communism would not have ended and we would not be discussing this issue today."
"As a member of the Delegation to the EU-Poland Joint Parliamentary Committee, I am pleased to have this opportunity to express my opinion on the state of progress of the negotiations with Poland."
"Let me remind you that the agreement between Europe and Poland was signed in December 1991 and came into force in February 1994."
"On 5 April 1994, the Polish Government made its official request for membership of the European Union and, on 31 March 1998, negotiations were officially opened."
"Poland is today, in terms of the extent of its territory and population numbers, the country which has the most 'specific gravity' of all the candidate countries."
"By dint of its geographical position it represents an extremely important factor in the stability of the future geopolitical position of the European Union."
"Furthermore, Poland is an economic partner of substance, given that it represents the European Union' s fourth export market after the United States, Switzerland and Japan."
"Accession negotiations with Poland have entered a crucial phase with the opening of all the chapters, including the very important chapter of agriculture."
"The European Commission has published the second report on Poland's progress along the path to accession."
"It notes that a great deal of progress has been made thanks to the efforts made by this country, particularly in terms of adopting the Community acquis."
"Moreover, Poland fully respects human rights and fundamental freedoms."
"Progress is also evident in the field of the environment, where the 'National Fund for Protection of the Environment' has been implemented and the 'polluter pays' principle applied."
"In terms of its foreign relations, the Polish Government has paid special attention to the matter of its borders with the region of Kaliningrad, Lithuania, Belarus, and Ukraine by stepping up institutional and administrative resources, particularly border police."
"Problems still remain."
"According to the Commission, Poland has not yet achieved satisfactory results in terms of increasing the efficiency of its legal system."
"The country should, moreover, make greater efforts to combat corruption."
"In economic terms, the Commission document points out that Poland' s principal challenge is to increase the rate of reform and privatisation, especially in the agricultural sector."
"Restructuring of the agricultural sector would appear to be necessary in a country where the rural population represents 38 % of the total population and accounts for 4.9 % of the GDP, and where agricultural employment is estimated at 27.4 % compared with 5 % within the European Union."
"I am fully aware that the Polish authorities consider that Poland will be ready for accession by 31 December 2002."
"This is not perhaps quite so obvious to the Polish population which is still generally very Euro-sceptical."
"That is why, although I think it premature to set a precise date at the present moment, it is certain that this candidate country will be among the first to join the European Union!"
"We have given certain undertakings. Poland is making considerable efforts."
"The date and precise arrangements for accession must be set by common agreement and not in an antagonistic way."
". I welcome the Gawronski report on Poland's application for membership of the European Union and share the majority of conclusions that he draws."
"I note that the Poland is making excellent progress towards meeting the Copenhagen criteria and fulfilling the acquis communautaire."
"If the Poland continues to make progress and the European Union adjusts its institutional structure and policies in order to cope with enlargement I can see no reason why the Poland should not be admitted to the Union."
"I look forward to early Polish membership."
"As far as some of us are concerned, Poland' s accession to the European Union will symbolise deliverance. In this Europe that General de Gaulle had once described as a 'cathedral' , Poland has a unique but well-deserved place."
"The historic, cultural and even emotional links which my country has maintained for centuries with Poland make us French perhaps more sensitive than others to the nature of the welcome which should be reserved for a nation which, almost single-handedly, sums up all the glories and all the tragedies in the experience of this continent of ours."
"Regarded for far too long as the prime battleground for neighbouring aggressors, who always saw the annexation of Poland as the first stop on their expansionist itinerary, the unwilling arena for one of the most abhorrent tragedies in history, and subsequently left for decades to oppression by a totalitarian regime which, encouraged by our culpable silence, thought that it could finally quash Poland' s legendary spirit of resistance, Poland has never ceased to demonstrate forcefully the values of freedom, courage and independence, all those shared values that form the foundation stone on which our construction of a political Europe is supposed to stand."
"We therefore have a duty to embrace Poland as a Member as soon as possible and treat the country as it deserves, as one of our Members for all time."
"Spare us the doubtful audits and requirements for standardisation that are so inopportune. Blinkered application of these would exacerbate rather than improve the situation in this country."
"With 25% of the population employed in agriculture, Poland is not Luxembourg, and the debates on the candidate countries' adoption of the Community acquis sometimes take on a surrealist tone, unless we accept the outrageous idea of a multi-speed Europe where, of all the disparities between peoples, only economic disparities actually counted."
"No, Poland deserves better than a conditional welcome."
"Its past is its best passport, and its dignity its best argument."
"Most of all, this country, which has ceaselessly fought against all hegemony, will bring us a new but, at the same time, experienced insight enabling us to parry the risks of any new imperialism, even that apparently inoffensive one - which may yet be a harbinger of the worst perils - of noble sentiments and a quiet conscience on the cheap."
"In welcoming Poland to our common home, the European Union will be doing justice to a newcomer, justice that has been denied to it for far too long."
"Jürgen Schröder Report (A5-0245/2000)"
"Mr President, I voted for the report on the current status of the Czech Republic's application for membership of the European Union and I would like to take this opportunity to extend a greeting to the pensioners and elderly people of that country."
"I hope that they will receive the European Union's help and support in those issues facing all the elderly people of the Czech Republic following the fall of Communism and the resulting devaluation of their currency and thus their pensions."
"I would stress, as Mr Schröder stated in his report, that inflation in the Czech Republic has fallen from 10.7% in 1999 to 2.1% this year."
"This is evidence of the Czech Republic's clear determination to join the European Union and its commendable commitment to this goal."
"Mr President, I am delighted that the House has adopted Mr Schröder' s excellent report by a majority of more than 90% and that, for the second year in succession, we have made an issue of the Benes decrees, which infringe international law and human rights, as well as highlighting their inconsistency with Community law and practice and with the Copenhagen criteria."
"The House has done this in a way which allows the Czech Republic to distance itself by its own efforts from these decrees that are incompatible with human rights."
"I call on Prague to respond to this signal, this challenge, this plea for dialogue, to grant our request and to ensure, together with our House, that this legacy of a nationalist era can be consigned to the past."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I particularly welcome the amendment tabled by the Green Group to the report on the Czech Republic' s accession to the European Union."
"The Czech Government' s attitude is unacceptable."
"At a time when there was mounting concern about the safety of putting Temelin into operation, it had declared that henceforth it intended deeds to speak louder than words."
"The German environment minister put his finger on the problem in a recent interview."
"He asked whether the Czechs want to join the EU in a community spirit or a spirit of defiance."
"At present, all the signs seem to indicate that defiance rather than reason is the mainspring for the Czech Government' s actions."
"If the Czech Republic joins the Union without the considerable safety risks of Temelin being resolved, it may well prove difficult in future to persuade other candidates for accession to take the nuclear safety requirement seriously."
"Furthermore, I think it is quite crucial to check whether the Benes decrees and AVNOJ provisions, which were used to justify persecution, robbery and murder, are compatible with European Union law."
"We would welcome their repeal as signalling an active process of coming to terms with the past and as a step towards creating a new basis of understanding between peoples."
", in writing. (DE) I rejected the report on the 'Czech Republic' s application for membership of the European Union and the stage of negotiations reached' because Parliament rejected the amendment submitted by the honourable member Matti Wuori."
"A disproportionately large number of breakdowns occurred during the preparations for putting the nuclear reactor Temelin into operation."
"In addition, environmental sustainability tests are not being carried out to an adequate extent, and the central parts of the reactor have not undergone crucial monitoring by international experts."
"I welcome the Schröder report on the Czech Republic's application for membership of the European Union and share the majority of conclusions that he draws."
"I note that the Czech Republic is making excellent progress towards meeting both the Copenhagen criteria and fulfilling the acquis communautaire."
"If the Czech Republic continues to make progress and the European Union adjusts its institutional structure and policies in order to cope with enlargement I can see no reason why the Czech Republic should not be admitted to the Union."
"I look forward to early membership for the Czech Republic."
"Wiersma Report (A5-0244/2000)"
"Mr President, I voted for the report on the current status of Slovakia's application for membership of the European Union."
"I would like to take this opportunity to express my hope that Slovakia's accession to the European Union will alleviate the situation of Slovakian pensioners and elderly people, a situation which is extremely damaging to the interests of all the citizens, particularly the elderly, in that their pensions are not sufficient to provide an adequate standard of living."
"As Mr Wiersma said in his report, I would stress the progress made in the Slovakian Republic in the area of the protection of minorities."
"It should be noted, in particular, that it is permitted to use the Roma language in 57 districts where the Roma population exceeds 20%."
"I welcome the Wiersma report on Slovakia's application for membership of the European Union and share the majority of conclusions that he draws."
"I note that Slovakia is making progress to meeting both the Copenhagen criteria and towards fulfilling the acquis communautaire."
"If Slovakia continues to make progress and the European Union adjusts its institutional structure and policies in order to cope with enlargement I can see no reason why Slovakia should not be admitted to the Union."
"I look forward to Slovakia joining the Community."
"Queiró Report (A5-0248/2000)"
"Mr President, I voted for Mr Queiró's report on the current status of Hungary's application for membership of the European Union."
"The European Union must also be attentive to the standard of living of Hungarian pensioners and elderly people, for they were hit hard by the demise of Communism in that the value of their pensions fell to next to nothing."
"I have no doubt that the European Union will make every effort to resolve their problem."
"Of particular note in Hungary is the considerable increase in machine and tool production brought about by an increase in exports."
"Well done to the Hungarian Republic!"
". I welcome the Queiró report on Hungary's application for membership of the European Union and share the majority of conclusions that he draws."
"I note that Hungary is making good progress towards meeting both the Copenhagen criteria and meeting the obligations of the acquis communautaire."
"If Hungary continues to make progress and the European Union adjusts its institutional structure and policies in order to cope with enlargement I can see no reason why Hungary should not be admitted to the Union."
"I look forward to early membership for Hungary."
"I abstained from the final vote on this report."
"I share the concerns of the European Member of Parliament who, quite rightly, before the vote, discussed the situation of the gipsies and the injustices they suffer in Hungary."
"The existence of serious discrimination against this community, one of the most victimised communities in Europe, is a key element casting doubt over whether Hungary is truly committed to making Europe an area of peace, democracy and prosperity for all its constituent populations."
"Van Orden Report (A5-0241/2000)"
"Mr President, the Pensioners' Party voted for the report on the current status of Bulgaria's application for membership of the European Union."
"I welcome this opportunity to extend a warm greeting to the pensioners and elderly people of the Bulgarian Republic."
"I would like to remind the inhabitants and, in particular, the government of the Bulgarian Republic that, as Mr Van Orden stated in his report, the Kozloduy nuclear power station must be closed down. Since this verdict has been given repeatedly, it would be as well to close it down as soon as possible."
"I call upon Bulgaria to comply with our request."
"The Van Orden report on the accession negotiations with Bulgaria expresses the support of the European Parliament for the integration of Bulgaria into the European Union."
"It correctly underlines the fact that improving the conditions of the Roma, reforming the legal system, cracking down on corruption and upgrading environmental policies will help to ensure that the accession negotiations move forward."
"Of special importance is Paragraph 13 on the widespread support across the European Union for Bulgaria' s removal from the list of countries requiring a visa for travel into EU Member States."
"There continues to be a lack of movement in the Council on this, as there is in the case of Bulgaria. Finally, the European Union must openly address the difficulties faced by Bulgaria, which are due to the political and economical destabilisation of the Balkans, the increase in the price of oil, and the international devaluation of the euro, to which the Bulgarian currency is linked by law."
"Finally, concern must be shown for whole swathes of society in Bulgaria, who are being particularly oppressed because of the austere public policy the country is pursuing as part of its accession strategy."
"I welcome the Van Orden report on Bulgaria's application for membership of the European Union and share the majority of conclusions that he draws."
"I note that Bulgaria is making good progress to meeting both the Copenhagen criteria and meeting the obligations of the acquis communautaire."
"If Bulgaria continues to make progress and the European Union adjusts its institutional structure and policies in order to cope with enlargement I can see no reason why Bulgaria should not be admitted to the Union."
"I look forward to Bulgaria joining the Union in the not too distant future."
"Nicholson of Winterbourne Report (A5-0247/2000)"
"Mr President, I voted for the report on the current status of Romania's application for membership of the European Union."
"Romania is a country which, like the other States of Central and Eastern Europe, deserves to become part of our great family although, as we are aware, there are problems, particularly as regards the widespread corruption present in many areas of public life."
"Sadly, this phenomenon is not restricted to Romania alone, but I particularly hope that the Romanian authorities will distinguish themselves by eliminating this fault as well - which is particularly apparent in their preparations for accession to the European Union - and respect civil rights."
". I voted against this report because the record of the Romanian Government in child care and disabilities rights remains totally unacceptable."
". I welcome the Winterbourne report on Romania's application for membership of the European Union and share the majority of conclusions that she draws."
"I note that Romania is making good progress to meeting both the Copenhagen criteria and meeting the obligations of the acquis communautaire."
"If Romania continues to make progress and the European Union adjusts its institutional structure and policies in order to cope with enlargement I can see no reason why Romania should not be admitted to the Union."
"I look forward to Romania joining the Union in the not too distant future."
"Martelli Report (A5-0242/2000)"
"Mr President, I voted for Mr Martelli's report on the current status of Slovenia's application for membership of the European Union."
"I would like to extend a particularly warm greeting to the Slovenian pensioners and elderly people, who are represented in the country's government by the Slovenian Pensioners' Party, which won 5% of the votes at the last elections."
"Pending a similar success in Italy - hopefully in the near future - I hope that the problems of the Slovenian pensioners and elderly people will be resolved too."
"I may add that it would be as well for Slovenia to withdraw all claims and cease all animosity - which, regrettably, have recently come out, here and there, in certain major statements - in respect of the Italian Republic."
"I welcome the Martelli report on Slovenia's application for membership of the European Union and endorse the conclusions she draws."
"I note that Slovenia has made excellent progress towards meeting the Copenhagen criteria and is making good progress towards fulfilling the acquis communautaire."
"Once the European Union has adjusted its institutional structure and policies in order to cope with enlargement I can see no reason why Slovenia should not be welcomed into the Union."
"I hope Slovenia will be in the first group of new members."
"Poos Report (A5-0249/2000)"
"Mr President, considering that Cyprus is one of the Mediterranean countries which lies in close proximity to the many Central and Eastern European States and that Italy juts out into the Mediterranean as the President of the Republic, Mr Ciampi, recently declared in a formal sitting of the Italian Parliament, I am particularly pleased to note that the report emphasises the fact that Cyprus' preparations are sufficient for it to join the European Union."
"I feel that this step and the entry of Cyprus into the European Union will prove extremely important in terms of bringing peace to this tortured island in our Mediterranean."
"Mr President, my vote on the report on Cyprus should be seen as a protest against its lack of balance, because I am not opposed to the entry of Cyprus to the European Union."
"On the contrary, I am keen to see Cyprus in, but I could not accept this unbalanced report, especially paragraph 4, and the failure to insist on at least on the desirability of having a political settlement prior to accession."
"In addition, the report called for the repatriation of settlers which presumably includes their children born and raised in Cyprus."
"Whatever the solution on settlers, and it is a thorny issue along with land restitution on both sides, this is too harsh without giving a qualification."
"The European Parliament has failed in its duty to reflect a balanced approach which I very much regret."
"Of course the Republic of Cyprus is the internationally recognised state but we should do more to recognise the rights as well as the duties of the Turkish-Cypriot community."
"The Poos report on the accession of the Republic of Cyprus to the European Union contains a number of positive points:"
"it unequivocally recognises the legal authorities of the Republic of Cyprus;"
"it underscores the fact that the accession negotiations are independent of the political settlement of the Cyprus question, thereby ensuring that Cyprus will not be a hostage to Turkey;"
"it highlights Turkey' s responsibility and that of the Turkish Cypriots in not resolving the Cyprus question;"
"it deplores the presence of the Turkish troops in Cyprus and the provocation this causes;"
"it raises the issue of the return of the refugees and the repatriation of the settlers."
"This is a balanced and fair position, which the Council of Ministers must take into serious consideration."
"I regret I cannot support the Poos report on Cyprus."
"The fourth round of Cyprus proximity talks took place in New York from 12-26 September."
"The parties have agreed to meet next in Geneva on 1-10 November."
"The UN settlement process has now lasted since December 1999 without a break, longer than any of the previous attempts to solve the Cyprus problem."
"The UN Secretary-General's Special Adviser on Cyprus, Alvaro de Soto, said at his press briefing on 26 September that a ""qualitative step forward"" had taken place in the fourth round of talks."
"He emphasised that, while there is still a long way to go, the two sides had engaged in substance during the talks in a way that they had not done before."
"He observed that new ground was being broken, which might cause nervousness in some quarters."
"But he looked forward in the coming months to building on the progress that has already been made."
"He also noted that the UN was already in contact with the EU in order to ensure that there was no clash with the goals of the United Nations process."
"As Mr de Soto noted, we do not expect progress to be easy, and the success of the UN process is far from assured."
"The UK position is that it is vital for us to do everything we can to show our support for the Secretary-General's efforts."
"Unfortunately some of the comments made in the draft report on the application by Cyprus for membership of the European Union by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy are not helpful."
"The use of polemical language and the one-sided impression given of MEPs' views risks undermining the process."
"I therefore hope that MEPs will do all they can to encourage the European Parliament to express its support for progress in the UN settlement process, based on the continuing goodwill of all parties in that process and that they will ensure that the European Parliament does not produce statements or take positions which might cut across that process."
"As a member of the Delegation to the EU-Cyprus Joint Parliamentary Committee, I am pleased to have this opportunity to express my opinion on the progress Cyprus has made in the negotiations for accession to the European Union."
"The European Commission' s assessment is very positive."
"Cyprus meets all the Copenhagen political and economic criteria."
"To date, 16 out of 31 chapters have been closed and the efforts of the Republic of Cyprus to meet all the criteria are ongoing."
"Cyprus may therefore look forward to becoming a member of the European Union in the near future, and any objection to this membership on the grounds of the special situation of the island would not be defensible either politically or morally."
"This is, moreover, made clear by the conclusions of the Helsinki European Council, which affirm, in the final analysis, that solution of the 'Cyprus question' is not a necessary precondition for accession."
"In this connection, I would hope that the talks conducted under the auspices of the United Nations will be able to come to a successful conclusion enabling the Greek and Turkish Cypriot populations to enjoy the advantages of membership of the European Union in the context of a reunified republic."
"I would also like to urge that the European Union, through its High Representative for the CFSP, should get involved to a greater extent in seeking a negotiated solution in order to put an end to the partition of the island, in application of the United Nations Security Council resolutions."
"The European Union does have the capacity to make a key contribution to the security of the Cypriot communities in the context of a peace settlement."
"It can help resolve the problem of the controlled return of refugees and the repatriation of colonists, and can make a considerable contribution to the development of the northern part of Cyprus, after reunification and after the withdrawal of the Turkish army."
"It is essential to initiate projects involving both communities and to encourage dialogue between both parts in a new spirit of trust."
"The European Union must convince the Turkish Cypriot community, which comprises approximately 89 000 members, that they should get involved unconditionally in the accession talks. It is in their direct interest."
"Indeed, Cyprus' accession should benefit both communities and should enable the Turkish Cypriots to make good their economic backwardness."
"Their per capita income is three times less than that of Greek Cypriots."
"It is therefore essential for Turkish Cypriots to express their point of view on the accession negotiations."
"It is not going to be an easy task, given the lack of good will on the part of the Turkish Cypriot side and of Turkey."
"Even if recent events in the region do not encourage optimism, the European Union must continue to bring its weight to bear in the talks seeking an overall settlement of the Cyprus question."
". -The Verts/ALE Group supports the report by Mr Poos on the accession of the Republic of Cyprus to the EU."
"It regrets nevertheless that its amendment on the issue of the settlers has not been adopted by the House."
"It is absolutely impossible to solve the issue of the settlers who arrived in Northern Cyprus from Turkey a long time ago simply by sending them back, as the report suggests."
"It is unfortunate that the EU takes a one-sided position on such an acute and difficult question."
"Proximity talks are not proceeding as we would have hoped."
"We are convinced that initiatives at all levels are required if to break the deadlock which have been reached in negotiations."
"We hope that the perspective of early membership of the EU and the easing of contacts by means of ""bottom-up"" communal projects that the EU promised to promote and finance can give a positive impetus to the solution of the ""Cyprus question""."
". I warmly welcome Mr Poos' report on Cyprus's application for membership of the European Union."
"I note that Cyprus is making good progress in incorporating the acquis communautaire thus allowing accession negotiations to move swiftly along."
"Like the rapporteur, I too welcome the Helsinki Council agreement not to make a solution to the division of the island a pre-condition for accession."
"There is no doubt that the accession of Cyprus to the Union will strengthen the influence of the European Union in the eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East."
"From the economic point of view, the accession of Cyprus should not pose major problems, since it is a country with a market economy and a high standard of living."
"I look forward to seeing Cyprus among the next group of new members."
"Stenzel Report (A5-0243/2000)"
"I note with interest Mrs Stenzel's report on Malta's application for membership of the European Union."
"Malta meets all the requirements for membership of the European Union and there is really only one obstacle to full membership. That obstacle is the divided nature of public opinion and the political parties on the desirability of membership."
"The Maltese Government should ensure that a constructive dialogue takes place with all sections of their community to ensure as wide a consensus as possible on the issue of membership."
"Providing that consensus is reached I look forward to Maltese membership of the EU."
"Paulsen Report (A5-0257/2000)"
"Mr President, what remains to be said on the subject of food safety and the precautions to be taken in order to avoid further instances of contamination or further food crises?"
"Mrs Paulsen' s report grasps the extremely serious nature of the situation but does not go far enough in view of the stakes involved."
"The outrages - one no longer dares to speak of mere infringements or minor abuses - in the industrial agro-food processing chain in the context of liberalism, competition and the frenzied thirst for profits, have actually proved lethal, even criminal, it must be said."
"Deliberate violations of health, criminal and even moral codes by doctoring the laws of nature and tampering with animal species and animal physiology are conducted without being subject to any surveillance or appropriate regulations or any justified penalties."
"Yet we consumers are the last stage in the food chain, and hence the final recipients of the abuses and counterfeits in the food industry."
"Should we be surprised, then, to find ourselves the victims of these, and even, unfortunately, to yield to them?"
"It is irresponsible and fraudulent to disregard the infinite complexity of the workings and relationships within the industrial agro-food chain in order to admit that it is no longer possible to monitor and separate out exactly what is going on in order to apply appropriate penalties."
"Every link in the chain must be responsible for what it produces and for its precisely identifiable role."
"The safety bolt guaranteeing this discipline lies in the Commission' s determination to ensure that consumers are provided with consistent quality, at all levels, in the products available on the market."
"So, in refusing to accept the inclusion of genetically modified foodstuffs as undesirable products, the European Parliament has taken the responsibility of being completely out of step with the public and the people that elected its Members, as consumers are proving to be more and more reluctant on the matter of GMOs, going so far as to reject them outright when they do have the opportunity to identify them in food."
"Nor should we be surprised if the agro-food industry leaps headlong into this breach and banks totally on animal feedingstuffs to consume their GMOs."
"The ball is now in the Commission' s court. It must make good its omissions by proposing and implementing urgent measures in response to the perfectly justified concerns of consumers."
"Mr President, the wholesomeness of feed materials and feedingstuffs is, of course, very important to the Pensioners' Party, and so I voted for the Paulsen report."
"To be honest, I have to say that up until yesterday I did not know whether I would give an explanation of vote, but then, as I was leaving Parliament yesterday evening, together with Mr Andria and Mr Speroni - whose first name is Francesco and who is therefore celebrating his name day today, and I wish him and all the other Francescos present in this House a very happy day - I started to feel dizzy, to vomit and to be affected by other such symptoms."
"I was, alas, the victim of an - albeit mild - dose of food poisoning, brought on, I regret to say, by eating at the European Parliament."
"What, therefore, will happen if the animals we eat also start to suffer from fainting fits and dizzy spells, as I did?"
"We must prevent any inclusion whatsoever of undesirable substances in animal feedingstuffs."
"Food safety requires that we must increasingly pay the closest attention to feedingstuffs, given the close links that exist between animal nutrition and human nutrition."
"That is why the amendments to Directive 1999/29/EC are so important, to ensure that it will cover all products in whatever form that are liable to be used in animal nutrition, both those intended for the production of raw materials for consumption and those for domestic animals not intended for consumption."
"Another positive step is the ban on diluting batches of products that have higher levels of undesirable substances than the established maximum limits with non-harmful products in order to get around the established maximum limits."
"With regard to the setting of maximum limits, several aspects must be taken into account, such as the continuous appearance of new chemical products and the need for periodic reviews based on precise scientific analyses and verified experiments, or even in certain cases the need to compensate market operators, especially farmers in particular situations when they are in no way to blame for the contamination of the products used in animal nutrition."
"Since 1997, when the mad cow scandal was uncovered, Parliament has been asking for animal feedingstuffs to be given the utmost attention."
"We must effectively be vigilant in this area as animal feedingstuffs are the first link in the food chain."
"We are particularly keen to implement in a practical manner at European level this concept of food safety from the stable to the table, or from the pitchfork to the fork."
"The three reports adopted today make it possible to progress in the right direction."
"The prohibition of undesirable substances in animal feedingstuffs is therefore a basic element in our food safety policy."
"First of all, because it is important to set acceptable health limits, and secondly, because it is necessary to prohibit the possibility of diluting contaminated foods in healthy foods in order to make them of a quality fit for consumption."
"We have the example of the thousands of litres of dioxin-contaminated milk which could be legally watered down with quantities of healthy milk."
"The principle of this exceptional practice is quite scandalous."
"Until now, poisoning has been legal provided that it is carried out in infinitesimal doses."
"Furthermore, the practice of watering down contaminants leaves the way clear for fraud throughout the territory of Europe."
"The destruction of contaminated foods or food compounds provides a twofold guarantee making it possible to limit the trafficking in this type of food."
"Firstly, it is guarantee of safety for the consumers who will, naturally, be the first beneficiaries of this measure, and secondly, it is a guarantee for the crop farmers and animal farmers that only health food is available on the market."
"For all these reasons I voted in favour of the ban on dilution proposed by the European Commission."
"It was, moreover, essential to step up harmonisation of the conditions of performing checks and inspections in the field of animal feedingstuffs."
"That has now been done."
"I should now like to see the Council of Ministers moving ahead rapidly and supporting the amendments we have adopted."
"Paulsen Report (A5-0256/2000)"
"It is important that a full, detailed declaration of the ingredients of compound feedingstuffs should become mandatory to guarantee their safety, by means of clear, transparent labelling which will allow stock farmers to make their own decisions on feed purchases."
"As we all know, back in 1997, in the aftermath of the BSE crisis, Parliament called for legislation to this end, and this call was reiterated after the scandal in Belgium last year when dioxins were found in feedingstuffs."
"It is also important that an exhaustive list of permissible feed materials should be drawn up and that manufacturers should submit on request proof of the composition of feedingstuffs on the basis of internal company documentation."
"RC B5-0768/2000 (ASEM III)"
"We have voted against the joint resolution based on a recital which, behind its hypocritical wording, suggests that relations between Asia and Europe are conducted between equal partners."
"Most Asian countries still bear the scars from their past 'partnerships' with the major powers, particularly those in Europe."
"Was the centuries long relationship between Great Britain and India a partnership between equals?"
"Or that between France and its colonies in Indochina?"
"Or that between China and all the great powers that attempted to dismember it into areas that suited their respective interests?"
"In addition, in very recent times, the poor masses in a number of countries in South-Eastern Asia have had to pay a high price for their 'partnership' with the speculative capital interests which have swarmed all over their region."
"In view of the past, in view of the current economic relations between the developed major powers and the poor countries of Asia, speaking of 'equal partners' for the future is, at best, a pious hope, and, more probably, a means of concealing exploitative relations behind pseudo-democratic and pseudo-humanitarian phrases."
"It is precisely because we are in favour of developing genuinely fraternal cooperation relationships between genuinely equal partners, between all the countries of the world, that we have no intention of endorsing this double talk by voting in favour."
"The joint resolution on the third Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM 3) discusses the forthcoming meeting of the ASEM 2000 People's Forum in Seoul. It endorses the establishment of a social forum and the strengthening of ""civil society dialogue"" ."
"It also, however, sets itself the major objective of initiating a round of global negotiations within the WTO seeking to liberalise trade ever increasingly and, further, to reinforce ""the WTO's rules-based system"" ."
"This forced, unfair liberalisation of trade and increase in the powers of the WTO are precisely what the social movements, the trade unions, associations and NGOs within the People' s Forum are protesting against!"
"Since, to date, ASEM has continued to be, in the main, an economic rather than social or political process, the 'hard core' of the joint resolution is this alignment with the neoliberal commercial order incarnated by the WTO."
"It is therefore easy to understand the support it has for the broad guidelines of the Commission' s approach."
"Yet for those of us who have an ear tuned to the demands of the people, ""social dialogue"" must emphatically not take place ""in this context"" when that means the context of the WTO rules, as the resolution states."
"We therefore have no choice but to vote against the joint resolution."
". I would like to add my voice to those condemning the acts of violence against one of my constituents, James Mawdsley from Ormskirk in Lancashire."
"I welcome the vote by this Parliament deploring the flagrant violations of James' rights under UN international law."
"Mark Rowland of Jubilee Campaign will be absolutely delighted that the European Parliament has joined the UN in condemning his treatment."
"We must continue to condemn human rights abuses in Burma."
"We, as elected Members, are outraged that 51 democratically elected members of the NLD are in prison, victims like James, of inhuman and cruel abuse."
"James' only crime was to speak up for and campaign for human rights and democracy in Burma."
"He should be commended for his efforts, which have caused him and his family such torment."
"We must urge the ASEM countries in this resolution to pressurise the military regime in Burma to restore democracy."
"That concludes the explanations of votes."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.22 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Discrimination and equal treatment in the workplace"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"A5-0259/2000 by Mr Cashman, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council Decision establishing a Community Action Programme to combat discrimination (2001-2006) (COM(1999) 567 - C5-0046/2000 - 1999/0251(CNS));"
"A5-0264/2000 by Mr Thomas Mann, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on the proposal for a Council directive establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation (COM(1999) 565 - C5-0068/2000 - 1999/0225(CNS))."
"Mr President, it is an honour for me to be standing in this chamber presenting what is not only my first report as an MEP but also a report that relates to a subject so close to my heart."
"I would like to express my sincere thanks to my co-rapporteur, Elizabeth Lynne, for her cooperation and constructive comments and extend that gratitude to all Members of the Article 13 Rapporteurs' Working Group."
"As rapporteur on the Action Programme to combat discrimination, I have tried to improve the Commission's text on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights."
"I should point out to Members that the Council working group agreed unanimously to recommend to the Council that the type of committee in the action programme should be modified to a mixed committee, a combination of the management and advisory procedures, thereby increasing the power of the individual Member States."
"The Council informed Parliament before the vote in committee, but only just before, deliberately ruling out any chance of further debate with myself or Parliament."
"As rapporteur I believe the original Commission proposals on the composition of the committee to be the best approach to achieving Parliament's and the programme's objectives."
"A politician can have no greater responsibility than to be given the opportunity to redress the wrongs so often visited upon minorities."
"I accept that responsibility eagerly, with a determination to ensure that this action programme to combat discrimination, not just in the EU but also in the candidate countries, is not the end of a noble process, but the beginning."
"For those of us comfortable and secure enough to fashion our own working and social environment, we can only begin to imagine the appalling, and sometimes life-threatening, discrimination which people face daily. Why does such discrimination exist?"
"It is illogical, irrational and based on ignorance."
"It exists because good men and women do nothing or we begin to do something and never finish."
"We are partial in our approach and application."
"We favour certain minorities and groups, but not others."
"We become chastened by public opinion or the media."
"By being chastened, we create and confirm a hierarchy of oppression."
"Whilst compiling my report, I was sad to realise that some NGOs believe their continuation is more important than that of other groups."
"Only one NGO made the connection between its oppression and the oppression of all the groups cited in Article 13 and that was the UK-based Stonewall Group."
"That is why I, as a member of a minority, issue this stern warning that unless we recognise that discrimination against one group is discrimination against all we will achieve nothing except the proliferation of NGOs and other groups."
"No one group should advance at the expense of another."
"We must remember that we are dealing with real pain and suffering and real lives."
"Members may have received queries from NGOs on funding and specifically core funding."
"I understand their concerns, but I have assurances from the Commission that NGOs will still be able to bid for funds on this and other programmes and initiatives managed by the Commission."
"In my report, I have called for greater representation and involvement of NGOs, greater accountability to Parliament, the production of an annual report to be debated by Parliament, the highest possible degree of transparency, promotion of remembrance of the past in the fight against prejudice and the recognition of multiple discrimination."
"The EU does not have a good record on eradicating discrimination."
"Now is the time to do the job and it must be done with every fibre of our being."
"We can never buy off the bigots; we will only encourage them further."
"Imagine the world through the eyes of a child growing up in a world which discriminates against it because it is female, a member of an ethnic minority, disabled or a lesbian."
"We have so much to do for that child and for others."
"This is no time for the faint-hearted."
"If we lack the courage to end discrimination, than at least we must have the integrity and the decency to admit it exists."
"As politicians, we must have the courage to be unpopular in the short term to do what is right and just in the long term."
"I urge Parliament to support my report."
"Mr President, Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam has been described as a sleeping giant."
"It forms the basis for Europe-wide measures to combat discrimination."
"My job was to consider the framework directive on employment and occupation, which will lead to major changes in company practice."
"The experience gained with the Anti-Discrimination Act in the USA ten years ago gives some idea of what lies ahead for Europe."
"That is why it is quite essential for the groups listed in Article 13 to be effectively protected against discrimination."
"At the same time, the workers' legitimate interests need to be considered."
"No wonder the French Presidency of Council described this issue as one of its priorities."
"Discrimination must be combated in the early stages, in cases of an intimidating, hostile or offensive environment."
"And all the players must be involved."
"Human resources can only be utilised to the full in a climate of peace at the workplace."
"That produces an economic and social dividend."
"Some undertakings reject applicants for continuing and ongoing training on the pretext that they are too young or too old."
"Older people are discriminated against by being squeezed out of working life or by setting an upper age limit for recruitment."
"Job applicants who come from socially disadvantaged families or urban backgrounds or who are disabled are often not accepted."
"The disabled are rejected on the pretext that the clients or staff cannot be expected to stand the sight of them."
"The underlying intention is simply to save paying for the necessary measures of assistance for the disabled."
"The employers then claim that hiring disabled people represents what is called undue hardship."
"In the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs we defined ""reasonable adjustment"" very precisely in Article 2(4), together with the circumstances under which undertakings cannot reasonably be expected to pay the costs involved, i.e., if they are too small or their turnover is too low."
"I certainly support the call by associations representing the disabled for a separate directive."
"That directive could consider the differences in detail, for instance the fact that someone whose mobility is impaired has quite different problems from, say, someone who is mentally disabled."
"A few important points in the directive are, firstly, the rules on the burden of proof."
"Article 9 of the draft directive states that persons who consider themselves discriminated against, whether as unsuccessful job applicants or as dismissed workers, can seek legal remedy."
"They need only go to a court or competent authority to establish the facts of discrimination."
"The respondent, however, has to prove that he did not discriminate and must be able to provide documentary evidence."
"To ensure that small and medium-sized undertakings in particular are not faced with an unreasonable logistical and financial outlay, we are seeking a limitation period of six to twelve months."
"Secondly, the right of associations to initiate proceedings."
"The Commission proposal, under which associations may only initiate proceedings with the complainant' s approval, has to be welcomed."
"Only associations, organisations or legal entities representing the interests of employees and the groups protected by Article 13 should be entitled to initiate proceedings."
"Thirdly, the mediating agency. In the event of disputes, independent mediating agencies must be set up to consider the interests of both the employers and the employees."
"Many problems may well be resolved internally, before going to the lengths of legal proceedings."
"The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs decided by a majority that these agencies should be set up in the EU Member States rather than setting up a central body at European level."
"Fourthly, the involvement of the two sides of industry."
"Since they are mainly responsible for settling questions of discrimination at the workplace, the social partners are best placed to work out viable solutions."
"And, of course, the NGOs should be involved, although the autonomy of the social partners must not be put in question at any time."
"Fifthly, religious communities, perhaps one of the most sensitive areas of our directive."
"The question is whether Member States can allow different treatment when it comes to religion or belief."
"I think they can!"
"These communities make vital contributions to society in terms of social facilities such as nurseries, hospitals and educational institutions."
"They see the danger of having to hire people who do not identify with their values and convictions."
"The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs voted by a large majority in favour of the compromise under which different treatment does not represent discrimination in cases where religion and belief are major requirements for the performance of a job."
"Equal treatment and non-discrimination are fundamental principles of the EU."
"We will find out at tomorrow' s vote whether we manage to build bridges, following the excellent cooperation of all the rapporteurs on this article - and let me just mention Mrs Swiebel as standing for all of them - and after the intensive discussions with the Commission and the Council Presidency."
"There is a real chance that we will persuade the Commission and the Council to incorporate many of our recommendations."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Cashman for an excellent report and for taking on board a lot of the points that were raised in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"I found it very useful working so closely together on Article 13 across the board under the Hughes' procedure."
"The Action Programme must enable groups that are discriminated against to take action themselves."
"It must ensure equal access to the programme for disabled people and it must make sure that funding does not fall below the preparatory actions."
"We must also prepare further for anti-discrimination legislation on all grounds in the future, including a disability directive."
"It has been brought home very strongly to me how we much need one in the light of the Article 13 hearings."
"Jenny was from the Access Charter, she was the coordinator for the group and I invited her to the hearings on Article 13."
"To start, with she could not get into Parliament except through the swing doors."
"Next we booked a disabled access hotel only to find that a single bed was put across the bathroom."
"She tried to get a taxi in Brussels and was refused."
"She tried to get into a restaurant to have a meal and was refused entry on the grounds that her physical appearance would put other diners off."
"The final indignity was that when she went to Brussels airport she was subjected to a full body search and then, when she remonstrated, was told: ""Have a nice trip, I hope your plane crashes."""
"That is why we need anti-discrimination legislation."
"Briefly, on the employment directive, I would like to congratulate Thomas Mann for an excellent report."
"Again this was a close working relationship."
"This is ground-breaking legislation and it is a gigantic step forward but we must go even further."
"I also urge you to vote for the amendment by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on age."
"Discrimination on any grounds is wrong, equally wrong."
"We must vote for both these pieces of legislation tomorrow and at long last demonstrate our commitment to stamping out discrimination in all its forms."
". (NL) Mr President, the directive and the Action Programme on equal treatment bear witness both to a policy which is based on principles and to a practical policy."
"Indeed, equal treatment is a fundamental constitutional right which forms one of the cornerstones of the European Union."
"They also form part of a practical policy because directives and action programmes encourage the Member States to fight discrimination on the basis of the same guiding principles and because the Commission can fulfil its role as Guardian of the Treaties but also as a pioneer in the social debate."
"The above also highlights the link between both instruments, the directive and the Action Programme."
"Not only do the social activities which underpin the social programme complement the directive' s legal framework, they also need to generate the extra information, the expertise and the support structure to complement and improve this legal framework."
"I hope to illustrate the need for this in the rest of my speech."
"The two proposals which the European Parliament is discussing today are both based on Article 13 of the EC Treaty."
"This Article 13 has now taken on a central role in the equal treatment framework of the European Union."
"It thus follows in the footsteps of the current Article 141, formerly Article 119, which lay - and still lies - at the basis of European legislation to combat sex discrimination."
"There are, however, major differences."
"First of all, we are dealing with a different decision-making procedure involving the European Parliament which, with regard to the implementation of Article 13, cannot yet fulfil its role of co-legislator."
"Secondly, a whole raft of pieces of legislation has now been drafted concerning the equal treatment of men and women, the oldest dating back 25 years."
"An overhaul of this legislation is therefore overdue."
"This summer, the Council adopted a directive to combat discrimination on the basis of race or ethnic origin."
"This directive provides a higher level of protection, and is wider in scope, than both existing equal treatment legislation on men and women and the draft directive which we are discussing here today."
"We in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs have always argued that this fragmented approach gives the wrong political signal, as if there might be some sort of hierarchy in discrimination."
"A patchwork of anti-discrimination rules also has a detrimental effect when it comes to drafting coherent legislation and also forms a threat to what has been achieved in European equal treatment theory."
"I am delighted that this viewpoint has been taken on board by the rapporteur."
"I would therefore like to extend a heartfelt thanks to Mr Mann for his open attitude and for the constructive consultation we have entered into."
"Partly thanks to this, we now have a large number of legal, technical amendments before us which aim to guarantee a level of equal protection against discrimination on the basis of race on the one hand and on the basis of religion, handicap, age and sexual orientation on the other."
"This touches on topics such as indirect discrimination, harassment, positive action, burden of proof, etc. The role of the so-called independent monitoring body is also called into question."
"As already stated, the level of protection concerning the fight against sex discrimination should also be brought into line with the highest standard."
"This is the gist of the directive against race discrimination which was adopted recently."
"Fortunately, the Commission has provided for this by submitting its proposal for reparative legislation."
"The European Parliament, in its role of co-legislator, will be able to get its teeth into this shortly."
"I would at this stage like to offer my services to the appointed rapporteur, Mrs Hautala, in this respect."
"The current picture is also fragmented in terms of scope or area of application."
"The directive on race discrimination has the widest scope, and mainly applies to social life outside the labour market."
"The existing set of directives concerning sex discrimination pertains to labour, remuneration and social security, whilst the current measures against discrimination on the other grounds specified in Article 13 apply to a much narrower area."
"I am delighted that the Commission pledged its willingness this summer to compile a draft directive also to combat sex discrimination outside the employment sphere, but I cannot understand why such an announcement for the other grounds of discrimination has not yet been forthcoming."
"This is the background to Amendments Nos 19 and 35, which contain a horizon provision ..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, discrimination, in any of its guises, deeply offends our sense of co-existence and undermines one of the guiding principles of the Union, that of equality of treatment."
"This principle, as well as the prohibition of all types of discrimination, have also been included in the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"I shall now comment on the fight against discrimination which we are examining today along with the proposal for a directive."
"The programme, despite being modest financially, can play a significant role in strengthening the mechanisms for combating discrimination and will achieve its aims if there is coordination, at both a Community level and within the Member States, with other programmes and initiatives in the same field."
"It is the Member States who are most directly responsible for the eradication of discriminatory practices and it is therefore essential that we incorporate all our accumulated experience and acquis in this field, and that this Parliament ensures that it is effectively monitored."
"We must support the social partners, the NGOs and other institutions which are pursuing the same objective, and we must also demand rigour in the selection of the actions and organisations which we are to support financially."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we are all aware of the budgetary pressures that exist within category 3 expenditure, which includes this and other programmes."
"Although the present legal basis releases appropriations for new preparatory actions, their funding within this category could lead to a reduction in appropriations for other policies."
"I would like to point out that, despite the commitment from the Commission, there is no express mention in the programme of technical assistance costs which are nevertheless envisaged in the financial statement."
"For this reason, the sum total of the appropriations must be allocated to financing operating expenditure."
"The citizens expect us to implement concrete measures."
"The fight against discrimination is something which concerns us all."
"In my view, this programme operates within a very general scope."
"Without prejudicing its objectives, we should support actions which are more in touch with the realities of discrimination."
"With regard to the proposal for a directive, I would like firstly to congratulate Mr Thomas Mann on the excellent work he has done."
"Balance, moderation and legal expertise were required and I believe that his report reflects those qualities."
"The common objective of eradicating discrimination in the field of employment can and must be pursued from many angles, but it is clear that the role to be played makes it essential to establish a minimal legal framework which must be consistent with all the measures to combat discrimination and, in particular, with the directive on race."
"The Member States already have a legal framework, both in the constitutional field and in ordinary legislation, and experience of the measures adopted in the fight against discrimination, which must be taken into account."
"Therefore, the concepts of framework directive and minimal directive are the key to interpreting the present proposal for a directive."
"However, the establishment of a perfect legal architecture which prohibits discrimination and protects the victims of it, does not guarantee its eradication in practice nor the elimination of its causes."
"It is therefore essential, amongst other things, to encourage and promote the culture of dialogue."
"The system of penalties laid down in the directive must guarantee that it acts as a deterrent and that it is effective in the eradication of discriminatory practices."
"However, as well as the penalties, the declaration of invalidity of activities is also important in the case of serious violations of the principles laid down in the directive."
"The exception of a difference in treatment which may be made on ideological or religious grounds or for reasons of age must bring together the law which protects certain public and private organisations with scrupulous respect for the principle of equal treatment."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this proposal for a framework directive is necessary but not sufficient, and we will have the opportunity to improve its mechanisms once the implementation period is over."
"The fight against discrimination will be a long one and we must therefore be attentive to the results of the measures we are debating today."
"I, too, congratulate both the rapporteurs, Mr Cashman and Mr Mann, on their excellent work."
"This package of legislation will open a new and radical chapter in the EU's history of commitment to securing equal opportunities and combating the modern scourge of discrimination."
"This Parliament will send a clear message in our vote to all our citizens that we intend to improve Member States' record in ensuring respect for equal treatment, irrespective of age, race, disability and sexual orientation."
"For individuals in my constituency this legislation is long overdue."
"However, I regret that some of the Christian Democrat Members in the Committee on Legal Affairs, in voting against the employment directive, saw it as unnecessary because it would, and I quote: ""restrict freedom of choice in private life""."
"But I ask you: whose freedom?"
"The freedom of those who continue to discriminate against individuals?"
"That is a freedom that this House should not seek to protect - it is neither Christian nor democratic!"
"In addition, their view is that cases of discrimination are not so numerous as to warrant any legislation."
"Perhaps they ought to talk more to their local constituents and those who suffer from discrimination."
"It is also best to give local examples to show how this legislation is relevant."
"In my constituency a retired head teacher from Manchester who is over 70 years of age, with much experience, was appointed to serve on the police authority by Manchester City Council."
"Following a complaint about her age, she was told she was too old to take up the position and not eligible, according to the current British Police Act."
"This legislation, therefore, is good for individuals like her."
"UK employment legislation will now have to be reviewed to ensure that ability, not age, determines who gets the job."
"Indeed the Home Secretary, Jack Straw, is now reviewing the legislation to remove such anomalies of discrimination."
"Discrimination, in whatever forms it exists, whichever group it affects, is wasteful and unacceptable, as the Confederation of British Industry has said. Again I quote: ""some enlightened employers are realising the potential of employing people from right across the board, from all walks of life."
"In another company in my constituency, B&Q, the grey revolution has begun. In Macclesfield one of their stores is staffed by only over 50 year olds and their oldest employee is 86!"
"I think that is a very good example to follow."
"This legislation will encourage employers to seek to use the talents, the ability, the experience of all people in our society."
"It is the biggest overhaul of discriminatory legislation that we will ever see in Europe and back in our own Member States."
"Yes, it will create changes in employment law, yes, it will create changes in general legislation and for the courts, but I do not believe this Parliament or the European Union can shy away from making those changes which will open up a world of opportunity for groups which have suffered for too long from the cancer of discrimination."
"Mr President, we often hear that Europe is distant and remote from its citizens."
"But the kind of legislation we are looking at today will have a big impact on peoples' lives and make people understand that here in Strasbourg and Brussels we do things that make a difference."
"I should like to congratulate the Commission on its work in bringing forward these proposals so speedily and the professionalism of the civil servants who helped us bring these reports forward."
"They have done an excellent job."
"Regarding the specifics of the report, I would like to thank Mr Mann who took on board most of the comments from the Committee on Industry, particularly those concerning multiple discrimination - as in the case of women, who are the target of other discrimination."
"I hope the Commission will look carefully at gender discrimination legislation in the light of this new directive."
"Similarly they took on board our comments on the involvement of NGOs."
"It is very important that organisations representing the people affected are listened to, because they will help us make the transition from fine words here today to practical policies that work in our Member States."
"Turning to Mr Cashman's report, I would like to congratulate my colleague on his first report."
"If this is a sign of what is to come, I hope he does many more."
"From the point of view of my committee, it is very important that anything the action plan does in the field of work on age and disability complements the work undertaken as part of the research programmes, the framework programmes."
"There is not enough money in the action programme to replace that work which takes place in the fifth framework which will hopefully continue in any other framework programmes, but we need to make sure they work together."
"Secondly, I am pleased that the Commission has recognised the need to continue core funding for European NGOs."
"I do not consider that the main aim of European programmes is to support these organisations, but without them it would be very difficult for us to hear the voices of those target groups."
"I hope special attention will be paid to the needs of the disabled community, who have many different issues they would like to see tackled."
"Finally, there are those in this House - I have heard them in my committee and elsewhere - who argue that we do not need this kind of legislation, it is too burdensome, it is a lawyers' charter."
"Fortunately many of those people are away this week at the British seaside."
"They have other things to do, so they cannot be here, but we should not be surprised at these comments and we should take no heed of them."
"We hear them every time we have legislation like this."
"We heard them years ago on equal pay for women, we heard them on all equal opportunities legislation, on improvements in maternity leave, we heard them in connection with the race directive before the summer, and so we should carry on regardless."
"This is good legislation."
"Mrs McCarthy said that good employers want this kind of legislation."
"Citizens want it too."
"I congratulate the Commission and my colleagues who drew up the report."
"We hope that this goes through rapidly and that the ministers will make rapid progress too."
"Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate the Commission on the initiative to develop Article 13 of the Treaty further."
"After so many years of talk, we finally have an initiative to tackle discrimination in different areas more effectively."
"I would also like to congratulate Mr Mann on the results of his work on the present report."
"It is a sensitive topic."
"Everyone is agreed that discrimination should be fought but opinions differ as to how, to what extent and by what means."
"Discrimination can have different consequences for men and women."
"I am pleased that what is now before us affords women better protection than the existing directive on the principle of equal treatment, especially with regard to vocational training, employment and employment conditions."
"I should like to highlight the importance of a person in whom employees can confide within an organisation and the importance of an independent body to which people and organisations can turn in the event of complaints concerning discrimination and intimidation."
"Positive experiences have been gained in this respect in the Netherlands."
"I also welcome the attention given to the problem of discrimination against the elderly."
"It is a growing problem, especially since the number of elderly people is growing in our society and they happen to be the most dynamic generation of elderly people ever."
"I would like to end by commenting on Article 4 (2) concerning discrimination on the basis of religion and belief, which is a sensitive area, particularly within our Group."
"It touches upon the theme of pluralism, the importance of which to the proper functioning of our democracy is recognised by many."
"But in the discussions on pluralism, most of the time we talk about doing justice to the different opinions of individuals."
"There is far less openness towards, and thought for, individuals wanting to express their opinions through organisations, for, in those instances, there is hardly any respect for pluralism but, rather, intolerance and discrimination, especially with regard to organisations founded on religious or ideological bases."
"I applaud the recommendation of the Mann report to offer ideological organisations the opportunity to prescribe the functions required of staff with this background in mind."
"It is a compromise, but one which enjoys wide support within Parliament."
"I urgently call on the Commission to adopt this recommendation and to do justice to the tolerance and pluralism desired by the representatives of so many States."
"Mr President, no sensible person can think that the European Parliament does not have to concern itself with discrimination, even if, in the case in point, it is a matter of rewriting and expressing our opinion on a report proposing a decision for the Council of Ministers which will do whatever it wants to anyway."
"That is the reason why the PPE-DE Group would perhaps have preferred are more compact and occasionally more intelligible text, which at least avoided some of the repetition, for, as the saying goes, 'He who grasps at too much loses everything.'"
"Indeed, parts of this text refer, in particular, to equality between men and women, giving rise to a specific policy or quite novel concepts such as gender-specific perspectives, or concepts which occasionally, and this is one of our fears, extend the scope of discrimination too far."
"The fact remains that the report tabled by our fellow Member, Mr Cashman contains many good things, particularly the space accorded to NGOs."
"I think it most important to rely on the support of this network of partners, but we must be selective in our choices and, especially, avoid being exclusive."
"In committee, I have had occasion to make a stand against the fact that there may also be experts outside NGOs that have something to say."
"Need I point out in this House that the principle role, particularly in terms of education, belongs to governments."
"Finally, this Community policy, Article 13, does not lead to a situation where the solution lies necessarily in more money."
"I believe the solution lies in analysis of the use of the money, and not necessarily in making unlimited appropriations available."
"Finally, we in the PPE-DE Group place great hope in the policy of assessment and coordination, and one of our proposals is that the fight against discrimination should give rise to a specific report to be presented before Parliament, which will account for the money and the use of the Community money which has been invested."
"Finally, and this is my concluding remark, the definition of the causes which has been given and, indeed, adopted in the Charter which we shall have to adopt in November, is an acceptable one, making it possible to resolve a great many tensions within the European Union."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if tomorrow, the entire House adopts the viewpoints held by the competent committees with regard to the directive, I am convinced that the new directive on equal treatment in the workplace will be an excellent directive, which will have an enormous impact on the elderly, the disabled, homosexuals and lesbians in their battle against discrimination in the workplace."
"My group therefore lends its unqualified support to the report and we would particularly like to thank the co-rapporteurs, Mr Thomas Mann and Mrs Joke Swiebel for their sterling work and also congratulate them on the excellent cooperation within the respective committees."
"I would, in fact, like to seize the opportunity also to congratulate Mr Cashman, because although directives are important, action programmes are, of course, essential too in terms of the support they lend to directives."
"The speed with which the institutions have deployed the new Amsterdam powers, Commissioner, show that the European Union is still in the vanguard of equal opportunities, and I would like to extend my express thanks to the European Commission for this."
"Moreover, I hope that the French Presidency will be indulged and that this directive and the action programme will now be approved."
"I would like to air a few concerns regarding this directive which are of particular importance for my group."
"Parliament rightly chose to play the trump cards which we already have in the form of existing directives on equal treatment, those on gender and those on race and ethnic origin, and I am particularly pleased with the sound descriptions of indirect discrimination, positive action and the principle of shared burden of proof."
"We were also right to decide against including sex discrimination in this directive because there is already a separate European directive on sex discrimination, which will, in fact, be revised further to the Commission proposals and which is founded on a much stronger legal basis, about which Parliament, in fact, may decide in codecision."
"What is important, however, is that the European Parliament should advocate that double discrimination, which often victimises older women and disabled women, should be tackled here."
"Thirdly, my group applauds the decision to delete the non-exhaustive list of so-called justifications of differences of treatment on the grounds of age."
"This would only open the floodgates to so-called discriminations already warranted in advance."
"We are also delighted with the provision in the directive which stipulates that equal treatment for the disabled also means that companies are expected to make the necessary adjustments within the workplace."
"Finally, Commissioner, I would like to say how excellent this work is."
"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for the cooperation, but our task is not finished."
"Let us hope - and I am relying on you, Commissioner - that the European Commission will now come forward with proposals, pursuant to Article 13, to fight discrimination on grounds other than those to be found in the workplace."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, both rapporteurs have done an excellent job, for which I want to thank them here on behalf of my group."
"The fact that so many different forms of discrimination exist in our societies confirms the importance of the Action Programme that is the subject of Mr Cashman' s report."
"The Action Programme is a key instrument for supporting the Community in developing a common strategy to combat discrimination."
"We cannot accept seeing women and men still not having equal rights at the dawn of the 21st century, seeing the disabled socially marginalised, or people being excluded from society because of their sexual orientation and branded as different."
"The right of all human beings to equality before the law and protection against discrimination is a basic right."
"That basic right is fundamental to the ability of any democratic society to function."
"Legal provisions are an important component, but cannot be the only one, in the fight against discrimination."
"The Community must supplement them with political and practical programmes that can actually be implemented."
"So we must support grassroots initiatives, improve information about discrimination and underpin the political programmes."
"Only then can we effectively combat discrimination in all the fields of human life."
"That has to be in the interest of all of us!"
"In that spirit I call on my fellow delegates, especially those on the Conservative benches of this House, to endorse the two rapporteurs' reports at tomorrow' s vote."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I feel that this Action Plan is a major step forward in the fight against discrimination, partly because, in these so very complex times, in the highly complex societies we live in, discrimination takes many other forms which are ever more unexpected and give ever greater cause for concern"
"I would like to focus on one point of the Action Plan which, as I said in committee, I feel leaves large gaps: the inclusion of Turkey."
"It is not that Turkey should not be included in this Action Plan, but we are financing a State - which I may define as criminal - without any insistence at all that these funds should be used to eradicate the worst form of discrimination, namely discrimination against the Kurdish-speaking Turkish citizens."
"Therefore, we are providing funds for Turkey to use as it likes without any obligation to eliminate the worst form of discrimination, which is a combination of all forms of discrimination in that, if there is discrimination against Kurds in general now, discrimination against Kurdish women, people of Kurdish origin with deviant sexual tendencies and disabled people of Kurdish origin will soon follow."
"There you are. We would have liked to compel or, at any rate, prompt Turkey to eradicate the genuinely widespread discrimination currently practised in that State."
"We are therefore extremely confused regarding this point, and we call upon the Commission to ensure, when monitoring the ways that the funding is used, that Turkey is not merely pretending to wipe out or combat more minor forms of discrimination without making any effort at all to fight that basic discrimination which, when all is said and done, is at the root of a great many of Europe's misfortunes."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Bonino List, I would like to express our great consternation at the Member States' approach to the issues of discrimination, racism and xenophobia."
"During the last part-session, Parliament adopted a resolution on the fight against discriminatory, violent and repressive racism."
"This resolution stated that racism is a crime which can be committed not only through actions but also through statements or the publication of messages, and called for more legal instruments to prosecute political parties whose programmes jeopardise the principles of non-discrimination."
"We are convinced - for our history, your history, the history of Europe makes it plain - that your strategy of prohibition and repression which is based on restricting freedom of expression and association, on strengthening repressive tools such as the police, social monitoring and telecommunications, on allocating funds and on creating monitoring centres, will create the perfect conditions for a fresh explosion of the phenomena that you wish, or say you wish to combat."
"I would like to remind you that the first action of the members of the Bonino List this parliamentary term was to promote a proposal for a resolution on the fight against discrimination based on sex."
"We applied for funding through Action Plans, which usually amounts to aid to NGOs, which are often reduced to little more than state-controlled bodies."
"We did not call for illiberal or illegal reversals of the burden of proof."
"We have proposed a number of amendments to the Mann report, amendments which make some of the points referred to more democratic and more liberal and ensure that they advocate civil liberties. The amendments remove the reversal of the burden of proof, the involvement of employers' associations in dialogue between the two sides of industry and limit sanctions to civil and administrative penalties, not criminal penalties."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would remind you that whenever prohibition has been applied in Europe it has been necessary to take a step backwards."
"It happened in Germany when you wanted to oppress the pro-nazi parties, it happened with Austria recently, and you were forced to step back, and it happened with the Technical Group of Independent Members."
"After all, as the great democracies of the English-speaking world teach us, racism and discrimination must be fought with liberal democracy, not by restrictions and the gradual erosion of freedom of opinion, freedom of expression, freedom of association and economic freedom."
"Mr President, this afternoon, we are discussing two of the three Commission proposals in which anti-discrimination legislation on the basis of Article 13 of the EC Treaty is proposed."
"As it happens, my group has never been in favour of including Article 13 in the Treaty, not because we condone discrimination but because we believed it was undesirable to raise this topic to European level."
"A great deal has already been regulated in this field, both internationally and nationally."
"The European Commission is rather reticent in its proposals, but from the amendments tabled by the European Parliament, it does appear that there is a desire to go a lot further: there is call for an overarching European anti-discrimination policy, whereby the policy of national States is monitored by the Commission."
"The idea does not appeal to me at all."
"Why would a centralised Europe do better than a national government, which is much closer to its citizens and enjoys a far greater degree of democracy and supporting power?"
"A sensitive issue is the clash with other constitutional rights, such as freedom of religion and belief, and the right to respect for privacy."
"I have a feeling that these rights are being infringed upon by Article 4 of the Commission proposal and the amendment tabled in this respect by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"Religion and belief are not separate entities."
"Faith is, by definition, professed within a community and, by extension, will find expression in people' s attitude to life."
"This is why organisations, schools and nursing homes which express a particular identity have been established by and for people who share the same belief."
"Managerial and executive staff will give corporate shape to this belief."
"Could the Commissioner explain why the Commission is not taking this on board?"
"The amendment tabled by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has not done a great deal to clarify matters."
"It appears to be putting more distance between beliefs and practical attitude to life and, as a result, institutions are even further restricted in living out and maintaining their own identities."
"Absolute freedom of religion is impossible, as is absolute equality."
"Discrimination in the sense of treating people as inferior, taunting them and putting them at a disadvantage is an evil that must be eradicated."
"But we must be careful that, in striving to protect the weaker members of society, legislators do not oppress other groups that hold certain minority beliefs."
"This would breach major guarantees in the Treaties and constitutions."
"Mr President, I will confine my remarks to religious belief and homosexuality."
"The President of Italy addressed this House today and I was interested when he said that it was not the aim of this Union to negate national values."
"Some of the matters before us today are destructive to national values."
"We have a proposal that elevates homosexuality to the same position as holy marriage."
"To achieve that, vast numbers of religious people who believe the holy scriptures are to be discriminated against in a most sinister and dictatorial manner."
"What about those people whose religious beliefs are based on the holy scriptures, their churches, schools, organisations and hospices?"
"You might not like it that they believe the scriptures, you might not like what the scriptures say, but they have a right to hold those views."
"The Bible makes it perfectly clear that those who abuse themselves with mankind cannot enter the Kingdom of God."
"Some in this room would say that is bigotry."
"But that is what these people believe because they are tied and anchored to the holy scriptures."
"They also believe what the Apostle Paul said, that acts between men and men are unseemly and are the result of lust not of love."
"How can these religious people be forced to employ those who, by profession and practice, advocate such anti-scriptural behaviour?"
"Are there going to be safeguards written into this legislation for those that believe that sex should only be between male and female within the marriage bond?"
"These proposals strike a blow at the sanctity of marriage and the sanctity of the home and they should be rejected."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are all glad that there is an Article 13 in the Treaty of Amsterdam because it finally puts an instrument in our hands and gives us the task of creating a comprehensive programme to combat discrimination."
"The Commission has submitted an Action Plan until the year 2006."
"It is very ambitious, highly committed and very concrete in terms of its objective, actions and individual measures."
"It is a programme that deserves full support and I am convinced we will be successful if we pursue that programme."
"I do, however, have problems with Mr Cashman' s report, which is peppered with 17 proposed amendments. I want to raise several points in it that worry me."
"First there is the proposed wider-ranging definition relating to the implementation of the programme, which goes beyond the comprehensive definition."
"I think that would create greater uncertainty because we would no longer know who could actually be assisted in line with the Commission programme."
"That produces the risk that the insufficient resources will then have to be spread too thinly over too many actions."
"I fear for the effectiveness of this programme."
"My second point is the problem that NGOs, important as they may be, are being asked to be involved in implementing the programme regardless of their size, nature and activities."
"Over and above this, they are also being asked to be responsible for monitoring; and if the NGOs are core funded up to 90% by the Union, the problem is compounded if the NGOs monitor themselves."
"I do not think we should ask too much of anybody."
"What we ought to do at all events is to give full support to the Commission' s highly committed programme."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this week is an important week as far as the debates in this House are concerned."
"Yesterday, we discussed the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and today, in discussing Community initiatives, we are debating the matter of combating discrimination."
"We are thereby boosting the positions of the European Union regarding the practical situations experienced by European nationals in connection with discrimination and equal treatment."
"I should like, straight away, to emphasise the importance of these two texts: on the one hand, the directive, acting as it does on the state of the law and, on the other hand, the action programme, because it makes it possible to implement effectively new practices intended for adoption on a widespread basis."
"In this regard, I cannot accept the muddle that some parties are making of the necessary anti-discrimination measures, equal treatment and the mention of other cases of prohibition."
"I do not think we can mix things up in this way."
"The proposal for a directive discussed in the Mann report is a key one, and I should like to discuss it briefly."
"It seeks to boost the principle of equal treatment at the same time as reducing the number of opportunities for exemptions, which we think excessive."
"Let me return to the subject of the exemption for religion."
"I should like to express our reservations on this difficult issue and restate our commitment to the principle of secularism, especially in the context of the fight against discrimination."
"This seems fundamental to us, particularly after incorporating the questions of activities in the social or health fields."
"The desire for action is a matter of jurisdiction, not religious belief."
"One last word on the discussion which may ensue on the need to maintain statistics on the subject."
"They are essential."
"Let us beware, nonetheless, lest these statistics be used against the men and women they concern."
"Mr President, Commissioner, our group has evaluated both reports with positive results and would, in particular, like to emphasise the fact that we have all focused on the need to expand the programme's scope with a series of amendments - which, in actual fact, have led to another survey on discrimination - intended to guarantee equal treatment to all people, irrespective of their sex, race, ethnic origin, religion, personal convictions, age or sexual orientation."
"The Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party has assessed all this with positive results, particularly focusing on the activity of Parliament, which insisted, in addition and above all, on preventive action as well as good practice."
"We felt that the objectives relating to enhancing in-depth understanding of the issue and its new forms, scale and development and, most importantly, action supporting those who have to implement these good practices, were entirely convincing."
"Yet we were even more impressed by fact that, at the end of the report, provision was made for an evaluation of the outcome of the processes and programmes, for this is also a guarantee of fairness, impartiality and transparency."
"I would especially like to focus on the opportunities provided for the Member States, who have to concentrate on high-quality actions, to work autonomously."
"This means that, for the first time, a different line is being adopted: we are not doling out funding left, right and centre but evaluating the quality of the operations and insisting on high quality; the operations themselves must then be monitored and their results published."
"I feel that this is a highly positive and constructive process, considering, also, that the results can be made available to the public and used to improve the quality of subsequent actions."
"I too would like to touch on the issue of exception made for religious organisations."
"I am pleased that it has been raised in this House."
"In effect, I feel that this is a mistake and that the exemption warrants discussion and reflection."
"I would just like to highlight a point once and for all."
"In my country, Italy, a teacher colleague of mine who was Catholic by religion but taught in a State school was dismissed because she became pregnant, she did not have an abortion and she was not married."
"Given that such a thing is possible, I would ask you whether it would have happened if the religious authorities were not endowed with this discretionary power?"
"I would add that, paradoxically, if this teacher had had an abortion, no-one would have realised anything and she would not have lost her job."
"Instead, having shown respect for the sanctity of life and her right to motherhood, she was dismissed, a victim of discrimination. This, in my opinion, is disgraceful."
"If she had been a man, I may add, she would not have had to worry about what she did in her private life since a way has not yet been found to make men pregnant!"
"Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteurs and those working on the equivalent opinions on their commitment to this work and their willingness to cooperate with all of us in this House who wish to see progress in combating discrimination."
"There is no doubt that it is a complex, sensitive and controversial area and it combines at least three of those elements I was always taught you were not supposed to discuss in polite society: politics, sex and religion, along with the equally important issues of age and disability."
"The importance people attach to this has been reflected in the fact that I have received more lobbying on this directive than on any other so far in this session and from a wider range of people."
"The aim of this work, based on Article 13, is to make equality of opportunity a reality by removing that smiling face that so often cloaks prejudice and bigotry, predominantly in the workplace."
"That is a challenge to all of us because we all judge people on initial impressions."
"Employers will now have to be clear and transparent in all aspects of their employment policy and practice and able to justify the choices they make on the basis of the real job requirements."
"They will also be expected to respond to the needs of the potential workforce, particularly in the area of disability."
"My group welcomes both the framework directive and the proposed Community action programme and sees them as an important step towards tackling prejudice in other aspects of people's lives."
"For that reason we shall be supporting Amendment No 18 to the Mann report which calls for Member States to repeal all penal code provisions discriminating against homosexuals."
"We know that that is not within the scope of the directive but we think it is an important marker because if, quite rightly, discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation is not to be permitted in the field of employment, then we should not be supporting the potential criminalisation of employees for what they do in privacy and in a consenting relationship."
"Concerns have been raised with me about the potential interpretation of the explanatory notes to Article 1, which again may seem a bit obscure, but these distinguish between sexual orientation and behaviour."
"I would ask the Commission to clarify this point."
"Does it mean that you can still suffer discrimination in the workplace if you engage in homosexual activities in your private life?"
"Or, does it mean, as I would hope, that we should learn the lessons from the Clinton experience and all behave appropriately in the workplace, whatever our sexual orientation."
"In dealing with religion, my group welcomes Amendment No 37 to the Mann report."
"It is important that, while we recognise the desire of organisations based on a particular religion or belief to employ people who share their views, it is also right that this desire should not become a reason to deny employment to people who are perfectly qualified to carry out a job which is not directly connected to that belief and who conduct themselves appropriately while at work."
"There are very few jobs where having a particular belief system is an essential qualification."
"Being the British Monarchy is one of them."
"Driving a school bus for a religious foundation is not."
"I found it particularly offensive to be asked that I should support changes which would make it possible for any religious body to deny any employment to homosexuals."
"I would urge any group campaigning for the right to discriminate against another group to consider how such freedom might also work against them and to consider if they think that would be just."
"Age discrimination is also rife and no voluntary code can really combat gratuitous discrimination."
"Article 5, as it currently stands, has been criticised for seeming to justify what it aims to combat."
"That is why we shall be supporting Amendment No 38 which limits itself to essentials on the basis of a strictly defined legitimate aim."
"This would hopefully exclude the boss's desire to be surrounded by attractive young people to enhance the company image or their own."
"Mr President, combating discrimination and passing legislation against it means acknowledging that is exists and that many forms of it are in a sense 'decriminalised' because they are so commonplace."
"I therefore, obviously, welcome today' s directive, whose application must also become the norm."
"I shall therefore confine my remarks to the limitations which, I feel, still remain in spite of everything."
"Firstly, the burden of proof."
"The directive takes a step forward in shifting the burden of proof but does not go as far as to reverse the situation."
"Yet, should the law not provide the victims of discrimination with better means to escape the isolation they too often find themselves in?"
"How is it possible to think that a job applicant, rejected in such circumstances, has the same resources as a firm, especially a large undertaking, to defend himself and prove that he has indeed been a victim of discrimination?"
"Moreover, if it were compulsory for firms to prove that their practices were non-discriminatory, they would doubtless think twice on the matter when recruiting."
"I am thinking particularly here of the discrimination affecting third-country nationals, but also the second-generation children from immigrant families."
"There are many examples of this in France."
"Given an identical curriculum vitae, identical education and identical career, a young person with a French sounding name has four to five times the chance of being recruited than a young person with a North African sounding name, and twice that of a young person with a Portuguese or Spanish sounding name."
"This is the hierarchy of discrimination."
"In a Europe that is supposed to be multicultural where diversity is respected, we must ensure that our deeds live up to our words."
"Let me end on the subject of the exemption granted to religious bodies. I would like to say that I consider the exemption of Article 4(2) to be very dangerous and perhaps even a legal cover for the most reactionary ideas."
"I feel that this may provide a major foothold for those most reactionary ideas. Mr Paisley' s objectionable intervention earlier with regard to homosexuals bears witness to this."
"Mr President, my Group and I identify as victims of discrimination, on the grounds of our beliefs, in this very House, since we are prevented from forming a political group as everyone else is authorised to do, and we therefore wholeheartedly applaud the opportunity to set up a programme to combat any form of discrimination."
"Not just discrimination against men and women at work."
"In France, for example, men are not allowed to teach in primary education. That is a case of blatant discrimination."
"The question is, however, far more significant in philosophical, legal and sociological terms."
"Legally speaking, there are general texts condemning discrimination everywhere."
"Yesterday, for example, the Charter of Fundamental Rights condemned discrimination, not just racial discrimination but even, according to the Charter, discrimination on the basis of birth."
"In affirming the principle of equality, all the constitutions of the world virtually establish a principle of constitutional jus cogens, since discrimination is prohibited everywhere."
"On the other hand, however, for forty years there have been texts in existence which are actually based on discrimination."
"In Geneva in 1963, the first of these, UNCTAD, United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, established the principle of compensatory inequalities or, in other words, discrimination."
"Our own Lomé Convention itself is based on discrimination in favour of the Caribbean and Pacific States."
"Our entire dispute with the United States, moreover, has arisen because we wanted positive discrimination in favour of our own ACP banana producers whereas the United States wanted an egalitarian system which would serve the interests of multinationals."
"Europe itself, with the GSP, the System of Generalised Preferences, which leads us unilaterally to give up our customs duties to the benefit of a whole series of States, is based on discrimination."
"And the national laws in our 15 countries also practice discrimination, including the Socialist France of the Socialist Mr Jospin."
"In 1999, with regard to New Caledonia, a preference was established with regard to employment on the basis of ethnicity, on the basis of race."
"So New Caledonia operates a preference based on skin colour."
"In the urban suburbs of French cities, there are tax free zones, based on ethnicity once again, for these areas are dominated by specific ethnic populations."
"And that is without mentioning the United States where, thirty years ago, the Supreme Court invented the principle of 'affirmative action' ."
"On a sociological basis, moreover, there is discrimination according to birth."
"In this House, Mrs Ana de Palacio Vallelersundi has a sister who is a Commissioner in the European Commission."
"If she were not born Ana de Palacio Vallelersundi, do you think the two sisters would now be in these two places?"
"Not everyone in the Olympic Games gets through to the final. There is no right entitling a person to go to the Olympic Games."
"So, in sociological terms, there is the risk of abuse."
"The principle of non-discrimination is a fine one, Mr President, but it also has a flip side."
"I must therefore warn you, the situation is not as simple as you may imagine. This principle of ...."
"(The President cut the speaker off.)"
"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteurs, Mr Cashman, Mrs Lynne and Mr Thomas Mann, and congratulate them on their work on the reports on the anti-discrimination programme and equal treatment in employment and working conditions."
"As shadow rapporteur for the European People's Party in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I welcomed the Council's decision to establish a Community Action Plan to fight discrimination."
"I feel that the great step taken towards consolidating the new powers conferred by Article 13 of the Treaty establishing the European Community in order to fight this very phenomenon of discrimination is satisfactory."
"In general terms, I agree with the emphasis placed on the development and growth of cultural tools to fight discrimination: in my opinion, we must combat discrimination with a culture of non-discrimination, making up-to-the-minute, accessible information available to all the citizens of all the Member States."
"In fact, information and awareness campaigns are vital in this area: they must act as hammers to forge new mentalities and bring about a new way of thinking and behaving, in order to drive out those prejudices which are still widespread and to ensure equal rights for all citizens."
"However, I consider that the overall funds allocated to this programme are inadequate and I call, in particular, upon the Commissioner to secure an increase in funding."
"The amount should be at least equal to the sums made available for the preparations for this programme, to make it possible to implement it fully and effectively."
"I would remind you of the additional cost of implementing the programme in respect of the more vulnerable categories such as the elderly, people with varying abilities and the older unemployed."
"These categories represent 25% of the Union's population."
"This is a potential which must not be underestimated and the integration of these categories could prove beneficial to the economy as well."
"Mr President, the proposal for a Council directive establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation extends the ban on discrimination beyond reasons of race or ethnic origin to other reasons which are used as a motivation for discrimination and which are mentioned in Article 13."
"The directive under consideration covers the gamut of salaried employment and independent occupations and professions."
"The report by Mr Mann was adopted almost unanimously by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. This was due both to his consummate preparation and his willingness to cooperate on the necessary amendments."
"The first positive aspect of the directive is the comprehensive way in which it tackles discrimination, which is especially important for the proper implementation of the directive."
"The directive has a second advantage in that it revalorises the experiences gained from the ban on discrimination on grounds of sex and uses the same tools and concepts, for example direct and indirect discrimination, effective legal protection and shifting the burden of proof."
"What is more, it revalorises the tradition of urging positive action aimed at compensating for disadvantages in order to integrate specific persons into the labour market."
"These aspects of the directive, together with the fact that, a short time ago, Directive 2000 was adopted, are proof of the avowed will of the European Union to guarantee an open society, free from predetermined categorisations and, most importantly, from the stigma of racism, which has its roots deep in European history."
"It is not by chance that the Action Programme gives priority to understanding the phenomenon of arbitrary discrimination, thereby seeking to tackle the issue at its very core, which is covert racism."
"This arises partly from fear and partly from a well-established tradition, which, it must be said, is one of the negative aspects of European civilisation and one of the main causes of unrest, both civil and between nations."
"That is why this directive must be incorporated into our cultural development."
"Mr President, when I listen to the cries of rage from Mr Martinez of the Front national, I feel that we have a real need to use the type of directive which has been proposed."
"These texts mark a step forward."
"They are going to give the anti-racist associations and the trade unions greater control regarding instances of discrimination, but I feel that now it is going to be necessary to make application of these directives, and compliance with labour law, mandatory by stepping up the number of inspections and by penalising offending employers."
"This means harmonising the acquired rights in a positive way in order to protect the weakest and most oppressed on the labour market and not, for example, in the name of equality, authorising night work for women."
"It is going to be necessary to prohibit, at last, the repression of the union movement, in the form it is tending to develop in Europe, in the French postal service for example."
"Finally, I feel that, as employers, States should provide an example by doing away with discrimination against the recruitment of non-Community employees in the public service, as this type of discrimination condemns the immigrants they do employ to endless job instability."
"Genuine socio-economic integration, however, presupposes the equality of rights which cannot exist without better political representation, and for that we should have to regularise the situation of illegal immigrants and grant all immigrants the right to vote."
"Mr President, the proposal for a directive we are debating today on equal treatment in employment and occupation clearly expresses the will and the endeavour of the European Union to adapt its social model to new economic, social and cultural realities, and that is why we welcome it with particular satisfaction."
"Implementing the directive is certain to improve the quality of life in European society."
"It will also contribute to enhancing the image of Europe in the eyes of the rest of the world, which is watching us especially closely, by actively demonstrating that Europe is continuing to work hard to protect human rights and to promote solidarity and democracy."
"But whether these aims will succeed or not depends on the contents of the directive being understood, on Member States acknowledging its importance and value, and on its correct and unequivocal implementation."
"That is why I believe that support will be given to the amendments that are concerned with monitoring its implementation. The amendments relating to informing citizens inside and outside the workplace, informing and educating social partners and economic and social operators, and training those who work in the public sector and the legal and legislative bodies of the Member States will also be supported."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate Commissioner Diamantopoulou on this important proposal for a decision and also Mr Cashman and Mr Mann, who have enriched and broadened the scope of action for combating discrimination."
"Today, we voted with a large majority for the reports on enlarging the Union to include the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, Cyprus and Malta. I would therefore like to take this opportunity to emphasise just how important it is that we support the attempts made by these countries to combat discrimination and to accept the multi-cultural nature of modern societies as a necessary condition for peaceful coexistence between peoples."
"The applicant countries must be given every assistance in meeting the Copenhagen criteria and in integrating as full and equal members into the European Union."
"Special attention must be paid to the countries of the Balkans and to Turkey. More resources must be made available to them in order to bolster their attempts to strengthen their democratic institutions and to eliminate discrimination, especially discrimination that is rooted in race or ethnic origin, or religious conviction, which has caused so much pain and bloodshed recently and taken so many human lives in the Balkans."
"I just wonder how much in fact we have learned and how wiser we have become as a result of the events in the Balkans, which were primarily caused by religious fanaticism."
"That is why I believe we urgently need to give the Balkan countries adequate resources and to promote measures to prevent and combat discrimination at its source. This can be done through the education system, the mass media and also by giving much more power to NGOs."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as is well known, many forms of discrimination still remain in the European Union, specifically in employment and professional activities, even though they are prohibited under Article 13 of the EU Treaty."
"It is therefore important to press forward with the two legislative initiatives that are now being debated, while improving them in certain respects and increasing the funds set aside for financing the programme, thus reflecting the political importance of this fight against discrimination."
"It is not enough for equality to be guaranteed in law."
"As we all know, the causes of discrimination must be rooted out right from the start - and the work of prevention is just as vital - through information, education and training in the promotion of equality and the fight against prejudice, changing attitudes through the various forms of positive action, particularly favouring groups that are discriminated against, or by appealing to the relevant authorities whenever employers persist in discrimination."
"With regard to the burden of proof, it is important that it should be up to the employer to prove that there has been no violation of the principle of equality, whereas the worker should only have to present the case of discrimination of which he or she has been the victim."
"Mr President, Commissioner, part of the debate proves that we, in fact, need a directive, because if people claim here that Europe is meddling in a centralist manner in an area which should fall under the remit of the Member States, knowing what has happened in many countries of Europe - even yesterday on television, there was again a whole raft of reports of attacks on Jewish synagogues, a report on the rape of a woman of foreign origin etc - they must have some nerve claiming that Europe does not need a directive on anti-discrimination."
"Groups which are in the firing line are those groups which peopled the concentration camps during the Second World War, namely people of certain religious beliefs, for example Jehovah' s witnesses."
"I am thinking of people of a particular race: Jews, gypsies, etc;"
"I am also thinking of the disabled, people who could no longer keep up, the elderly; all these people were at risk of being put in a concentration camp."
"This is also true for homosexuals."
"So those who claim here that Europe does not need to lay down in a directive the values which we all aim to defend are mistaken."
"We do need this to happen and we must give out this signal to the outside world."
"Belgium is holding local elections on Sunday."
"We have agreed with all democratic parties that we will be forming a cordon sanitaire against the extreme right."
"This means that none of these parties will form a coalition with the extreme right."
"This is an extremely important decision and we feel supported by directives such as these, which is of great importance."
"Commissioner, I should like you to carry on undeterred, as we desperately need this decision."
"Mr President, there is no hierarchy of discrimination."
"I welcome this directive as the first-ever EU law introducing Europe-wide rights for our 37 million disabled citizens, an end to the back-door route to legislate for disability rights and a tribute to the disability movement which has campaigned for this day."
"In particular the agreement of the principle of reasonable accommodation, pioneered in Sweden and Ireland, will now ensure that employers across Europe adapt their workplaces, acquire specialist equipment and amend their working practices so that disabled employees really do get a fair chance."
"It might simply mean lowering a light switch by a metre but, for the wheelchair user it makes the difference between a job or no job."
"I thank Mr Mann for his support on this point."
"I also thank my colleague, Mr Cashman, for accepting my amendments on the action programme which will guarantee European money to cover the extra cost of disability, to promise information accessible to all, and to ensure that disabled people can speak for themselves."
"Two more messages."
"Firstly, to all MEPs, remember that we achieved a strong directive combating race discrimination, for which I was proud to act as co-rapporteur, with action against incitement, for the right to go to court, to empower NGOs, to shift the burden of proof."
"Do not meddle with these hard-won gains."
"Secondly, to the Commissioner, I know you will not today be able to accept my Amendment No 56 on procurement, but in your reply I ask you to promise this House that you will bring forward new legislation to link the power of the public purse to companies' compliance with these laws."
"Please also tell us that it was a mistake for the Commission to propose core funding for only one European NGO representing each discriminated group."
"This legislation is about valuing diversity."
"Do not ignore your own words by denying deaf people, people with learning difficulties, and self-managed organisations of disabled people the possibility even to sit at the table."
"Mr President, if one thing singles out European society from the other societies of the world, it is precisely its sensitivity and commitment to the fight for freedom and human rights."
"However, I would like to say that this fight is not the exclusive property of the left."
"Sometimes, with cheap demagoguery and a progressivism which it cannot even define, the left tries to confuse the public with hypotheses which sometimes lack any content and are sometimes inadequate for the task of structuring society in accordance with certain values which our Group will always champion."
"That is what differentiates some benches from others."
"Article 13 is the starting point for a new EU objective: to combat discrimination or inequality in the treatment of citizens for the reasons listed therein."
"The action programme seems to me to be a serious programme."
"It is almost acceptable in its original form because, essentially, it is directed at something fundamental, that is, educating European society in the value of the human being, of whatever type."
"I believe that this is the central nucleus of the programme."
"I therefore consider that it is necessary to commit the public and private sectors to this task and, to this end, I believe that the public sector must provide an example."
"Public administrations and schools must be a model in the fight against discrimination and the same must be required, naturally to an equal extent, of the private sector."
"Finally, ladies and gentlemen, the media must also play an important role in this task."
"Unfortunately today, certain sections of the media, such as television and the Internet, do not contribute through their programmes and advertisements to the dignified and respectful treatment of the sectors of society who most need that cooperation, such as, for example, women and children."
"The objective of also increasing the awareness of the media with regard to this task therefore seems to me to be a very good one."
"Mr President, I should like first of all to say thank you to Mr Cashman and Mr Mann for the two reports."
"It is incredibly important that we should now secure implementation of the package which is the first and interim realisation of Article 13 of the EC Treaty."
"In that way, we should be taking an important step towards removing discrimination against minorities in the EU and the applicant countries."
"I should therefore like to emphasise two important points."
"First of all, I believe that, if the initiatives for combating discrimination that we are now putting in place are to succeed in practice and on a day-to-day basis, it is crucial that the NGOs which represent the minorities affected should be involved as much as possible in the work."
"Otherwise, the initiatives will not succeed in the real world."
"The second thing I want to point out is that, with this first package, the Commission has unfortunately committed a serious error by itself putting reasons for discrimination in order of priority."
"Only racial discrimination is to be prohibited in all areas of society in general. Discrimination for other reasons, for example because of handicap or sexual orientation, is only prohibited when it comes to employment and occupation."
"Grounds for discrimination should have equal status."
"Discrimination is equally offensive, whether it occurs on the basis of race or sexual orientation. I therefore wish strongly to support Mrs Swiebel' s proposal to the effect that the Commission be obliged to correct this error within the next three years."
"I can see that the Commissioner is here today."
"Today is therefore a good opportunity to confirm that this proposal will be followed up."
"Mr President, I should like to underline what my colleague Mr Hernández Mollar has just said."
"This fight against discrimination is a fight that mobilises us all and it cannot be an exclusive banner for any political group in this Parliament."
"Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam threw up a challenge for the European Union agenda, which gave the Community specific powers to initiate a variety of actions to combat discrimination, so as to ensure the same level of protection for all disadvantaged groups."
"I should like to congratulate the Commission on the important step it has taken in initiating this process of implementing Article 13 through the package of proposals that it has presented to combat discrimination."
"Experience has also shown us that the promotion of anti-discrimination legislation is essential but it is not enough."
"Such measures must be accompanied by preventive work and efforts to change behaviour and attitudes. Clear proof of this comes from the results of a fairly recent Eurobarometer survey, which showed that one in three Europeans, roughly 33%, regarded themselves as very or fairly racist."
"It is crucial that we teach and promote respect for multicultural diversity in Europe."
"I should also like to stress the importance of involving the countries applying for membership as much as we can in these Community actions to combat discrimination."
"Mr President, I welcome this Commission initiative, but I would like in particular to congratulate Mr Cashman and Mr Mann on their excellent work in producing these reports."
"Given the large number of discriminatory actions, decisions and attitudes which still appear today in Europe, I am pleased with these reports which we are debating today and which contain certain points which I feel to be particularly noteworthy."
"Firstly, we must insist on the need to bear in mind, when implementing the concrete actions of this programme, Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which is the pivotal instrument in the fight against discrimination in the European Union."
"Secondly, we must highlight the particular discrimination suffered by certain social groups, women, the disabled, immigrants, homosexual men and women, the elderly and ethnic minorities and, within these groups, we must insist on the importance of monitoring and implementing concrete measures in the fight against cases of multiple or double discrimination, which occur especially in the case of women."
"We therefore have to stress the need to integrate the gender element into all areas of the fight against discrimination and, in parallel, I wish to ask the Commission to make a clear and decisive effort to achieve coherence between the directives, recommendations and programmes against discrimination, giving this House a leading role in the establishment of priorities, the carrying out of an assessment of the effectiveness of the actions proposed today in this programme and the revision, if necessary, of the actions and decisions taken within this action programme."
"Lastly, the European Parliament must be kept informed, taking account of the reports and opinions produced by this House, and we must highlight the importance and necessity of truly making use of the opinion and participation of the NGOs and associations - and providing them with the necessary resources - since they are without doubt the key to the success of the measures adopted."
"Mr President, discrimination on religious grounds is as unacceptable as any other form of discrimination."
"We have seen the tragic results in Northern Ireland and in the Balkans."
"It simmers away under the surface in several parts of our European Union."
"Nevertheless the spiritual dimension is a vital dimension of our European way of life."
"It is a clear fact of our European history that we have a large number of religions and each of those religions has various and diverse churches, denominations and trends."
"It is important that they should be able to uphold their beliefs."
"I welcome the rather obvious fact that priests and ministers can be restricted to the relevant faith without promoting accusations of illegal discrimination."
"But that is not enough."
"We must support Amendment No 37 by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, which also exempts any restrictions on the religion or faith of persons who come directly into contact with members of that faith in education, social welfare or health care, for example, teachers in denominational schools, doctors and nurses in hospitals and hospices, visitors to inmates in prison, counsellors and carers for children, old people, teenagers and married couples, where these socially desirable services are provided by religious bodies."
"A spiritual dimension is vital to Europe."
"We must avoid absurd tangles of red tape, which will only succeed in reducing Europe to a purely materialistic, politically correct but pointless entity."
"Ladies and gentlemen, at the time of the discussions regarding the Treaty of Amsterdam, we were delighted, myself in particular, at the inclusion of Article 13 on discrimination on the basis of sex, race or ethnic origin, religion or philosophical convictions - non sectarian, I might add - handicap in any form, age or sexual orientation."
"This was, moreover, the basis for proposed measures to combat discrimination."
"These proposals involve two draft directives and one action programme intended to support the efforts of the Member States."
"It is extremely difficult, of course, both for me and for my fellow Members, to give a precise opinion on measures of such great significance in just two minutes."
"As regards the Mann report on equal treatment in employment, and let me congratulate the rapporteur, I shall confine myself to pointing out that I am, personally, satisfied that it has been possible to reduce the number of permissible exemptions to a minimum."
"Some possibilities have been retained, however, which I must admit I find somewhat shocking."
"One such is the possibility of derogation on terms of religion."
"The provision according to which the notion of professional, essential and crucial requirement may justify exemptions on the grounds of religion is not, in my view, acceptable."
"As a confirmed secularist, I could not possibly endorse it."
"In the same vein, the exemptions authorised on the basis of age must be treated with the utmost vigilance since, in practical terms, that often leads to the exclusion of the oldest employees."
"On the subject, now, of the programme to combat discrimination, the Commission' s proposals are satisfactory."
"Some aspects needed clarifying, and now they have been."
"I congratulate the rapporteur on this and, in conclusion, I shall vote in favour of these reports, with the exception of the point I raised just now."
"Mr President, the right to equal treatment and protection against discrimination is one of the fundamental human rights."
"It lies at the very heart of everything we believe in in the European Union."
"I subscribe to the objective of the present proposal of extending this right to include the professional environment."
"I am aware that there are also arguments in favour of guaranteeing European legislation for equal treatment within one market."
"But beyond that, I am beginning to find myself at odds with the rest of the opinions in this House."
"In my view, Parliament has overdone it when it comes to the rather restrained legislation which the European Commission would have wanted to submit."
"Surely this proposal has been drafted with the intention of applying it within an economic sphere of business and trade?"
"It is simply not practical if you run a small business, and someone discovers after twelve months that he was discriminated against in a selection procedure which involved forty candidates, to keep each and every file from that period and then investigate exactly what happened during that selection procedure once more. They might not even remember the candidate involved."
"Surely this is not acceptable."
"Why do we in Parliament never think about the practical implications of the legislation we draft?"
"I hope something can as yet be salvaged in the process with the Council and Commission which is to follow."
"I would now like to make a request to the Commissioner."
"Commissioner, the inquiry has been followed up by a fiche d'impact."
"In my view, this fiche d'impact - and I am involved a great deal with small and medium-sized businesses in this Parliament - is one big scandal."
"It amounts to one official having spent one afternoon behind a desk dreaming up all kinds of positive effects which in no way tally with reality."
"I call for a real fiche d'impact: an actual enquiry into the consequences for small and medium-sized businesses of this directive as it has been laid down by this Parliament, and not a would-be story made up by some official who has never set foot in a business, and I would welcome this before this directive becomes legislation."
"Mr President, the draft Council decision establishing a Community action programme to combat discrimination initiates the process of implementing Article 13."
"This is a task of major importance, the positive effects of which will be felt directly or indirectly, sooner or later, in the life of the Member States in the form of concrete programmes and measures or even amendments to legislation. These have been demanded by changes in our societies, and governments have often not been able to respond to them satisfactorily."
"The civilisation we share asserts its greatness through respect for the rules of an open, tolerant and liberal society, with its inclusive and multicultural dynamics."
"Yet even today the generous idea of granting each citizen the greatest possible freedom, provided it is compatible with the same measure of freedom for others, still comes up against obstacles - some de facto, others de jure."
"In the face of dogmatism, prejudice and ignorance, which even today condemn so many of our fellow citizens to sub-citizen status, Europe draws on its best qualities: our tradition of enlightenment and emancipation for individuals and groups."
"The family, for instance, remains a foundation and a pillar of our society."
"But how many of the Member States of the Union still embrace in their legislation static and dogmatic concepts of the family, discriminating against unmarried partnerships and, in a particularly shocking and anachronistic manner, against those partnerships composed of homosexual couples?"
"The family should be seen today, ultimately, as a community based on affection rather than the civil effect of a contract blessed by religion."
"The fight against discrimination that we are discussing today means above all the affirmation of inclusive citizenship, more demanding than the exclusive citizenship of the past, historically linked to the origins of democracy and the republic."
"Mr President, Commissioner, what we are now in the process of doing is translating Article 13 of the Treaty into practical politics."
"We did this first with the proposal concerning discrimination on the grounds of race and ethnic origin, and now we are moving on to the action plan and discrimination in the workplace."
"I want to begin by thanking both rapporteurs, Mr Mann and Mr Cashman, for their quite excellent reports."
"I want to pause and consider a special group, namely the disabled."
"I have taken an interest in this issue since I was a member of the Swedish Parliament and we carried out a major investigation which resulted in a proposal to combat discrimination in the workplace."
"We then looked at unemployment, which at that period was generally very low in Sweden, and compared it with unemployment specifically among the disabled."
"At that time, we had an overall unemployment figure of 2 per cent among the population as a whole."
"Among the most severely disabled, unemployment stood at 70 per cent."
"It is still the case that the most severely disabled barely figure in the labour market."
"They are discriminated against at the present time."
"This type of legislation is therefore needed, and often it is only minor measures that are required."
"We often talk about the internal market and young people' s opportunities to study and work throughout Europe."
"But what is the situation for young people who are disabled?"
"What opportunity do they have to work in the internal market, to study in different countries and to pursue their personal development?"
"We are at present discriminating in this area."
"It is therefore important that we tackle this discrimination."
"This should be done in relation to a number of areas."
"The disabled are also discriminated against when it comes to gaining access to restaurants and cultural institutions."
"The matter must therefore be followed up."
"One final point."
"The disabled are incredibly important when it comes to organisations."
"Because organisations are important in this process, I hope that the amendment which I tabled, to the effect that more than one organisation should have a share of the grants, and which was adopted by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs will also be that amendment which is finally adopted."
"As you know, last November the Commission proposed a broad package based on Article 13 with two directives and a programme."
"One of the directives has already been adopted in record time, and I am quite optimistic that the other one will be adopted during the French Presidency in November."
"The debate in Parliament was extremely interesting, and you have already highlighted the political importance of this directive."
"In terms of social solidarity, human rights and social justice, and in terms of the internal market, it is very important to understand that we must have the same minimum social standards in all Member States and in the applicant countries in the future as well."
"I would like to thank the two rapporteurs, Mr Cashman and Mr Mann, for the excellent work they have done."
"I would also like to thank the committees involved for their support and cooperation in getting a coordinated view in such a short time."
"It is important that the Community action programme is adopted by the Council this autumn so that we can avoid a gap between it and the preparatory actions which we are currently running."
"I can accept a number of your proposals."
"In particular I welcome the amendments you have made on mainstreaming and on the issue of multiple discrimination."
"I will also accept the amendments you have tabled to bring out the importance of preventing discrimination, as well as combating it."
"Prevention is the key to a long-term strategy."
"I also agree with the emphasis you have placed on doing what we can to meet the special needs of people who have difficulties in participating in the programme."
"This will necessarily include efforts to make all the documentation around the programme as simple and as accessible as possible (on which you have also proposed amendments)."
"I am aware of the difficulties and of the complication of the forms of these projects and I will try to simplify them."
"I can also agree to highlight in future the importance of NGOs, both as partners and as target actors participating in the actions themselves."
"It will be important to involve as wide a range of types and sizes of NGOs as possible to make sure that we benefit from the experience of these people who work every day with these issues."
"I can accept your proposals to write into the body of the decision the limit of 90% for the co-funding of such NGOs, and we can justify this proposal because there are many particularities in these NGOs."
"In short, therefore, I can accept either as drafted or in spirit Amendments Nos 1, 2, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 18, 21, 41 to 45, 47, 50, 58, 59, 62, 64, 65, 66 and 67."
"I can also accept parts of Amendments Nos 3, 14, 16, 31, 33, 35, 38, 40, 55 and 57."
"I am unable to accept the remaining amendments for a variety of reasons."
"Some are not in conformity with other legal requirements, for example the amendment concerning the committees' arrangements."
"Some are simply not compatible with the Commission's objective, such as focusing the annual report on the implementation of the programme rather than on a particular aspect of the fight against discrimination itself."
"Others risk creating an imbalance in programmes by an over-concentration on a particular aspect; others again are not necessary to achieve Parliament's objective, as the ideas are either implicitly or explicitly already included in the decision, such as those on drawing on the experience of third countries."
"As regards Mr Mann's report, I would like to comment on the main amendments tabled before Parliament today."
"There are three categories of amendment."
"The first one concerns disability, religion and age."
"The second category aims to clarify the text of the Commission proposal and the third category consists of a large number of amendments which try to bring this proposal in line with the directive on racial discrimination adopted last June."
"As far as the first category is concerned, disability, religion and age, the specific problems facing disabled people are acknowledged in the current draft where the provision to reasonably accommodate the workplace to the needs of disabled people is specifically foreseen."
"This is a key provision for achieving equal treatment for people with disabilities."
"I welcome your clarification on the terms ""reasonable accommodation"": you use the word ""adjustment"" and ""undue hardship""."
"Your proposal is very useful, as discussions in the different institutions have shown that these terms were not fully understood."
"Now it has become clear that a number of factors such as the cost involved, the financial resources of the organisations and the possibility of obtaining public funds will determine if their accommodation would impose a considerable burden on the employer."
"I would like to clarify that the valuation of the economic impact in SMEs is not just the work or job of a civil servant."
"We use as a basis the statistics at European and national level, we use surveys and we have comparisons with the impact in the USA where there are surveys and results after a long period of implementation of directives like this."
"Another key issue concerns religious organisations and the possibility of using the genuine occupation requirement clause in Article 4(2)."
"However, this provision should not give rise to discrimination on the sole grounds of disability, age or sexual orientation and we must be very clear on that."
"I welcome your reference to this question in Amendment No 37."
"I can also agree to the idea of extending the wording of Article 4(2) to include organisations providing services in a religious environment, as we realise that the wording of the Commission's proposal was very rigid."
"In my view, with these two additions, the scope of the proposal becomes clear."
"On the contrary, I cannot accept Amendment No 38 which proposes to delete from Article 5 the list of differences of treatment on grounds of age, which could be justified."
"This is not in line with our proposal."
"The Commission's intention is to create workable rules for companies while at the same time prohibiting instances of discrimination which are arbitrary and not objectively justified."
"However, I understand that this is a very sensitive issue."
"The Commission is ready to simplify the wording of Article 5 for better understanding of this provision."
"Regarding the second category of amendments, it aims to clarify the text of the Commission's proposal."
"In particular, Amendments Nos 9, 10 and 20 propose the removal of the reference to discrimination based on racial and ethnic origin."
"All three can be accepted for reasons of legal consistency."
"I also accept the references to the 2000 employment strategy, to personal and self-realisation, to discrimination as an obstacle to free movement of persons, to the clarification of the personal scope of the directive as being applicable to third country nationals, to the clarification of the burden of proof and to the simplification of the information provision."
"These references are contained in Amendments Nos 7, 8, 9, 12, 34 and 47."
"The Commission can accept the spirit of all these amendments."
"I want to turn now to the third category of amendments."
"I can accept the spirit behind all these amendments but in some cases there is a problem with the wording."
"However, there are a number of other amendments which I cannot accept, either for technical reasons or because their detailed nature runs counter to the purpose of the Framework Directive."
"I would like to refer in detail to those amendments which I cannot accept because they present political or legal difficulties."
"You have addressed the important question of contract compliance."
"This kind of provision is not appropriate in a directive on a framework proposal."
"I agree that it is very important and I pledge that it will be a communication: we will examine this in the text of the communication we have already announced in the social agenda."
"Secondly, I have raised the issue of monitoring and statistics."
"We all know that this is very important, but I must stress that in some Member States the collection of this kind of data infringes constitutional provisions on the protection of privacy."
"So I cannot accept your proposal on Amendment No 43, but I agree with you that, without monitoring, it becomes extremely difficult to know what progress is being made and the action programme will explore what can be done at Community level."
"I cannot accept your references in Amendments Nos 21 and 45 to natural and legal persons and non-formalised groups of persons, as this employment proposal only applies to individuals."
"It is clearly a legal problem."
"You propose in Amendment No 52, by analogy with the directive on racial discrimination, to incorporate a provision on independent bodies to monitor compliance with the provision of the directive."
"I also have difficulties with Amendments Nos 19 and 35, in which you propose a time-frame of three years in order to equalise the scope of the discrimination legislation for all the grounds referred to in Article 3."
"It is impossible to refer to this time-frame in a directive, but the implementation of the action plan will help us to see how we can move forward with the other amendments."
"To summarise, I can accept, either as drafted or in spirit, Amendments Nos 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 12, 14, 23, 24, 26, 30, 34, 40, 49, 50, 51 and 54 and also parts of Amendments Nos 7, 9, 13, 20, 25, 29, 36, 37, 41, 42, 46, 47, 48, 58, 59, 60 and 61."
"This very large number of accepted amendments proves the excellent cooperation between the Commission and Parliament."
"In conclusion, some Members of Parliament referred to the need for cooperation about, or the implementation of, directives like these in the applicant countries."
"This directive must be part of the social acquis in the applicant countries."
"It is the first time that we allow joint projects in this action programme."
"Applicant countries can cooperate with the Member States and submit joint projects and joint proposals and this is very important for them and for us also."
"Some of the Members have referred to the particular problems that Turkey has with the Kurdish language and the problems in Turkey."
"I consider that the Community could support and select any kind of project that the Turkish Government submitted in the framework of this action plan."
"I had to reply to more than 50 different points and amendments and I am very optimistic that these amendments will be adopted during the French presidency."
"That concludes the debate."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Arms trade code of conduct"
"The next item is the report (A5-0211/2000) by Mr Titley, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the Council's 1999 Annual Report on the Implementation of the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports (11384/1999 - C5­0021/2000 - 2000/2012(COS))"
"Mr President, it may have passed some people by, but the fact that I am able to stand here and lead a debate on the Council's annual report on arms exports is really quite sensational, firstly because for years this Parliament called for a code of conduct in arms exports and was told it was an impossible dream."
"Yet we have a code, thanks largely to the initiative of the British Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, proof once again that where Parliament leads today, the Council will eventually follow."
"Secondly, when the code was agreed cynics said it was too weak and it would not work."
"Yet it is clear from the annual report that it has worked better than all expectations, including those of the Member State governments who approached this project with great suspicion."
"The code of conduct has led to greater mutual understanding, greater transparency and a greater convergence of Member States' policies."
"Furthermore non-EU countries are queuing up to associate themselves with the code."
"Clearly the more global the code the more effective it will be."
"Thirdly, it was also feared that the code would be implemented in secret."
"Yet today, thanks to the Finnish Presidency, we are able to discuss the annual report."
"So great progress has been made in a short period of time."
"That I welcome and I congratulate everyone involved."
"Effective and coherent EU policy on arms exports is essential if the EU is to pursue its external objectives, particularly given that we have so many areas of instability on our borders."
"You cannot claim to respect democracy and human rights if you do not act to stop weapons of murder and repression falling into the wrong hands."
"You cannot seriously pursue conflict prevention and peacemaking without controlling arms exports, particularly small arms."
"You cannot expect public support for peacemaking operations if our troops face death from weapons which we have ourselves supplied."
"At the same time the European defence industries remain strategically and economically important to the EU."
"In order to survive they need to continue their consolidation and rationalisation."
"A common arms exports policy is essential to this process."
"That is why the framework agreement signed by the six Member States in July was so important."
"Despite the enormous progress made, there are areas where the code of conduct needs to be strengthened."
"The Council annual report itself identified the need for a common list of military equipment to be established."
"This was agreed in June and progress has been made on the list for paramilitary, public order, and internal security equipment."
"I wholeheartedly welcome these developments."
"The code, however, is only a political commitment between Member States."
"It should be legally binding."
"Article 7 of the code commits Member States to prevent exports being diverted to undesirable end users."
"Yet end user regulations vary enormously from country to country."
"They should be better coordinated and more effective."
"As a starting point we need a Community-wide database of information on licences and sensitive end users."
"It is clear that many weapons find themselves in the wrong hands because of the activity of arms brokers."
"Yet most countries have little, if any, control over them."
"In my own country I would need a licence to own a shotgun but not to set up as an arms broker in my garden shed."
"This is wrong and I welcome the British Government's announcement last week that it is to stop."
"We need to control the activities of arms brokers throughout the EU."
"I was stunned recently to discover that there are up to 300 arms brokers in the south-east of England alone."
"Modern civilisation is rightly offended by this unregulated trade in death."
"That is why progress has to be made on the German presidency proposals to control arms broking."
"That should be a priority now."
"Lastly, the greatest safeguard against abuse of arms exports is transparency."
"The annual report is a large step forward but its transparency depends on the transparency of the national reports which it is created from."
"Some are better than others."
"Since 1997 my own government has published annual reports on arms exports which have been praised for their transparency."
"I urge all other governments to do the same."
"I commend my report to the House. I urge the Council to act on my recommendations in order to enhance the EU's commitment to global peace and stability."
"Mr President, I have to confess to a certain nostalgia for the times when the European Parliament - and the various pacifist movements and trade unions - used to call urgently for dedication and action in order to steadily reduce arms manufacturing, and we would discuss ways of converting military production into civilian production."
"I still feel that this must be our approach, that we must not give in before the inevitability of war and conflict and that the defence policy must not provide for large-scale arms production, but that Europe must adopt an defence policy of intervention where it is not weapons that count but the ability to intervene peacefully in order to find non-violent solutions to disputes."
"That said, since I am a dreamer whose feet are firmly on the ground, I will hold onto my dreams and work towards their realisation."
"I feel that it is important, as stated in the opinion of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy itself, which is attached to the report, that the code of conduct - and we can deduce this from the annual report which we examined - has led to steps forward in the area of controlling and rationalising arms exports from the European Union."
"In this sense, the Titley report is particularly efficient and highlights not only the merits but also the omissions, the innate limitations of the Council's report and of the feasibility of implementing the code of conduct."
"I would like to emphasise certain points which appear to be particularly important: making the code of conduct legally binding, actively working towards drawing up an international code of conduct on the transfer of arms, making implementation of the code of conduct more transparent - in order to better assess its effectiveness - for example, providing information relating to the number and type of weapons for which licences have been granted and to the identity of exporting countries and countries of destination, conducting checks on intermediaries and brokers, putting an end to the current practice of selling European Union arms in areas of war or where human rights are blatantly violated."
"Another major point is the ban on exporting, promoting and selling equipment and expertise which is, in practice, to be used for the purposes of torture."
"There are a great many other important points, but I would just like to end by saying that transparency dictates a greater involvement of national parliaments at decision-making level and the participation of NGOs."
"Mr President, Commissioner, in taking the floor on the extremely difficult subject of arms sales, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on the manner in which he has managed to clarify matters for Parliament in the outstanding and comprehensive explanatory statement in the motion for a resolution which is being discussed today and which will be voted on tomorrow in this House."
"This statement focuses on the fear shared by the majority of our fellow Members, that arms of all kinds manufactured by the European Union may, if exports are not effectively controlled, be used by countries or armed groups that do not respect international law or human dignity."
"This is a not insignificant risk."
"The rapporteur was right to point out that, without such control, we have a situation where military personnel from EU Member States, acting in a peace-keeping capacity, have, in the recent past, been confronted by weapons manufactured and supplied by EU companies."
"Mr Titley is right, however, to point out in addition that the future of the European defence industry, which is essential for pursuing the European Union' s peace and security objectives, will depend on the coherence between the policies of the Member states, particularly as regards exports, and that this should lead them to work towards drawing up and expediting the publication of a code of conduct based on the terms given in the legally binding agreement signed in July by six of the Member States."
"This is the objective of the Titley report, and that is why the Group of the European People' s Party endorses the report."
"That is also why it opposed those of the amendments tabled by our fellow Members in order to demand planet-wide general disarmament, with the European Union to set the example."
"In consideration of the situation of the world today and of this continent, following the end of the cold War and the breaking of the balance established by the dread fear of weapons of mass destruction, such an attitude would be highly irresponsible."
"Since this dream, as you rightly termed it, Mrs Morgantini, still remains today in the realms of utopia, as I fear it will for a long time to come, we should, as proposed, highlight instead the positive results that have already been obtained by applying the code of conduct and propose all the measures that are desirable and applicable in order to improve the efficiency of this method."
"I believe the report under consideration will contribute to this objective. I should like to congratulate the rapporteur once again."
"Mr President, this Parliament has always argued in favour of improving EU laws on arms export and, partly as a result of these pleas, we now have a code of conduct which we are able to debate today for the first time."
"The PSE Group sees this as a good start but a code is no law."
"We continue to strive for legislation which is more binding and more up to date, in view of the developments within the arms market and in the arms industry."
"So, as far as we are concerned, we would emphasise the wording in Mr Titley' s report about also making the code legally binding."
"Having said this, I would naturally like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Titley on his excellent report."
"He has scrutinised the code most comprehensively and has prepared a report for us which we can now readily discuss."
"One central point, of course, is that arms export policy should not develop in isolation."
"It must form an integral part of the common foreign and security policy."
"After all, it is an instrument of foreign policy which can and must contribute to the Union' s external policy which we would all like to bolster."
"The European Union is currently developing a military arm within the second pillar."
"This requires more cooperation in the field of arms production and arms export."
"I hope that the bigger players in the arms export industry can see this as well."
"May the improved cooperation between six Member States, which came about recently, serve as a case in point."
"I would still like to underline that, within that framework, one of our objectives is to improve the so-called end-user regulation."
"We feel we should continue to work on this code and ensure that it can lead to a common arms export policy in due course."
"The rapporteur is also right to highlight a number of persistent problems in the field of arms export."
"The proliferation of light weapons remains disconcerting, even close to home, in the Balkans, for example."
"In a sense, these arms have come to symbolise anarchy in many areas worldwide."
"The EU would do well to grant this more priority."
"There is of course also a direct link with organised crime, which is actively involved in the arms trade."
"This can only be tackled through increased cooperation."
"I wholeheartedly back Mr Titley' s plea to grant the candidate states a more prominent role."
"I would also like to include the Balkans in this."
"Much of the so-called illegal arms trade is channelled through these regions."
"As Mr Titley pointed out - rightly so - the code can be made more transparent by providing more and better information."
"I would like to underline this, also on behalf of my group."
"Unnecessary secrecy surrounding arms transactions must disappear."
"Here too we should continue to fight for more transparency."
"It is only by having hard facts that we can assess whether the EU Member States actually practise what they often preach, namely work on more security within and between countries."
"Mr President, its undeniable merits notwithstanding, the report is very technical and sticks to the paradigm and framework of military security, and it lends disproportionate weight to considerations relating to the defence industry."
"There are only faint rumblings in the background when it comes to armed conflicts and human suffering."
"We must extend our study, on the one hand, not only to matters of binding agreements, but also to instruments other than those intended specifically for military purposes, voluntary disarmament, conversion, and making the work of the police and customs authorities more effective, and, on the other hand, the applicant countries just mentioned by Mr Wiersma."
"The code of conduct, as part of a common foreign and security policy, will also be binding on the applicant countries."
"We would also like the important NATO country, Turkey, which is also an important market, to be mentioned in this connection."
"It is only by complementary action such as this that we can move towards a more sustainable security in Europe and the world, one that is founded on disarmament and stability."
"Mr President, where Mr Titley' s report in general is concerned, I basically share the points of view presented by Mrs Morgantini and others."
"I shall here simply discuss a quite special issue concerning the draft resolution."
"Recital R of the report talks about the ... 'development of a common defence policy in the context of the CFSP and the establishment of a European Security and Defence Identity within NATO' , and paragraph 1 e talks about the EU' s weapons policy' s having to 'contribute to the development of a Common Defence Policy' ."
"Mr President, these are wordings which have to be totally unacceptable to those Member States which are non-aligned and which want to remain so."
"That applies to my own country, Sweden, and I accept that it also applies to other non-aligned States within the EU."
"Sweden does not believe that activity within CFSP can be described as a defence policy because it does not involve any common defence obligation corresponding to NATO' s paragraph 5."
"CFSP covers crisis management activity outside the EU' s borders and nothing which can be described as a common defence policy."
"Sweden participates actively, too actively I am inclined to say, in the development of a common weapons policy, but that is something different."
"The situation is not improved by Mr Titley' s writing about a common defence identity within NATO."
"As is well-known, Sweden is not a member of NATO. Nor, as far as I know, does it have any intentions of becoming a member."
"All Swedish Members of the European Parliament obviously have to vote against the two above-mentioned wordings, and I also expect Parliament as a whole to reject them."
"If that were not to happen, the Swedish Government would, of course, have to lodge a protest against Parliament' s openly repudiating Sweden' s non-aligned status."
"Mr President, I read Mr Titley' s remarkable report with very great interest."
"If you allow me, I would like to elaborate on two aspects."
"In the explanatory statement, the rapporteur lists four ""essential criteria"" which European policy needs to satisfy in the field of arms exports."
"The third criterion, the needs and challenges of the European defence industries, and to a certain extent criterion 4, the development of a common defence policy, are potentially and factually at odds with criterion 1, namely the consistency of the Union' s external action, whereby its objectives regarding conflict prevention and promotion of human rights prevail."
"After all, the European arms industry needs to export, and these exports often end up in countries which are not serviced by successful competitors for a variety of political and strategic reasons."
"Unfortunately, practice has shown that these are often countries which should not be supplied with arms in the interests of conflict prevention."
"Think of the warring parties in Congo and countries in the Middle East."
"On the basis of this consideration, I would argue in favour of clarity: which criterion prevails in the event of the criteria quoted by Mr Titley clashing?"
"Secondly, the rapporteur is completely right in putting his finger on the sore point of supervision by national governments of the conduct of their own arms dealers."
"Not the slightest obstacle is put in the way of these dealers, as long as they only use the telephone to set up deals between parties in other countries."
"A useful addition to Mr Titley' s practical proposals could perhaps be the introduction of a licensing system to finance the trade in weapons used in war, as well as to settle arms deals."
"Monitoring the money circuit is bound to make it more difficult to avoid arms trade regulations."
"At the same time, when the financial flows are monitored, it means that governments use one and the same yardstick, unlike in the present situation, where they are intent on monitoring the real flows whilst turning a blind eye to the virtual, financial flows."
"Mr President, this is an interesting and important debate."
"I apologise that I shall not be able to be here for the end of it, but I have already been struck by the number of contributions to the debate by people who know a great deal about the subject, including Mr Titley."
"I would like to thank him very warmly for the excellent report, which addresses a number of extremely complex issues."
"I can assure him that the Commission has read his report with very great interest and I hope that Member States have also done so, since so much of the action is in their hands."
"We certainly stand ready to collaborate with the Member States to ensure that the report's recommendations are sensibly implemented."
"Mr Titley has highlighted an essential element of the CFSP."
"Indeed, as ESDP becomes operational, issues such as arms exports must be seen as forming part of a comprehensive approach."
"Our aim must be coherence and that I take to be a very important underlying message in the report."
"The EU code of conduct establishes a set of detailed principles governing conventional arms exports."
"These aim at preventing the export of weapons to governments which abuse human rights, to areas of conflict or to regions engaged in arms races."
"It is clear that the ultimate responsibility for arms exports belongs to national governments."
"But the arms trade is currently dealt with in the context of the common foreign and security policy, with which of course the Commission is fully associated."
"The code has been in existence for one year and, as acknowledged in the first annual report, Member States' initial experiences of its operation during this period were positive."
"The code has already increased mutual understanding of Member States' policies, it has established an efficient consultation mechanism and it has encouraged dialogue on the implementation of its provisions."
"It is undeniable, however, that there are grounds for further strengthening of the code and its implementation, as Mr Titley has mentioned."
"The aim of the annual review is to identify such potential improvements."
"Any amendments to the code must enjoy the support of all Member States."
"In this respect we welcome the adoption of a common list of military equipment covered by the code during the Portuguese presidency, as requested by this report."
"The Commission services are currently exploring the possibilities of drafting EC legislation on non-military items to which the provisions of the code should apply."
"This would certainly include instruments which can be used for torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment."
"A few weeks after the adoption of the code, the associated countries of Central and Eastern Europe and Cyprus plus Iceland and Norway issued a declaration aligning themselves with the criteria and principles in the code."
"Since then many of those countries have made considerable efforts to comply with the code."
"We share Mr Titley's concern that associated countries should take the necessary steps to attain European Union standards in the field of arms exports."
"The Commission services, in the course of their regular meetings with associated countries, continue to encourage them to abide by the code's provisions and fully implement its criteria and to monitor their compliance."
"Furthermore, the European Union is interested in broadening the acceptance of the main principles contained in the code so as to cover the world's main arms exporters."
"The European Union is committed to combating the destabilising accumulation of small arms in many parts of the world."
"The Commission, in close collaboration with the Member States, was actively involved in the drafting of the European Union joint action on small arms and light weapons."
"We fully intend to strengthen policy in this area as part of a coherent approach."
"We agree with the rapporteur that further efforts are needed in establishing common rules for controlling the legal trade and for eradicating trafficking and smuggling in such arms."
"We are committed to providing financial and technical assistance to countries, international organisations, regional arrangements and NGOs, as proposed by the joint action."
"A number of projects are currently in progress or under consideration."
"Under the EU project in Cambodia, technical, administrative and financial support is provided to the government and to selected NGOs for actions aimed at promoting the control, collection and destruction of weapons."
"The European Union is currently considering the continuation of the project beyond its expiry date in November of this year."
"We are also supporting Operation Rachel, a joint South Africa/Mozambique operation, on the collection and destruction of small arms."
"Other projects are under consideration in South Ossetia and West Africa."
"The Commission attaches great importance to the 2001 UN Conference on the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons."
"In this respect it is going to be necessary to build credible EU common positions in the coming months."
"We will continue to consult closely with our partners during the preparatory process and we will work together towards the adoption of effective guidelines for the conference."
"These could result in politically or legally binding instruments and a comprehensive international programme of action for the small arms problem."
"The point I believe is to see our efforts in this regard as part of a comprehensive approach to arms policy in general and as part of the overall endeavour to make ESDP coherent."
"May I thank the rapporteur again for his excellent report, which provides a great deal of useful guidance on how to develop our policy in this extremely important area."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is suspended until 9 p.m."
"European research area"
"The next item is the Commission communication on the European research area."
"Mr President, Ladies and gentlemen, today the Commission adopted a Communication that is important for the future of research in Europe."
"It proposes guidelines for future Union research activities, for the period 2002-2006, and more especially for the Union's future Research Framework Programme."
"The aim is to define the specific contribution that this will make to the creation of a European Research Area."
"By means of its Resolution of 18 May 2000, this Parliament lent its firm support to this project, which is now being put into action."
"A group of representatives from the Member States has therefore been set up to deal with the issues of benchmarking and the mapping of excellence, and this group is currently working with the Commission."
"A methodology and indicators have been defined and will be presented at the next Research Council."
"The initial results will be presented to the European Council meeting scheduled for next March, which aims to address general economic and social issues."
"But it is clear that the Union's Research Framework Programme also has a more specific role to play."
"Before it can do so, however, there is a need for a comprehensive review of its design, the conditions under which it is implemented and, more specifically, its methods of intervention."
"The guidelines set out in the Communication adopted this morning have been defined with this in mind, on the basis, in particular, of the conclusions of the report on the five-year assessment of research programmes, drawn up by a panel of independent experts, and the mid-term review of the Fifth Research Framework Programme, carried out by the Commission."
"The guidelines have been defined in such a way as to enable European research to be structured more efficiently via the European Union's research programme."
"They are based on the following principles: a switch from an approach centred on individual research projects to a broader approach, based on a set of cohesive actions of which European Union measures will constitute but a part."
"A real concentration of efforts in areas where action at Community level will generate a plus: that of European added value."
"Such areas would be pinpointed by applying criteria for defining this added value in terms of creating rankings and exclusion."
"The introduction of types of intervention of longer duration; half-way houses between support for projects and institutional financing, the use of the variable geometry instruments available under the Treaty, and, more specifically, European Union participation in national programmes, as provided for in Article 169 of the Treaty."
"In tangible terms, there is, among other things, a proposal to have recourse to formulae such as the networking of national programmes through support for the mutual opening-up of programmes and, above all, European Union participation in programmes carried out in a coordinated fashion; the creation of European networks of excellence by networking existing capacities in the Member States around joint programmes of activities; the carrying out of large targeted research projects conducted by consortia of companies, universities and research centres, on the basis of overall financing plans; greater backing for regional and national efforts in support of innovation and research conducted by small- and medium-sized companies; reinforcing and diversifying action in support of research infrastructures of European interest; the increasing and diversification of mobility grants and, in general terms, measures in the field of human resources."
"These new methods of intervention are the result of new methods of management."
"They will significantly enhance the impact of the measures taken under the current framework programme to increase the scale of projects and to simplify procedures."
"The guideline document adopted today is designed to trigger debate immediately, beginning with debate within the institutions."
"On the basis of the outcome of this debate, the Commission will present its formal proposals for the Research Framework Programme for 2002-2006, next February."
"These proposals will become part of a series of specific Communications, each of which represents a contribution to the establishment of a European Research Area."
"I will have be able to present these guidelines in detailed fashion and discuss them at length at the meeting of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, which is scheduled for 12 October, but I look forward to hearing Parliament' s views on this document."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"I can see that you are tackling the task of bringing in the framework between 2002 and 2006 in a very efficient and workmanlike way."
"You say that you intend to concentrate on projects where there is considerable European added value and that you will therefore be applying criteria."
"Could you tell us a little bit more about what those criteria might be?"
"Could you also say how you envisage the role of the Joint Research Centre in undertaking an evaluation of technological foresight programmes which might indicate to us the sorts of areas where this European added value might be most useful?"
"Mr President, I have a question."
"In the Committee on Budgets, the European Parliament has earmarked 10% of resources for small and medium-sized undertakings."
"So what is the picture in this new area, especially as regards cooperation between the research institutes, the major research institutes, between groups of undertakings, small businesses and individuals?"
"Does the programme go into that question specifically?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, in your communication on the European research area you also referred to the poor mobility of researchers and to the problems within Europe."
"Hence my question: do you intend to follow up this communication on the European research area with legislative initiatives, with a view, for instance, to improving mobility as well as social protection during periods spent abroad?"
"Mr President, I would like to respond succinctly to the various Members who have spoken, by saying that I hope that next Thursday's debate will be more in-depth."
"First of all, I would like to reply to Mrs McNally: the issue of European added value formed part of the criteria for calls for proposals, which already comprised a series of elements such as, for example, the multinational dimension, the fact that there are several Member States, the fact of these being projects which were more or less European in scale."
"These were therefore elements which already existed."
"But to date there had not necessarily been any form of ranking or factors dictating exclusion."
"This ranking is precisely the characteristic that we want to enhance, and it is dependent on the level of the method of intervention."
"There is a need to strike a balance between a genuine ranking and avoiding additional bureaucracy."
"This is the discussion on criteria that we will be having with the Member States, of course, and also with Parliament."
"As regards the Joint Research Centre, the idea is to make this a key centre for common reference, for joint expertise."
"It has an important role to play."
"You are well aware of the need to centre the actions of the Joint Research Centre on areas in which it can fulfil this role of European added value, by virtue of the fact that it does not depend on the private sector and is independent of the Member States."
"As regards the issue of SMEs, we have, of course, been careful to ensure that SMEs play a part in the framework programme, as was stipulated in the budget decision."
"Only this afternoon I witnessed a fine demonstration."
"I do not know whether you have seen the new types of fireman' s helmet that have been developed as the result of a partnership between German, French and Dutch firms and the TNO Research Centre, which constitute a new generation of fireman' s helmet developed by SMEs."
"This is a very striking example of what we have achieved in this area."
"With regard to the actions that we propose, page 16 of the policy paper sets out the new ways in which we are thinking of working, with greater decentralisation towards associations and towards national structures."
"Lastly, as concerns mobility, Mr Linkohr, you will be aware of just how much this issue, and all its social implications, is of concern to us."
"The Mobility group has been set up at Commission level, with the various Member States, and is to hold its first meeting on 20 October."
"This group consists of the representatives of Research Ministers, but also actual Ministers for Social Affairs and Home Affairs, to overcome obstacles to mobility, such as problems concerning pensions and freedom of movement on European territory."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his introduction but I am still left with a few questions."
"You said that you have a total shake-up of the framework programme in mind."
"We have tried to do this with the fifth framework programme and, as it now transpires, with very little effect."
"In a resolution quoted by yourself, which was adopted in this Parliament on 18 May and for which I was rapporteur, I recommended multi-disciplinary teams for research, since innovations often occur on the cutting edge of different disciplines."
"I cannot find any reference to this in your report which I have now read and which you adopted this week."
"My second point, Commissioner, is that you recommend the European Union to take part in national programmes."
"I have also written that, in Europe, we need to move away from techno-nationalism, but once again if the framework programme is what we are concerned with, this Parliament - and I repeat this very Parliament - plays a crucial role, and how will Parliament' s role take shape if we apply variable geometry?"
"Commissioner, I would like to draw your attention to a very long-standing issue for whoever has been involved in research."
"In discussions and contacts I have had with the research community, especially in Greece, there is great concern about whether the Commission is in favour of downgrading basic research."
"At least that is what seems to be coming out of the budget debate in Greece, and many people are calling upon the European Union to make its views clear."
"Is this true, and at the very time the United States appears to be doubling its funding for basic research?"
"If it is not true, should basic research not be intensified in all countries, large or small, in line, of course, with the value placed on their centres and researchers?"
"Mr Busquin, thank you very much for your Communication, which shows that you are being very swift in giving effect to the proposals for guidelines that you have set out with regard to the common research area."
"I would like to ask you whether you consider that it will be possible to launch, as early as 2001, pilot actions regarding the preparation of the Sixth Framework Programme, and, in particular, the networking of research that you have talked about."
"I would also like to ask you to award particular attention to the relations between the STOA Unit and matters that concern your Directorate for which you have responsibility, because problems exist in this regard."
"Many research-related matters selected by the STOA Unit are then poorly received by the Commission departments."
"This issue should therefore be discussed with you, particularly in connection with the Joint Research Centre (JRC)."
"Lastly, I would like to ask you whether we could quite rapidly develop research activities within a Euro-Mediterranean context, since you recently had a meeting at Capri with the Research Ministers of countries from both sides of the Mediterranean, and because this is an issue of great concern to Parliament."
"Mrs Plooij van Gorsel, thank you for your intervention. I am aware of the significant support that your report gives to the European Research Area."
"I feel that we must take into due consideration the fact that our objective is not part of a traditional framework programme."
"You, who have experience, will perhaps say that this has already been stated several times."
"I feel that what is currently required is something that structures the European Research Area, which is to say something that goes beyond the framework programme and supplements national programmes; we need a structuring element, which means that we have to agree on certain rules."
"And here I am referring to the flip side of variable geometry."
"Yes, with an opening-up of the national programmes of several Member States onto an area with European added value, the Commission and the Union can intervene."
"But they must intervene by applying criteria that facilitate access which is as broad as possible for all the elements of the European Union, which is to say for all the Member States, and even for third countries too."
"There are new proposals to champion."
"We have never made use of Article 169 of the Treaty; this Article could be used to harness more frequently and more cohesively the activities of the various Member States."
"I share your views on multidisciplinarity."
"This issue is certainly not developed particularly extensively, but it is nevertheless brought to light in the criteria."
"The third paragraph of page 9 of the document reads as follows: ""need to combine complementary expertise in the different countries, particularly in the case of interdisciplinary issues, and to carry out comparative studies on a European scale"" ."
"It is clear that in the future - and you have stressed this in your report - development will take place on the borderlines between different technologies and sciences such as biology and information technology."
"It is therefore clear that the multidisciplinary aspect must be taken into consideration, and will moreover constitute one of the elements of European added value."
"Concerning the question about the European Union and its disinterested approach to basic research, I do not feel that this is the case."
"I moreover believe that this dichotomy between basic research and applied research is a thing of the past."
"In many fields, it is immediately apparent that certain basic research elements are, in fact, applied research elements."
"The current framework programmes are therefore a mixture of basic research issues and applied research issues. So I do not feel that there is any need to make a distinction."
"This is my belief, and also that of the scientific community, which does not seem to be of the opinion that that European Union programmes systematically disregard basic research."
"I believe that we will have the opportunity, Mr Papayannakis, to address this issue again in our discussions, but there is no intention on our part to make a distinction."
"Moreover, no one is talking about making a distinction, and industry has not called for one."
"Lastly, I would like to reply to Mr Piétrasanta, who I thank for his intervention and constructive intent."
"As concerns discussions with the STOA Unit, I feel that we have to act together, since this is something that concerns this House, the Joint Research Centre and the technological foresight institutes in the various Member States."
"It is in our own interests to cooperate more effectively and more closely."
"I would therefore welcome any form of debate or discussion on this issue."
"As concerns the Euro-Mediterranean context more specifically, I believe that you too will have noted the interest shown by the countries on both sides of the Mediterranean in conducting joint research and technological development activities."
"I would, however, like to say before Parliament that it is important for this need, which has been expressed and which is, moreover, a force for economic development and innovation in this area, to be considered at the level of the MEDA programmes and at that of all the external relations programmes."
"There is often a tendency, at external relations level, not to view research and technological development as priorities."
"I, for my part, believe that these are key factors for increasing understanding among researchers and their mobility around the Mediterranean basin."
"In any case, these were the conclusions that the Ministers for Research and Science reached on this subject at Capri last weekend."
"Mr President, I would also like to welcome Mr Busquin's statement."
"Many of the ideas that we discussed in the report from the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy have been taken on board."
"There are two points that I would like Mr Busquin to explore a bit further with us this afternoon."
"The first is that he specifically mentioned in his statement EU participation in national programmes."
"Could he expand a little on what he envisages and say whether that will entail the EU partly funding national programmes and acting as a coordinator or will the JRC become one of the actors in a broader research network on an equal basis, for example, with other national research teams."
"I would also like to press Mr Busquin on a point that Mr Piétrasanta made, because I do not think he answered that and it was a point that I certainly supported."
"Can he confirm that he will be considering some pilot programmes in 2000-2001 in order to develop some of the networking concepts ahead of full implementation?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, I have three points to make."
"First, I was glad to hear you say the management is to be improved."
"Indeed, the management of the programmes is sometimes rather creaky."
"What concrete steps do you have in mind here?"
"Secondly: research is constantly changing our society and the consequences of research change our society."
"What is the position of socio-economic research in the European research area?"
"Thirdly, the ECSC Treaty will be expiring in 2002."
"At that point considerable funds will be available for coal and steel research."
"Will that research be incorporated in the sixth framework programme?"
"To what extent will there be coordination, and how much power of codecision would Parliament have on what happens here?"
"Commissioner, I would like to thank you for being here today and for your statement."
"The Commission appears to be moving quickly towards shaping the European Research Area."
"I have two questions: firstly, the term 'added value' that you used, although this is not the first time it has been used, refers to economic criteria for the development of research and may lead to the commercialisation of research."
"Without wishing to pour scorn on the commercial and practical side of the use made of the results of research, I am somewhat concerned that this will become the prime criterion."
"Could you possibly allay my concern?"
"My second question relates to the centres of excellence."
"Does the Commission have any criteria in mind for choosing these centres of excellence?"
"Mr President, Mr Harbour and Mr Piétrasanta - I apologise for not having replied to your question - firstly, as concerns pilot experiments for 2000-2001, we will make every effort to accurately assess the feasibility of certain elements, including that of networking."
"As you will see in the policy paper, discussions are already underway on two or three issues, which will be put into effect as of next year, bearing in mind, of course, the constraints associated with legal aspects of the Fifth Framework Programme."
"A degree of flexibility can, however, be shown in respect of certain issues."
"You will have three examples of this in the policy paper, and I hope that we will have the opportunity to discuss this matter again soon."
"As regards the question that you refer to, you have spoken of participation in national programmes."
"I believe that this will be one of the key issues."
"If I am unable to give you an immediate reply on this today, it is because it was precisely my intention, in this policy paper, to invite the Member States to adopt a position, for there will never be a European Research Area if it stems solely from the will of the Commission."
"The Commission and the framework programme only account for 5% of research-related public expenditure."
"There can therefore be no talk of a European Research Area if we are only responsible for 5% of that research."
"That is why it is important that on the 16th, at the meeting of the Ministers responsible for science, the Member States undertake to open up their national programmes."
"At that juncture, the contribution that we can make will consist of providing some sort of coordination."
"The States who agree to open up their programmes will foster coordination and mobility within a relationship yet to be defined - on a project by project basis, of course."
"Not all the projects will be opened up; some will be easier than others to integrate at a European level."
"In response to Mr Lange, I would like to say that we are already beginning to take management measures."
"There is Mr Gerold' s report, certain elements of which I am still waiting to receive, but I can tell you now that, as it says in the policy paper, there is a need to increase the size of projects."
"We currently find ourselves somewhat overwhelmed by a host of projects that are too small, which make administration cumbersome, and which exacerbate constraints and lead to errors."
"With regard to social and economic research, it is quite clear that there is a place for this."
"There will be an entire chapter on science, society and the citizens."
"We are going to draft a Communication on this subject."
"I indeed feel that, in Europe, research and development must be conducted with the citizens."
"There is a whole series of avenues that must be explored in the field of social and economic research, in the fields of foodstuffs, new technologies and, in particular, biotechnologies."
"As regards the ECSC programme, you will be aware that an agreement has been reached, and that research will continue."
"It will not, until there is a proven need to the contrary, be totally incorporated into the framework programmes. It will retain its specific character."
"This, moreover, is the wish of those who negotiated the ECSC research programmes with the Commission."
"In reply to Mr Alyssandrakis, I feel that commercial issues should not be allowed to predominate."
"In any case, the type of research that could be labelled 'disinterested' , which is to say research that has no commercial goal, is often the type of research that produces the best results in economic and basic terms."
"I believe that everyone now realises the need to maintain an area which guarantees freedom of development to researchers, independently of purely commercial imperatives."
"Your question is very relevant, but we will have to wait to see what happens in practice."
"We do not intend to push commercial issues to the fore in all fields of research."
"Much targeted research has a highly prominent commercial aspect, but there are also more basic forms of research which serve general European Union policies and, at times, also have beneficial spin-offs for commercial interests."
"Lastly, as regards centres of excellence, we are at precisely the point of preparing the applicable criteria."
"I would nonetheless like to emphasise one sentence which you will see in the policy paper that I feel to be very important, because the issue of centres of excellence has prompted many questions."
"It is inadvisable to define what exactly is excellent and what is not."
"We therefore feel that we should refer to the terms as they stand in the policy paper, namely the 'networking of capabilities for excellence in the public sector (in particular university teams) and private-sector centres of excellence, which would be achieved with long-term joint programmes of activities' ."
"This is therefore a bottom-up operation to be carried out not with hyper-centres, but with different teams working as part of a network."
"High-performance European- and international-level teams which link up to work as a network, regardless of where they are based."
"The information technologies now available make this quite possible, whatever the size of the teams."
"Thank you very much, Mr Busquin."
"That concludes this item."
"Question Time (Commission)"
"The next item is Question Time (B5-0540/2000). We will examine questions to the Commission."
"First part"
"Question No 1 by (H-0726/00):"
"Subject: Budgetary implementation of the Cohesion Fund The Cohesion Fund's budgetary implementation rate has in recent years been extremely high."
"Given that the amendments to the rules governing this Fund have been extremely limited in scope (unlike those affecting the Structural Funds), how can the Commission justify the fact that the rate of implementation for the first half of 2000 is lower than 1%?"
"I am very pleased that Mrs Torres Marques has asked this question because it gives me the opportunity to sum up, before the plenary session of the European Parliament, the situation with regard to Cohesion Fund commitment appropriations, which affects not only the country for which she is a Member but also other countries - Ireland, Greece and Spain."
"I would also like to state my concern at the very low level of commitment of Cohesion Fund appropriations at the end of August - only 16%, Mrs Torres Marques - and, while things have changed for the better since the end of August, I would like to reiterate this concern, which I shared with Parliament' s Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism on 11 September."
"Meetings have been held with the Greek, Irish and Portuguese authorities to ask the governments of these countries to speed up their presentation to the Commission of their Cohesion Fund projects."
"We have received a set of projects from Spain which give me cause to hope that, in the case of this country, there will be a complete implementation of appropriations for the year in progress, subject, of course, to these projects fulfilling the requirements in terms of technical expertise."
"In the case of Portugal, Mrs Torres Marques, but above all in the case of Greece, the number of projects received does not give me the same cause to hope for a satisfactory implementation of appropriations."
"Please understand me when I say that I would not wish to be misunderstood in the slightest by you or any of the MEPs concerned."
"I do not want to point the finger or hand out good or bad marks."
"It is my responsibility to manage as rigorously and as actively as possible the European Union' s second largest budget, that for Regional Policy and the Cohesion Fund."
"I have to report not only to the Court of Auditors and to the tax-payers, but also, first and foremost, to the European Parliament, which is responsible for budgetary control and for adopting this budget, and I believe that it is my duty and role to say what is happening, at such times as I judge fit, and to do so in a transparent manner, with respect for the budgetary authority of which the European Parliament forms part."
"There are reasons why so few projects have been submitted to the Commission to date."
"On the one hand, as a result of the efforts made to commit all the appropriations at the end of 1999, there was inevitably a very sharp drop in applications for the financing of new projects at the beginning of this financial year."
"On the other hand, as this is the first year of the new programming period, I have to say, and this is an objective assessment, that the Cohesion Fund countries, including your own, have centred their efforts on Objective 1 programming."
"I have, in fact, publicly stated, notably at Lisbon in the presence of the Prime Minister and Mrs Lisa Ferreira, that the Commission was extremely satisfied with the quality of the work carried out by the Portuguese authorities in conjunction with the local authorities as concerns Objective 1 programming."
"However, due to the very major efforts made it has been impossible to make a simultaneous and commensurate effort in respect of the Cohesion Fund."
"I would like to say to the countries concerned that they now have to make this effort and swiftly present a sufficient number of tangible projects."
"Otherwise, there will be a risk of certain Cohesion Fund appropriations made for the financial year 2000 being lost for ever."
"Indeed, contrary to the provisions of the interinstitutional agreement on the Structural Funds, no form of rebudgeting in subsequent financial years is provided for in the case of the Cohesion Fund."
"Those countries that are Cohesion Fund beneficiaries should therefore be under no illusion that there is little time left for projects to be submitted and appraised under the budget year in progress."
"That is the point that I wanted to make as clearly as possible, Mrs Torres Marques. Thank you for providing me with the possibility to do so."
"Many thanks, Mr Barnier, for coming on behalf of the Commission to answer this question, which is very important to us."
"But I think, Mr Barnier - and I am sorry to say this - you are not very well informed."
"Perhaps the lack of staff you have just mentioned exclusively devoted to the Cohesion Fund - who did exist in the former Commission - prevented you from having more concrete details."
"According to the details I have, and after what you said in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Planning, I know that Portugal has already submitted projects that exceed the Cohesion Fund in both the transport section and the environment section."
"You know that this fund has always been very well managed by the four countries and has always had 100% take-up rates."
"You must be very concerned to know why countries that have always complied so well seem not to be complying now."
"I think the ball is in your court: your staff have the details, but they must be allowed to provide an answer."
"What I am afraid of, Mr Barnier, is that the Commission may be taking the opportunity to cut the Cohesion Fund appropriations in the 2001 budget."
"We will not accept that!"
". (FR) - Mrs Torres Marques, I have listened very closely to what you have to say, but I do not quite understand what you mean when you talk about the possibility of our cutting the budget."
"The previous programming period finished at the end of 1999."
"We are now in a new programming period, and it is this period that I basically have to worry about in terms of my accountability, which does not prevent me from being highly attentive, in conjunction with Mrs Schreyer, and under the control of the Committee on Budgetary Control and the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, to the balancing of accounts for previous programmes."
"Now, I also have some concerns in this area, some of which concern Objective 2, Objective 1 and Cohesion Fund appropriations that date some way back."
"I would, however, reiterate that Portugal did indeed handle matters well in the previous period."
"I am simply observing, and I have given you the figures as at 26 September, that the appropriations actually committed by Portugal, for the new period - I have only been a member of the Commission for a year - stand at 2.6%."
"You have heard me: 2.6%."
"I am quite familiar with the General Regulation on the Structural Fund and on the Cohesion Fund, and I am aware that they are not governed by the same rules."
"I would thus issue a warning: Watch out!"
"It will not be possible to re-programme or rebudget for subsequent years, and there is a risk of losing a number of Cohesion Fund appropriations."
"I have written to Mrs Ferreira, with whom I have had very good and constructive relations, to state my concerns."
"I know that your country is making great efforts to present a sufficient number of projects."
"We will validate the technical content of these projects as swiftly as possible so that your country, like the other Cohesion Fund countries, is not made to suffer and is able to benefit from all the appropriations in question."
"Commissioner, I would like to ask you two things."
"You quoted a figure of 2.6% for Portugal."
"Could you give us the figures for Spain and Greece?"
"My second question is this: besides the Cohesion Fund, there are also the Community Support Framework, the Structural Fund, regional programmes, etc."
"I am unable to provide you, off the cuff, with details of the projects being conducted under the Community support frameworks for countries that are eligible for Objective 1 funding under the Structural Funds."
"I provided all this information to the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism on 11 September, but, if you really wanted, I could arrange for this information to be transmitted to you this evening or tomorrow, in the form that it was submitted, in all transparency, to the competent Committee on 11 September, under a month ago, for all the countries concerned."
"I have no major worries, regarding Objective 1 funding, for any of the countries concerned, nor any major worries regarding Objective 2 funding: things are moving forward and, by and large, discussions on the Single Programming Documents are already under way."
"I believe that negotiations are in progress on 83 of the 102 SPDs to be signed, although I am only speaking from memory."
"Why am I laying the emphasis on the Cohesion Fund?"
"Because, once again, the General Regulation treats the Structural Funds (Objectives 1 and 2) and the Cohesion Fund differently, and because, if I were forced to, I could not enter into reprogramming in the case of the Cohesion Fund."
"There would therefore be a risk of losing the money."
"That is why I am sounding the alarm without, I repeat, pointing the finger at any particular countries, because planning everything in one year for the seven years to come makes major demands on regional and national administrations, national governments and Commission officials."
"You asked me to give you the figures for the other countries."
"As at 26 September, the level of appropriations committed stood at 26.2% for Spain, 4.9% for Greece and 2.6% for Portugal."
"No appropriations had been committed at that date for Ireland, but the situation in that country is a special one."
"In overall terms we had, as at 26 September, committed 17.6% of the Cohesion Fund appropriations."
"Question No 2 by (H-0730/00):"
"Subject: Fuel duty The current level of fuel duty in the United Kingdom is very substantially in excess of that prevailing in any other Member State."
"The burden imposed by this tax is especially heavy on remoter parts of the country, in particular the Scottish Borders and the Scottish Highlands and Islands."
"This has a severely distorting effect on competition as between small and medium-sized undertakings in these localities and multinational or other large-scale undertakings operating throughout the United Kingdom, as between tourist industries in these localities and hotel chains concentrated in large centres nearer to mainland Europe, such as London, and as between farmers and fishermen in remote parts and farmers and fishermen more advantageously located."
"Will the Commission therefore carry out an inquiry into the question whether the excessive level of fuel duty in the United Kingdom constitutes a breach of competition law under the Treaties and is therefore illegal."
"What action does the Commission intend to take on this matter?"
"The question raised by the honourable Member is extremely topical but, in order to be able to give a clear answer, I have to remind you of the origin of Community law on fuel tax."
"In 1987, the Commission submitted several proposals on indirect taxation in order to abolish the fiscal borders as part of completing the internal market."
"Regarding duty, the aim of the Commission was to achieve complete harmonisation of taxation on mineral oils within the Community by introducing a unique duty for each type of product."
"Had these measures met with approval, unfair competition, as intimated by the honourable member today, would almost certainly have been ruled out."
"However, this proposal instead met with heavy protest from certain Member States."
"In 1989, the Commission submitted a new proposal which was to offer more flexibility."
"That proposal which, in addition to minimum rates, also provided for narrow rate bands and target rates, was once again rejected by the Member States."
"Eventually, in 1992, the Member States unanimously decided on the introduction of a Community system of tax levies on mineral oils which only provided for a minimum tax rate for each type of mineral oil on the basis of its use; i.e. as fuel for motor vehicles, for industrial and commercial use or for heating."
"I would thus like to underline that the Community minimum rates have not been reviewed since 1992 and that today, in practice, duty levels often far exceed the Community minimum rates and also differ greatly from country to country."
"As the honourable Member pointed out, the duty on fuel and diesel used as motor fuel which applies in the United Kingdom is the highest in Europe, but duties on fuel oil and kerosene, at least if - and insofar as - these are used for industrial and commercial purposes or even for heating, remain far below the highest values applicable within the Union, as is also the case with the duty on heavy fuel oil."
"It is thus a mixed bag and it is not the case that all duties on mineral oils are higher in the United Kingdom than elsewhere in Europe."
"Finally, if duties on mineral oils are laid down at a high level, this does not lead to non-compliance with Community regulations in terms of competition."
"Government aid, on the other hand, could exist, as a form of government aid, only if certain specific sectors were to enjoy exemptions from general regulations, and the compatibility or otherwise of such aid measures with the Treaty would then have to be examined."
"This concludes my response for the time being."
"Mr President, I am grateful to Mr Bolkestein for his very careful answer to my question, but I am not quite sure that he has answered it fully."
"To make matters clear, as the Commission will know, this question was tabled before the protests began and it was prompted by complaints from people in my constituency."
"For example, there is a company on the island of North Uist which is engaged in quarrying and road maintenance."
"It seems a very good idea that there should be small- and medium-sized enterprises that are able to tender for and compete for road maintenance work on islands of that kind."
"It is good for employment and for social cohesion."
"If the fuel costs of a company like that are more than double those of multinational companies with other bases elsewhere in Scotland which can bid for the same contracts, obviously this severely distorts competition, to the disadvantage of outlying communities."
"I appreciate the points Mr Bolkestein made and I know that the principal rule in the treaties prohibits charging foreigners more than home companies, but the general law of fair competition in Europe ought to apply and where levels of taxation are totally disproportionate we should look at the effect competition law can have on the situation, despite the general rule that these matters are the prerogative of Member States."
"Mr President, I would say to Mr MacCormick that the Commission has no means of influencing the level of excise taxes for mineral oil products in Member States."
"I want to be clear and insist on this point, because, as I said in my answer in the first instance, the Commission has made several attempts to get Member States to agree to the harmonisation of excise taxes precisely to avoid distortions in trade which may arise as a result of the differences therein."
"Mr MacCormick will realise that these attempts by the Commission have been rejected by the Council."
"Therefore once again, the Commission has no instruments to get Member States to change the level of excise taxes."
"That is the first point that I would like to repeat and insist upon."
"Secondly, as Mr MacCormick knows, where Member States favour by fiscal means a certain sector of industry, they thereby infringe the rules on state aid, in this case fiscal state aid which is akin to a subsidy."
"Mr MacCormick rightly strives for equality of treatment and equal and fair competition."
"If a particular sector or region is favoured through fiscal means then the laws of fair and equal competition are infringed and the Commission, in the form of my colleague Mr Monti, will take action."
"Thirdly, Mr MacCormick will know that there are a certain number of derogations from the principle of certain and definite levels of excise taxes."
"These derogations stem from Article 8(4) of Directive 92/81 of the European Union and are approximately 100 in number."
"These derogations are called the 8(4) derogations."
"At the moment, the Commission is looking at all these derogations and examining whether they should be prolonged and if so, for what length of time."
"In the course of this examination, the Commission will also answer the question of whether such derogations are an infringement of the Treaty rules on state aid, because obviously a derogation may border upon fiscal state aid and if there is an overlap, there may be a case for the Commission to take action."
"Returning to the case in point, which had not yet come to my attention, I assume that the conditions under which large and small companies operate are connected with the excise taxes for the minerals oils that they use and as long as the excise taxes are similar or more or lessthe same for these various sectors of industry, there is not much scope for the Commission to intervene."
"I hope that I am clear in this."
"If I have not persuaded Mr MacCormick, I hope that I can do so perhaps after this meeting."
"Mr President, the reason that prices differ between the islands and the mainland has nothing to do with excise duty."
"Excise duty is absolutely identical in all parts of the United Kingdom."
"I should like to ask this: is the Commission aware of a recent highly reputable Swedish academic study which has demonstrated that taking all costs into account, transport costs in the UK are in fact average compared with the European Union as a whole?"
"Taking account of non-wage labour costs, the cost of licensing and insuring vehicles and road tolls, the UK is no more expensive to drive in than any other part of the European Union."
"Given the Community's commitment to meeting its Kyoto commitments, I wonder whether the Commissioner would accept that the best way of doing so is by higher fuel duties, as opposed to raising the other transport costs."
"If you want to conserve fuel, the way to do it is through fuel duty, not other forms of taxation."
"I would say to Mr Martin that there is obviously a connection between the price of any kind of fuel to the consumer and the demand for that fuel."
"That is the price elasticity of demand."
"It is a mechanism which I suppose is familiar to Mr Martin. Although the precise shape of the elasticity curve is something we may debate, the fact that it exists is certain if one looks at the oil-intensity of the economy and how that intensity has changed."
"Since the oil crisis in the 70s is has approximately halved."
"There can be no doubt that in the longer term intensity plays an extremely important role."
"If, therefore, Mr Martin bears in mind that if we want to attain the aims and purposes of the Kyoto Agreement and a high price of oil to the consumer would be beneficial to that end, then he has the logic of economic reasoning behind him."
"The logic of economic reasoning supports the statement made by Mr Martin. One may, of course, expand on his wish - which I deduce from his words - to comply with the undertakings which we entered into in Kyoto, by saying that other forms of energy may also help us attain that aim."
"For example, nuclear energy is a very clear case in point."
"It is not part of my portfolio to deal with energy, and particularly not with nuclear energy, but since Mr Martin has embarked upon an economic line of reasoning then I feel free to make this remark."
"There are other sides to this picture."
"If one increases the price of oil, one influences economic growth in an adverse manner."
"In both the Western world and for developing countries calculations have been made which show that an increase in the price of oil - USD 5 per barrel or USD 10 per barrel - means that economic growth will suffer by 0.2% or 0.5% or whatever."
"So it is not a simple picture."
"Kyoto is important."
"We all want to achieve that."
"The high price of oil is conducive to achieving that end but there is also a negative factor on economic growth with its attendant consequences in the form of more unemployment."
"It is not a simple picture."
"I would caution Members - insofar as that may be necessary - against a one-sided approach to this whole problem."
"Mr President, I accept the Commissioner's very balanced arguments about Kyoto and the economic repercussions thereof but we are talking here about particular problems in peripheral and remote areas."
"If the Commission has no instruments to influence levels of excise taxes in Member States, and if favouring certain industries is not allowed under the competition rules, surely where a region suffers special disadvantages because of peripherality and remoteness, it would only be a case of equalising matters, not of giving any special preference if there was some differential in excise taxes permitted in those special and particular circumstances?"
"I should like to say to Mr Purvis that the matter of natural, regional disadvantages is probably a matter for the national governments since a part of their electorate lies in those outlying areas and peripheral regions."
"They may also fall under the competence of my colleague, Mr Barnier, who spoke to this Assembly a little while ago."
"From my point of view, I look after the fiscal matters of the Union, insofar as I am allowed to do so by the Member States."
"It would not be right if I said that a geographical advantage were to be achieved by fiscal means so, to that extent, I must disappoint Mr Purvis."
"However, if he comes to me with a particular case in point, a particular region, or whatever if may be, then I would be happy to raise the matter with my colleague, Mr Barnier."
"Question No 3 by (H-0743/00):"
"Subject: Budget line for minority languages The budget line of the European Union for minority languages was introduced in 1983 and increased steadily to reach a peak in 1995 with EUR 4 million."
"Since then the appropriations have been cut, for no apparent reason, with the result that in the current year they amount to EUR 3.5 million."
"This is all the more surprising in that the European Union is moving closer towards enlargement to the East and the question of minorities is becoming increasingly important as a result, particularly in the context of a proper exchange of information."
"Furthermore, activities hitherto - for example, the creation of an online network for regional and minority languages, operated by the European Bureau for Lesser-Used Languages and the three Mercator centres - have had a very positive response."
"Can the Commission therefore state what level of appropriations are intended for promoting minority languages for the coming year, and whether any increase over 2000 is envisaged?"
"Mr President, in response to the question asked by the honourable Member, I would like to say that the preliminary draft budget, which was adopted by the Commission on 10 May, includes an appropriation of EUR 1 million for the European Bureau for Lesser-Used Languages and for the Mercator centres under the budget heading A-3015."
"The Commission has not entered in the budget any specific appropriations for the financing of projects directly intended to promote regional or minority languages, for reasons that I will now attempt to explain."
"The Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 between Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure specifies that appropriations relating to activities with no legal basis - as with the case in point - for projects concerning the promotion and safeguarding of regional and minority languages and cultures, may be entered in the budget for only three financial years at the most, and on condition that the establishment of a legal basis for them is subsequently envisaged."
"Bearing in mind this limitation, and in view of the scope for financing projects concerning minority languages as part of the European Year of Languages 2001, the decision was taken not to enter specific appropriations in the budget for 2001 but to consider the possibility of providing a more sustained form of support to the future of these languages, and this within the framework defined by the 1999 agreement."
"In other words, I am relying very much on the European Year of Languages to set things in motion and to enable us, at the end of that year, to come together and arrive at a lasting solution that does not oblige us to return to the lists each year and do battle to obtain funding."
"It should nevertheless be noted that regional and minority languages and cultures are eligible for support under a number of other programmed actions. For example, preparatory activities designed to encourage the use of digital content on worldwide networks in order to promote linguistic diversity in the information society - Culture 2000, MEDIA - insofar as the projects proposed contribute to the achievement of the objectives of these actions."
"While no amount is specifically set aside for minority languages as part of these activities, this does not prevent these programmes being used for that purpose."
"Mr President, thank you, Commissioner, for that information."
"Of course I would have liked you to be more like Santa Claus and tell me now how much extra money we will have to produce in future for the minorities and for promoting minority languages."
"Naturally, I am aware of the legal framework."
"I want to look at the issue as a whole and ask, in that context, whether in future we might not be able to draw on the Structural Funds."
"A few weeks ago, the Braunmüller Verlag published a book by Dr. Christoph Pan entitled ""Volksgruppen in Europa - Ein Handbuch"" [Nations in Europe - a Handbook], which listed some 60 minority groups in the European Union, 300 in the continent of Europe."
"Out of a total of 750 million inhabitants, 100 million belong to minority groups."
"If the Central and Eastern European countries were members of the European Union, we would have another 50 or so minority groups on top of the existing 60 in the European Union of Fifteen."
"Dismantling the internal borders is certainly a substantial step forward, but we must be able to prepare these minorities."
"Would it be possible to fund that through the pre-accession programmes and the Structural Funds?"
"Mr President, I am sure my parliamentary colleagues know that the Structural Funds - and this is something new - earmark very substantial funds for cultural activities, for both I and Michel Barnier considered it important to ensure that the Structural Funds do not invest only in roads and airports but also in people."
"But the fact is that applications to the Structural Funds have to come not from the Commission or the European Parliament, but from the governments."
"So in the event that the governments want to use the Structural Funds for the development and promotion of minority languages, they can do so."
"Of course, it is also most important for the national parliamentarians to urge their government to take action."
"As the author is not present, Question No 4 lapses."
"Question No 5 by (H-0762/00):"
"Subject: Campaign against child sex tourism Since 1998 ECPAT Sweden has been running a project for a code of conduct for tour operators against child sex tourism with a view to persuading tour operators to undertake to eliminate demand for this type of tourism."
"As the project also covers Germany and Austria, it has been receiving 60% EU funding since November 1999."
"A new decision by the Commission is required to continue financial support after November."
"No new application procedure for assistance has yet been initiated."
"There is therefore concern that funding may cease."
"As I assume that action against child sex trafficking is one of the Commission' s priorities, will a new application procedure be initiated to carry on funding the ECPAT project?"
"I will answer the questions from Mr Sacrédeus and Mrs Theorin on the same subject together."
"The Commission agrees on the importance of the fight against child sex tourism."
"The Commission will pursue its actions to protect human dignity by preventing and combating violence against children, including child sex tourism, in the field of cooperation in justice and home affairs."
"Last spring and summer the European Commission carried out a general review of its activities and human resources."
"On 26 July 2000 the Commission concluded that it needed more than 1 200 extra posts to be able to manage all its tasks."
"In the past the Commission's executive tasks have increased while its political and legislative work has decreased in relative terms."
"In July the Commission decided to reverse this trend and reduce its executive tasks in order to have sufficient human resources for the political, legislative and conceptual tasks."
"For a wide range of sectors this means the reduction and phasing out of activities."
"In particular activities financed by small budget lines will be reduced because they are very intensive in terms of human resources."
"The sex tourism information and awareness campaigns have had an important role to play."
"However, in view of the lack of resources and in line with the general trend of cutting small budget lines, these activities will be phased out."
"Thus the Commission will not make new financing commitments next year."
"Nevertheless the Commission will do its best to use appropriations for these activities in this year's budget."
"I have instructed my services to find the most efficient solution in the next few weeks."
"Discontinuing support for the information campaign does not, however, mean that the Commission will abandon its other activities to protect children against violence and abuse, notably the STOP programme."
"The Commission is preparing a proposal to renew the programme later this year and child sex tourism will be one of its concerns."
"The Commission is also preparing legislative proposals on the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography in accordance with the conclusions of the Tampere European Council."
"Proposals will seek to approximate definitions, offences and penalties and the extra-territorial application of Member States' criminal laws on sexual exploitation of children."
"In this field Member States have a major responsibility."
"Nevertheless the Commission will, in close collaboration with the Member States, continue to play an active role in developing and maintaining a coherent European policy to protect children against violence."
"I should like to thank Commissioner Liikanen for that answer, even though I am not entirely happy with it for obvious reasons."
"I wonder if the matter has been shunted backwards and forwards between different EU Commissioners without anyone in the end taking real responsibility for the issue."
"Tasks of that kind do exist."
"The second thing I want to ask about is whether you believe that the matter has been handled in an acceptable way."
"Thirdly, how, in the light of enlargement towards the East, do you interpret the decision to remove resources from a practical fight in Sweden, Austria and Germany against child sex tourism when we know that there are special problems involving the sex trade and trade in human beings in a large number of the candidate countries?"
"Fourthly, President of the Commission Prodi recently attacked the power of the Council of Ministers."
"What would you think if, during its Presidency, the Swedish Government demonstrated this power by taking action to reinstate economic support for ECPAT Sweden?"
"I should first of all like to emphasise that, in the previous Commission, it was Anita Gradin who was very active in this area."
"She was responsible for issues of justice."
"It was also therefore quite logical."
"It was an important activity, and I value the work she did."
"I have also spoken with her."
"Where concrete financing proposals are concerned, it is not possible for me to adopt a position here, because we must respect the normal procedures."
"As I said, I have asked my officials to find a solution which would enable us to use the current budget grant, that is to say the money we budgeted for the year 2000."
"I nonetheless believe that we have to find a partner who operates internationally."
"Thirdly, each presidency must clearly have its own programme."
"If such a situation were to arise, we should have to discuss it later."
"I want to say again, however, that we must concentrate our efforts on this area. At the same time, it is important to do so at a more political level and to concentrate on the Stop programme which covers the same area."
"It is obviously a good thing if the Commission has re-thought this issue."
"It would be devastating if support for the work on combating child sex tourism were to be withdrawn."
"That cannot reasonably be the EU' s policy."
"Every year, more than one million children are forced into prostitution."
"These children are increasingly exploited by tourists and businessmen who, remarkably often, come from Europe."
"The fact that the major paedophile scandal in Belgium is now no longer making the headlines in the media does not, of course, mean that the child sex trade has disappeared."
"Support for ECPAT is incredibly important."
"It is completely in line with the Council' s 1999 decision concerning efforts to combat child sex tourism and with the resolution adopted by Parliament as late as March of this year."
"To withdraw support for this work would therefore be to go both against the Council' s and Parliament' s demand for priority to be given to the fight against the child sex trade."
"How the Commission is to solve the problem technically is, I think, a matter still to be resolved, but the main thing is that this important work should continue to receive support from the European Union."
"I have thought of a number of different possibilities."
"One of these is to cooperate with the World Tourism Organisation, or the WTO."
"This is therefore not the same WTO we most often talk about."
"The World Tourism Organisation acts globally, not only in industrial countries but also in the developing countries where these problems exist today."
"We have still not made any decisions, but we hope to be able to take measures either with the WTO or with some other organisation in order to finance the project this year."
"I know that, as you mentioned in the discussion, the Swedish organisation has already cooperated with the WTO in the past, so these two organisations know each other well."
"I hope that we can find a solution in conjunction with the WTO and in such a way that the three remaining months of this year may be sufficient for activating this budget line."
"Question No 6 by (H-0781/00):"
"Subject: Euro Can the Commission say whether it has carried out any investigation into the cost of adapting European undertakings to the Euro, what the outcome of that investigation is likely to be and what will be the average cost to each European firm, in particular small firms, of adapting to the changes required by exclusive use of the single currency as from 1 January 2002?"
"Will provision be made for any Community financial contribution for European Union undertakings (especially those in the weakest position) in order to lessen the burden posed by the forthcoming changes?"
"Some experts in the field believe that there is a risk that it will prove impossible for undertakings to adapt their computer systems and software in time. This would jeopardise their operation, and might force them to return to conducting all their business on paper."
"Does the Commission share this view, and what action will it take to prevent such problems?"
"Second part"
"Questions to Mr Byrne"
"Research shows that the creation of the single currency entails significant overall economic benefits."
"That is why the introduction of the euro should be seen as an investment rather than a cost for the economic operators involved."
"Research on the potential changeover costs for individual undertakings would only provide a partial view and could be misleading."
"As regards compensation, the Member States and the Commission take the view that the public authorities and the private economic operators will each bear the costs of the changeover in their respective fields."
"The Commission believes that all undertakings will be able to prepare themselves in time for the final changeover to the euro, including the adaptation of their computer systems and software."
"However, the present state of preparation is a matter for concern."
"Indeed many SMEs are still not fully aware of the implications of the changeover for their businesses, particularly as regards the legal tax and accounting rules and their software."
"The Commission and Member States are currently stepping up their efforts to provide information to remedy this situation."
"I would like to thank the Commissioner, who spoke succinctly yet unequivocally on the issue."
"The problem is that SMEs, as well as large enterprises of course, are being asked to shoulder the burden in order to benefit from the introduction of the euro. But the question is whether the SMEs can bear this burden without appropriate support."
"If they cannot, although they may reap benefits later on, the result will be that they may close down, as we were told during a seminar that was held in Brussels three months ago."
"This must be addressed, as we are talking of millions of SMEs throughout Europe."
"Since the Commissioner doubts whether sufficient progress has been made in respect of information and preparation, I would also like to ask whether he has any statistics on what percentage of the changeover has been completed in SMEs - let us stick with them - in the different countries, and I would especially like to ask if he has any details on Greece."
"Mr President, our plan is to discuss this issue in the Commission next week."
"Mr Solbes is to present a communication on special measures to accelerate the changeover to the euro."
"I am sure that Mr Solbes who is responsible for this matter will come to the details and I will transmit your message to the Commission next Wednesday when we take a position on the matter."
"Mr President, what interests me most is how the euro-debate will go on from here, after the referendum in Denmark, and what changes the Commission intends to make to the information strategy?"
"I am not sure that this is supplementary to Mr Marinos' s question: it is very broad."
"In any event, Mr Liikanen may answer if he wishes or is able to, but it is a very broad question."
"On the basis of what I have said, Mr Liikanen may decide."
"Mr President, very briefly, 11 countries have accepted the euro."
"For them everything continues as usual."
"These countries are preparing everything to change their notes and coins."
"This philosophical political discussion is no longer on the agenda, but in general we can discuss the dangers of a referendum, but perhaps in some other context."
"As the author is not present, Question No 7 lapses."
"Question No 8 by (H-0724/00):"
"Subject: Foodstuffs hygiene and hunting The Commission has recently submitted proposals concerning foodstuffs hygiene, COM(2000)438."
"The provisions are extremely comprehensive and touch upon various rules affecting hunting."
"Has the Commission assessed the effect of the proposals on reindeer husbandry and elk hunting in Sweden and Finland?"
"Do the requirements relating to hunting, for example of elk, also cover the treatment of meat for own consumption?"
"Mr President, the proposal on food hygiene referred to by the Member in question is a consolidation and simplification of the existing set of hygiene rules contained in 17 different directives."
"These include Directive 92/45 of 16 June 1992 on public and animal health problems relating to the killing of wild game and the placing on the market of wild-game meat which already lays down a number of hygiene rules with respect to wild game."
"With the new proposal, the existing food hygiene rules have been simplified."
"They are presented in a clearer way and unnecessary detail has been deleted."
"The proposed rules are definitely less extensive than the existing rules."
"Within the proposal on food hygiene the rules on meat from hunted animals are a minor but important part."
"It must first be emphasised that the proposal on the hunting of wild game does not apply to reindeer nor is it the intention that it should cover meat that is destined for the hunters' own private consumption."
"The proposal gives more responsibility to the hunter for judging the fitness for human consumption of wild game meat that is directly delivered to the consumer."
"The proposal aims to ensure that hunters are able to make a judgment about the safety of such wild-game meat."
"The Professional Hunters' Association would play an important role in ensuring that the hunters have the qualifications to make such a judgment."
"This applies also to moose."
"The impact of the proposal is limited."
"Already at present there is an obligation in Finland to present moose that is shot and sold to restaurants for inspection by the competent authority and some Member States already apply the rules as proposed."
"The proposal has been elaborated in close consultation with the Federation of Field Sports Associations of the European Union."
"It is believed that with the increased responsibilities for the hunters, consumer confidence in food safety are increased."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the Commissioner for his answer, and I have a supplementary question."
"The fact is that elk hunting is extremely widespread in Sweden and Finland."
"Tens of thousands of people hunt elk, and the meat they obtain is an important contribution to their households."
"Most people who hunt use the meat themselves."
"It is consumed within their own families or by friends, acquaintances or relatives."
"I should like a guarantee from the Commission that under absolutely no circumstances will the rules in this document apply to meat consumed by people for their own household needs."
"Meat of this kind must be exempt from these rules."
"If these rules were to be applied to meat consumed by people within their own households, this would constitute a bureaucratic disaster for elk hunting."
"I am happy to be able to give the honourable Member the assurance that these rules will not apply in circumstances of private use."
"Question No 9 by (H-0738/00):"
"Subject: Live animal transports A new Commission report on a mission that it carried out in France in November 1999 and a recent investigation in Italy by Compassion in World Farming and Animal Angels, show that several Member States are still not properly enforcing Council Directive 91/628/EEC on the Protection of Animals During Transport (as amended by 95/29/EC)."
"It emerged from this report that some transporters are failing to stop and give animals rest at the places which they have indicated on their route plans."
"The report also notes serious breaches on vehicle standards and maximum journey limits regarding animals arriving into and travelling through France."
"Would the Commission indicate the Member State from which the animals and vehicles referred to in Section 5.4.2 of the report come, and the Member State from which the animals mentioned in Section 5.3.1 of the report come?"
"What sanctions is the Commission taking against France and these Member States?"
"I share the concern that has been expressed that rules on the transport of animals are not being sufficiently enforced in certain areas."
"While Member States are responsible for the day-to-day enforcement of Community legislation, the Food and Veterinary Office of my Directorate-General undertakes specific control and inspection missions to check that Member States apply Community legislation in an effective and uniform manner."
"Under Community legislation, transporters of livestock must submit a route plan in advance to the competent authority of the place of departure when the journey exceeds eight hours."
"On their return, the transporters must send back completed route plans to the same competent authority."
"The competent authorities of the place of departure must check in particular that completed route plans have been returned and verify that the journeys have been carried out according to the plans."
"During the mission referred to, carried out in France in November 1999, it was found that the route plans stamped by the competent authorities of the place of departure were not properly implemented and that travelling time limits were often exceeded."
"The FVO mission report mentioned refers specifically to transporters whose journeys originated in Ireland."
"Concerning France, the Commission is waiting to be informed about the actions taken by the competent authorities regarding some of the recommendations of the FVO mission report, especially of the action taken to ensure that route plans are properly used and signed."
"A reminder has been recently sent to the French authorities."
"Irish authorities have been informed of the findings of the FVO and details of the deficiencies detected have been sent."
"The Commission is currently monitoring the situation in both cases."
"If it appears that a Member State repeatedly fails to enforce Community legislation, the Commission would consider opening an infringement procedure under Article 226, as has already been initiated against other Member States in relation to the protection of animals during transport."
"I will present a report on the implementation in the Member States of the Community legislation on the protection of animals during transport to the Council and to the European Parliament."
"The Commission's report will include the findings mentioned in the FVO inspection reports."
"When this report has been concluded, I intend to present proposals to improve the transport of animals and the problem of insufficient enforcement of the travelling time limits will be addressed."
"In conclusion, I assure you that animal welfare is very high on the Commission's agenda."
"I look forward to further discussion of these issues when I present the report on animal transport in the next few weeks."
"Thank you for that response and for outlining the theory of what is meant to happen with this directive."
"As the Commissioner has indicated, the reality is often quite different."
"I want to ask in particular about the border post of Gorica between Slovenia and Italy."
"Over the years the Italian authorities have ignored the requirement of the directive and have done almost nothing to alleviate the suffering of live animals arriving from Eastern Europe."
"The latest complaint submitted by the Euro Group for Animal Welfare in April this year resulted in the Commission agreeing, at long last, to take out infringement proceedings against Italy."
"I would like the Commissioners to say a little bit more about the specific issue of infringement proceedings against Italy."
"What is the progress of this?"
"Has it started and, if not, when will it?"
"In relation to candidate countries I can tell you that meetings have taken place with them in relation to this issue of transport of animals and preliminary agreements have been reached."
"The view of the Commission has been made known and noted."
"In relation to Italy, I have had an informal conversation with the relevant minister on this issue."
"He has indicated to me his concern to ensure improvements in the area."
"We are considering infringement proceedings in relation to this Member State but no such proceedings have been initiated as yet."
"This is a related question."
"Perhaps it is not related to the issue of the transport of animals over long distances, but to that of transport to abattoirs and what happens before then."
"By adopting a number of reports, we in Parliament have embarked upon the long road towards making food in Europe safe."
"When does the Commissioner intend to produce draft directives to make animal husbandry safe, that is to say the breeding of animals, how we treat the animals we eat, how we transport them to abattoirs etc.?"
"When will these directives be part of the long chain?"
". As I indicated, the Commission is currently working on a report on the operation of an animal transport directive in the Member States."
"This report is at an advanced stage of preparation and will, I hope, lead to further proposals for improvement in the existing situation, in particular in the existing directive."
"We discussed this issue previously at my meeting with the Green Group."
"The report will be transmitted to Parliament in due course."
"Question No 10 by (H-0755/00):"
"Subject: Adverse effects of imports of genetically modified seeds on cotton cultivation Imports of cotton seeds contaminated with small quantities of genetically modified seeds originating chiefly from the USA have caused serious problems for cotton growing in Greece and will have adverse long-term consequences."
"These problems have arisen because the EU and the Greek government have deliberately neglected to set up the necessary Community or national legal framework to prevent imports of seeds and propagating material contaminated with genetically modified organisms from third countries."
"Since the above omission has still not be rectified, despite the adverse consequences it has caused, will the Commission say what measures the EU intends to take to prevent imports of seeds and propagating material contaminated with genetically modified organisms in future ?"
"Under the current Council Directive 92/20 on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms, products containing or consisting of GMOs may not be placed on the market unless consent has been given under the provisions of this particular directive."
"Although this is not yet reflected in the relevant Community seeds legislation, this principle would apply also to those seed lots of conventional plant varieties of the different genera and species, including cotton, which contain impurities of EU-unapproved genetically modified seeds."
"Member States are responsible for inspection and control to ensure compliance with Directive 90/220."
"The Commission White Paper on food safety has foreseen the need to amend the annexes of the existing directives on the marketing of seeds in order to first of all lay down the growing conditions and other requirements for purity concerning the adventitious presence of genetically modified seeds in seed lots of traditional plant varieties and secondly to lay down the details of the labelling requirements for seed of genetically modified plants."
"The Commission services are currently preparing a draft Commission directive covering these issues and including cotton seed."
"However, in this year's spring sowing season the Commission was informed of interceptions of imported seed of conventional varieties of different species including cotton containing traces of GM seed."
"The Member States concerned reacted differently with regard to the interceptions."
"As far as the measures taken by the Greek authorities are concerned, I would also refer to the answer given my colleague, Mrs Wallström, to Oral Question H-742/2000."
"The Standing Committee on seeds and propagating material for agriculture, horticulture and forestry has discussed a plan for coordinated and harmonised interim action in respect of GM seed impurities in seed of conventional varieties."
"Under this plan the Member States would immediately organise testing of a significant number of seed lots of conventional varieties to determine the presence of GM seeds until the coming into force of related new Community legislative measures."
"A set of criteria was identified to establish a common approach for sampling and testing for the presence of GM seeds and for appropriate action in the case of detection of GM seeds."
"The criteria are currently under discussion."
"This interim action plan is designed to cover the period until the coming into force of related new legislation in order to avoid an unsatisfactory situation similar to that earlier this year in the forthcoming sowing seasons."
"Our question was clear: what measures is the Commission taking?"
"The Commissioner has told us about some general measures that are going to be taken. But he did not mention a single substantive, practical measure to prevent the importation of GM seeds."
"How are we to interpret this?"
"Of course, we may get an expression of wishes, as today, and of good intentions."
"But there continues to be a lack of any practical measures to prevent imports from the United States and from third countries of genetically propagating material infected by genetically modified organisms."
"I take the view, Commissioner, that you should ask, for example, that cargoes are accompanied by a supporting document, a certificate from a reliable, accredited international body or laboratory to testify that the imported seed lots are free from GMOs."
"But you are not asking for anything like this."
"This is a practical measure which you could introduce immediately."
"I am pleased to report the Standing Veterinary Committee responsible for seeds held a number of meetings in June, July and September on this particular issue with a view to reaching an interim agreement between Member States as to how to deal with this kind of situation, pending the enactment of the legislation that I referred to."
"Active consideration is therefore being given to this issue and an attempt is being made to seek agreement with Member States as to how to address this particular problem."
"That, in my view, addresses the short-term aspect."
"The long-term aspect, referring to the issues you identified in your supplementary question, is the subject of ongoing work at the moment in my DG and the particular issues you referred to - issues such as labelling and traceability - are being addressed."
"These are important and complex issues which deserve full consideration and I am happy to tell you that they are being considered in that light."
"Question No 11 by (H-0774/00):"
"Subject: Health and safety warnings relating to the private use of visual display units Further to my exchange of letters on this issue with Commissioner Byrne, can the Commission give a firm commitment that it will further examine whether a Directive is required to provide health and safety advice to parents and teachers whose children/pupils use computer equipment either at home or at school?"
"Can the Commission give an indication as to when it will announce the results of its examination of this area?"
"Finally, can the Commission comment on the progress made by Member States who, pursuant to Council Resolution of 17 December 1998, were encouraged to consider developing voluntary agreements between manufacturers and consumer associations on the production of informative and consumer-friendly operating instructions?"
"This is a matter which, strictly speaking, falls largely within the competence of my colleague, Mr Liikanen."
"However, having consulted with his services, I am in a position to inform you that essential safety requirements concerning computer equipment to be used privately or in the working place are prescribed by a directive relating to electrical products, the Low Voltage Directive, as well as by the Directive on Radio Equipment and Telecommunication Terminals."
"Specific standards have been developed by standardisation bodies on a number of these safety aspects."
"There are also some safety requirements for eye protection at work in the Directive on the Safety in the Workplace but none yet for private use."
"Moreover, the Council recommendation on the limitation of exposure of the public to electro-magnetic fields is applicable to safety aspects of computer equipment."
"Concerning these aspects, the Commission has already prepared a mandate for the standardisation bodies to draft standards on the use of computers over long periods."
"As far as advice to be given to parents and teachers, whose children and pupils use computers, is concerned, manufacturers are obliged, under the present legislation to provide an instruction for safe use of the equipment if deemed necessary."
"The general product safety also puts an obligation on producers to provide consumers with information on risks."
"This autumn the Commission will ask CENELEC to consider the development of standards on the effect on eyes of display units and computer screens for private use, as well as the inclusion of information and warnings for parents and teachers on this aspect."
"Ergonomic aspects will also be assessed to find if action at Community level is needed."
"At this stage the Commission does not consider that a specific directive is required to cover the issue of warnings for parents identified by the honourable Member."
"Standardisation can meet the concerns expressed."
"This is the same approach which has been followed to address, for example, the specific needs of the elderly and the disabled in relation to information and communication technologies."
"For the more general question on the follow-up by Member States to the Council resolution on operating instructions for technical consumer goods, it should be noted that this resolution is addressed to Member States and to the economic operators and does not involve any specific follow-up by the Commission."
"However, the Commission will ask the Member States to provide information on the follow-up given the resolution."
"Mr President, I am grateful to the Commissioner for that information and for some signs of progress in the study of this issue."
"Would he agree with me that it is a false distinction to draw here, however, between safety in the workplace and safety in the schoolroom or safety for a child working at home?"
"Is it not the case that there should be at least as much consideration given to the safety of people in the latter environment, particularly since, in the time since the 1999 directive came in we know a great deal more about the possible harmful effects of ionising and non-ionising radiation on young people?"
"From a logical point of view I entirely agree.The difficulty in this issue is that the Commission and the European institutions have far greater powers in legislation governing the workplace than in, for instance, legislation governing private homes."
"The answer to your question is that the Commission's powers do not extend that far."
"Questions to Mr Patten"
"As the author is not present, Question No 12 lapses."
"Question No 13 by (H-0728/00):"
"Subject: Maryam Arubi sentenced to death by stoning for adultery Is the Commission aware that Maryam Arubi (30), found guilty of adultery, was sentenced to death by stoning under the Iranian penal code based on the Islamic sharia?"
"Could EU representatives and representations abroad take this serious human rights situation in Iran into account when the forthcoming UN resolutions are being prepared and adopted, including those being drawn up at this moment for the Millennium Summit?"
"Maryam Ayubi's case is extremely disturbing."
"As the honourable Member knows, Iran's penal code is based on Islamic sharia law."
"The death sentence is widely used."
"The Iranian authorities are well aware of our opposition to the death penalty."
"We have repeated that position on numerous occasions."
"In February 2000, the European Union asked Iran to introduced a moratorium on the death penalty in the wake of death penalties handed down against four student leaders."
"We have no reports as to whether the death sentence on Ms Ayubi has been carried out."
"According to European Union diplomats in Teheran, however, no death sentence by stoning has been carried out in Iran during the last three years."
"The Commission is very concerned at the poor human rights record in Iran in general."
"The Iranian authorities are well aware of the importance we attach to these issues."
"The recent parliamentary election in Iran will we hope offer an opportunity to develop a more productive dialogue on human rights with the Iranian government."
"In doing this we will regularly review the progress of reform in Iran including in the field of human rights."
"In the third committee of the 55th session of the UN General Assembly a resolution on Iran is being prepared and the presidency has informed Member States of meetings with the Special Rapporteur of the Human Rights Commission."
"Consultations are continuing to determine the European Union's position which will of course reflect our deep concerns regarding the situation in Iran."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the Commission for being receptive to my question."
"It seems incredible that today, in the year 2000, in a world which is globally interconnected, women are being sentenced to death for adultery."
"If Maryam did not live in a theocratic regime she would be free, she could enjoy the right to life, but as she lives in Iran, she will be stoned to death."
"The Spanish Prime Minister - Mr Aznar - is to make an official visit to that country in October."
"Perhaps he will shake hands with President Khatami."
"Commissioner, is it not inconsistent for us to form friendships and ties with regimes which violate human rights in this way, to the point of stoning its women to death?"
"This is the thirteenth time under the Khatami regime."
"Is that not inconsistent?"
"You know as well as I do that there are many ways of exerting political influence."
"What will the Commission do in this case?"
"Whatever the allegations made against Ms Ayubi or against anyone else, nothing in my judgment can justify the death penalty, let alone the death penalty by what is called lapidation which is a rather cleaned up way of referring to stoning."
"It has to be said that if we avoided any political contact at all with governments or regimes whose human rights record we profoundly disapproved of, there would be a lot less foreign travel by governments and heads of government."
"It is only by talking to people like President Khatami that one is able to get across our deep human rights concerns."
"My own view is that we should continue to argue our position on human rights with considerable vigour."
"We should do that bilaterally with the Iranian government and, where appropriate, in international fora and we should certainly give every encouragement to those more moderate elements in countries like Iran who believe, as the honourable Member and I do, that human rights are universally valid and not some colonial implant."
"Question No 14 by (H-0745/00):"
"Subject: Burma Aung San Suu Kyi, the opposition leader and Nobel Prize winner, has ended up under what amounts to house arrest, and all contact with outsiders has been forbidden by the country' s military rulers."
"The EU has deplored her treatment and might cancel a planned delegation visit to Rangoon later this year."
"Does the Commission take the view that constructive engagement with the Burmese Junta has any value?"
"In view of what Aung San Suu Kyi continues to endure, will the Commission' s view be that the EU should not attend the EU-ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on 12-13 December 2000?"
"I am delighted to say that I agree with you Mr President, and agree with the honourable Member."
"The record of the Burmese regime remains appalling."
"Like Members of this House and decent civilised people the world over, the Commission deplores the continued violation of human rights by the military regime in Burma, in particular the extra-judicial killings, the widespread imposition of forced labour and forced displacement of local populations, as well as the repression of political opponents and the prevention of the free functioning of legitimate political parties."
"The regime's treatment of the Nobel Laureate, Aung San Suu Kyi, is all of a piece with their treatment of the Burmese people."
"The dignity and courage with which she responds is an inspiration to all of us and a symbol of hope to the people of Burma of a brighter future."
"I join with the honourable Member in expressing my admiration of Aung San Suu Kyi and her fellow members of the NLD."
"Today Aung San Suu Kyi is now under de facto house arrest."
"Even when this is relaxed, as we hope it soon will be, she will be far from free as we are now wearily familiar with the array of wholly unjustified restrictions that the regime maintains on her freedom of movement."
"These restrictions apply sometimes in an even more draconian way to the National League for Democracy."
"The NLD is a legal political party but it is subject to continual harassment and its members are routinely subject to arbitrary arrests."
"I am particularly concerned by reports that party members, waiting with Aung San Suu Kyi at Rangoon station two weeks ago, were attacked and even chloroformed before being evicted from the station premises."
"The Commission remains convinced that a lasting solution to the current situation must be based on agreement between the regime, the democratically elected opposition and the representatives of the ethnic minorities."
"Aung San Suu Kyi has long pressed for such a dialogue."
"We continue to support fully the desire of the General Affairs Council to establish a meaningful political dialogue with Burma in order to express forthrightly the European Union's concerns and to press for change."
"The agenda for the EU-ASEAN ministerial meeting in Vientiane in December is due to include an open discussion on the situation in Burma with our ASEAN partners."
"It offers an opportunity to express our concerns firmly, directly and in detail to the representative of the SPDC."
"The EU's attitude towards that ministerial meeting in Vientiane and indeed, whether it should take place at all, or at what level the EU should be represented at it, will depend on developments in Burma between now and December."
"We will be watching developments closely but we should also be clear that the December meeting is about the EU's political relations with ASEAN as a whole."
"We do not want to permit the generals in Rangoon to be allowed to hold that relationship hostage."
"We are determined not to let the behaviour of the regime in Rangoon prevent us from developing our relations with the other nine members of ASEAN."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner, for that comprehensive answer."
"Can I assume from your answer that the Commission still believes that constructive engagement has any value?"
"After the catalogue of terrible events that you have just given us, it seems to me that constructive engagement has seen its day."
"Do you not think that we should now be exploring other ways of tackling the problem of our relations in Burma?"
"Should we not be looking at investment issues as the French Government are doing?"
"Should we not be challenging the whole tourism issue as the British Government has been doing?"
"If the European Union is not prepared to call for economic sanctions then why not, for instance, suggest that the SPDC should be challenged in the UN and its legitimacy as the Government of Burma challenged in the UN General Assembly?"
"I wonder if you consider that a viable option for the Commission and the Council at this time?"
"As the honourable Member knows, we have taken a number of tough measures in relation to the regime covering issues like visas and assets."
"There is a serious argument about whether one should go further."
"Speaking for myself, though I have always wanted to go to Burma and particularly to see Bagan, I would not dream of going to Burma in the present circumstances and I would advise other people similarly."
"When it comes to the overall question of trade and investment, I will be absolutely candid with the honourable Member about my assessment and about my concern."
"My assessment is that the main reason why there is not more investment in Burma is the policies pursued by the regime there."
"So long as a regime like that is behaving in that way, it would be extraordinary if anybody was to think that it made much sense to invest there."
"My other problem, whenever I think about or talk about sanctions, is a concern about how smart sanctions ever are in practice."
"The living conditions of people in Burma, thanks to the appalling government under which they suffer, are bad enough as it is and I would not like to do anything that made those living conditions worse."
"So I am reluctant to go further on trade or to advise further action on trade or investment."
"As for further declaratory political action, I am always prepared to consider the case for that."
"This is where the whole question of whether or not it is worth engaging in a dialogue is one that has to think about very carefully."
"For example, if we were to send a commission still to Rangoon we would only conceivably consider doing so if there was a guarantee that a delegation could meet with Aung San Suu Kyi, if there was a guarantee that it could meet with her party colleagues, if there was a guarantee that it could also meet with the ethnic minority leaders."
"In those circumstances it may well be that a mission would be justifiable."
"One has to discuss issues like this with the balance of advantage very much in mind as to whether or not it really is going to provide some discernible positive effect if one connects with people who pursue policies which most of the rest of the world regards as being appalling."
"One last point."
"I think it is very important that the ASEAN countries themselves put pressure on Burma."
"Burma is exporting instability to the rest of the region, it is exporting drugs, it is exporting HIV/Aids, and I hope the rest of the region will do what it can to change policies in Rangoon."
"I was very glad that the Commissioner mentioned the ethnic minority groups and the need to open a dialogue with them."
"In practical terms can he tell us what, if anything, the European Union can do about a policy which has been virtually one of genocide over many years towards the Karen, Shan, and other minority groups?"
"Mr President, apart from the political measures that we have already discussed, the most practical thing we can try to do is to provide some humanitarian assistance."
"We have been trying to do that through NGOs."
"There are many living in wretched conditions outside the country in refugee camps and others living in wretched conditions within the country."
"I hope that we will be able to continue to provide humanitarian assistance to them, but obviously what is most important - this would encourage them to return from Bangladesh and from other countries in the region - what is most important is that there should be a political settlement which recognises those rights as well as the rights of those who were democratically elected over ten years ago and whose election was swept aside by the generals."
"Question No 15 by (H-0769/00):"
"Subject: Democracy in Kosovo What is the Commission' s view of the local elections in Kosovo and the development of the various democratic forces in the run-up to them, and what are the region' s medium- and long-term political prospects?"
"Mr President, the Commission fully supports the decision of the UN Secretary General's special representative for Kosovo, Bernard Kouchner, to hold the Kosovo municipal elections on 28 October and the efforts of the UN mission in Kosovo, UNMIK, to organise these elections."
"Within the UN mission, OSCE Pillar III of UNMIK has lead responsibility for the elections."
"EU Member States provide the bulk of the OSCE budget, and the European Commission has also provided EUR 5 million for equipment for the registration process."
"The European Commission has full confidence in the ability of UNMIK to implement the results of the municipal elections in the short and medium term."
"The elections are an important step in involving the people of Kosovo in the running of their own communities."
"Commissioner, first I want to ask about the Commission' s approach to the preparations for these elections, whether there is (a) any support for the parties, (b) training of local politicians and (c) support for the media in connection with the municipal elections?"
"So these are the three points in relation to support."
"Moreover I think that following the Serbian elections, Kosovo must also be given a democratic platform beyond the municipal level. So I would like to ask the Commissioner when he thinks a general election could conceivably be held in Kosovo, since that would surely be necessary in order to create a negotiating partner for Serbia with a view to a future settlement in this region."
"The most important thing for the stability of the region is that what everybody recognises was the election result in Serbia or FRY ten days ago is recognised by Mr Milosevic who, if he was to recognise that election result, would be out on his ear immediately."
"That would have a considerable effect on the whole region."
"As for elections beyond those for the municipalities, we must take one step at a time and ensure that the elections for the municipal administration are properly conducted and involve the people of Kosovo more in managing their own affairs."
"One thing we can all be certain of is that the electoral process in Kosovo will be fair, unlike the electoral process in Serbia."
"The OSCE is responsible within UNMIK for the election organisation and for the sort of issues which the honourable Member referred to."
"It is worth recalling that EU Member States, as OSCE members, pay about 67% of OSCE's budget."
"That does not count any other bilateral donations that they may be making to particular projects."
"We have provided from the Commission EUR 5 million for registration and identity card equipment."
"When I was in Kosovo the other day I was very struck by those who told me that the initial stages of the election campaign had been conducted with considerable professionalism and style."
"They referred to some of the election meetings, for example, that they had gone to."
"Maybe they do not yet have decorous televised debates with Jim Lehrer, with everybody avoiding being rude about one another, but they certainly have started their election campaign with a good deal of brio."
"I hope that will continue, that the election process will produce results in which everybody in Kosovo from every group will be able to feel that they are sharing in the administration of their local communities."
"I would like to dwell a little on the answer given by Mr Patten on the elections in Serbia."
"I happened to be there together with 200 other election observers from 52 countries."
"Regardless of the opinion one may have about the regime there, I have to say that the elections were beyond reproach."
"I can tell you that these elections were conducted democratically, and were better than elections in our own countries, which I have happened to take part in or observe on many occasions."
"The issue, Commissioner, is not whether Mr Milosevic will accept the outcome of the elections."
"The question is whether the leader of the opposition, Mr Kostunica, will accept the results, and whether he will go to a second round next Sunday in order to complete the elections and to give the people of Serbia, the Yugoslavian people, the opportunity to decide on their future, without interference from you and without interference inside Serbia."
"As regards Kosovo, it would have been better had it taken part in these elections, which were simultaneously presidential, parliamentary, regional and municipal elections."
"This is how the European Union could help to remedy the situation, and also by putting an end to the genocidal sanctions which are still in place today."
"I must put the point very gently that I am not sure that many people in Europe would recognise the description of the elections in Serbia which has just been given by the honourable Member."
"Even fewer people in Serbia would recognise the description of the electoral process which has been given."
"The people of Serbia - including, I suspect, Mr Milosevic - know perfectly well who won the elections on the first round, which accounts for the fact that Mr Kostunica not unreasonably has argued that the election process should now be recognised and he should enter into the responsibilities for which the people of Serbia have clearly elected him."
"The sooner that happens and the sooner Serbia can rejoin the European family the better, as far as I am concerned."
"Whether, when that happens the honourable Member will be looking back nostalgically to the days of Mr Milosevic, we will see."
"Most of us believe that Mr Milosevic has played a signal and criminal part in the instability which has wracked the region for the last decades, which has produced countless deaths, misery and impoverishment."
"The sooner he goes the sooner the people of the whole region can look forward to a brighter future which will include rather fairer elections than the ones that Mr Milosevic recognises."
"That concludes Question Time."
"Questions 16 to 44 will be replied to in writing."
"(The sitting was suspended at 7.45 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)"
"Arms trade code of conduct (continuation)"
"The next item is the continuation of the debate on the report (A5­0211/2000) by Mr Titley, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the Code of Conduct on arms exports."
"Mr President, I congratulate Mr Titley on his report, as others have done earlier today."
"As many of us said at the time in 1998, we saw the code of conduct as a very important first step towards having common and responsible arms export policies."
"But we saw it as a beginning and not by any means the end of the process."
"It is important to recognise that, at a time when our European concerns can seem somewhat abstract and rhetorical, controlling weapons is a real way in which Member States' governments, the Commission and Parliament can demonstrate the positive benefits of being able to work together here for a common approach to arms control."
"Now we have to look at how we can further strengthen that code of conduct and in particular make it legally binding."
"We see dealers buying Cold War weapons in Eastern Europe, flying them into African war zones and creating terrible suffering."
"It is important to develop ways in which EU candidate countries can be brought into the information exchange and into consultation mechanisms."
"Candidate countries should also be involved in discussions on the further development and strengthening of the code."
"Secondly, it is important that we reach a common understanding of what the code's criteria actually mean in practice."
"The acid test of the code will be whether it deters undercutting."
"There should be in-depth multilateral consultations before one country can grant a licence that another has rejected."
"In a democratic Europe we have a right to know which countries are selling arms and where."
"Therefore all Member States have to publish arms reports."
"What we would like to see is a consolidated European report which should be published and scrutinised by this Parliament."
"All proposed transactions organised by arms brokers should be subject to the licence approval of national governments and all countries should require all arms broking activities to be licensed."
"Finally, arms fuel conflicts all over the world."
"We urge our governments in Europe to tighten up the controls on the movements of these lethal weapons."
"Mr President, the European defence industry is important, but at least as important is world peace."
"Mr Titley' s report provides a balanced response to this recurring theme."
"It argues in favour of better and stricter controls in the arms trade and greater transparency."
"It is, for example, necessary to develop better marking and tracing techniques for arms, by analogy with car coding."
"This must be done in a harmonised manner and at international level."
"Only in this way can obscure and illegal practices be traced and penalised more easily because - and this appears to me to be the key problem - the discrepancy between the legal and illegal arms trade is becoming increasingly smaller."
"The globalisation of world trade makes arms cheaper, more readily available and more difficult to trace."
"According to Oxfam, fifty-five percent of the total trade in light weapons is illegal."
"Needless to say, a stricter code of conduct only makes sense if the Member States assume their own share of the responsibility."
"In certain air- and seaports, arms control leaves a great deal to be desired."
"In addition, cooperation with candidate countries must be stepped up in this area."
"They may subscribe to the code, but in certain cases act as the hub of the illegal arms trade."
"Some will claim that the code of conduct is not ambitious enough, but it is better to have a code of conduct which is flawed than not to have one at all."
"In any event, future annual reports should contain more complete and transparent information, and the code of conduct should become legally binding in due course."
"This code of conduct is a first step in the direction of greater coherence, but I share the rapporteur' s hope that we will not leave it at that."
"Mr President, the real solution to the whole problem of arms exports and arms production is that we should convert to non-weapons production."
"We are in the 21st century now."
"The technology and expertise that is available should be used for something constructive in society, something that will benefit people rather than something that is going to annihilate and destroy people."
"We should be focusing on the conversion to non-weapons production instead of on how we will compete with the other weapons manufacturing countries around the world."
"Countries with very few resources and very little money are coerced and forced into buying weapons when they should be using that money for social and health problems in their own countries instead of contributing to insecurity in the region and in many cases to the abuse of their own people with these weapons."
"We only have to look at Indonesia and the fact that the European Union could not wait to lift the arms embargo, or to not reinstate it."
"That was deplorable."
"If you look at the other countries in Europe which are now getting involved in the arms industry it is extremely disturbing."
"I come from Ireland, which has a track record of non-weapons production and no involvement in the arms industry."
"Now I find that contracts for arms and components for arms are increasing every year."
"In Northern Ireland, where there is a so-called peace process one of the big companies that has come there and been welcomed with open arms is Raytheon one of the biggest arms manufacturers in the world."
"That is a complete contradiction in terms."
"We should tackle this."
"We should keep the arms industries out."
"That is not where we should be providing jobs."
"We should be providing jobs for people in something that is constructive and positive for society."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the fact that we are debating the code of conduct is a positive step."
"Nonetheless, several legitimate questions arise."
"Is it possible for those who used their weapons in Yugoslavia to murder civilians, destroy buildings and bridges, and cause irreparable destruction to the environment, and those who murdered, and continue to murder, children in Iraq, to be really interested in arms control?"
"Is it possible for those who acknowledge that the European arms industry is important both economically and strategically to be sincere when they say that the external actions of the European Union must be inspired by the values of democracy and the protection of human rights?"
"Rather, as has already been said, they are far more concerned that their weapons will end up in the wrong hands, or that their acts of aggression will accept enemy fire from weapons they have made themselves."
"But the weapons are already in the wrong hands, and we would be deluding ourselves if we believed that procedures such as the code of conduct could put a stop to the acts of aggression and crimes of the new order of things."
"We are convinced that the existence of the code of conduct is not the result of the philanthropic feelings of those who inspired it, but of the intensified resistance of people against the barbarity of imperialism."
"We place our hopes for a world without conflict and weapons in the universal, peaceful and, more generally, popular movement."
"Mr President, special attention deserves to be paid to the European Parliament' s first report on the export of arms since the Member States adopted a Code of Conduct on this matter in 1998."
"If the European Union' s action beyond its borders is to be coherent in the way that the European Parliament never tires of asking that it should be, must not the priority of the arms-exporting States, in a sphere ultra-sensitive to public opinion, be that of simultaneously paying attention to human rights, conflict prevention and the European Union' s external security?"
"Our rapporteur, Mr Titley, is proposing a bold resolution to Parliament."
"He emphasises the entirely inadequate nature of the code of conduct which, it should be remembered, is non-binding."
"The code ought therefore to be made legally binding."
"Controls must be tightened up, and the ultimate use to which exported arms are put must be strictly monitored In a word, the trade in death must stop."
"The supervisory mechanism must above all be extended to the light, small calibre arms used in a great many regional and ethnic conflicts throughout the world, which are often turned against the civil and military personnel of EU countries."
"Finally, Mr Titley proposes cooperating with the United States - and why not, I might add, with Russia and China too? - in order to devise a common approach to conventional arms export controls similar to that established for chemical weapons control."
"The five permanent members of the Security Council, who are supposed to watch over our security, should listen to these proposals and negotiate an arrangement truly worthy of the twenty-first century as quickly as possible."
"Mr President, I fully share the hope and the opinion of Mrs Morgantini and Mr Brie, whose first amendment clearly states that the Union' s aim must not merely be to establish a code of conduct on arms exports, but to work for international disarmament and to end the arms race altogether. This should be the European Union' s fundamental objective."
"Whatever the case, arms exports exist and it is therefore useful and it is a step forward to have a code of conduct on arms exports, which sometimes run counter to the principles that should be the identifying features of the European Union: conflict prevention and the defence of human rights."
"We should therefore take this opportunity to make the code more efficient and to ensure that our young soldiers engaged in peace missions do not have to confront, as they occasionally do, arms exported by the European Union."
"Firstly, given the diversity of policies within the Fifteen Member States of the European Union on controlling arms exports, we should seek to bring about the extension of the binding agreement that was signed by six Member States in July of this year. There should be greater transparency to improve monitoring of this trade, a legally-binding code and, finally, Mr President, a ban on the manufacture, promotion or sale of any equipment designed for torture, cruelty or the death penalty."
"Mr President, I believe that the Titley report and the code of conduct, which we are debating together today, are two initial steps in the right direction. Of course, we must regard them as just a starting-point."
"I would like to make a few general points, which I think may contribute to the debate."
"The arms trade is characterised by the fact that the major purchasers are poor countries, which seem to be able to find the money for arms but not for anything else."
"This should trouble us, since the money comes from smuggling, from the sale of drugs and from a compliant banking system. But the sale of weapons is often made easier by the dealers themselves."
"I believe that it is not enough for us to seek out the end user."
"We must seek out the producers, who must be made to defend themselves and to explain what they have done with their entire weapons production, because usually weapons smuggling starts with the producer and not with any other sector."
"I would like to add that, in addition to the countries of the European Union, all the countries of Central and South-Eastern Europe that have close ties with the EU, Cyprus, Canada and others have contributed to this positive development."
"However, Amendment No 21, which I do not agree with because of the way it is worded, gives me the opportunity to say that Turkey, to which this amendment refers, must send a representative to appear before this House to explain its position to us. This may seem like a different issue, but it is not."
"We cannot take practical decisions based on false information and distorted realities."
"This relates to the specific statement made about Turkey' s behaviour in this regard."
"Anyway, I repeat what I have already said: Parliament cannot waste time debating an issue without a representative from the Turkish Government providing answers to our questions."
"Mr President, I do not know whether to laugh or to recoil in horror at this report."
"If it were adopted, it would show up the European Parliament for what it is and for what it is good for."
"We have a situation in which the sale and manufacture of arms constitute a massive waste for humanity, a situation in which the market for this highly individual trade consists of present, future and potential wars of a kind which tear the world apart, and in which arms expenditure and local wars are an exacerbating factor in the underdevelopment of a large part of the planet, and yet the European Parliament proposes to regulate, and lend moral legitimacy to, a trade that has no use for ethical codes and regulations."
"The report even has the temerity to present arms exports as a means of preventing conflicts, combating poverty and promoting human rights."
"The weapon used to target and kill a Palestinian child in cold blood is no doubt a product of the duly regulated, ethical arms trade, as no doubt were the bombs dropped upon the former Yugoslavia and the fragmentation mines left in Africa."
"Given that armaments are the flagship product of international trade and a huge source of profit for a number of large industrial groups which like to think they are respectable, the only role left to the European Parliament is that of attaching the fig leaf of hypocrisy to the traffic in arms and the loathsome state of affairs which enables it to thrive."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Separating financial control functions"
"The next item is the report (A5-0260/2000) by Mr van Hulten, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the proposal for a Council Regulation amending the Financial Regulation of 21 December 1977 and separating the internal audit function from the ex ante financial control function (Article 24, paragraph 5, of the Financial Regulation) (COM(2000) 341 - C5­0293/2000 - 2000/0135(CNS))."
"Mr President, I am pleased to see so many members of the public here today because, as everyone up there can see, there are very few people down here at this time of night."
"Today's debate marks an important step in the reform process that was initiated by the Prodi Commission just over one year ago."
"It is the very first legislative proposal to be considered by this House as part of the reform package."
"The proposal to separate the internal audit function from the ex ante financial control function flows directly from the recommendations formulated last year by the Committee of Independent Experts, which Parliament endorsed in my report of 19 January of this year."
"This draft legislation is more important to the future of the Commission than its less than thrilling title suggests."
"In its first report the Committee of Independent Experts stated that internal control and internal audit were entirely separate - even conflicting - activities, which do not belong in the same department."
"They reached the conclusion that a priori control and internal auditing are activities which employ completely different techniques and address completely different concerns."
"The arrangement whereby they have been kept together within the same DG should be reviewed."
"Internal auditing must play an effective supporting role in the service of the Commission so that the latter can exercise its responsibilities."
"With that aim in view, the human resources allocated to internal auditing should be greatly increased. In addition, internal auditing must take its place independently."
"The Court of Auditors took the same view in 1997, when it wrote that there was a latent conflict between the power to grant approval - and thus expenditure - and the responsibility for subsequently evaluating the same expenditure in accordance with the criteria for sound financial management."
"The Commission's fast-track proposal seeks to implement the recommendation of the Committee of Independent Experts by creating an internal auditor who operates separately and independently from the financial controller."
"I have no doubt that its implementation will be one of the keys to the success of the reform package announced by Vice-President Kinnock in April."
"I am proud of the fact that the Committee on Budgetary Control has been able to agree unanimously on a draft opinion within a very short period of time."
"Many thanks, therefore, to the other members of the committee for their help and in particular to Mr dell'Alba, whose work as rapporteur for the Committee on Budgets proved invaluable."
"Let us hope that the Council will now take a leaf out of our book and develop the same sense of urgency."
"While our committee welcomes the broad gist of the Commission's proposal, my report presents a number of changes which must be made in order to make the proposed separation of powers work."
"I cannot help but feel that in the race to produce a proposal within the time limit set by the Reform White Paper, the Commission failed to focus properly on the detail."
"The changes proposed by our committee are designed to clarify the Commission's text, to impose certain minimum reporting standards and to tailor the text more closely to the specific circumstances of the different European institutions, all of which are affected by any changes to the Financial Regulation."
"First, the division of responsibilities between the financial controller and the new internal auditor must be clarified."
"It is not enough to state that an internal auditor must be appointed."
"The Financial Regulation must also contain a job description."
"Our committee's amendments seek to draw a clear distinction between the role of the financial controller who remains responsible for ex ante financial control, and the internal auditor, who is responsible for ex post control, and in particular reporting on the quality of management and control systems."
"Secondly, the Commission's proposal would have the effect of making the appointment of an internal auditor compulsory for all institutions."
"While this makes sense for an institution with a large operational budget or those with a relatively large administrative budget, such as the European Parliament and the Council, it does not necessarily make sense for the other small institutions which have a financial control staff of no more than four."
"While these institutions must have the option of appointing an internal auditor, it is sufficient to impose certain minimum audit requirements on the financial controller."
"It must be clear, however, that this distinction can only apply during a transitional period."
"When the recasting of the Financial Regulation is completed, hopefully within one to two years, it must apply fully to all institutions."
"Some members of the committee have argued that the appointment of an internal auditor should be made compulsory for all institutions at this stage."
"Of course such a notion has superficial appeal, but if it leads to the appointment of at least 20 additional officials without a clear prospect of direct efficiency gains it should be resisted."
"It is important, however, that institutions which do not employ an internal auditor take the job of internal audit seriously."
"I was surprised to discover that in at least one of the smaller institutions no audits were carried out by the financial controller despite the clear requirement to do so in the Financial Regulation."
"The third change to the Commission's proposals contained in my report is therefore the spelling out of a minimum reporting requirement."
"One of the problems Parliament has faced in recent years is a lack of standardised information on financial control from the institutions."
"I therefore propose that both the financial controller and the internal auditor should produce annual reports detailing their activities."
"Finally, institutions must learn from each other instead of constantly reinventing the wheel."
"My report proposes that the annual internal audit report produced in one institution should be made available to all other institutions to enable them where appropriate to apply the conclusions arrived at elsewhere to their own management and control systems."
"As I have already reminded the House, this proposal is only the prelude to a full recasting of the Financial Regulation."
"Parliament has not yet received the official text of the proposal but we have been able to see a preliminary version of the text and although I hope the full text will be forwarded to Parliament soon I also understand the Commission's wish to ensure that the text is legally and linguistically watertight."
"It is a very substantial document."
"Some in Parliament have already referred to it as the ""beast"", but it is going to be one of the most important items of legislation before us during the term of this Parliament."
"One of the key changes advocated by the Commission is the abolition of the system of ex ante financial control."
"This proposal does not meet with unanimous approval in this Parliament as, the Commissioner well knows."
"Many Members are concerned that the existing system of financial control will disappear before a new system which now exists only on paper has been proven to work."
"We have therefore asked the Commission to give us an undertaking that during the transitional period which is about to begin the system of centralised ex ante control will be maintained and will not be affected by the introduction of the internal audit function."
"I would ask the Commission to confirm today the undertaking it has already given Parliament in relation to this point."
"I would, however, like to make my personal point of view very clear."
"I welcome the proposed change in principle."
"As the Committee of Independent Experts pointed out last year, most of the irregularities highlighted by the committee stem from decisions approved by the financial controller, that the supposed quality guarantee provided by the approval is a myth and put forward two strong arguments for changing the system."
"First, ex ante checking, whether it be universal or based on sampling, is unlikely to be a cost-effective process."
"The effort put into checking all transactions is clearly disproportionate, while sampling is unlikely to have sufficient deterrent effect."
"The second and fundamental principle is that any retention of ex ante control runs up against the crucial objection that, de facto if not de jure, it displaces responsibility for financial regularity from the person actually managing expenditure to the person approving it."
"Although the Court of Auditors has never explicitly backed abolition of centralised ex ante financial control and we have yet to hear its views on the proposal at present before us, it has raised the possibility of moving to a different system."
"In its 1997 opinion it wrote: ""As for completely abolishing the requirement of prior approval, this would not be acceptable unless it were to be replaced by other procedures that provided at least equivalent safeguards and that could also involve financial officials other than the financial controller."""
"The Commission's challenge will be to convince Parliament that it can create those safeguards."
"Mr President, this evening, we are discussing the tightening of controls on expenditure by the European institutions."
"An important topic, I might add, as Europe has a bad reputation among its electorate in this area. Too much European money disappears to unknown destinations, both at Brussels level and within the Member States."
"The objective of the Commission proposal we are discussing today is to separate the internal audit function from the ex ante financial control function."
"The Van Hulten report is right to define further the discrepancy put forward by the Commission and sets the right tone for exchanging best practices among institutions."
"There might be some reservation with regard to the exception Mr Van Hulten makes in his report for smaller institutions where the appointment of auditors is concerned."
"However, I can understand the pragmatic reasoning behind this idea."
"I too believe that the staffing levels in those institutions are too low to warrant extra manpower."
"I would like to pay special attention to one point in particular, namely the fact that the separation of ex ante control and the audit may not have any bearing on the position of ex ante control."
"After all, these are administrative-official institutions where the option of ex ante control remains an absolute necessity."
"This does not mean that permission must be gained from the financial director for the purchase of every single pencil."
"What it does mean, however, is that an assessment is carried out, according to modern methods on the basis of risk analyses, to find out in what cases of expenditure ex ante control is absolutely essential."
"It also means that ex ante control must still be required when the services request this."
"If this possibility were not to exist, this could lead to a situation in which people no longer dare take decisions."
"Also important is that the ex ante control continues to be carried out independently, admittedly in a decentralised manner, but certainly not under the Director-General of the Directorate-General under scrutiny."
"In summary, independent audits are compulsory but cannot be carried out without modern and efficient ex ante control."
"The two are strictly separated but jointly responsible for the sound supervision of the European institutions' expenditure."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Socialist Group in this House supports Mr van Hulten' s report and therefore also the unanimous decision and proposal from the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"So - nothing against an independent, internal audit service, to which we are giving the green light today with Mr van Hulten' s report!"
"A professional audit is an essential component of modern management in the public and private sphere."
"However, a good audit is not in itself a miracle cure."
"I will not name any names here, but one could give a whole list of companies where renowned auditing firms have attested that all is well, only to find a few weeks or months later that they have collapsed."
"That is why I find it worrying that the Commission is obviously still intending, as before, to introduce the new audit service not as a useful complementary service but as a substitute for the traditional financial control."
"As previous speakers made clear, that means it is on a head-on collision course with a majority in this Parliament, which after all is responsible for scrutinising and assessing the Commission."
"Nor, unfortunately, is the independence of the new audit service beyond all doubt."
"Under the so-called fast-track procedure we are discussing today, the Commission guarantees that independence, but the draft document on the general reform of the Financial Regulation, of which we already have a provisional version, is a step back again in that respect."
"Why, for instance, Commissioner, does the Commission not want to grant the internal auditor the power to initiate proceedings before the European Court of Justice in the event of his independence being impeded?"
"And is the independence of the internal auditor not also impeded if - even before he is appointed - a fait accompli is established by recruiting his staff in advance?"
"We have other examples of where that leads."
"We need only think of OLAF."
"Here too the Commission faced the new director with a fait accompli by simply transferring the entire team of the former UCLAF task force to OLAF, even though it was clear that some of the officials were totally unqualified for the job."
"Result: the new director may come from the outside, but he immediately finds himself ensnared in a system that is already firmly established."
"I hope we will not see a repeat performance here!"
"I can understand the Commission wanting to show that it can produce quick results; but when you talk to Commission officials, you get the sense of a mood of growing depression over the past months, and not only among the so-called losers, for of course some people are bound to lose out in any reform."
"Like several Member States, I think there is still some doubt as to what this general reform will cost at the final count or what benefits it will produce."
"We are still starting out from the simple idea that in the end the purpose of reform is to achieve greater efficiency."
"Today we still do not know whether it will and until we do I would advise this House to take a rather sceptical view of the European Commission' s reform process."
"After all, we owe it to our voters!"
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur."
"I have a feeling that these kinds of topic, and this report, are right up his street, and I would almost go so far as to say that it is not a coincidence that this sitting is so well attended this evening."
"The proposal under discussion is a direct result of the report by the Committee of Independent Experts."
"An internal control service is to be set up."
"Yet, my group feels it is too early at this stage to make a final decision on centralised ex ante control or decentralised ex ante control within the Directorates-General themselves."
"We need to give this some more thought and weigh up the pros and cons very carefully."
"I also believe that, as far as this is concerned, we need the advice from the European Court of Auditors."
"We cannot make a decision until we have the proposal on the new financial regulations, and within the framework of the discussion on these new regulations, a number of aspects will need to be laid down definitively."
"We will be backing all amendments which help clarify the division between financial control and internal audits, as currently proposed."
"We are also in favour of providing information more effectively."
"In our view, there is one note of discord in the report, although this is not the view of the entire group, and that is the question: should internal control only be set up in respect of the Commission, the Council and Parliament, or should it also extend to smaller institutions?"
"In my opinion, it should also apply to smaller institutions."
"This may not be practical - it is indeed the case that only a few people deal with financial control in those institutions, but the principle that the person who gives ex ante approval also self-assesses after the event is wrong."
"These two activities should always remain separate."
"This also applies to smaller institutions even though they have fewer staff."
"If we lay something down for large institutions, the neutrality principle proposed by the Committee of Independent Experts should then apply across the board."
"I am not in favour of making any exceptions to this rule."
"Otherwise, my group is able to support all the rapporteur' s amendments, especially those which stipulate that annual progress reports should be compiled."
"Public opinion is so sensitive in this area that I feel this Parliament should deal with this topic every year, and not only at the discharge stage. It should also deal with the question of how matters can be improved in terms of control, and, in the light of public opinion, we cannot do enough about this."
"Mr President, our group also supports the rapporteur and thanks him for his good work."
"I think the Committee on Budgetary Control held important discussions on this subject and the Commission would certainly be well-advised always to draw on that committee' s authority during the further reform process."
"I believe that constructive cooperation really can make a contribution to improving the reform."
"We believe it is urgently necessary to modernise the management."
"We support the Commission' s steps in that direction."
"But we also have some criticism regarding the question of final control."
"We too believe there is a need to look again at the situation with regard to the independent final control."
"All this has to be brought together again in the form of overall responsibility on the part of the Commission."
"We also support those groups that are already thinking about extending the reforms to the small institutions."
"I believe the administration has to be modernised at European level in all the institutions."
"Parliament certainly still has something to learn too and there is room for improvement in its own procedures. We hope that in general with this process we will manage to restore European public confidence in the European institutions."
"In future, the administration must be able to react more quickly."
"We expect great gains from that."
"In the past we often found that excessively lengthy decision-making processes disappointed the applicants and led to a loss of confidence in the European institutions."
"Modernisation can do much to allay that. But the annual audit report process is also important; it must not be confined to the discharge but must be continuous, in the form of annual reports through which we pinpoint where progress can be made, so as to restore confidence at that level too."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr van Hulten' s report was very broadly endorsed in the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"No doubt the same will happen during the vote here in plenary."
"So, my compliments to Mr van Hulten, but may I also ask the Commission to interpret this endorsement correctly."
"By it we are showing that we continue to support the reforms it has embarked on."
"We want these reforms."
"They must lead to greater transparency and efficiency in the handling of the taxpayers' money and help improve the control systems."
"We need these reforms so that we can manage substantially to speed up the payments to the legitimate recipients of aid and at long last reduce the number of budgeting errors the Court of Auditors criticises every year."
"Setting up an independent - and I emphasise the word independent - audit service is a step in the right direction and responds to Parliament' s requests in its January resolution on the reform of the Commission."
"However, we want this audit to complement rather than replace the traditional financial control."
"That is another thing this House decided in January and confirmed again in the 1998 discharge."
"Unlike the internal audit, the traditional form of financial control checks budgetary processes even before agreements are signed and payments made."
"These ex ante controls are essential because, unlike their national colleagues, the Commission officials have wide discretionary powers in many areas of financial decision-making."
"Independent counter-checks are essential in order to avoid errors."
"If in future these audits are conducted decentrally and in a targeted manner for risk areas, we will also manage to prevent the controls from being too unwieldy."
"It is essential for the financial controllers to remain independent, which means they must not come under the same directors-general they are checking."
"In short, the controllers must not be under the orders of those whom they are checking!"
"Parliament has repeatedly made that clear too."
"Unfortunately, we are still waiting in vain for a signal from the Commission in this respect."
"I would ask the Commission to take the necessary steps together with Parliament!"
"That is in the Commission' s interest too."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating Mr van Hulten on this very thorough report, which has deservedly received the unanimous support of the other members of the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"I wish to say, Commissioner, that this report is only an interim measure, which means that it is the first step towards building a bridge between our present system of control and the system that we would like to achieve through the reform."
"The draft version of the reform of the Financial Regulation is still not available in all languages."
"Furthermore, the White Paper states, quite unnecessarily, that at the end of the interim period, the Council will be able to take into account whether or not the Financial Regulation has been approved."
"The need for legal certainty requires us to bring forward the deadlines for this interim period, which has given rise to many reservations in this Parliament, since it seems that we want to have our cake and eat it; in other words, we want to move ahead, but without giving up the precautions that are currently in place. There are overlaps, which means that responsibility is being diluted."
"Expenditure is doubling but there is no assessment of posts, and so many people are doing the same thing."
"The staff involved are neither being given responsibility nor being motivated. This interim period, as stated in the White Paper presented by the Committee on Budgetary Control, is being extended indefinitely."
"I urge you, Commissioner, to ensure that the interim period ends as soon as possible."
"We know what we want and it is the will of this Parliament, but it is crucial that the transitional period should not be extended beyond what is strictly necessary."
"I therefore feel that, when it comes to drawing up and suggesting the agendas for the Presidencies, you should not ask us to head straight for the objective we wish to achieve, regardless of the time needed to make the changes in the audit."
"There has also been a certain carelessness, of which I am sure the Commissioner will take note, so that we will, as soon as possible, achieve the aim of this reform which we began with the van Hulten report."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission' s great reform project as summarised in the White Paper is primarily aimed at boosting efficiency, i.e., at making a real improvement in financial management, covering in fact every aspect of the budget."
"In future the money is to be spent in a more targeted and effective manner, and of course we also want a better guarantee that the funds are actually spent for the purposes decided by the budgetary authority."
"That is the primary aim and my colleague, Mr Kinnock, has repeatedly set out all the steps we will take in seeking to achieve it, for the reform process consists of a great many measures."
"Let me point out that we have already implemented a large number of these individual steps, be it in relation to workplace definition or to setting up a central financial service in the Budgets Directorate-General, to name only two important ones."
"We are now concerned with amending the Financial Regulation, a process which in fact only began in 1998 when people realised how important it is to conduct not only an ex ante control, but also an internal ex post control, i.e. to have an internal audit service."
"It is only since 1998, with the seventh amendment of the old Financial Regulation, that the independent financial controller has been responsible for both activities."
"Shortly thereafter, the Committee of Independent Experts informed us that this system is not the ideal solution either, because it contains latent conflicts."
"Regardless of whether such conflicts have in fact arisen, there is a potential for conflict."
"That in itself can lead to the question whether the person who gave the go-ahead for expenditure ex ante really is in a position to conduct an accurate ex post control - with the necessary objectivity."
"If even the slightest impression could arise that the controller might no longer be independent, that is reason enough for us to split this function again."
"That is the proposal before us."
"It has also been pointed out that this proposal should, of course, be incorporated in the general revision of the Financial Regulation, but since that revision will take quite a long time - if only because it is such a complex business - the Commission has asked for this single issue to be decided in a fast-track procedure."
"On the question of the Financial Regulation in general, let me say very briefly that I really am very sorry that the revised version is still not available in all the languages."
"I personally will do my utmost to speed things up, so that Parliament finally has this document in all the languages."
"I want to thank both committees - the Committee on Budgetary Control and the Committee on Budgets - for this intensive debate and in particular the rapporteurs, Mr van Hulten and Mr Dell' Alba, who was unable to be here today."
"I really do appreciate the fact that Mr van Hulten made such personal efforts to find a good solution for this change to the Financial Regulation and thus to get this key component of the reform up and running."
"Turning now to the proposed amendments, let me say briefly that the Commission approves the insertion of the extra recital."
"This recital - as also the amendments to Article 2(a) that you proposed - relates to your concern, expressed here, that the financial controller' s function of ex ante control could be weakened during the transitional period."
"That will not be the case, because we have decided - speaking only in terms of posts now - that 80 posts will be available for this ex ante control during the transitional period."
"Let me point out again - since misunderstandings sometimes arise here - that ex ante control is in fact based on a sampling method."
"In the past, 10% of operations were controlled, which, however, accounted for 89% of the total budget."
"That is why this always has to be taken into account too."
"The percentage has now been cut to about 80%, but it is based on a risk assessment."
"That means that we have 100% control for some high-risk areas."
"I can understand the concern that in the absence of this ex ante control - before the money is spent - a deficit could appear."
"Of course the Commission has taken note of Parliament' s concern here."
"So I can only underline again that we have developed a very accurate procedure for checking whether the individual Directorates-General that are to be responsible for this ex ante control in future are in a position to conduct it."
"Only if they are able to do so will we revert to sampling, to selecting, which is often controlled."
"Obviously that is a guarantee that must exist."
"Let me say briefly that the Commission accepts Amendment No 2, which - most importantly - provides for an annual report by the financial controller, to ensure greater transparency."
"In my view, the concern set out in Amendment No 3 is also most important, namely that a differentiated approach should be taken to the different institutions. That means the Commission, the Council and Parliament must under all circumstances separate ex ante control from the independent audit service, while the small institutions, which do indeed have a far, far smaller operational budget, should be free to choose whether to separate them."
"That is, of course, also a question of experience."
"Perhaps it will be concluded at some point that this should be made compulsory; but for the time being it should be left to their discretion."
"I think that will also make it easier to implement this reform."
"I really find this proposal so useful that I am only sorry I did not think of it myself."
"But that also shows how important it is for the Commission and Parliament to interact constructively."
"Let me therefore thank you for your proposals and your opinions."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Schreyer."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Parental control of television broadcasting"
"The next item is the report (A5­0258/2000) by Mrs Angelilli, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee: Study on Parental Control of Television Broadcasting (COM(1999) 371 - C5­0324/1999 - 1999/2210(COS))."
"Mr President, Commissioner Reding, ladies and gentlemen, this report on the possibility of establishing parental control of television broadcasting in order to protect minors tackles an issue which is extremely important and topical, all the more so when we consider the growing number of television programmes on offer and the increasingly wide and increasingly uncontrolled distribution of the Internet."
"To this I would add two further observations: on the one hand, the number of minors with direct access to televisions and computers is constantly increasing and, on the other, there is a worrying increase in the broadcasting of violent images - portraying all possible types of violence - both in television programmes and over the Internet."
"For example, last week in Italy, a racket trafficking paedophile pornography via the Internet was uncovered."
"This discovery was then broadcast on the television network. However, some of the images taken from the sites investigated were also shown, causing great consternation amongst the citizens over the unscrupulous use of such pictures, which are or were certainly inappropriate and harmful for the minors who were watching television at the time."
"To return to the report, as you are aware, the European Commission is preparing a report on the implementation of the 'Television without frontiers' directive, to be published in the next few months."
"Guidelines and considerations on the protection of minors must be included in this report in an appropriate manner."
"I would also like to point out that Article 22, Paragraph 2 of the directive explicitly specifies that all the Member States must take appropriate measures to ensure that broadcasts by television broadcasters do not include any programmes which might impair the physical, mental or moral development of minors, in particular programmes that contain pornography or gratuitous violence."
"Therefore, we are all aware that, in practice, this is certainly not a simple undertaking."
"However, in the light of these considerations, our task is to define the objectives which we can reasonably expect to achieve in order to be able to establish genuine, reliable protection for minors."
"Firstly, we must identify all the technological systems in order to be able to manage in an informed manner the increase in the broadcasting via television or Internet of material which could be considered harmful to the psychological development of minors: I refer, in particular, to filtering systems and programme classification systems."
"However, we must also take into account the introduction of the digital system, which will facilitate the use and broadcasting of such programmes."
"Secondly, we must specify that, in addition to the technological control systems which I have mentioned, a further two elements are essential to prepare the ground, so to speak."
"Firstly, we must promote the development at national level of information and awareness-raising policies targeting families and the world of education in general."
"Secondly, we must encourage producers to take responsibility for the quality of television programmes and broadcasters to take responsibility for broadcasting procedures for these programmes."
"Clearly, we cannot attempt to harmonise legislation on the protection of minors in that, under the principle of subsidiarity, each Member State is sovereign in this matter, but also because cultural and moral concepts and therefore views on these issues differ widely from country to country: for example, there are differences in the definition of who exactly is a minor and the definition of violence, etc."
"However, having said this, if we are to produce more than empty words to protect children we do need to provide clear recommendations on the protection of minors in the media context."
"I would like to summarise the proposals made in this report which I feel are most important and most viable in practical terms: firstly, the setting up of an group of experts consisting of high-level individuals appointed by the Member States to contribute to the definition of common criteria for the protection of minors in the media context; secondly, the establishment by all the operators in the sector of a code of self-regulation in respect of the protection of minors; thirdly, the possibility of promoting filtering systems and making them available for use on both television programmes and the Internet."
"I would like to end by saying that, in accordance with the vote which took place in committee, I cannot accept Amendments Nos 1 and 4 tabled by the liberal group or Amendments Nos 5 and 6 tabled by the Group of the Party of European Socialists, whereas I welcome Amendments Nos 2 and 3 tabled by the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are debating a report that gave rise to much controversy when it was discussed in our committee, all sparked off by the term subsidiarity."
"But at a time when we not only have a surplus of audiovisual offerings but also excess consumption of these offerings, we cannot retreat behind the word subsidiarity. As politicians, we simply have a responsibility, in all the areas in which we act, to protect young people from that surplus."
"At a time when we are witnessing so much violence, hatred and intolerance in all our countries, we surely have to ask ourselves where it is coming from."
"Now, I cannot say: it all comes from television."
"But no doubt much of it can be traced back to the excessive consumption of these television offerings, some of which incite to hatred and intolerance, including intolerance towards other nationalities."
"So we must give serious thought to how we can check this."
"We have a responsibility towards minors!"
"Subsidiarity is to be welcomed. And we want to preserve it; but I beg you, let us not hide behind it."
"It is our job to do something, and indeed we have already tried to introduce this kind of protection of minors with our first ""Television without frontiers"" directive."
"I am thinking now of Mr Hoppenstedt, who fought for the V chip."
"But what can we achieve with that kind of technological barrier?"
"Not much; children usually know how to handle it better than adults, which means we really must think very seriously about how to remedy this situation."
"We do not intend to replace anyone who is doing a good job at national level, but we do want to introduce common criteria and minimum requirements at Community level and propose rules that help people effectively to implement measures to protect minors in their country."
"Of course I also think that we are not in a position, either as politicians or as technicians, to tackle this problem on our own."
"Far more important than all this, of course, is the role of the teachers and the parents, and handling this medium correctly."
"Television and the Internet have to be learned and, of course, also taught."
"So what we are doing today is just a small part of the job that society as a whole has to perform."
"I believe we must bring up our children to enjoy this medium in the right way and to get parents to encourage their children to watch suitable programmes and disregard the less suitable ones."
"That is why we should do both, do our job as politicians and urge society to do its bit."
"Unfortunately, I cannot endorse the Liberals' demands."
"I find them too liberal and not really geared to the interests of the minorities we are considering here."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Pack, how much television violence can a child tolerate?"
"The question is not nearly as easy to answer as some people think."
"And that is one of the findings that has come out of the highly commendable ""Study on Parental Control of Television Broadcasting"" that is the subject of the Commission communication."
"Despite an impressive number of international studies, there is still no clear evidence of any direct link between violence and media consumption."
"Someone may commit a particular act under the influence of an image seen on the media, but that does not mean that the cause of that act is also to be found in the media image."
"That is a most important finding, for we must not overshoot the mark in our legitimate concern for the well-being of children and young people and, in particular, we must not mistake the real causes of the sad reality of youth violence."
"Youth violence is the result of a build-up of several factors, such as experiencing violence in the family, suffering serious social disadvantages, having poor chances for the future because of lack of education, which leads to frustration, which in turn finds its outlet in violence."
"That fits in with the experience I myself have gleaned during ten years of voluntary jury service at a number of juvenile courts."
"Technical measures to control television offerings cannot resolve these problems."
"Fortunately, however, the vast majority of children and young people grow up in an environment free of all these types of problem."
"That is the best youth protection there can possibly be."
"Here we see parents who are committed to passing on their own moral values and life experiences to their children."
"As a rule these are rooted in a particular cultural, social and societal background."
"Systems of parental control must therefore also leave room for individual action on a pluralist basis."
"That is also what the Commission is seeking to do, with reference to the findings of the study."
"Basically, the report we are to vote on here also supports that approach."
"At the same time, of course, no-one disputes that media images can influence moral values."
"But we must make it equally clear that even if we place our confidence in a differentiated supply of filter systems, that in no way takes away from broadcaster responsibility."
"The Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport has therefore called in so many words for the programme and provider responsibility to be established."
"That is and remains mainly the task of Member State legislation, although it certainly does not preclude a consensual agreement on certain basic values in a dialogue with all concerned at European level."
"Finally, the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport also considered it important to urge the Commission to extend all youth protection measures to multimedia offerings of all kinds, since images of violence and other harmful content are certainly no longer confined to conventional television."
"Europe' s children have been surfing the Internet for a long time now, and they are doing so more and more."
"It is more important for the children and their parents to learn to use the media properly than to introduce legal restrictions and electronic filters."
"That is an educational and social task."
"Mr President, Mrs Pack is right."
"We are concerned here with the proximity principle."
"The EU is facing a number of challenges - enlargement towards the East, the intergovernmental conference and the Treaty in Nice."
"These questions are at the top of the agenda."
"The problems relating to democracy and to the EU' s closeness to the people are other crucial issues."
"It is a question of the EU' s political legitimacy in the eyes of the people - and time is rather pressing."
"I believe that solving these problems is a prerequisite for the success of the European project as a whole."
"In his splendid major speech yesterday, President of the Commission Romano Prodi mentioned that, for the sake of the EU' s political legitimacy in the future, it will be necessary to produce a list of those subjects the EU is to deal with and those which the Member States are to deal with. I entirely agree with the President of the Commission about the need to prepare such a list along the lines of a constitution, and I am quite clear about the fact that the subsidiarity principle must be reinforced and that the EU must therefore refrain from making policy on the wide range of areas in which the political problems are not of a cross-border nature."
"The EU should stick to the key political issues."
"In so far as the President of the Commission has had any ideas about which areas belong where, I hope that he shares my view that issues of parental control of children' s television viewing do not belong on the EU' s agenda."
"On behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I have therefore tabled a number of amendments, the purpose of which is to limit the effects of this report in so far as it may be adopted."
"Allow me finally to emphasise that the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is also concerned about the increase in the number of TV programmes containing sex and violence."
"We are also convinced that these programmes are in no way of benefit to viewers and certainly not to children."
"But, all other things being equal, I think it is the job of parents to prevent their children from seeing that sort of thing at home."
"Mr President, our sitting is not being broadcast on television!"
"It would be good for the world to be able to see your imposing figure presiding over the House, and a live television programme broadcast at this time of day showing our alluring Commissioner would be just the thing."
"But there are no television cameras here. We are not being filmed."
"Sadly, as the previous speakers have said, our televisions show scenes of violence and rampant sex, some of which feed money into the State coffers through the infamous advertisements publicising sex chat lines, and yet we, the European Union, ban the sale of toys containing phthalates - and rightly so for they are dangerous if children put them in their mouths."
"It is not enough to leave parents to keep watch over their children: we ban the toys!"
"That is what we do."
"And why, in this case, then, do we not just ban all programmes which are harmful to us all? Oh, no."
"In this case, we leave parents to keep an eye on their children."
"But consider how often are parents at home, how often they have to go out."
"We should also ban mobile phones, the WAP phones we hear so much about, which all the youngsters will soon be carrying about town, putting their lives at risk from traffic because they are watching television programmes and absorbed in material from all the different States of the European Union displayed on their mobile phones."
"I do not, therefore, agree with the words of the Liberal Member who has just spoken."
"I am afraid that the heavens and the satellites will soon be raining signals from all over the Union down on all our States."
"And it is therefore important for a European directive to be adopted to prevent the transmission of harmful material."
"Mr President, Commissioner, our children access and use televised, printed and new media on a daily basis and as a matter of course."
"Information from all over the world and from every sphere of knowledge is delivered to the home in record time and our children can communicate all around the world on an everyday basis."
"At the same time, a huge selection of different entertainment programmes is available to them, usually without any controls."
"Aside from all the positive aspects, we must not disregard the negative side-effects of this ease of access."
"Children are being faced day by day with a growing wave of media brutality and violence, which is simply too much for them, especially because no limits are imposed on these offerings."
"So all those concerned, starting with the children, via the parents, the teachers, the countries, the European Union and, beyond them, the suppliers and producers must come to grips with this question and learn how to deal with these offerings and their effects."
"The public must be made more aware of the effects of this constantly growing wave of violence and support measures must be taken."
"Parents are in particular need of help here, and in the following form: parameters to protect minors in the media context throughout the European Union, the introduction of filter systems available at low cost, legislation to protect minors and assumption of responsibility by the media, enterprises and private and public-sector providers."
"These measures must not be restricted to television but must apply to all accessible media."
"The candidate countries must of course also be integrated in this process even at this stage."
"Since the media market is a matter of supply and demand, i.e., a question of hard business, the providers pay no attention to the consequences of various offerings."
"All that counts is the ratings."
"So we must introduce protective mechanisms that are impossible, or at least not easy, to circumvent."
"Furthermore, I believe programmes that help reduce and overcome violence and aggression should also be on offer. No doubt they could not be marketed so spectacularly and would therefore produce lower ratings, but in return they could make a considerable contribution to damage limitation and to combating the adverse effects."
"We are responsible for ensuring that our young people can shape a future society in which violence and aggression are not presented as hip or cool or as examples to be copied but as deeply reprehensible."
"We have to match up to that responsibility by adopting the appropriate directives and providing the necessary support."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, one Sunday evening a fortnight ago in the South of France, Johan, aged 17, and Robert, aged 16, murdered their childhood friend, Romain, with a firearm and a baseball bat, for no reason or motive, just like on TV."
"Arrested very soon afterwards, they told the police, ""It' s funny, they don' t get caught that easily on the telly."""
"They also said that they wanted to see what it was like to kill someone in real life."
"This occurred not far away and not very long ago."
"It happened on 17 September, close to home, in Europe."
"There is no question of simplifying matters or engaging in generalisations, even if we do have a limited time for speaking in the European Parliament, but there are a great many examples."
"It may be remembered that, a few years ago, Oliver Stone' s film, 'Natural Born Killers' , generated the same controversy by giving rise to copycat crimes by youngsters in the United States and France."
"So when I hear some people stating in debates in committee that there is nothing to prove that television violence in all its forms may have a harmful influence upon children, I am, to put it mildly, surprised."
"We are often alarmed at the television programmes our children watch."
"The on-screen violence of all kinds to which children are subjected, whether it be on television or through the computer, has short-, medium- and long-term consequences."
"The purpose of this report is to help us, as parents and grandparents, to protect minors and to provide us with a tool enabling us to make better, informed choices for our children."
"Just how is that an attack on the principle of subsidiarity?"
"The audiovisual media continue to be the exclusive domain of the Member States."
"At no point does the report suggest potential harmonisation."
"At the very most, the talk is of tentative convergence."
"With regard to the protection of minors in the media context, the definition of common criteria is therefore, of necessity, minimal, given the cultural, moral and social variations in our Member States."
"Establishing minimum criteria is the very least the European Union can do for its children."
"I would also support the rapporteur when she explains the need to make sure that all families are guaranteed the right to an affordable filtering system."
"That being said, these devices must not, and cannot, exonerate broadcasters and educators from fulfilling their responsibilities."
"Children will very quickly learn to manipulate these filtering systems better than ourselves."
"Legislators - and I have almost finished speaking now - cannot regulate everything, but they must occasionally remind everyone what their rights and duties are."
"I believe that that is what we are doing today."
"Mr President, I should like to thank both the European Parliament and its rapporteur for the important work which has been done on this issue."
"I remember that, when the V-chip was discussed in this House, I was among the MEPs who banged their fists on the table and demanded that parents have the opportunity to exercise supervision."
"The Commission shares the view expressed in the report that cooperation between Member States and the Commission is essential if minors are to be better protected over the next few years."
"This does not mean harmonisation."
"No one wants this, no one has talked about it and no one intends to implement it."
"The idea is to draw up minimum rules."
"I am the last person to attack subsidiarity."
"I defend it, because it is essential."
"Subsidiarity must serve some purpose, however, and not act as a screen."
"I am convinced that, when it comes to protecting young people, we are in prime position of responsibility, and I am also convinced that there are ethical considerations more important than the strictly legalistic ones."
"With regard to the introduction of a self-regulation code, it should be noted, particularly in terms of the technical aspects, that, in a number of Member States, broadcasters have already introduced coding systems for television sets to enable parents to cut off the power."
"The Commission is also consulting the Digital Videobroadcasting Group, or DVB, about the technical aspects of systems for protecting minors, particularly digital filters."
"Like Parliament, the Commission also thinks that each family ought to have access to these filtering devices at affordable prices."
"As you know, however, no effective systems are yet to be found where television is concerned."
"However, filters are available to the public for use with the Internet, and this should speed up the development of similar filters for television, especially digital ones."
"In short, when more programmes are put on the market, parents will have the technical means of preventing their children from watching certain broadcasts."
"Let us not, however, forget the ethical and legal aspects."
"The problem is certainly not to be solved at the touch of a button or just by pulling a plug."
"As has been said in this House, journalists, programme makers and broadcasters are also responsible."
"I should like to remind you that the Commission has adopted an action plan designed to promote safer Internet use and also to make users more aware of the problem."
"I think too that, even if this public awareness campaign relates to the Internet, it will also have a knock-on effect on television programmes."
"It is true, as Parliament acknowledges, that the Member States do not share the same ideas about what minors should or should not be permitted to see."
"The report considers there to be good reason for aiming at progressive convergence, even if it is premature at this stage to define the criteria involved in such convergence."
"Although I do not think it is feasible to adopt uniform criteria, I think it is our responsibility to arrive at some classification of the contents of television programmes, while leaving parents the option of deciding whether the programmes may or may not be watched by minors."
"I should also like to say something in response to the contents of a national television channel which showed offensive pictures on the pretext of providing information."
"Let me tell you that, in journalism, there has always been an ethical code and a system of self-regulation for applying this code, and this has operated quite well, I have to say."
"There are always exceptions, when things go wrong, but exceptions are precisely what they are and all the more shocking for being so."
"In my opinion, the profession has to be made more responsible so that it takes responsibility itself for the content of broadcasts and for what will and will not be shown."
"I myself was a professional journalist for twenty years."
"I will tell you something: journalists cannot write and show everything they know about or are aware of, or divulge all the information they have, because it may do a lot of harm to third parties."
"In its report, Parliament also invites the Commission to encourage the creation of a think tank with the job of drawing up a memorandum containing the basic legal principles applied in the Member States for the purpose of protecting minors in the media context."
"The Commission will respond to this invitation because, as you know, we are due to table the 'Television without frontiers' directive again in 2002, with a view to testing the water."
"I think it will be very important, in that context, to launch a broad debate on our society' s responsibility where the media are concerned."
"When I say society' s responsibility, I am thinking not only of European governments but also of political responsibility at national level, the responsibility of media practitioners and the responsibility of parents and of society in general."
"I am also very aware of the remarks made about education, about training in the interpretation of images and about making younger people more aware of the need to approach the media in a critical frame of mind and not to watch any old thing, at any time and in any way."
"I would also say that the industry has already devised an international system of self-regulation called the Internet Content Rating Association, in which the Commission participates."
"Consideration could be given to encouraging the creation of a similar initiative covering audiovisual content."
"Your thoughts on this matter would be welcome, as they would be in the context of 'television without frontiers' ."
"Where, finally, the protection of minors is concerned, I should like to point out that there is a Council Recommendation of 24 September on promoting national frameworks designed to ensure comparable and effective levels of protection of minors and of human dignity."
"There are plans for the Commission to prepare a report for Parliament and the Council on the measures taken by the Member States to apply this recommendation."
"The objective of such a study will be to evaluate the effectiveness of the approach proposed, an approach based on the principles of self-regulation, and my officials have just set the work in motion and have sent a questionnaire out to the Member States."
"One thing is certain, I think."
"The problem will not be solved through technical, technological or other such measures. It is society as a whole which has to assume responsibility."
"We are in the process of assuming our own share of responsibility."
"Let others assume theirs and, believe me, I shall call for everyone to play their part in applying a solution."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Reding."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Education and training: mobility within the Community"
"The next item is the report (A5­0255/2000) by Mr Robert J. E. Evans, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the proposal for a recommendation of the European Parliament and of the Council on mobility within the Community for students, persons undergoing training, young volunteers, teachers and trainers (COM(1999) 708 - C5­0052/2000 - 2000/0021(COD))."
"Mr President, this report covers a very important issue and one that has been prominent in my post bag for nearly six years."
"If we are serious about the European ideal, we have to be able to ensure that it is easily sold to those who are convinced about the concept and those who are not."
"I was a teacher for 16 years and now, as an MEP, I have spent a lot of time in schools, colleges, and at conferences arguing for just this sort of action."
"It links in with many positive initiatives over the last few years with which we are all familiar - Socrates, Youth for Europe, Leonardo and so on. Young people in general are very positive about the European Union."
"They do not have the problems often associated with other age groups."
"They are used to multicultural and diverse communities."
"But confronted, as they so often are, by factors that work against the European ideal, they rely on their own experiences."
"We have to ensure that the experiences of young people - students and others in the educational world - are positive."
"Nothing will be more damaging to their developing views, than if a report such as this fails to make progress or if it fails to deliver greater mobility or if it fails to at least start to demolish the barriers that confront educational mobility today."
"Back to the beginning."
"When it first presented its report, the Commission accepted that its recommendation was less than satisfactory."
"I understand that it even considered withdrawing it."
"Since then, a great deal of work by my own staff, by Parliament's staff and indeed by the Commission's own staff, to all of whom I pay warm tribute, has presented us with what I thought, until today, was perhaps a worthy if not perfect report, certainly one that was satisfactory and would go some way to achieving my aims."
"Today, and at the eleventh hour, the Commission have advised me, albeit indirectly, of its difficulties."
"Firstly, I understand that the Commission now believes that all references to researchers to be outside the legal base as provided for under Articles 149 and 150."
"I ask the question: why is this information only available on the 4 October?"
"Why has someone waited until now to come up with this?"
"Was this legal advice not known when on numerous occasions I discussed its inclusion with members of the Commission staff?"
"Indeed, when Mr Mantovani and I and the whole Social Affairs Committee were encouraged to progress the case, why was I told that the researchers would be the subject of a later Commission recommendation if there is no legal base for it?"
"And why in 1996 did the Commission publish a Green Paper - Education, Training and Research - if there was no legal base for it?"
"Was that, I ask, not a waste of Commission and Parliament time and indeed money, then and now."
"No-one has more respect than I for Mrs Reding and her Commission staff so I am sure that tonight in her response she will be able to address the particular points that I raise and that she will not present a prepared statement."
"I will now turn to some of the particulars which I addressed in the report - details which were defined and honed in response to discussions with a huge number of parties, from students to ministers, teaching unions to government, representatives from several, if not all, the countries."
"The report seeks to remove legal and administrative, and indeed cultural, barriers to mobility."
"It promotes the wider use of a variety of financial means of assistance."
"It tries to promote an EU-wide area of qualifications and specifically to make the lot of third-country nationals easier regarding mobility."
"Specifically my report replaces the worthy international generalisations by, in effect, repatriating the decisions to the Member States."
"I tried to make sure that the report only covers areas over which Parliament and the Commission has jurisdiction."
"I have endeavoured to ensure the recommendations with any fiscal implication are limited to a bare minimum."
"As with any Parliament report, experience has shown that there is little chance of anything happening, or at best little possibility of uniformity across Europe, if there is no monitoring."
"For reasons which I understand, but which will have the effect of neutering the whole report, the Commission will, I am led to believe, be rejecting Amendments Nos 46 to 51."
"Indeed, they have already press-released it to the effect that they are going to do so."
"Commissioner, I say to you that without an action plan, without any indicators to see who is doing what, and how well they are doing, without assessment of progress, there will be so many discrepancies, so many complaints, so many letters in your post bag, so many students and teachers knocking at your door, and indeed so many MEPs lobbying you, that I suggest you will wish, even allowing for the constraints under which you work, that you had accepted the amendments I proposed and which I hope Parliament will accept."
"In conclusion, I was both pleased and flattered when this report was referred to by President Chirac in his speech to Parliament some weeks ago."
"If the French Presidency are now serious, then I suggest that Council will have to work very hard to salvage both their and the Commission's reputation as a matter of urgency for I suggest the failure to endorse this report in its entirety will send all the wrong, and very confusing, messages to important groups of our society."
"(IT) Mr President, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on this proposal for a recommendation, I would like to express my satisfaction at the end document, which was the result of a joint effort by Mr Evans, Mrs Martens and myself. I would especially like to thank Mr Evans and Mr Martens for their fruitful cooperation."
"During the nineties the Commission produced several recommendations on the issue but no practical solutions were found."
"I therefore hope that, this time, a solution will be found once and for all, so that mobility throughout the European Union - of students, young persons undergoing training, young volunteers, teachers and trainers - will become one of the crowning glories of the European Union, putting paid to that paradox whereby it is easier for goods, capital or services to move within the European Union than it is for the citizens themselves."
"The problems to be resolved vary from country to country: for example, regulations differ on matters of social security, study grants, right of residence and taxation, and there is no system for the mutual recognition of qualifications and work placements."
"Then there is a dearth of information on opportunities for mobility and there is the barrier of the lack of knowledge of languages."
"I would draw attention, out of the amendments tabled, to the inclusion in this recommendation of the specific category of researchers, since this category was originally included in the Green Paper."
"I am firmly of the opinion that, rising above the problems of organisation and coordination, which cannot be avoided for they are a result of the reorganisation of the directorates-general of the Commission, it is vital to support and foster research in Europe, for research is a fundamental vector for the growth, international competitiveness and development of the Member States, particularly if we compare the situation with that of the United States and consider the negative implications of mobility problems which are driving young researchers to go to the United States rather than attempt to move within the European Union."
"This is why the category of researchers should be included, Mr Evans."
"I therefore call upon the Member States to make every endeavour, alongside the Commission, to resolve the bureaucratic and other problems of mobility, and to set specific goals in the form of a two-yearly action plan and a final report."
"This is the very minimum necessary if we are to achieve that area of freedom which is the basic right of every European citizen."
"Mr President, in my capacity as draftsperson of the Committee on Petitions, I should like to congratulate Mr Evans on his excellent report on the mobility of students, researchers and persons undergoing training and to thank him for having taken the concerns of our committee into account."
"Of all the petitions we receive, many relate either to mobility within the European Union, and in particular that of students, researchers and persons undergoing training, or to the recognition of qualifications."
"The difficulties encountered by the petitioners are due, on the one hand, to the lack, or the complexity, of legal texts and, on the other hand, to governments' failure to respond to the seriousness of these problems."
"The Commission needs to draw up a list of the problems encountered by European citizens, particularly with regard to the issues of freedom of residence and freedom of establishment and, most especially, with regard to their right to work, study and obtain recognition of their qualifications in other Member States."
"This list must be accompanied by practical measures such as the establishment of objectives to be achieved by the Member States and the obligation on the latter to prepare periodic reports on the progress achieved."
"Student mobility would be improved if the periods of study completed in each Member State, together with the qualifications and certificates acquired, were to be fully recognised within the European Union."
"The European Commission should take ambitious initiatives designed, in the short term, to provide for the reciprocal recognition of academic qualifications between Member States."
"By responding to the problems of daily life, this European Parliament and Council Recommendation should make it possible to bring Europe closer to its citizens, in particular its youngest citizens who should be the forces involved in creating a European identity."
"Mr President, the 1996 Green Paper on mobility lists the obstacles to mobility."
"Four years down the line, we have to recognise that very little has been done."
"There are still major obstacles, for example in the field of social security, health cover, extending residence permits, taxation, etc."
"I lament the fact that, as a consequence, young people are prevented from gaining experience - study, work or other experience - in another Member State."
"It is about time that Europe turned its attention once more to the sound implementation of programmes such as Socrates and Youth for Europe."
"It is thanks to these programmes that young people can come into contact with the thinking, the language and the culture of other countries."
"This is why these programmes which promote student mobility are so crucially important."
"After all, the experiences which these people gather contribute to a broader understanding of European cultures, they enhance professional experience and the command of languages, encourage familiarity with the European patrimony and increase the chances of finding employment."
"This is why thresholds need to be lowered on behalf of students, volunteers, university teachers and researchers - yes, I include researchers in this as well."
"In line with the 1996 Green Paper on mobility, this group should also benefit from the recommendations in this report."
"I believe that the European Commission was wrong to exclude them."
"As is apparent from the report by the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, there are still many thresholds, and during my work visits in my country, I hear many complaints every time, not only about the obstacles to mobility, but also about the implementation level, the red-tape involved in applications, the number of bodies which carry out the same inspections and late payments."
"Some outstanding payments date back as far as 1996."
"The French Presidency has prioritised improved mobility for this target group."
"Mr Evans has done sterling work and thanks to sound cooperation, the Culture Committee approved the report on mobility unanimously last month."
"This is a sign that the continuous obstacles to mobility which stand in the way of students, volunteers, university teachers and researchers should be swiftly removed."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, promoting the mobility of students, trainers and teachers is being seen as an ever more important part of the European strategy."
"It was given attention, for example, in Lisbon last March at the summit there, in which matters of employment, social participation and the information society were focused on."
"In the Lisbon conclusions, mobility was recognised as an essential element in the information society and in the promotion of lifelong training."
"Robert J. Evans' s report therefore discusses an extremely important issue."
"The greatest credit goes to the rapporteur for an approach based on the point of view of the public and the practical problems involved."
"Mobility is not to be promoted by noble objectives but by removing the day-to-day obstacles."
"I hope that the main amendments adopted by the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport will be received positively by the Council, as they deserve to be, and that legislation is speedily brought into effect."
"When it comes to student and teacher mobility, experience shows that the real problems of mobility are not found so much in the area of educational administration, but with the social, tax and immigration authorities."
"Problems with regard to retaining social security benefits, transferring benefits, and taxation still hamper mobility within the Union."
"Questions of responsibility have also been raised, especially when it is a matter of on-the-job learning."
"Regarding our own problems in the education sector, we cannot steer away from the difficulties there are in approving study credits."
"Students are still pretty much dependent on the good will of the lecturers."
"If that is missing, study abroad might unduly extend the actual length of time a person studies."
"I am very glad that the rapporteur pays attention in his report to the opportunities for nationals of countries applying for membership to be included in the recommendations on mobility."
"The most serious problems at present concern those coming from non-member countries."
"Improving their status will be an effective way of building a common Europe."
"What is also important in this report is the attention given to the equal treatment of those who are the most disadvantaged, for example, the disabled."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking Mr Evans and Mr Mantovani for their work."
"This is an important report, although it does leave major question marks and give rise to serious doubts in certain areas."
"This report is a natural full stop to the conclusions reached in the Green Paper, which highlighted the remaining barriers to mobility, mobility which is not, as Mr Mantovani said, simply a question of goods and capital but must indeed be mobility of persons, with all the spiritual, human and cultural wealth which they can take to the different countries and thereby enrich them."
"Our group - the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party - has tabled amendments which include the category of researchers in the recommendation: we are therefore in favour of including researchers."
"Moreover, we would stress that, although the proposal is certainly a firm step in the right direction, in our opinion, there are certain gaps which will require us, or rather the Commission, to work on eliminating all the remaining barriers of an administrative, legal, linguistic and cultural, but also financial nature."
"At the same time, it needs to produce active measures firmly promoting the teaching of at least two Community languages in every country and developing and supporting the cultural and linguistic education of our young - and not-so-young - citizens. This should include the use of new methods and new technologies."
"We also agree that there is a need to give all those who participate in this mobility system clear, comprehensive information regarding their social security rights. In addition, we agree that direct and indirect taxes such as the tax payable for renewal of residence permits should be abolished immediately."
"Certainly, as Liberal Democrats, we agree that this mobility system should be extended to include the candidate countries as soon as possible, and we would like to express our regret at the continuing delay in the mutual recognition of qualifications, an issue with which Commissioner Reding is quite familiar and which we know to be very important to her."
"Commissioner, we call upon you to act incisively within the Commission on this unresolved matter, so that, in full respect for national powers and sovereignty, we will indeed be able to talk of a Europe of peoples, a Europe of citizens, but also a Europe of culture."
"For if Europe is not a Europe of culture, it will never be Europe!"
"Mr President, I would like to join my colleagues in thanking the rapporteur for the tremendous work which he has done on this report and also to congratulate the members of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Committee on Petitions who have drafted opinions."
"This is a very sensitive subject because, as my colleagues have already pointed out to the Commission and Council, a lot of hindrances are put in the way of students, lecturers, people undergoing training and volunteers with regard to mobility within the Community."
"Freedom of movement for persons, goods, services and capital is enshrined in our treaties and yet young people, who are the future of the European Union and perhaps have fewer prejudices than some of us adults are denied opportunities because of the bureaucratic barriers put in their way."
"The SOCRATES Programme was mentioned as one example of this."
"A survey carried out by the Commission in 1998 on the ERASMUS Programme, covering 10,000 students, showed that less than 50% of the available places were actually taken up on a full-time basis and that over 60% of the students who took those courses encountered financial difficulties."
"What this highlighted was that unless some serious remedial action is taken on the financing of the ERASMUS Programme and the kind of support that is made available to students, there will be inequality between those whose parents can afford to send them and those whose parents cannot."
"I spoke on this issue in this House in the last session, but I would once again urge EU education ministers to grasp the nettle and make sure that proper initiatives and proper funding are put in place."
"I would also call on the Commissioner to ensure that in the next round of proper funding is available for the ERASMUS Programme."
"One point I would like to raise finally while we are on the subject of mobility is the ongoing case in one of the Member States of the European Union with which I have been involved for the last five years, namely the question of foreign lecturers in Italy."
"Despite several opinions from the courts, recommendations from Commissioners and actions at Council level, nothing has been done to regulate the position of these foreign lecturers whose status was reduced by the Italian education minister."
"Action needs to be taken to ensure that those inequalities do not continue."
"I would commend this report to the House and recommend support for the amendments put forward by Mr Evans."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I wish, informally but nonetheless from the heart, to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Evans and Mrs Martens, as well as the draftspersons of the opinion, because to my mind, these issues have not been addressed so directly, sincerely and authentically for a very long time."
"I believe this to be political honesty, even if it is not pleasant to hear."
"We have spoken many times about mobility and the shortcomings that exist in its regard."
"I would say that in Europe we are currently living in a climate of considerable moral fraud."
"Fraud, not necessarily in the eyes of the law, but certainly moral fraud, because we are sending students to other countries and then we give no recognition to their studies and nor do we give them certificates."
"This is moral fraud, in which we are willing partners."
"What can we do?"
"I think that we can do a great deal."
"As the Commission and Parliament, we can demand compliance from programmes that are funded by the Commission."
"We cannot allow universities not to recognise qualifications."
"Europe' s universities, in France, Spain and elsewhere, are autonomous and have the power to decide whether they will recognise diplomas and the subjects that have been studied."
"Universities that do not comply, however, must forfeit their subsidies."
"There must be clear checks and monitoring, even if only of a sample, and above all, a web site, where students can register their complaints."
"This is not expensive at all."
"We are not only protecting the rights of young people, since the same applies to researchers."
"It is pointless to talk about lifelong learning if we ignore researchers."
"Mrs Reding, Mr Busquin and his Directorate-General are not doing anything about the training of researchers, nor about the recognition of postgraduate qualifications or about doctors' training."
"This has today created a void in the European Union and unless the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport addresses the problem, Europe will probably not be in a position to compete in the media, in the cinema or in research in information technology."
"Our human resources are our only future in a world in which there is no more valuable commodity than knowledge."
"We cannot allow this field to be taken away from us, even if this makes things uncomfortable in terms of the European Parliament working closely with the Commission."
"I think we should ask Mr Prodi to do everything possible to ensure that young people studying abroad do not feel like orphans and that researchers are not left without support, at the mercy of what their rectors decide."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is our declared aim to make Europe into the most competitive and dynamic knowledge society in the world, an economic area that is able to achieve sustained economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion."
"So we must make every effort to close the existing gap between words on paper and the actual, practical difficulties the European citizen still encounters every day."
"Here, the European dimension in the field of education and training plays an important role."
"We must, therefore, ensure that the freedoms laid down in the Treaty such as the right of residence and free movement, do not remain empty words."
"Transnational mobility is not just an occupational and economic requirement but calls for a forward-looking basic approach."
"Precisely for that reason I am still very surprised to see how many obstacles remain to greater mobility and flexibility in Europe."
"We therefore call for research workers to be included in the scope of the recommendations."
"We call for measures to dismantle the existing obstacles and to ensure that persons undergoing training can enjoy social security and other benefits, to prevent the risk of double taxation, to promote the learning of at least two Community languages and to develop means of financial assistance."
"Finally, we call for measures to create greater transparency in the recognition of qualifications, periods of study and training."
"We call on the Commission to play a more active role in promoting the mutual recognition of training certificates, which advance mobility and flexibility, so that we really can achieve our declared aims."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, may I first of all thank the rapporteur and also all those, in the relevant committee and in this Chamber, who have committed themselves to making mobility a reality."
"Believe me, I know what you are saying, and a lot more besides."
"It is through practical action and not through green or white papers or, for that matter, black or red ones, that problems are solved."
"And what we have here is practical action."
"Believe me, it is not easy."
"Do not imagine that, by setting a recommendation down on paper, there will be cheers of joy from all the Member States."
"No, a number of Member States will have to be forced to eliminate obstacles of a kind which may seem ridiculous."
"However, there are still definitely barriers to the removal of these obstacles, and I have not finished persuading all the Member States of the fact, but I am still optimistic."
"I am an optimist for two reasons."
"First of all because, as a European Commissioner, if I want to make progress, I cannot allow myself to be pessimistic; and secondly because, in spite of all the problems of which I am aware, hundreds of thousands of students and hundreds and thousands of parents and grandparents thank me when I meet them and tell me that the experience they were able to have was terrific."
"Go into the street and ask young, and not so young, people which European programmes they have heard of, and they will tell you - Socrates and Erasmus."
"So, in spite of the persistent problems, of which I am aware, these programmes are of positive value and contribute something to the people of Europe."
"I agree with you that the obstacles which still exist need to be removed."
"I would thank you for your cooperation on this matter."
"It is easy to talk in a speech about removing obstacles, but less easy to remove them in practice."
"What is more, most of the problems of which we are aware do not stem from the Commission but from the Member States and even the regions."
"What, then, is the state of play regarding the financial problems?"
"Mrs Pack, you are witness to the fact that the Commission and Parliament had agreed between themselves to request more money because they knew very well that the Erasmus grants were not enough and that only those who received help from their parents or grandparents or who worked during their Erasmus studies had the opportunity of benefiting from these Erasmus grants."
"All right, what was given was given."
"You have to make do. That is why I have asked the ministers, since they have not given me any more money, to ensure that supplements to the Erasmus grants are offered in their countries, and this is something we are discussing."
"Last Saturday, I was in Paris for a Council of Ministers for Education, exclusively on the issue of mobility."
"Things are moving, and not just in the abstract."
"The rapporteur quoted President Chirac' s words on mobility."
"The French Presidency wishes to make mobility one of the key issues of its term of office, and will go on to do just that."
"In November, the Ministers of Education are going to take a decision not only on this recommendation, which is a small step in the right direction, but also on an action plan to be implemented in order to facilitate mobility and turn this into a reality."
"At the Council meeting in Nice, mobility will be one of the items for discussion."
"So you see, things are moving."
"Not everything needs to be seen in negative terms, because there is a lot of progress."
"I would say to you, however, that, for things to continue to move, some pressure needs to be exerted."
"So, help me to apply some pressure. You are doing so today and will do so tomorrow."
"I should like to thank you right now for doing this."
"I should also like to say that the French Presidency is not the only one to have made progress in this area."
"The Portuguese Presidency did a marvellous and very useful job of preparing the ground, and I should like to pay tribute to both Presidencies for the way they wish to make progress."
"The Lisbon Summit was something of a point of departure for a long journey which we are only just beginning."
"Our Heads of State and of Government and the regional and national governments have realised that education has a role to play if we want to develop the economic and social sides of the European Union."
"The creation of a Europe of knowledge is therefore a very important step in the right direction, but we still have a very long way to go. I have no hesitation in telling you that we shall do more than just talk."
"We shall take practical steps, but it cannot happen overnight. We have to keep chipping persistently away at the issue and never give up applying the pressure."
"However, we shall get there."
"With regard to the amendments, the following may be accepted: 4, 5, 11, 12, 16 to 18, 25 to 27, 28, 30, 31, 33 to 38, 40, 41, 44, 52, 53, 54 and 55."
"I am also able to accept the following amendments, as reworded: 7, 9, 13, 20, 23, 29, 32, 42, 52 and 57 on the basis of the English text."
"And, finally, I am able to retain the following amendments in part: 6, 10, 15, 19, 21, 22, 24 and 42."
"That is almost all of them."
"Let us now turn to the amendments which present problems."
"These concern researchers."
"Ever since the beginning, it has been more or less clear that researchers could not be part of the recommendation."
"However, as is its proper role, Parliament has exerted pressure for researchers to be included in the text nonetheless."
"The Commission has responded to Parliament, and these problems were tackled in a communication adopted on 18 January on the European Research Area and, in the follow-up to this communication, Commissioner Busquin will be presenting a communication on the mobility of researchers."
"There will therefore be a specific communication on this subject, and I think it is partly thanks to the pressure exerted by Parliament that this is going to happen."
"Allow me now to return to Amendments Nos 46 to 51 which, with a view to ensuring that the recommendation is followed up, request the Member States and the Commission to put in place a process which might be considered similar to the Luxembourg process in the case of employment."
"I agree with the objective, but there is an important reason why the Commission has adopted the position it has on these amendments, and that is because, by accepting them as they stand and in their present proposed wording, the same problem would arise as when we speak about the action plan which the ministers and the Commission want to have finished drafting by November."
"Considerable new human resources, which do not exist at present, would be necessary."
"I did not want to leave the matter as it stands."
"That is why I spoke about it this morning at the meeting of the Commission, and the conclusion drawn by the Commissioners was clear."
"Following the communication of the 26 July on matching human resources to the institution' s tasks, the Commission cannot accept new tasks unless the budgetary authority allocates it the necessary resources for carrying these out."
"This is a position of principle, to be applied generally and not only to what is of concern to us now."
"It is a collegiate position adopted by the Commission, in view of the decisions taken, in view of the peer group and in view of staffing problems."
"From now on, the Commission will give the same answer on all topics."
"The budgetary authority will therefore have to ensure that we have the material resources for taking action."
"That being said, I should nonetheless like to remind you that the Commission already has a monitoring system which will be placed within the framework of the new open method of coordination, recommended by the Lisbon European Council."
"This open method of cooperation is based upon the assumption that European guidelines will be established, the implementation of which it will be possible to adapt in relation to regional and national diversity."
"It will also, however, enable monitoring to be carried out periodically so that the Member States can progressively develop their own strategies where mobility is concerned."
"I think, Mr Mantovani, that, over and above the questions of principle that bind me to the Commission' s collegiate decision, there is an avenue to be explored here, and it might perhaps be necessary to look for alternatives in this area."
"In any case, I am happy to have a discussion with you to see what can be done in this respect."
"Finally, the Commission cannot adopt Amendments Nos 8 and 58, the former because the Lisbon conclusions, which have already been listed in recital 11, encourage the Member States to take the necessary measures to promote mobility, and I can assure you that the Member States are proceeding along the right lines."
"They demonstrated as much last Saturday in Paris when, for a whole afternoon, they discussed the issue in depth and made commitments to mobility."
"A good start has been made."
"Finally, Amendment No 58 cannot be adopted, quite simply because it duplicates Amendment No 37 proposed by Parliament on the same subject."
"I think we are on the right road to reaching an agreement on the content, without necessarily having to resort to a second reading. This would allow the Education Council to adopt a text on 9 November enabling the French Presidency to present the Nice European Council with the 'mobility' package requested by the Heads of State and Government in the conclusions to the Lisbon Council."
"We all want the same thing."
"We want there to be real progress on this issue in the real conditions in our regions and our Member States."
"I should also like to do much more when it comes to the recognition of qualifications."
"At the moment, and as the Treaties at present stand, it is a national responsibility, which is not to say that I am not doing anything."
"I am in constant discussion with ministers."
"I also know that account has to be taken of the autonomy and independence of universities but, by means of our network systems, we have brought the universities closer together, and they engage ever more frequently in joint ventures and recognise students from other universities and studies completed in those universities."
"Things are moving slowly, and that is frustrating because the objective can be seen there before us."
"It is a fine objective, and we should like matters to move more quickly."
"In politics, things do not, unfortunately, always move as quickly as one would wish."
"If, however, the pressure is kept up, we shall get there."
"So, help me to do just that."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Reding."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"(The sitting was closed at 11.12 p.m.)"
"Address by Mr Ciampi, President of the Italian Republic"
"Mr President, it is my great honour to welcome you to the European Parliament."
"I hope I will be forgiven for mentioning the excellent memories that I cherish of my official visit to Italy last March, the especially warm welcome I received, that you gave me, Mr President, and the depth and clarity of your approach to Europe."
"Your visit today comes at what is a crucial time for European integration."
"We do of course have good cause for rejoicing in this regard, and we were talking about this a few seconds ago, following the adoption of the Charter of Fundamental Rights last Monday by the groups that make up the Convention."
"We are conscious, Mr President, that you have promoted this Charter right from the outset."
"You even believed in this project at a time when it was, for some, more a utopian dream than a tangible prospect."
"On many occasions, you have reiterated your desire for the Charter to be granted genuine legal effect."
"Even if the future of this text is now in the hands of the European Councils at Biarritz and then at Nice, this House looks forward to the results of these negotiations with a sense of optimism."
"This optimism has been heightened in recent days by the numerous interventions that we have heard from the Member States."
"But now is also the beginning of a key stage for the Intergovernmental Conference."
"At Leipzig on 6 July, you issued a call for a vision for the future of Europe, based on a draft constitution."
"We would like to join with President Chirac and Minister Fischer in saying how much we value this move."
"It is one that has initiated a genuine political debate on the future of Europe, and I have no doubt that your speech today will provide us with an opportunity to take this debate still further."
"Mr President, you can be sure of this Chamber's commitment to this great European project."
"We, for our part, are sure that we can count on a telling contribution from your country, whose actions have always been decisive each time that a major step is taken towards European integration."
"Equal opportunities"
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"the Council statement on: Equal opportunities; equal participation by men and women;"
"the report (A5-0198/2000) by Mrs Dybkjær, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, on the Commission annual reports 'Equal Opportunities for Women and Men in the European Union - 1997, 1998, 1999'."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is the third time I have had the pleasure of addressing the House since the French Presidency began. I first addressed the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities on 11 July and, on 5 September, I made a statement about the monitoring centre for industrial change."
"Today, I am here to talk about balanced participation by men and women in all areas of society."
"The motion for a resolution on the Commission' s reports that you will be voting on later goes into great detail on the subject."
"I would like to comment on three points highlighted by Mrs Dybkjær, and I commend the quality of her work as rapporteur to this House."
"First, as regards the need for regular assessment and monitoring of equality at every level regarding work, employment, education, training, family life, health, and the dignity of women, we will only be able to make significant progress if we have the most accurate intelligence on every aspect underlying discrimination."
"The second point relates to the new information and communication technologies."
"This emerging sector is opening up greater access to the world of work for women."
"We must make sure the gaps in this area are reduced."
"We must make sure women benefit from the new jobs generated, while avoiding reproducing the inequalities that exist in more traditional sectors: less skilled jobs, part-time work (sometimes not by choice), insecure contracts and difficulties put in the way of access to decision-making posts."
"Thirdly and finally, I think the proposal to make implementation of the principle of equal treatment a selection criterion for any Community aid or funding is essential to promoting equality."
"Because equality is a major political issue we are going to use a number of events to give it prominence during the French Presidency."
"I am primarily here today, of course, to discuss those events."
"We have organised a Ministerial Conference in Paris."
"It will be held on 27 October."
"I have naturally invited Mr Rocard, my eminent fellow countryman, the Chairman of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and Mrs Theorin, Chair of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities."
"We will also be organising a Conference on Professional Equality on 24 November, bringing together experts, social partners and company managers, to look at the obstacles in the career paths of women."
"I shall not, however, be talking about the Conference on Professional Equality so much as the issues I have put on the agenda for the Ministerial Conference on 27 October."
"Three issues will be tackled, and they are issues also dealt with in the Presidency' s major documents, either in the Fifth Action Programme or the Social Agenda."
"The three subjects on the agenda for the Ministerial Conference are balanced participation by women and men in decision-making, combining work and family life, and including equality in several structures of the European Union Council of Ministers."
"The first issue, women' s participation in decision-making in all areas, shows the serious deficit women still suffer from today in comparison with men."
"That is a democratic deficit which is less and less tolerated nowadays."
"Perhaps some of you remember the Paris Conference of April 1999, when we reached agreement on a statement, but, with fifteen Ministers, had great difficulty deciding on a plan of action with quantified targets."
"That is why I decided to seize the opportunity afforded by the Presidency' s major documents, this time, to move that action plan forward."
"I can tell you that my country has now marked a crucial milestone as regards women' s participation in decision-making."
"Very briefly, a reform of the constitution was adopted on 28 June 1999 in France, with the support of the Prime Minister and the President of the Republic, and immediately afterwards we began debating a bill on parity, which was adopted on 3 May 2000."
"This law will be applied to all elections, including local elections from 2001."
"So, at the risk of seeing their electoral lists invalidated or not having their campaign costs refunded, the political parties must present lists with equal numbers of men and women placed alternately to prevent women being relegated to positions where they have little chance of getting elected."
"I feel sure that balanced participation of women in political decision-making would produce a genuine renewal of our whole political life."
"Such power sharing will bring with it other profound changes in economic, social and cultural life."
"The Beijing Platform for Action and the final outcome document of the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on Beijing + 5, last June, are along the same lines."
"The Finnish Presidency' s report on women and decision-making sets out clear indicators for evaluating the progress made."
"I also want to salute the Commission' s initiative - I think my information is correct, Mrs Diamantopoulou - in taking a decision to have parity between men and women within its committees and groups of experts."
"We must all commit ourselves to following and developing this encouraging initiative."
"The French Presidency would like to make progress in this matter and hopes to approach its partners with proposals for quantified targets for giving women access to decision-making in all areas, the political arena, which I have already mentioned, but also economic and social sectors."
"Initial consultations undertaken by the French Presidency confirm that this is a central concern in all Member States."
"I do not mean to imply that we have already reached agreement on the quantified targets, but I can assure you I am putting a good deal of effort into getting that agreement."
"The second issue for this Ministerial Conference will cover combining work and family life."
"Following the example of Finland, a questionnaire has been sent to all the Member States and this will be followed very shortly by a report."
"A proposal on indicators to measure progress will be put before the Council."
"I was hoping to make this issue an important one in the Presidency' s programme so as to ensure continuity of the work done under the Portuguese Presidency."
"I am thinking of the Evora seminar on maternity and paternity and the resolution on balanced participation by men and women in family life and at work."
"Because we know that as long as women have to carry the burden of a double working day alone they will continue to face a dilemma between their private and family lives and between their working lives and their lives as citizens."
"Indeed, as I always say in France, ladies and gentlemen, while a law to impose parity in politics is now within the bounds of possibility, it is more difficult to impose parity in daily life, domestic parity, by law."
"Just as the public arena should not be a male monopoly, the private sphere should no longer be the exclusive domain of women."
"That is why new methods of organising time must be considered, so that all those involved - parents, children, citizens, elected representatives, businesses - have their proper place."
"This will be one of the strong points of the Ministerial Conference."
"Let me add that I have also put this item on the agenda of the Conference on Professional Equality of 24 November."
"The third issue for the Ministerial Conference will cover the incorporation of gender equality into the work of the various European Union Councils of Ministers."
"I hope to initiate a process I have used as a working method in France, a method that works well."
"For the first time, several Councils of Ministers will be dealing with gender equality by linking it with one of the items on their agenda."
"To give you a couple of examples: at the Education Council there is the issue of mobility of men and women students and teachers, because we have recognised that there is major inequality in mobility; and at the Internal Market, Consumption and Tourism Council there is an item on the development of electronic commerce so as to make it accessible to all, both men and women, because we know there is gender inequality in electronic commerce too."
"In addition to the Ministerial Conference and the Conference on Professional Equality, I should also mention two very important documents specifically devoted to equality, but within the area of competence of the Employment and Social Affairs Council."
"I am thinking of the Fifth Action Programme and the amendment of the 1976 Directive."
"On the Fifth Action Programme, I would first like to wholeheartedly thank Mrs Theorin and the rapporteur, Mrs Eriksson, for their work which will, I hope, make it possible to adopt the programme before the end of the year."
"I know Parliament will be particularly concerned about mainstreaming and the implementation of strategic objectives relating to equality in economic and social life, and - to return to this point once again - balanced participation in decision-making."
"For my part, I undertake to ensure that the programme' s funding matches up to our ambitions."
"By the same token, it falls to us to review the 1976 Directive, 25 years after its adoption."
"This review will not only bring the law into line with the many rulings from the Court of Justice, but will also incorporate other very important points into Community legislation."
"I am thinking, for example, of sexual harassment as gender-based discrimination."
"The notion of indirect discrimination will be more precisely defined and the derogations from equal treatment supported better."
"This is a particularly important advance for women, as Mrs Hautala is sure to emphasise when she presents her report to Parliament on behalf of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities."
"Going beyond the specific issues falling within the scope of my ministry, I want to mention three initiatives, very briefly."
"First of all, the guidelines for employment, this time fleshed out with quantified targets, which propose to increase the employment rate for women to 60% by 2010."
"The role of the social partners is also strengthened, and I am very pleased about that."
"Finally, in a word, the fourth pillar devoted to equal opportunities reinforces the integrated approach to equality through gender mainstreaming and through specific guidelines."
"The second initiative I want to mention relates to the social agenda to be submitted to the Nice Summit, next December."
"This is one of the Presidency' s great priorities and, as you know, it opens up a broad field of action in employment, and clearly makes the point that combining work and family life makes a contribution to this."
"Personally, I would like to see this issue taken into account even more specifically in the social agenda."
"I think we can all congratulate ourselves on the fact that the agenda contains a chapter devoted to the promotion of gender equality and, in that area too, I hope we will progress towards quantified targets."
"The last initiative I want to stress concerns the drafting of the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"As you know, the draft is the outcome of complex negotiations which were completed on 26 September."
"The document will be submitted to the Biarritz European Council in a few days' time."
"I shall stress our commitment to having the articles relating to gender equality clearly set out in the Charter."
"I am frequently asked about this."
"I know I have already used up my speaking time so I shall be very brief, but there are a few things I need to make clear."
"Three articles in the Charter are devoted to gender equality."
"The first is devoted to the general principle of the equality of all persons under the law."
"The second relates to the principle of non-discrimination, including that based on gender."
"The third affirms the principle of equal pay and equal treatment, together with the possibility of undertaking positive action in favour of the under-represented sex."
"Combining work and family life, entitlement to paid maternity leave, rights of a more general scope, such as the right to dignity and the right to respect for their physical and mental integrity, also appear in the Charter."
"So all these provisions make this document an additional instrument underpinning equality."
"Civil society' s expectations are high, and this has not escaped the members of the Convention, who are anxious to have a gender-correct Charter."
"In conclusion, I repeat that the Community level is the right one for making progress together in all the areas I have mentioned, but it is also the right level for making progress on many other issues of concern to women."
"I am thinking in particular of the violence they suffer, one of my priorities for government action, and I know that is a specific issue that impels you to action too."
"Any progress we make in one Member State is progress for the other Member States."
"If national policies are enriched by Community policies, then Community policies must also be inspired by national experiences."
"I am convinced that together - Parliament, Council and Commission, but also Member States, social partners and non-governmental organisations - we will make progress and I know - we know - that equality between women and men is on the move."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by welcoming Mrs Péry back to Parliament."
"Those of us who have previously heard her in Parliament know that, with her as President-in-Office of the Council, we have a very committed spokesperson for women' s issues, and that is something we need if our plans are to succeed at all."
"In the committee, we combined three reports from the Commission and dealt with them together."
"On behalf of the committee, I can promise that, in future, we shall attend to the reports in time so that the Commission does not feel it is engaged on a major task, but that we in the committee are ignoring the fact and not getting our reports ready in time."
"We have promised ourselves that this will not happen in future."
"All three reports - I shall return to the speech of the President-in-Office of the Council in a moment - call attention to the articles of the Treaty of Amsterdam and say that, in these, we have obtained a new and sound basis for working on the issue of equality in the Commission and that we have also obtained a number of tools for implementing equality in the different Member States in a way we were unable to do before."
"This is something which, as women, we should be pleased about."
"We can say that almost all women have worked hard to achieve a better Treaty where equality is concerned, and I therefore think that we can be quietly pleased with the fifteen men who sat and adopted the Treaty of Amsterdam and were therefore also involved in implementing the principles of equality, even though it cannot, of course, be said that there is much in the way of obvious equality in their own Assembly."
"There is really a paradox in the fact that we in the EU have, on the one hand, an outstanding basis for equality - especially now with the Treaty of Amsterdam - but that, on the other hand, there are fifteen men in the European Council who make all the decisions, something I shall refrain from commenting further upon."
"It therefore becomes obvious in one way or another that there is a difference between principles and concrete implementation."
"I am also saying this because I think it is incredibly important that the EU should be given a stronger women' s perspective, and I say this for two reasons."
"First of all, we have had a referendum in Denmark which clearly showed that women, more than men, are opposed to this project, and not merely the project involving the euro but the EU project as a whole."
"In Denmark, we have equality in a great many areas, so women ought not to feel threatened by the project."
"We see, however, that, on many points, women are opposed to the project to a much greater degree than men."
"We therefore have some problem or other, and I will venture to say that it is not because we have declined to say that the EU is OK."
"Instead, it has to do with this overridingly male-dominated agenda, which women have emotional reasons for voting against."
"Secondly, we are now facing enlargement, and we know that the progressive changeover from state-run to private enterprises affects women more than men."
"Because a great many of the countries have said that they want to hold referenda, we have the major task of conveying to women in the candidate countries that the EU is good for them."
"For, if we do not make a special effort in this area, I am completely convinced that there will again be a range of emotional reactions which will not necessarily have to do with the EU clauses but with the fact that the EU is, all in all, a very male-dominated enterprise. In that way, there is a risk of our seeing 'no' votes in referenda in the candidate countries, too, and of enlargement failing to go ahead."
"I would therefore prevail upon the President-in-Office of the Council, both the current and the forthcoming ones, as well as upon the Commissioner, to be alert to this aspect, for I believe that it is absolutely fundamental to our work that we make a very big effort in this area."
"In connection with the reports, I would also say - and the President-in-Office of the Council touched upon this, too - that one of the major problems in the EU is of course the big cultural differences."
"It is therefore no wonder that the President-in-Office of the Council is having difficulty getting her action plan through."
"This clearly shows that the countries have very different interests, but one of the things we have to work on is trying to find out where, in particular, we can make a contribution in the individual countries."
"I have a dream of our being able to obtain proper statistics for the different areas so that we can obtain indicators for the labour market, education and many other matters in relation to equality."
"In that way, we shall be able to work on things in very much more concrete terms."
"I would very much recommend that this be done for the candidate countries too, for it proves to be incredibly difficult to obtain figures from the candidate countries about how responsibilities are divided between men and women in the different areas."
"I believe that, if we are to be able to deal with enlargement properly, we must also have those figures."
"There were thousands of other things I could have done with saying. I can see, however, that my allocated speaking time has run out, so I shall stop at this point."
"I would, however, put a strong case to the Presidency and the Commissioner for our continuing to follow the guidelines which we have indicated in the report and to which I have referred in my speech."
"Mr President, Mrs Péry, Commissioner, the reports that the Commission has drawn up on equal opportunities in 1997, 1998 and 1999 are very important documents and the reference to the Treaty of Amsterdam is a significant step forward."
"Articles 2 and 3 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, covering equal opportunities for men and women and Article 141 covering positive measures for employment are a guarantee for women that should take effect in all the policies of the European Union."
"We are aware that women do not participate sufficiently in the decision-making process in politics, business or unions."
"They have a much smaller share in the labour market than men, a difference that is particularly accentuated in some countries, especially in southern Europe."
"They do not receive the same pay for equal work, with the difference reaching almost 30 % in the private sector."
"We know that measures for combining family and working life particularly favour women, although research is still needed into the current situation of the family and the role that women play in it, which is no longer the traditional role, because society has changed a great deal, and at the same time, so has family structure."
"It is essential that research should be carried out on the real situation of women in the various Member States in order to guide the policies that need to be made if we are to achieve greater equality between men and women."
"In order to integrate gender policies into all programmes, we must be aware of the situation from which we are starting and the objectives that we wish to achieve with particular policies."
"Because what really count are the achievements and the advances in the situation of women."
"We are aware that the majority of unemployment in the European Union is among women."
"In order to achieve full employment, therefore, we need to have positive policies directed at women, which will consist both of creating jobs and of preparing women for the new jobs - information society, new technologies - in which they can play an entirely equal role to men."
"The percentage of women in work in the European Union is much lower than that in the United States and Japan, a level that only some northern European countries come close to."
"If we take into account the candidate countries, the problem becomes more serious as the levels of women workers in those countries are even lower. Therefore, the objective of equality between men and women should be included in all programmes."
"Women have decided that they wish to work, that they wish to make their work compatible with their family life."
"Women wish to take part in decision-making processes, in politics, unions, and business, and we know that the contribution of women is positive for everyone and for the progress of society as a whole."
"European Union policies should help them to take part in order to achieve greater equality between men and women."
"Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, contrary to what the annual reports which we are discussing here might seem to suggest, European women' s equality policy did not originate three years ago, but dates back much further to at least twenty-five years ago."
"Its launch was accompanied by a great deal of legal creativity, audacity and lashings of political power of persuasion."
"If one examines women' s equality policy now, it seems to me, as we are all gathered here - and, of course, most of the people attending and taking part in the discussion are women - that while we are all naturally trying our utmost, we are also aware that European women' s equality policy is threatening to lose its momentum."
"It has become an issue for which you have strong feelings neither for nor against."
"To put it mildly, it is in a conceptual and political vacuum."
"The reports we are dealing with here seem to reflect this mood."
"There is a great deal of activity, reasonable sums are being spent, fantastic conferences are being held, everyone does all kinds of wonderful things, but we do not know where it is all leading."
"Is this policy a success?"
"Is it useful to draw the goals nearer?"
"We cannot verify this, for - and the rapporteur also mentioned this in her report - the goals of the policy are not clearly defined and cannot be measured."
"What we need to do, therefore, is to formulate our goal more clearly, so that we know whether we are successful or whether the instruments we deploy are successful."
"We also need to define the problem more clearly and identify the problem which the policy is trying to solve."
"Twenty-five years ago, we were able to talk about social discrimination of women as a group and about unequal treatment."
"Does this definition of the goal or problem still apply?"
"Is it still appropriate?"
"What are the groups in society for which this definition is still appropriate?"
"Is it not the case that the gap caused by this social discrimination has been partly bridged for certain groups and that others groups are doing very well indeed, in other words, that a kind of sham women' s equality has been created?"
"In short, I would very much like us to address the question as to what the problem facing women consists of."
"What is the problem which the policy is trying to solve?"
"Can we reframe this using a more modern approach and can we apply a theory and set of policy instruments which will breathe new life into the policy, so that we do not continue on the same path?"
"I may be critical, but it might be useful to shake up the house of cards, which women' s equality policy in Europe does appear to be, where we are all frightfully nice to each other and say everything is so wonderful."
"Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, I should like to start by thanking our fellow MEP, Mrs Dybkjær for an excellent report and welcoming her back to Parliament after her recent weeks' campaigning."
"We know that Lone Dybkjær did what she could."
"I am a man in an EU within which men and women do not have equal opportunities."
"It is worth repeating that."
"Sometimes, some people - even colleagues in this Assembly - seem to believe that they do have equal opportunities, but they do not."
"Just as some people have said, it is enough to look at this Assembly: the majority are men, the majority of those making decisions are men, and when the European Council meets it consists solely of men."
"There is one female Head of State in Europe."
"It is therefore gratifying that the European Parliament is represented by a woman in these contexts."
"More women are needed in decision-making positions, because it is quite simply unacceptable that so much human ability is being lost."
"Women do have the ability - and without imposing quotas."
"This week we have taken a great step closer to a reunited Europe."
"Emphasising how matters stand regarding equality in the candidate countries is a particularly important task in the membership negotiations that are currently in progress."
"Some problem areas: women often have two jobs, unemployment is higher among women, childcare has deteriorated, there are too few women in decision-making positions, violence against women is on the increase in many candidate countries and several candidate countries are at the centre of the increasing trade in women."
"What can be done?"
"Rapid membership of the EU will provide economic strength, better conditions for women and greater freedom of choice."
"The chapter on equality must be accorded equal importance in the membership negotiations."
"There must be no transitional periods."
"We must monitor whether the directive on equality is really being incorporated into legislation."
"Mainstreaming is very important in the internal policies of the candidate countries, too."
"An ombudsman for equality issues should be introduced, and in the candidate countries too."
"The EU should pursue a campaign to combat violence against women throughout Eastern and Central Europe."
"The EU should also take the initiative and organise a UN convention against the trade in human beings."
"I started by talking about my male status."
"Perhaps this issue of gender needs to be pointed out in this Assembly."
"On the basis of my own experience, if I may speak personally, I am convinced that Paragraph 15 of the resolution - stating the importance of men' s involvement in, and access to, good childcare - is the most important paragraph by far if equality and equal conditions are to be achieved for men and women."
"I should like to conclude by saying that equality begins in the home."
"If we cannot share tasks and responsibility in the small world of the home, there will never be real equality in the big world outside, either."
"Mr President, I greatly appreciate the fact that France, during its presidential term, has decided to issue Parliament with a statement on equality."
"This is, of course, no surprise, as we know that Secretary of State Péry is also extremely active in these matters in France."
"She is quite right when she says that steps taken forward nationally can inspire us at EU level and, on the other hand, steps taken forward at EU level can give hints to the Member States regarding the direction they should go in."
"It must also be said that France' s constitutional amendment to establish a policy of equal decision-making would perhaps be ideal as a source of inspiration not just in the Member States, but perhaps also at European Union level."
"I know that in this we are getting into a very sensitive area as we are stepping into what is almost like the Member States' areas of competence."
"We could perhaps say that as the Commission has begun to ensure there is equal representation of men and women in its own committees and expert groups it will perhaps not be such a very big step from there to what Mrs Dybkjær said, dare we say it, that we should work on the assumption that both women and men should represent the European Union at a higher level too, such as at summit conferences."
"Perhaps the biggest disappointment in this area with regard to the Charter on Fundamental Rights, as far as I am concerned, is that the Charter does not say that we should carry through the idea of equal representation of women and men in decision-making."
"However, this should have been incorporated in the Charter quite naturally - in a modern society such as ours - but this work will certainly have to be continued and gone into in greater detail."
"Péry spoke of the importance of reconciling work with family life."
"I am glad that she also mentioned that the method chosen by Finland was being used in France, in which quite clear indicators are identified to gauge the situation."
"This will also perhaps serve as an answer for Mrs Swiebel, who was demanding that we must be able to define clear targets and that results must be able to be measured."
"I believe that this method, which Finland has introduced for the first time, works well in many areas and while it is part of the Commission' s strategy on equality there is good reason to expect much from it."
"I would also like to mention one problem in the area of work and family life."
"It would appear that it is getting harder for young families to take advantage of the rights that have been guaranteed them by law, as competition in the job market has become so fierce."
"We must be very careful that young mothers and fathers do not freely surrender their rights because they are afraid of the problems they might encounter in working life."
"Reference was also made here several times to mainstreaming, and I can only agree with what has been said here that, for example, in the area of economic policy it is of absolutely major importance to start considering the gender perspective."
"The fact is, in Denmark, women suspect that the whole European integration project threatens the rights and levels of welfare women have achieved there."
"This, I think, presents quite a challenge for both the Commission and the Council."
"Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased with the two reports being debated today: Mrs Dybkjær' s report on progress so far, and Mrs Eriksson' s on the future."
"I found them both enormously interesting. Today, I simply want to talk specifically about what these reports contain - our current objective as Europeans in terms of equal opportunities."
"What emerges from these reports is that it is difficult to move from theory to practice."
"Plenty of theory, plenty of fine words. No one is quicker than us to say these things or to come out with fine words, but practical results are a long time coming."
"Why does this worry me?"
"Because I think there is currently great ambiguity and awkwardness about equal opportunities in Europe."
"We want specific actions and we want mainstreaming."
"The two things are not easily reconciled and we could lose out on both counts."
"For example, at noon we will be voting on two reports on discrimination and equal access to employment which both exclude gender on the grounds that gender is covered by policies other than discrimination policy."
"I find that position awkward and ambiguous, and I think that means more thought is required on the drafts you are presenting to us, because there is no certainty that all this will produce practical results."
"To take a very simple example, which we were just discussing three days ago in the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, are we talking about defending flexibility or about fighting poverty?"
"Both are possible, but they are also contradictory, because we know very well that flexibility creates more poverty, and next week' s World March of Women will make that point."
"So there are contradictions in our equal opportunities policy and I think we must be aware of that so that we can organise the future of our project better, or so it seems to me."
"Another example, also full of contradiction, is part-time work."
"It appears in today' s reports amongst the social rights."
"Is access to part-time work a social right?"
"I have no idea, but I doubt it."
"On the other hand, there is also something in the reports which seems to me very important and which Mrs Dybkjær has placed well to the fore, as has Mrs Eriksson: the fact that in future we need to be concerned about so-called 'derived rights' , that is, women' s social rights to autonomy."
"What happens to a woman who has spent twenty years with a husband who then leaves her?"
"What sort of pension will she get?"
"Good question!"
"What is her tax position?"
"There is no equal opportunity, there is no real equality for women without autonomy and freedom as social rights, so that they can have control of their lives throughout their lives."
"I would like this subject, so strongly emphasised in our reports, to be one of our priorities from now on."
"I now want to talk about enlargement, which is still, perhaps, one of my concerns."
"We are delighted that the Finnish Presidency has introduced indicators and I know the French Presidency wants to consolidate this indicator policy into an important institution."
"I am very pleased about that, I am delighted."
"But looking at the problem of enlargement, and here I will conclude, because the issue of enlargement worries me a great deal, yesterday we naturally voted in favour of the report on enlargement to a whole series of countries."
"But where, pray, are the conditions for women' s rights and equal opportunities in that enlargement?"
"I am concerned about that and I urge the French Presidency to be concerned about it."
"Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, all of us here agree that equal opportunities for men and women must be pursued in all our policies."
"But beyond that, the method has to be defined."
"We need to be sure that what is decided in Strasbourg is real progress."
"In the name of equal opportunities, and thanks to Europe, French women have won the right to work at night."
"I am not sure they should thank Europe for that."
"The European method, imposing uniformity, is wrong."
"First, because while women, like citizens in general, have the same ideas of what is fair and what is unjust, they do not have the same ideas about their role in the various cultures of the European Union."
"Nature has determined that woman should carry the future of humanity in her womb."
"Now, the primary duty of any society is to promote life and hence do everything possible to enable women to reconcile their legitimate right to personal and professional development with potential motherhood."
"In that area, there is no equality."
"Only women can have children."
"So fairness does not come into the equation when the roles of women and men are as different as that."
"Rather than making abortion easier, the French government should be developing a policy aimed at eliminating every material and social reason which might drive a woman to such a negation of life."
"Every abortion is a condemnation of our society, but never a condemnation of an individual woman."
"Since I became a Member of this Parliament, however, it has been my impression that a part of this House would rather forget this aspect of women' s lives."
"More serious still, I also have the feeling that the institutions of the European Union have the greatest difficulty developing a global vision of society in our countries."
"As the debates and regulations go by, a compartmentalised vision of our society appears."
"Instead of addressing everyone, we compartmentalise: minority after minority, ethnic group after ethnic group."
"As a French woman and citizen, this vision of the world is particularly alien to me."
"I am a citizen who should enjoy the same rights and the same prospects as any citizen of the other sex, no more and no less."
"I do smile sometimes in this House, particularly when I hear that the group most hostile to the single currency are women, especially in Denmark."
"When we decide on policies targeting people with disabilities, or blind people, it is perfectly normal to add women."
"It is really very annoying that these women, from the depths of their kitchens or household accounts, are rejecting the radiant future of the euro."
"They must be re-educated."
"The image of the European woman we find in the pages of our reports and directives does not correspond to that of these Danish women, the majority of whom are saying no to the euro."
"So, new pages describe her as ill informed, isolated, and out of step with everyone else."
"Danish women will appreciate that."
"I take this opportunity to salute the Danish women Members of Parliament, especially Ulla Sandbaek and Pia Kjaersgaard. They come from different political backgrounds, but together they embody the courage so many men lack."
"It is my conviction that a method is being outlined today through policies geared to sectors, not to say minorities, in this Parliament."
"Any kind of national attachment must be destroyed, European societies must be reduced to a collection of isolated individuals in small ethnic, sexual, social or other minorities, all run from a distance by a European State as distant as it is pernickety."
"It is not surprising, therefore, that Mrs Dybkjær' s report refers to the Beijing Platform, which uses women' s rights as a weapon to defend a particular conception of women and their rights, and impose it on the whole world."
"The Polish delegation to the New York conference already had occasion to appreciate the arrogance of a part of the European delegation incapable of accepting other positions more measured than its own."
"Other Members of this Parliament had to take up the pen to put things right, and Poland thanked them for it."
"In spite of these remarks, we shall vote for this report because we are naturally in favour of equal opportunities, but what equal opportunities means most of all is respect for everyone."
"Mr President, Mrs Péry, Commissioner, the position of, and relationship between, men and women in society has changed dramatically over the past decades."
"The number of dual earner households has grown considerably."
"Given this development, we applaud a policy which contributes towards the equivalent development of men and women in line with their talents and interests."
"The present report, however, puts forward an exaggerated interpretation of the principle of equality."
"The diversity or differences with regard to men and women are still not being given enough consideration."
"There is also the freedom of the individual to consider."
"As a result, the freedom of choice for women, which they strive for, can very easily fuel frustration and renewed forms of repression."
"I therefore find it telling that the report is seeking to establish a numerical balance between men and women across all sectors of society, for example in the labour market."
"The choice of training and profession for men and women will depend on their own personalities, talents and interests."
"To respect and value these differences shows that we still have our feet firmly on the ground."
"The campaigns launched by the Dutch government to encourage girls to select more exact science subjects and so-called male professions, have failed miserably."
"A European repeat of these debacles appears completely pointless to me."
"I just have to get something off my chest. I find it shocking that the representative of the Council should mention the fact that equality should be enforced, yes enforced, would you believe, in the home."
"I do hope that she shares my view that the government has no right to intervene in the private sphere."
"In addition, the report undervalues transductive labour."
"Bringing up children, especially transferring standards and values, is of vital importance to our society."
"Whoever denies mothers the freedom of choice to bring up their own children unpaid, will be presented with the bill later on in the form of youth crime and vandalism."
"The idea that women lag behind in paid work compared to men should certainly not be considered as inequality, because it is based on a one-sided, woman-unfriendly vision."
"After all, it is the cool, rational, enlightened thinking which advances human beings as independent, autonomous creatures and downgrades women to being the second sex."
"When one adopts this thinking as starting point, it is easy to see why one could be in favour of women' s equality."
"This choice, however, does not offer any guarantees against evil, suffering or injustice."
"At best, it sustains other types of suppression."
"Human beings are independent and responsible creatures placed in relation to God, their Creator, on the one hand and their fellow human beings on the other."
"This means, among other things, that men and women interrelate and need each other in order to do themselves justice as men and women."
"This is exactly why keeping marriage and family completely out of the picture in this report represents a lost opportunity."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it was certainly a sensible initiative on the part of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities to compile a report on the Commission' s annual reports concerning equal opportunities for men and women in the European Union, covering the period from 1997 to 1999."
"These reports have confirmed what we were all already fully aware of. The situation is far from hunky-dory when it comes to equal treatment and equal opportunities for men and women within the EU, despite the fact that the first equal treatment directive concerning equal pay for men and women came into force as long as 25 years ago, and Article 119 of the Treaty of Rome, which came into force in 1957, made provision for the elimination of wage discrimination against women."
"That was over 40 years ago."
"After all, we are already discussing the Fifth Action Programme on the equal treatment of men and women."
"Mrs Dybkjær' s report contains another long list of demands and wishes directed at the Commission, particularly in respect of inquiries, which I do not, however, necessarily consider to be indispensable."
"But we all know only too well where the real problems lie, and that the lack of political will - particularly in the Member States - the lack of willingness on the part of the social partners, the hesitancy of the political parties when it comes to involving more women in the decision-making processes, and also -let us be honest about this - the mentality of many men and women, are responsible for this unsatisfactory state of affairs."
"Once again, we have been left in no doubt on that score."
"What I do not see in this report, Commissioner, are calls for the Commission to at last get round to following up Parliament' s very specific proposals."
"We have a far more pressing need for concrete legislative proposals from the Commission, than we do for studies and fine declarations and speeches."
"Firstly, improvements are called for in the existing directives, for example those covering equality of opportunity in the sphere of social security, with respect to public and company schemes."
"I would remind you, in this connection, of our report on the splitting of pension rights in the event of divorce, as a result of which, payments for surviving relatives and the retirement age are to be included in the 1979 directive."
"I would put you in mind of the overdue improvements made to the 'caffeine-free' free directive of 1986 concerning equal rights for self-employed people, including spouses that help out - those millions of invisible workers, most of whom are women - and whom are engaged in small and medium-sized agricultural enterprises without any form of social security."
"Five years ago, we unanimously adopted an excellent report on this subject, one of our demands being a framework statute for spouses that help out in the family business."
"There were two sessions of round-table talks organised by the Commission, and we have not heard another word since."
"That was three years ago."
"What we really need is for the Commission to at last come up with concrete, legislative proposals, instead of frittering away time and money on reports and inquiries, and wasting time that would be better spent on worthwhile legislative work."
"The Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities would also do well to take this advice to heart."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Nicole Péry for giving us high hopes of the French Presidency, which has made great strides with its law on equality."
"Electoral lists comprising 50% men and 50% women could be worth emulating."
"However, we are still awaiting the decision regarding a formal Council of Ministers."
"Unfortunately, we are only ever referred to other Councils of Ministers for a decision."
"We do not want to wait any longer."
"Other speakers have made the point: we want political action."
"It is high time for decisions on equal pay for equal work, i.e. for Articles 141 and 13 to be implemented."
"The Charter of Fundamental Rights has to be more than a fine proclamation."
"What we need are concrete implementation measures that will enable people to reconcile a career with family life."
"The Fifth Action Programme will assist us in this, but we as a European Parliament have already come some way ourselves."
"We have created a network of committees on equality with our female counterparts in the national parliaments, and in November, we will be meeting our female counterparts from the Member States, as well as those from the candidate countries."
"We did the same thing, incidentally, in New York, at the Beijing + 5 Conference."
"I was the rapporteur in Peking and the co-rapporteur in New York."
"The Polish women were very grateful to us for making it clear that the representative who was there at the time most definitely did not reflect the views of Polish women."
"I met with some very positive responses there."
"I would like to remind our President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, of the important speech he made here."
"There must be no glass ceilings in the European edifice."
"The European Parliament employs 30% women, which is the highest percentage rate of all the institutions."
"The Commission has 25% women, so at least there is an upward trend."
"The European Court of Justice could do better, as only two of its fifteen judges are women."
"Yes, and the picture looks very gloomy in the Council on the equal opportunities policy front."
"All I can say there, is that the Council is what you might call a developing country where equality for women is concerned."
"We have every reason to be concerned."
"We have heard that the previous Council Presidency first restructured and then scrapped the Ministry for Equality."
"That gives us great cause for concern, and we expect that as well as stepping up the pace in matters of equal opportunities policy, there will also be concrete measures."
"Mr President, the Commission reports on equal opportunities are very welcome, but unfortunately, as the rapporteur said earlier, in a practical sense they are not very useful as real measures of success or bases on which to build future programmes, because they are too descriptive and there is not enough analysis of successes and failures."
"One of the vital requirements for improvements in the position of women is firstly to know exactly what the current situation is."
"That means we need accurate facts and figures."
"Then the evaluation reports can use clear criteria and give us an objective analysis of progress or the lack of progress."
"After all, one of the main criticisms that I receive from grassroots women's organisations is that when applying for financial support from the European Union, they have to make very detailed predictions about their future work and its outcome."
"Yet in reports like this, we do not have anything like the same detailed information."
"We need to ensure that information and activities reach women in their own communities, and one effective way of doing that would be by developing and promoting real life case studies which reflect a positive image."
"I try to look at these reports from the point of view of women in Wales, the constituency I represent, and consider how they are affected by this kind of progress and how they can get access to and use this kind of information."
"I would support the request of the Committee on Women's Rights in this report for a major study of women in the EU and in the candidate countries as a starting point for future work."
"A lot is being done by women's organisations, by governments, by the European Parliament and the Commission."
"We have heard from the Minister of the progress that has been made in France and we can learn a lot from this."
"Greater involvement by women at all levels of government and in all areas of life is essential for deepening democracy and achieving and maintaining peace."
"We should be encouraging better dialogue with women everywhere - after all the European Union is seen as a pioneer in terms of equality legislation."
"The reports are welcome and the progress they outline is a step forward, but until we really begin to exchange good practice and base our work on real statistics, we are not in a position to judge whether we are on the right road to achieving real equality between women and men."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Péry, ladies and gentlemen, as the Commission' s reports acknowledge, major issues still remain to be resolved in the field of equal opportunities for men and women."
"In practically every sphere of activity, serious inequalities still exist."
"Despite the differing situations in Member States, there are generally fewer women in the labour market, they are most affected by unemployment, including long-term unemployment, and by casual labour, part-time work and atypical, insecure and badly paid work."
"Women' s average salaries are still lower than men' s, by around 28% on average, which is a contributory factor to women making up the bulk of the poor and to preventing them from participating in social and political life."
"Since we know that quality employment that provides rights is a fundamental factor in guaranteeing equality between men and women and in guaranteeing women the same kind of independence as men, it is crucial that we study the causes of this situation and adopt the necessary measures to overcome it, specifically through policies on employment, training, education and on infrastructures for supporting the family and children, giving priority to this issue at a practical level and not just making declarations of intent."
"With regard to participation in the decision-making process, either at political level, in the business world or in the trade union movement, women are still in the minority."
"Whilst this situation can be explained to some extent by the difficulties women face in the labour market and within the family, it is also true that political parties must shoulder their democratic responsibility to guarantee equal opportunities for women to participate in political life and in the decision-making process itself, in order to put an end to the scandalous situation that still exists at the beginning of the new millennium."
"Madam President-in-Office, thank you for coming here today to tell us about the French Presidency' s interesting initiatives."
"I should like to dwell in particular on two terms: articulation between family and work and parité au quotidien."
"These concepts and what they stand for are gaining ground in French society and I hope that this interest will be exported to the rest of Europe."
"I also wanted to congratulate you on your initiative in introducing the female dimension into the Councils because, as we see on a daily basis, women' s issues are special issues, not just a necessary dimension to every policy."
"As far as the Commission reports are concerned, Commissioner, we received them with interest and we examined them in the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities."
"However, I have to say that we were dissatisfied with the descriptive nature of the reports and trust that future reports which come under your responsibility will contain a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the results."
"On other words, we need a breakdown of the indicators applied, detailed statistics comparing the situation in the Member States, an analysis of cultural differences in the various European societies and an indication of the factors which act as disincentives to the developments we are seeking and to the development of a European nationality for women which, as we can see on a daily basis, for example from the recent referendum in Denmark, is a sector which we need to address."
"My final comment concerns the situation of women in the countries preparing to join the European Union."
"Because of the course of our own history and our experience from the policies which we have applied, we have an obligation to help them and I therefore feel that the Commission and the Council should call on the Member States to adopt the mechanisms which allow equality to be applied to all their policies."
"We have both a political and a moral responsibility for these countries trying to find their way into Europe and for the cohesion of the enlarged Europe which we are preparing."
"Mr President, welcome back to Parliament, Mrs Péry."
"Thank you for your considerable commitment and for the work you have made a point of doing in the interests of equality."
"We are especially looking forward to your succeeding in implementing a policy of alternate listing of women and men in decision-making."
"That is really excellent."
"I would just like to raise a couple of issues which I believe should, as a matter of urgency, be a part too of the Council' s thinking and of the work it is doing."
"It concerns not only women in the European Union, but also women in the candidate countries."
"In the candidate countries, the social exclusion of women has been substantially greater than that of men. It is therefore women who have been hardest hit."
"Many of them have lost their jobs and, with this, comes violence against women, sex discrimination and the trade in women."
"Many women are lured to Western Europe with promises of a better life, but the reality is the opposite."
"They often fall victim to acts of violence and some are forced into prostitution."
"Consequently we must demand and support preventive programmes and specific measures, such as strict legislation, witness protection schemes and information campaigns."
"However, the fact that the existing laws are not enforced and new ones are not created means that the governments of Europe are indirectly allowing the Mafia to continue with its activities."
"This is therefore an incredibly important issue for us to get to grips with."
"In this area therefore, the Council, especially its men, has a tremendously important job to do in leading Europe in the fight against the Mafia that trades in women, for this slave trade is not something that responsible politicians can push aside, shrug off or ignore."
"We have a political responsibility to abolish this slavery of modern times."
"In conclusion, I would like to say something about the men - and it is the men that I address."
"When I talk about 'the men' , I mean the men with power."
"It is Prodi, Chirac, Jospin, Schröder, Blair, Persson and the others who must become involved in this, namely all 15 of our heads of government."
"Mr President, the recitals of this report highlight aspects of gender inequality."
"Women are forced into temporary work, they are far more exposed to insecure jobs and unemployment, and on average they are paid 30% less than men."
"Unfortunately, the proposals that follow do not measure up to the challenge of those recitals."
"Firstly, because the majority of them are about creating monitoring centres, collecting statistics and carrying out studies."
"Gender inequality is not exactly a new phenomenon we are just discovering, needing to be studied."
"As regards work, we cannot seek equality and continue to develop insecurity, flexibility and part-time work."
"That is part-time work that women are forced into, because 70% of them would like to work full-time."
"Today we are witnessing the pauperisation of wage-earning women all over Europe, including France, where 15% of them live on less than FRF 3 650 a month."
"Worse, so-called equality is sometimes turned against women: for instance, in France today the incorporation of a directive is going to make night work legal for women."
"A strange notion of equality."
"Other choices could have been made; night work for men could have been banned instead, when it is not required to meet society' s needs."
"In conclusion, fine words and nothing concrete."
"That will not be enough."
"That is what we will be saying in Brussels on 14 October with the World March of Women fighting against violence and for real work for all."
"Those are the essential conditions for real equality."
"Mr President, I would like to thank both Mrs Péry and Commissioner Diamantopoulou for being here today."
"From the reports and speeches that we are considering today we can deduce, as many of us already knew, that the problem of equal opportunities is a structural problem and that in order to deal with it we need global strategies, because as women we are not a category or a homogenous social group or indeed any sort of group."
"In the European Union we are currently running the risk of our debate being elitist and of the progress only reaching some of the more informed and more privileged women, leaving behind the rest, who are young women, immigrant women, single mothers, victims of the white slave trade, etc. They suffer from multiple discrimination."
"We cannot continue with an elitist debate, we cannot continue to have progress only benefiting those women who enjoy greater opportunities."
"Our efforts need to be directed at the women who have the most problems, who are certainly the majority in the European Union."
"We therefore need to assess the real situation of women, we need to draw up indicators and we need to make our political action binding, so that progress really reaches everyone and not just a few."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish first of all to congratulate the French Presidency on initiating this debate. I should also particularly like to congratulate our former Vice-President, who is fully aware of the problems we face in this House and of the great interest that the European Parliament takes in the debate on issues of equality between men and women."
"As the Minister quite rightly said, we are discussing a political issue of the greatest importance and it is crucial that Europe understands that we are arguing that equality is just such an issue."
"I should also like to congratulate Mrs Péry, as a French politician, on the coherence shown in her own country, which amended its constitution to include equality between men and women. It also then succeeded in introducing and approving a law to implement this."
"Not all countries have managed to follow France' s example, which I hope will bear fruit elsewhere."
"I should like to say, Mrs Péry that I consider the fact that you are organising a Council of Ministers for Women' s Affairs and that every government in the European Union has one member responsible for equal opportunity issues to be of the utmost importance."
"This is the only way in which 'mainstreaming' can be introduced across the board in government and in which the equal opportunity policy will gain the high profile necessary to give it substance."
"I shall end, Mrs Péry, by asking you a question."
"As the Ministry of Equal Opportunities in Portugal is now defunct, who will represent my country at the meeting on 27 October in Paris?"
"Mr President, I too would like to thank Minister Péry and Commissioner Diamantopoulou for today's debate. I would also like to thank the rapporteur, whose report not only contains observations on the situation of equal opportunities in the European Union, but also recommends a course of action."
"I would particularly like to thank the Minister for the work she is doing in her own country and as President-in-Office of the Council, and I would like to make a connection between the work of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and the work of the Commission, focusing on one point: employment."
"The report before us is, I feel, a major synergistic work."
"The guidelines for 2001 on equal opportunities in the world of employment are starting to become better defined, more specific and more effective."
"This is the way forward."
"The Committee on Women's Rights would like to congratulate the Commission and also propose a few even more specific pointers."
"I truly believe that this report and the Fifth Action Programme which lays down a strategy are the way forward."
"We might do better to stop complaining, or rather to complain but, at the same time, to show due appreciation for the positive steps which are being taken to ensure that we make increasingly effective progress."
"Mr President, I will not reply individually, except to Mrs Torres Marques, because her question is really direct and personal."
"I was indeed sorry to see that Maria De Belém Roseira was no longer the representative."
"She was very active during the Portuguese Presidency, but it is not up to me to make that decision, it is up to the Minister for Employment, whom we have invited to the conference on gender equality."
"I will now respond generally on the issues, rather than give individual answers to any one of you."
"Several of you have said gender equality policy did not start a year, two years, or three years ago."
"Obviously not, and as someone involved with associations for social change - because I too, like many of you, have some thirty years of involvement with these associations behind me - I know how hard the social movement, the feminist movement and the intellectual movement, naturally, have worked to move this issue forward, and today we take our places in roles of responsibility in our institutions."
"The history of the women' s movement goes back way over fifty years: I sometimes remember Olympe de Gouges, who dared to call for a declaration of women' s rights and gender equality, and was condemned to the scaffold in 1793."
"Of course the history of feminism is very long."
"My second comment is about inequality in the world of work."
"Ladies and gentlemen, political will is clearly not enough to eliminate every possible social inequality overnight, especially in the world of work."
"Management, the unions and the market have a role to play, but we do what we can by expressing a political will."
"I can tell you in one sentence what I am doing about it: I have wasted no time proposing a law to improve equality in the world of work."
"This is currently being debated in Parliament, and I have introduced a provision, which obviously does not suit everyone in my country, but which is compulsory and will compel each company or profession to negotiate on equality in the workplace every three years, covering salaries, conditions of work, career prospects, and access to lifelong training."
"My third comment is about your doubts: plenty of speeches, plenty of documents, plenty of reports, but not enough actual progress towards quantified targets."
"It is true that the reality in the European Union is that we have to take decisions as Fifteen and we differ culturally in relation to these issues."
"Nevertheless, I believe in the need to fight for quantified targets, and to implement policy through indicators."
"I did not mention this in my speech, but I am fully intending to propose a feasibility study on the gender institution to the Ministerial Conference, because we need an instrument for monitoring those indicators, and for exchanges of good practice."
"Fourth point: the issues of the future."
"Two of you mentioned new social rights, new fiscal rights."
"I can tell you that will be the central theme of the Swedish Presidency, and I shall be following it with great interest, because the progress made will certainly inspire French action."
"Fifth point: the Charter."
"It is true that while much has been done compared with the initial stage of this document, we might have hoped for something more dynamic on decision-making."
"I have not lost hope, however, of improving the text."
"Sixth point: enlargement."
"In New York I took the liberty of making myself clear on that issue on behalf of my country."
"I shall be just as clear today, on behalf of the Presidency."
"The candidates really must be helped to come up to the level of the acquis communautaire."
"That seems clear."
"Excluding gender equality from the acquis communautaire is unimaginable, and of course we shall be just as vigilant on that issue as on the others."
"Finally, violence, prostitution, the grip of the Mafia. If Mrs Diamantopoulou wants to take a European initiative, because we have done things before at Community level to combat violence, I shall be there to support her."
"Mr President, what we refer to here and what has been referred to for a century as the women' s problem is approached from two different angles, as the debate here in the House today has demonstrated."
"The first reasons that the structure of the social and economic system is to blame for present inequalities and the policy of the European Union and of all the national governments is based on this reasoning."
"The second approach says that women, themselves, are to blame for the inequality which exists in society."
"This reasoning often leads to absurd distortions, one of which was heard here today, i.e. that the way in which women voted in Denmark was determined by some particular female chromosome and not by the social differences which they experience on a daily basis."
"Honourable Members, Mrs Péry, the President-in-Office, has given us a superb analysis of the priorities of the French Presidency, which we all believe will be particularly important priorities."
"I should like in my brief intervention to confine myself to the report."
"The 97, 98 and 99 reports are not simply working papers."
"They are political tools."
"I should like to remind the House that the Commission' s legislative proposal due for debate calls for annual reports from the Member States on the subject of positive action because we really do believe that these reports are political tools for three reasons."
"Firstly, they give us a picture of the situation."
"As you will have seen, the reports contain analytical tables, data on each Member State and tables on all the individual sectors."
"Secondly, because they allow us to make a comparative assessment of the Member States and a comparative assessment of the overall progress of the European Union over time."
"Thirdly, because they form the basis for strategy, both for the European Union - even in the Charter of Fundamental Rights the fact that we had a picture of the current situation played an important role - and at national level, given that the Member States are able to use the comparative assessment to set national targets."
"In my view, the reports which you have at your disposal concentrate on and highlight three issues."
"The first is the participation of women in decision-making."
"The average participation of women is 18.6% in Europe, 28.9% in regional parliaments and 30% in Parliament and there appears to be a very minor increase in the order of 0.6% from one year to the next."
"The second interesting comment concerns the wage differential between men and women which, at European level, is hovering at the unacceptable level of 23% to 24% and, in some regions of Europe, is as high as 40%."
"The third interesting statistic concerns domestic violence, the violence which women suffer at European level."
"I fully accept the comments in the report and the recommendations by Members who have spoken of the need to change the nature of the report."
"I have taken your comments on board and I see that we need to concentrate on analysing data, especially the results of successful strategies and successful initiatives at national and European level, in order to give the report a strategic slant."
"However, I need your help here."
"My services face huge problems collecting data from national governments."
"There are several countries, although one could cite examples for all countries, where it is impossible for us to collect statistics, where it is impossible for us to collect their experiences and results at national level from innovative policies in time."
"I believe that, if you work together with your national governments, you can help the Commission to collate this data quickly, so that it in turn can present an analysis of them in the sort of report which you require."
"Finally, as far as enlargement is concerned, it is of course, as Mrs Péry has said, a question of acquis communautaire."
"However, I would stress that, in working with each of the candidate countries, we have been closely monitoring the question of sexual equality, as regards both the legislative framework and the creation of institutions which can support the application of these policies."
"As you know, we have starting signing joint reports with each candidate country in order to monitor their adjustment to employment policy on an annual basis."
"They contain an entire chapter devoted to the participation of women."
"I should like, once again, to thank Mrs Dybkjær for the excellent, in-depth work contained in her report, which will be most useful to us in our next report, and I should like especially to thank the French Presidency and Mrs Péry for being so pro-active on the issue of equality during their presidency."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
"Community customs code"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0254/2000), on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council Regulation amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code (6995/2000 - C5-0267/2000 - 1998/0134(COD)) (Rapporteur: Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi)."
"Mr President, Commissioner, this morning we will approve the Council common position definitively adopting this reform of the Community Customs Code."
"It could be thought, given that Parliament has not tabled amendments to the Council common position, that we have before us a perfect text."
"That is not the case, but it is a satisfactory text and, having given it great thought and following an extensive debate, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market decided not to table any amendments."
"What are the reasons for this?"
"We need a little history."
"The reform of the Community Customs Code was enshrined in Article 253 of the current code and a reform was planned for before 1 January 1998."
"We are therefore somewhat behind schedule."
"This reform is important because it aims to re-examine the Community Customs Code in accordance with the progress of the internal market and of administrative techniques."
"It is therefore an important and urgent reform in a sector that, as we are all well aware, is the real core of European construction. Building a common customs system has been one of the major achievements in that progress towards European construction."
"The proposal aims to simplify customs processes by means of computerised or paperless declarations, to make the rules more flexible, to improve the procedure for collecting duties and to provide a more solid basis for applying the principle of good faith to imports that are subject to the preferential regime, establishing legal instruments that enable us to combat fraud and offering greater legal security."
"At first reading, in the Paasilinna report, Parliament adopted thirteen amendments of varying importance, which also met a variety of fates when they subsequently went to the Council."
"In its joint position that was definitively and unanimously adopted, the Council incorporated eight amendments and rejected five."
"I am not going to comment on the eight amendments that were adopted, as we are all in agreement with them."
"I am going to discuss the five amendments that were not incorporated."
"Three of them - Amendments Nos 4, 5 and 7, referred to the commitology procedure."
"These amendments need to be considered in the new context of the interinstitutional agreement, and therefore, Parliament can agree to not insisting on these commitology amendments given that they have been superseded to a certain extent by the new interinstitutional framework."
"With Amendment No 15, Parliament wished to introduce a recital urging the customs authorities to apply customs rules correctly, to establish monitoring measures in order to ensure that it was applied consistently and to facilitate action against fraud."
"The Council considered that it was not drafted suitably in order to be included in the Community Customs Code and pointed out that there is a Green Paper - which is currently being converted into rules - specifically for combating fraud."
"We were therefore also able to accept this amendment not being incorporated."
"Finally, Amendment No 11 requested that this modification to the Community Customs Code enter into force before 1 January 2000 and is, therefore, no longer valid."
"Aside from these amendments, it should be considered that the common position modified the original text on which Parliament had agreed on two important points: the first is Article 220, in which the Commission aimed to maintain a longer period for conducting the investigations that could lead to a prosecution for fraud or a wrongful declaration."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, following a long debate, considered that it was not reasonable to maintain legal uncertainty for a period of six years, and that three years, which is the period set, is a more reasonable period of time for establishing, with the appropriate means and the average proceedings, whether or not there were irregularities in a declaration."
"With regard to the modification of Paragraph 6 of Article 215, it should be said that we are dealing with a deeper issue, because the intention is that the additional declaration could be made anywhere in the European Union, especially wherever in the European Union the undertaking in question has its headquarters."
"On this point we consider that, given administrative and technical advances, instead of making an amendment on the legislative text, we preferred an amendment to the draft resolution that I hope the Commission will be able to accept. In a subsequent reform of the Community Customs Code, this will enable this idea to be incorporated, which is one that we feel is important and deserves to be promoted and supported by the European Parliament."
"Mr President, in the increasingly open economic climate in which the European Union must operate, and given the need to establish trade relations that ensure the competitiveness of undertakings, it is crucial that we establish a legal framework that sets the same rules of play for everyone."
"In this sense, the Community Customs Code is an essential support for the European Union' s trade policy, as well, as we are already aware, as being an essential instrument for protecting the Union' s financial interests."
"The progress made on the internal market, the gradual growth in trade due to the increasing opening up of the markets and the progress of the information society mean that the Community Customs Code needs to be brought up to date with the development of Community and international trade."
"Hence the need for and the timeliness of the reform that was proposed at the time with the aim of simplifying and rationalising customs procedures, precisely in response to the demands of the new realities that I have mentioned."
"On the other hand, it was also necessary, as I understood it, to establish effective monitoring measures to ensure the uniform application of customs procedures across the whole of the Community and to prevent unfair competition and the opening up of loopholes that could facilitate fraud."
"At the time Parliament therefore introduced some amendments with the aim, on the one hand, of guaranteeing the possibility of conducting customs procedures by means of computerised declarations, but without this unwittingly opening up the back door to fraud. On the other hand, the aim was to ensure that customs rules were applied correctly and consistently across the whole of the Community, in order to prevent situations of unfair competition."
"As the rapporteur pointed out, however, neither the Council nor the Commission adopted the specific amendments that I have mentioned, because, among other reasons, they considered that they did not add anything to the proposed text and that fraud should be combated outside the Community Customs Code."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, as the rapporteur pointed out, accepted that approach, and therefore decided not to re-introduce the amendments."
"I personally continue to believe, however, that the text that was adopted by Parliament at the time responded much better to the new realities that had arisen from the internal market and the liberalisation of the markets, insofar as the elements of clarification and monitoring that were introduced by the amendments that were not adopted were a better guarantee that the rules would be complied with and that the same procedures would be followed when applying them."
"I must therefore regret that they were not taken into consideration, although I also understand the position of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market - the position of the rapporteur - of not re-introducing the amendments because, ultimately, what really matters is that the Community Customs Code and the proposed reforms move forward and that the legal framework is established."
"Let us hope that in the future we will at least be able to achieve those guarantees."
"Mr President, I believe that both the rapporteur and Mrs Ferrer have highlighted the main points of Parliament' s position and the legislative procedure to date, and they have pointed out how the Council, Parliament and the Commission have worked together in order to arrive at a text that is correct and acceptable to everyone."
"I think that, once again, the conciliation procedure, which means agreement between the institutions, is working properly."
"However, there is an amendment that the Council rightly rejected."
"It is Amendment No 15, on fraud."
"A Customs Code is not the place for establishing rules on fraud."
"That is something that depends on the correct functioning of administration and, clearly, in a legislative debate we should not be discussing the subject of fraud."
"Taking advantage of the fact that the Commissioner responsible for the internal market, Mr Bolkestein, is here, I would like to point out that a few years ago the European Parliament established its first committee of inquiry, which was to investigate fraud in the transport of goods."
"There was a report by Mr Bouwman, an excellent report that we adopted, in which considerable fraud was revealed, for example, in the case of tobacco."
"There were goods, particularly tobacco, which were entering through a non-Community country in the European Economic Area zone, going through the Community zone and then mysteriously leaving the Community zone on paper, but without actually leaving."
"Currently, for example, there has been a drop in the price of bananas in the European Union."
"It seems that multinational companies are placing their excess bananas, those that they do not sell in the United States and Europe, in Eastern Europe. From Eastern Europe, certain 'charitable' organisations, that is mafias, introduce these bananas, which were practically given to them, into the Community market, competing with the prices of legal importers and Community producers."
"We could also mention the ongoing fraud in tomatoes, in which we see prices being continually undervalued because goods are being introduced through certain Community ports without authorisation."
"Therefore, while recognising, as the Council and the Commission have said, that this amendment was not appropriate in this case, I would like to, once again, take the opportunity to point out that the procedures for monitoring imports in the European Union are not working, that fraud is being committed and that this fraud is not only bad for Community taxpayers, but also for the functioning of the internal market, and even for loyalty to third countries."
"If we want third countries to accept commitments, the European Community must be the most zealous in ensuring that its own rules are being complied with, because if a country has the opportunity to place products in the Community by means of smuggling, why is it going to bother to negotiate with us for any sort of concessions?"
"I therefore welcome the fact that we have reached an agreement on this subject."
"I think that the modifications are very positive, but I would like to take this opportunity to ask the Commission for greater vigilance and for stricter measures on fraud in Community customs."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, although it is true that the text is flawed, as the Chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and the rapporteur have already underlined, I would still venture to suggest that this legislative resolution is an example of transparent, simplified and efficient Community legislation."
"After all, in the Community Customs Code, a successful attempt has been made to harmonise and simplify legislation in a transparent manner, which surely must always be the objective."
"I can only applaud the Customs Code, and I am, therefore, somewhat more positive than Mrs Ferrer, for example, for it indeed forms the basis of various areas of Community policy within the framework of Community action of the national customs authorities."
"The goal to achieve simplified yet quality communication whilst building in a sufficient level of flexibility with regard to the basic rules, thus improving the procedure for collecting duties and offering a higher degree of adjustment of the provisions with regard to offering goods at customs, meets one of the requirements of the single market, and that has been achieved in this case, so much so, in fact, that many countries have drawn on this model in order to speed up the process to be able to take part in international trade."
"In broader terms, the Community Customs Code is one of the most important legal instruments for establishing the amount of outstanding duties and to establish to whom these are due."
"The code forms the legal basis for levying these duties and, as such, one of the key instruments for protecting the financial interests of the Community and for ensuring the smooth running of the Community policy in different areas."
"In short, I believe I can safely say that the administration now has all the possible levers at its disposal in order to fulfil its task efficiently and within the timeframe provided, and I assume that the European Parliament can invite the administration to make the results of this legislative resolution felt as soon as possible."
"Mr President, I would like to ask the Commission to adopt a position on the request made in the legislative resolution for the appropriate measures to be taken in order for there to be a modification of the Community Customs Code, as mentioned by Mr Beysen and as I have also expressed."
"Mr President, may I start by extending a warm thanks to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market for the work it has carried out on the basis of Mrs Palacio' s report This report encompasses all the questions which formed the subject of debate at first reading in March of last year."
"I welcome the major overtures which have been made with regard to this dossier, which has been the subject of long and intense discussions within the Council."
"I am pleased to note that it was possible to dismiss the reservations expressed by Parliament due to issues of comitology with regard to various proposals."
"This opens the door to a major reform of economic customs systems, on which, in fact, Parliament will be informed in detail in the next couple of months prior to approval."
"In the same way, the amendment tabled by Parliament regarding paperless declarations, adopted by the Council, will enable Member State customs authorities to have state-of-the-art automated administration equipment at their disposal."
"Thanks to the initiative taken by Parliament at first reading, the most wished-for outcome within economic circles was the compromise of good faith, as a result of which it will be possible to strike a better balance between the operators' need for legal certainty and the need for efficient protection of the financial interests of the Community."
"That has been, as is known, the outcome of a long debate in the Council, during which debate the Commission staunchly defended its view."
"It comes as no surprise that this point forms an integral part of the dossier and that the dossier has been approved unanimously."
"Taking into consideration the delicate position in which the dossier now finds itself, I am of the opinion that the outcome of a conciliation procedure, assuming that the debate were extended, would have been quite uncertain."
"It is true that the Commission would have wished to take matters one step further. But it can at the same time validate the result achieved and keep some points of its proposal in reserve, which can then be brought up for discussion again at the appropriate time."
"In this spirit, the Commission is able to endorse the positive balance-sheet of this legislative operation."
"It would like to thank Parliament and the committee chaired by Mrs Palacio, in particular, for the efforts made and interest shown by Parliament and the committee with regard to this dossier."
"Finally, in direct response to the question raised by both Mr Beysen and Mrs Palacio, I can confirm, on behalf of the Commission, that we will be only too pleased to meet and carry out that request."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
"(The sitting was suspended at 11.50 a.m. and resumed at 12.05 p.m.)"
"Vote"
"Mr President, I wanted to speak before you took that vote to explain why I wanted Members to vote against the amendment."
"Yesterday the whole position changed with the position the Commission has taken on the legal base."
"But it is too late now because you have just taken the vote and Members voted in favour of it."
"We will just have to press on."
"I am sorry about that."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Mr President, on that last vote, I would just like to inform the House that the Commission issued a press release yesterday and Commissioner Reding spoke last night to the effect that, as regards the report we have just passed and agreed on mobility for teachers, students, academics, others involved in education, and helping them to move around Europe to study, to work and everything else related to the education field, the Commission will not accept the amendments which ask them to do something to enforce these arrangements."
"We have exchanged all the happy words and have asked Member States to take action but the Commission, because of restrictions on its budget and reasons that it has given before, is now indicating that is not prepared to follow through to see how the measures are being implemented in the different countries, which to my mind rather neuters the whole report that Parliament spent a long time putting together."
"This is also very sad for thousands of students and others involved in education across Europe."
"I am sure the Commission and the House will have noted what you said."
"Welcome"
"It gives me great pleasure to welcome the President of the International Olympic Committee, Mr Juan Antonio Samaranch."
"The 27th Olympiad in Sydney, which has just ended, was regarded by everyone as a major success, attracting millions of spectators from all over the world."
"Mr Samaranch, we know you took up your post as IOC President in 1980, and since then, have introduced many important reforms."
"Sport should promote peace and human understanding, and I just want to mention a few important initiatives which have been taken under your presidency."
"Firstly, the integration of China into the Olympic Games; the institution of the Olympic truce; your insistence on participation in the games by all countries in the world, as well as from countries in conflict, a recent example of which is the participation of athletes from East Timor; the participation of women in the Olympic Games and in the different governing bodies has strengthened considerably under your presidency; and of course, the fact that the Olympic Games in Sydney were considered to have been drugs-free."
"Finally, I would like to mention the launch of the International Olympic Truce Centre in July 2000 in Athens which was created through a joint initiative of the International Olympic Committee and the Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs with a view to promoting the Olympic ideals."
"This centre is symbolically based in Greece where the first Olympics took place and where the next Olympic Games in 2004 will be held."
"Mr President, we are delighted to welcome you to the European Parliament and we hope you enjoy your visit."
"Vote (continuation)"
"Mr President, we are just about to start the vote on the Mann report and I want to draw your attention to the fact that there appears to be a translation problem in Amendment No 63 from the TDI Group."
"I note there it was submitted in Italian but in the English language it says that ""discrimination which requires men to wear a tie should be outlawed""."
"This must be a translation problem because I am certain that the TDI Group would not want to trivialise such an important piece of legislation on equal rights by introducing such a frivolous and unnecessary amendment."
"Perhaps you could get your services to check this."
"We will look into that."
"Mr President, this is on a mistake in translation too, though not as important as the one just mentioned."
"In Amendment No 24, the words 'difficulté injustifiée' in the French version are a mistranslation."
"I trust this will not change the way we vote, but the French translation really must be checked."
"The words in the English version are the authentic ones."

"I would like to start by congratulating the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, Mr Mantovani, on the substantial amendments he tabled to the Commission communication, a communication which, among other things, relates to the movement of young students and young researchers within the European Community."
"I said 'young', and therefore the pensioners and elderly people, whose interests I am trying to protect, should not have to concern themselves with this directive."
"But time waits for no man: one day the young people will become old people as well; the young researchers will also grow old and, it is to be hoped, pensioners."
"I therefore welcome the amendments which call upon the Commission to treat periods of study and research as if the students and researchers were paying social security contributions, as this will increase the pensions of students and researchers."
"Mr President, in my opinion, Robert J. Evans' s report is very important and I voted in favour of it."
"The right of freedom of movement of European citizens is still being violated in many ways."
"Students in particular often encounter barriers and difficulties in Member States that should no longer occur under EU legislation."
"Studies by the European Commission show that needless red tape is causing problems for students from other EU countries."
"Residence permits are granted for just short periods of time and it is awkward and costly to renew them."
"There are some unfortunate situations."
"In Spain students are required to deposit - in a Spanish bank account, note - special sums of money that act as a guarantee in order to rent accommodation."
"It is also complicated to arrange for students' families to move."
"Recently it came out that certain estate agents handling rented accommodation in London would not accept a foreign, for example, a Finnish, guarantor that ensured the Finnish student' s rent would be paid."
"European rights of citizenship do not seem to carry much weight in this situation."
"Mobility inside the European Union is one of the essential conditions for enabling European citizens to feel that they are full members of this Europe we are gradually building."
"This is more than a symbol; it is a reason, a driving force, for belonging to the European culture and model we are proclaiming."
"That is why I shall vote for this report."
"It lays down conditions to enable people travelling inside the Union to do so free from restrictions on their rights, their social security, or other benefits."
"This report is all the more important because it comes at a critical time for the European Union, a time of enlargement."
"Mobility for all, including nationals of third countries legally resident in Union territory and students and teachers acting independently - outside the Socrates and Leonardo programmes - is one of the fundamental values of the Union which we must uphold so that the candidate countries know exactly what kind of Union they will be joining."
"(PT) Despite the fact that the European Union recognises the rights of Member States' citizens to freedom of movement, to the provision of services and to residence, there is considerable difference between what the texts say and the reality experienced by many people. Examples of this are the disparities in health care cover, the risk of dual taxation, the random nature of social provision, the lack of recognition of professional qualifications and the complexity of legal texts, which make it very difficult for the ordinary man or woman to know exactly what their rights are."
"As the rapporteur said, the Commission appears to be aware that, unless concrete measures are adopted, certain fundamental freedoms that are enshrined in the Treaty, such as the right of residence and the right of free movement, are, in practice, in danger of becoming mere statements of principle."
"The Commission must therefore adopt ambitious measures to guarantee the right to reside and settle, and, amongst others, the right to work, the right to study and the right to have one' s qualifications recognised in Member States other than one' s own."
"- (SV) While in principle we adopt a positive view of the European Parliament and the Council' s recommendation on mobility within the Community, we would like to state the following:"
"We believe that, from the point of view of equality and justice, it is very important that third-country nationals resident within the EU should have the right to utilise the provisions of Community legislation on the same terms as the Union' s own citizens."
"We also believe that, to a great extent, the Member States themselves should be allowed to decide on the taxes to be collected."
"Healthy competition will reduce the tax burden on businesses, encouraging entrepreneurship and therefore the creation of job opportunities. In this way, the states' loss of income due to tax competition may be offset by the fact that more people are paying income tax."
"We are therefore opposed to Amendment 38 concerning the introduction of common tax regulations for volunteers."
"I strongly endorse this report from my colleague, Robert Evans, designed to boost mobility amongst students and others involved in training across the EU."
"He is right to emphasise the need for further action to overcome bureaucratic problems relating to residence rights and right to emphasise the needs of disadvantaged groups such as the disabled."
"I support his desire to see research workers included in the proposal and his comments about the importance of involving countries preparing to join the EU."
"I hope when this report comes back for second reading we are able to note that the Council has incorporated the rapporteur's sensible amendments."
"The two-fold approach of education and examinations for master craftsmen diplomas or certificates is prerequisite to future economic success."
"Mobility and life-long learning must go hand in hand with assuring a high standard of education for our young students and working people."
"Report Cashman (A5-0259/2000)"
"Mr President, I was prompted to vote for the Cashman report by the words of the Chairman of the Pensioners' Association of the municipality where I live - Curno, in the district of Bergamo, Italy - who said to me, 'We have absolutely no way of safeguarding the interests of the elderly."
"We would like to put forward proposals to prevent them being poorly treated as, sadly, frequently occurs, but we do not have the money to do so."
"Once a year, the mayor of the village invites us all to a lentil supper, similar to the lentil stew Jacob gave Esau in the Bible. That one meal is all we get the whole year, but there is nothing practical we can do about it.'"
"So, roll on the financing for the actions to combat age-discrimination provided for in the Cashman report. That is why I voted for the motion."
"We Independents welcome the action programme proposed by the Commission for fighting discrimination."
"But we vehemently reject the proposal submitted by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs to set up another special unit for the implementation of this programme."
"Discrimination cannot be tackled by creating additional administrative bodies; but solely by changing people' s attitudes."
"Communicating traditional values such as tolerance and respect for diversity can do far more to help achieve this goal than the most detailed annual report on the various forms of discrimination."
"Report Mann (A5-0264/2000)"
"Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party, I would like to draw two points requiring clarification to your attention."
"I will deal firstly with Amendment No 15."
"This amendment highlights a procedure concerning the acquis communautaire."
"The Association Agreements concluded between the European Union and the candidate countries, and those which have yet to be concluded, should incorporate regulations banning discrimination against groups protected under Article 13."
"It is all the more crucial for this step to be taken if certain candidate countries have minorities that require protection on the employment and occupation front."
"Secondly: Amendment No 18."
"The amendment refers to the fact that many Member States have provisions in place that could lead to discrimination against homosexuals seeking employment."
"However, the amendment does not emphasise the importance of criminal law provisions in dealing with such behaviour."
"It takes the form of a recommendation, in as much as it states that the Member States should annul these provisions."
"In phrasing it this way, the principle of subsidiarity is upheld."
"This does not fall within Europe' s sphere of competence."
"I was slightly disappointed that we did not have the opportunity to get majority support for the need to set a limit on the storage of documents."
"I had proposed six to twelve months."
"As I see it, that would be realistic in operational terms."
"I worked for companies for many years."
"We were unable to achieve this."
"What we did manage to achieve though, and what pleased me enormously, was that we were able to make it abundantly clear that special regulations must be introduced for religious communities, because we must make it possible for people to identify with the idea behind and the fundamental aims of these communities."
"We scored a major common victory there, to my mind, and we also finally managed to secure regulations benefiting the physically handicapped."
"I am delighted that people have been so willing to compromise today, as indeed our voting has shown."
"I would like to thank you all again most warmly for your excellent teamwork."
"Mr President, I have been a Member of the European Parliament for 15 months now."
"Today, 5 October 2000, did not start well, but it has become the happiest day of my time at Parliament, for today Amendment No 62 to Mr Thomas Mann's report has been adopted."
"I strongly supported this amendment, which reads: ""no discrimination as regards access to health care, welfare benefits, and economic assistance shall be permitted on the grounds of the age of a disabled person"" ."
"In my opinion, this is an extremely important result: it shows - if I may be permitted to rejoice at this, Mr President - that there is some point to my being here."
"I would like to thank the Members who helped and supported me - for I could not have achieved this result alone - Mr Speroni of the Lega Nord, Mr Thomas Mann, the rapporteur, from the European People's Party, Mrs Lambert of the Group of the Greens and Mr Helmer from the British Conservative Party."
"They have risen above party politics and shown that, when an amendment is right, they will support it, whoever the author."
"I have not voted for the Mann report because, while it is indeed necessary to seek equal treatment for people in employment and occupation, it is also necessary to refrain from pushing zeal to the point of abandoning all protection of freedoms and all respect for the rule of law."
"For example, Article 9(1) of the proposal for a directive, provides that when persons who consider themselves wronged because the principle of equal treatment has not been applied to them take action, they need only establish a presumption of discrimination before the court; making it incumbent on the defendant, that is, the employer, to prove wrongful accusation."
"This article has been slightly modified by an amendment from the European Parliament, which complicates the wording, but does not alter the general thrust."
"If this directive were adopted, it would then be up to the accused employer to prove his innocence, not up to the accuser to provide evidence for his claim."
"Thus, the usual principles of the rule of law are being gradually altered under the influence of an extremist approach to combating discrimination, with the European Parliament and Commission only too happy to join in and poke their noses into every national law."
"Yet again, we cannot approve of this shift, which is also going to be boosted by the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, because its present wording extends the anti-discrimination clause that the Treaty of Amsterdam has already introduced into European law."
"During the Treaty of Amsterdam negotiations we were delighted with the inclusion of Article 13 on discrimination on the grounds of sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age and sexual orientation."
"That kind of provision bears witness to the Community' s commitment to promote a more just, more egalitarian society, and above all, it has opened the way to appropriate Community action aimed at contributing to the fight against discrimination in general."
"It means the efforts made by the Community to promote gender equality can be completed by attacking new grounds for discrimination."
"It gives new and significant impetus to Community action in an area where a certain legislative acquis and fruitful cooperation with civil society exist."
"That is the basis on which measures to combat discrimination have been adopted."
"The proposals consist of two draft directives, covering discrimination in employment and discrimination based on race and ethnic origin, and an action programme intended to support the efforts of the Member States."
"As regards the parallel directive on equal treatment irrespective of race or ethnic origin, the Council succeeded in reaching political agreement after the European Parliament revised its opinion on the issue."
"We have therefore had to vote on the directive on equal treatment in employment and the 2001/2006 Action Programme."
"To explain my votes, I would first say that the right to equal treatment and protection against discrimination is a fundamental human right."
"But while this right has been recognised, it is very far from being converted into reality, hence the advantage of adopting determined and coordinated measures at European level."
"As regards the Mann report on equal treatment in employment, I shall limit myself to emphasising my satisfaction that the grounds for derogation have been successfully reduced to the minimum."
"Otherwise the door would be opened to abuses contrary to the aim of this directive."
"Certain possibilities remain and I have to admit I am unhappy about them."
"These are the grounds for derogation in matters of religion."
"The provision for derogation on religious grounds on the basis of the notion of essential and direct occupational requirements carries the risk of broad interpretation."
"As a confirmed secularist, I cannot associate myself with that."
"Similarly, I am concerned about the derogations authorised on the basis of age, as older people are particularly at risk of discrimination in relation to employment."
"As regards the action programme to fight discrimination, the European Commission' s proposal was broadly satisfactory."
"There were some deplorable gaps and inaccuracies which have been corrected, with my support."
"I felt it was essential to broaden the scope of the programme in order to ensure the implementation of Article 13 of the Treaty."
"I am also very pleased that harassment will in future be regarded as a form of discrimination and that there is recognition that discrimination must be prevented, not just combated."
"It was important to reaffirm the need to associate the candidate countries with this programme."
"Everyone is well aware of the problems faced by certain minorities in those countries."
"My final comment relates to the budget for this programme, EUR 98.4 million. That figure is obviously inadequate given the actions envisaged."
"In conclusion, I support the spirit of these proposals and I have voted for most of them, the exception being where they are in contradiction with my secularism."
"The proposal for a directive on equal treatment in employment and occupation before us today is a response to a demand long expressed by the European Parliament, and our group in particular."
"It is actually one of three parts of a package of measures on combating discrimination based on the new Article 13, introduced by the Treaty of Amsterdam, and includes a Community action programme."
"These texts should, then, fill a glaring gap in the construction of Europe: recognition of the real needs of people excluded or marginalised in our societies because of disability, age, or membership of a minority."
"The texts therefore represent some of the first steps towards the people' s Europe that we have wanted for so long."
"So, I enthusiastically support this proposal for a directive and the very positive amendments proposed by our rapporteur to improve its effectiveness."
"In so doing, I wish to stress the importance of the amendments to improve the protection of people with disabilities by clarifying the terms 'reasonable accommodation' of the workplace and 'undue hardship' for the employer, and those toughening the ban on discrimination against older people who freely choose to go on working - 63% of Europeans aged 55-64 do not work - and those strengthening the vital autonomy of management and the unions as well as the crucial role of social dialogue in actually implementing equal treatment in businesses."
"In parallel, the amendment extending the exception to the principle of non-discrimination to the wider 'social' activities of religious organisations, where the discrimination is solely based on religious conviction and on no other grounds, is a reinforcement of the specific nature and original contribution of these structures as compared with public or private services."
"On the other hand, the amendments providing for penalties against companies infringing the principle of equal treatment by excluding them from public contracts seem to me both poorly adapted to the purpose and subject to divergent interpretation."
"In addition, they open the door to distortions in competition between businesses in different European Union countries."
"That is why I wish to express reservations on that point, while voting in favour of the text as a whole."
"The SNP welcomes this directive and its aim to end discrimination in the workplace."
"The unfair treatment of workers on the grounds of race, religious belief, disability, age or sexual orientation can in no way be justified in a modern and socially just Europe."
"This directive gives Member States a great opportunity to enhance the rights of workers across the European Union."
"The SNP is pleased to support this legislation, which is in line with our party's policies of ending discrimination in all its guises and of positively backing measures to ensure equality of treatment for all citizens."
"Moreover the SNP sees this legislation as a means to fulfil the underlying objectives of the European Union in recognising that equality in the field of employment helps combat social exclusion and assists the EU's aims of permitting the free movement of its citizens."
"Amendment No 18: the directive under discussion concerns a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation and the over-generalised wording in Amendment No 18 is not relevant in all aspects to this directive."
"It is manifestly clear from the justification for the amendment that the purpose is also to interfere in provisions on age that apply in Member States, which, in any case, are fully justified for reasons of psychological development, and they do not have any kind of impact in the job market."
"For these reasons I voted against the amendment, although discrimination in employment and occupation in all its forms must be opposed."
"Amendment No 37: the form the committee have proposed for Article 4.2 of this directive is good and could ensure there is a significant degree of continuity in the wider social activities of religious organisations, which is a basis for all European socio-political thinking, and is still an important part of its activity in practice."
"In addition, the wording proposed by the committee reconfirms the vitality of the individual culture and customs of small, immigrant communities, among others."
"For these reasons I voted in favour of the amendment."
"Our colleague, Thomas Mann, has invested a great deal of work in a report on the proposal for a Council directive establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation."
"His report was adopted unanimously in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"However, we then had 13 improvement amendments to consider, in addition to the 60 contained in the Mann report on the directive proposed by the Commission."
"There is a saying we would do well not to ignore in our efforts to amend the Commission proposals, which are actually well thought through as a rule, and this is how it goes 'what is better is the enemy of what is good' ."
"That is only common sense in fact."
"One could not help but wonder if common sense had always prevailed in the drafting of certain, no doubt well-meaning, proposed amendments that were now before us."
"If the directive is to be adopted and implemented, it must not be encumbered with a literary approach and wishful thinking, which have no place in a legal document."
"That is most certainly true of the amendment which proposes that this directive should end the sexually discriminatory practice of stipulating that only male personnel can wear a tie."
"If absurdity could kill then the authors of such an amendment would definitely no longer be with us."
"I think it is also going too far to expect employers to provide statistics on all aspects of their employment of people falling within the scope of this directive."
"The authorities already have their work cut out."
"This brings to mind another sound rule of thumb: 'no one can achieve the impossible' ."
"I also think that we can do without the entire contents of the new Article 12 (a)."
"The Commission rightly refrained - on the basis of the subsidiarity principle, of course - from instructing the Member States to set up new institutions for monitoring the application of the principle of equal treatment, which could be consulted by every conceivable, and inconceivable, group of people or association etc, requesting free handling of their complaints, and which could even be granted access to confidential personnel files."
"Despite all the inconsistencies and superfluous proposals, which do nothing to help the cause, I did not want to vote against the report at the final vote."
"But here too, I feel that 'less would have been more' , and the Commission proposal, without the superfluous amendments, is the better and more logical instrument for ensuring equal treatment in employment and occupation, which is, after all, what we want."
"I warmly welcome this proposal to establish a framework to combat discrimination and ensure equal treatment in employment."
"The areas covered are access to employment and occupation, vocational training, promotion, employment conditions and membership of certain bodies."
"The proposal covers both direct and indirect discrimination."
"Harassment is also included within the definition of discrimination."
"With regard to disability, the principle of equal treatment entails the identification and removal of barriers in the way of persons with disabilities who, with reasonable accommodation, are able to perform the essential functions of a job."
"While the proposal continues to allow differences of treatment on the grounds of age they have to be objectively justified."
"The proposal also allows positive action to redress gender imbalance."
"These proposals deserve the serious attention of the Member States and the other Community Institutions."
"The EPLP has voted for the Mann report on equal treatment in discrimination because it is firmly committed to the principle of combating unjustified discrimination and is broadly supportive of the overall objectives behind this proposal."
"However the EPLP has strong reservations about the following areas."
"On disability, whilst we welcome the principle of the proposals, the UK are justly proud of our own disability discrimination legislation, but we do not want to impose our model on other Member States."
"However, we do want to ensure the directive lets us continue with the approach in the Disability Discrimination Act, although we recognise that some relatively minor changes may be required."
"On age, the EPLP welcomes the principle of fighting age discrimination in employment and training."
"This is a very complex area and the proposals are far-reaching and ambitious."
"However, we feel it is important that the Community has legislation which is clear and workable."
"On religion/belief, the EPLP welcomes the principle of protection on these grounds."
"For the UK this would end the anomaly whereby two non-major Christian groups (Jews, Sikhs), receive protection both from direct and indirect discrimination under the UK Race Relations Act as they are recognised by the courts as ethnic groups as well as religious groups."
"Under some circumstances, Muslims receive protection, but only in cases of indirect discrimination, whilst Afro-Caribbean Muslims, white Muslims and indeed Christians, receive no protection at all."
"However, the UK is one of the most religiously diverse populations in the European Union, so it is important that the proposals are right."
"The EPLP is concerned to ensure that the directive will permit Section 60 of the UK Schools Standard and Framework Act 1998 to remain unaltered."
"On sexual orientation, we welcome the principle of the Commission's proposals to fight discrimination on this ground."
"Further Concerns:"
"Much of the text will need further clarification before it is finalised."
"We have concerns about the unclear definitions of 'reasonable accommodation' and 'undue hardship' in Article 2(4), and the possible contradiction with the public procurement directives in the amendment on Article 55."
"Several areas of difference with the race directive should be eliminated, such as the definition of indirect discrimination in Amendment No 21, the defence of rights in Article 8, the text on victimisation in Article 10, and Article 11 covering dissemination of information."
"We also feel that the directive should be clear about which differences of treatment on the grounds of age are permissible and which are not."
"We have concerns about several elements which appear to be overburdensome: notably application of the legislation to volunteer workers in charities and to public posts, and also compulsory collection and monitoring of statistics."
"We are concerned about the inclusion of health, social security and assistance as there are considerable national differences in how these matters are handled and whether they form part of the employee/employer relationship."
"There are also elements which, we feel, should be left to Member States such as overall implementation, provision of training to particular age groups of workers, the nature of a mediation system, and how SMEs are to interpret the directive."
"Finally, some elements should be permissive rather than mandatory to cater for different Member State practices."
"We believe that the negations to come will provide an opportunity to tackle these issues and we look forward to enactment of the directive and the benefits it will bring to workers in the UK and other EU countries."
"I voted against these reports because they enshrine within them the principle that sex perversion is elevated onto the level of holy marriage and sex only within the marriage bond."
"They also discriminate against people and organisations who believe the Holy Scriptures to be the Word of God, the only infallible Rule of Faith and Practice, forcing such believers to employ those who propagate and practise acts of sex totally against the scriptural ethics."
"It is on this issue alone that I voted no."
"Broadly speaking, the Christian Democrats welcome the proposal for a directive establishing a general framework for employment equality."
"However, we feel that the committee' s amendment concerning statistics divided according to target group - i.e. based on the existing reasons for discrimination, such as race, ethnic origin, age, religion or belief, as well as sexual orientation - is far too great a violation of integrity."
"We have therefore decided to vote against this amendment, but we support the report as such."
"Report Van Hulten (A5-0260/2000)"
"I have abstained on the van Hulten report because I do not think we should increase the number of controlling authorities within the European institutions."
"This 'control frenzy' actually leads to officials being freed from responsibility, to a situation where everyone tries to palm off responsibility on the controllers, and the controllers of the controllers."
"The European Union suffers from a bad image among many citizens."
"Rapporteur Van Hulten expressed the following view in an interview with a Dutch weekly magazine, ""It is called Europe, it is in Brussels and is corrupt."""
"Thanks to the action taken by a ""whistle blower"" and the Committee of Wise Men, corruption has been brought out into the open."
"In the interview, Mr Van Hulten is right in saying that we will not be able to draft a positive agenda until we have solved problems such as fraud, waste, but also a lack of efficiency and effectiveness in decision-making."
"The financial reform, more specifically the establishment of an internal audit department, is conducive to the European Union' s effectiveness."
"Rapporteur Van Hulten is right in filling in the gaps in the Commission proposal: what is needed is a clear definition of the distribution of responsibilities between financial control and internal audit."
"But if Mr Van Hulten would like to dedicate himself to an efficient and effective Union, we, along with the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets, cannot see why he should exempt smaller institutions, such as the Committee of the Regions, from internal audit duty."
"This view is at the expense of transparency of the financial regulation."
"Naturally the number of transactions in the smaller institutions is smaller than in the large ones - the 800 000 transactions performed annually in the Commission eclipse the 10 000 transactions performed annually in the Committee of the Regions."
"But this only says something about the staffing levels of the internal audit department and nothing about the financial significance and hence usefulness of such a department."
"This is the reason why I have applied for split voting on Amendment No 3. In this way, it will still be possible to include the obligation of an internal audit department in the proposal."
"Although the rapporteur shares my view that all institutions must be given equal treatment, he would like to postpone this equal treatment until the definitive review of the financial regulation in eighteen months' time."
"In my view, if the opportunity presents itself to step up efficiency within the EU institutions, each day that passes while we are waiting is one too many."
"To set up an internal audit office in the institutions will naturally require effort, but that effort will remain the same, whether it is made now or in the future."
"The image of Europe is not served by the efficient operation of the large EU institutions alone; in many respects, it is probably the small ones that make all the difference."
"Report Titley (A5-0211/2000)"
"I am sure, in common with all my colleagues, we support the proper management and control of arms exports in the European Union."
"We have many examples of how uncontrolled and unscrupulous arms exports have exacerbated many of the conflicts in the past century and even into the present time."
"We, in Europe, along with our colleagues across the globe, have to see that the mistakes and greed of the past are not repeated."
"The reasons of my vote on this report relate, in the main, to the question of closer European Union relations with NATO and also the onward rush to a common defence policy."
"Many will speak about peace and conflict resolution while at the same time will be making deals to sell arms to combatants."
"If this two-faced policy were stopped then many of the difficulties could be overcome."
"As stated at the outset, I am in favour of greater control over arms exports, but this issue should not be confused with other political initiatives."
"Even if we sympathise with the idea of regulating the European production and export of arms politically, we are sceptical about the Titley report, mainly for the following reasons."
"There is no link between the development of the arms industry and EU cooperation in the area of military policy."
"The EU has decided to develop a joint military capacity in order to fulfil the so-called Petersberg objectives (crisis management and conflict resolution outside the territory of the EU), but it has no common defence policy."
"The individual EU countries are members of NATO and the WEU, or else are non-aligned."
"Policy on arms exports must start from that point, and a distinction must be made between supervising an arms industry developed for political reasons (namely crisis management) and arms exports for purely commercial reasons. In our view, such exports ought to be kept to a minimum and, in the long term, completely abolished."
"We are particularly opposed to the wording of Paragraph R and Paragraph 1 d) and e) of the report, to the effect that the development of arms exports should lead to the development of a common defence policy and the establishment of a defence identity within NATO, and that the arms industry should benefit from the EU' s developing a common code of conduct on arms exports."
"We welcome the initiative for codes of conduct for arms exports."
"Many of Mr Titley' s proposals and comments in the report represent improvements to the Council' s original report."
"Nonetheless, we have decided to vote against Mr Titley' s report for the following reasons:"
"The report means continued recognition of the importance of a strong European military capacity instead of placing the emphasis on the need for disarmament and peace."
"The report sees arms export controls primarily as a method of avoiding awkward situations for Europe' s military industry and not as a way of achieving disarmament and peace."
"Moreover, the report discusses European arms exports as a way of solving future local conflicts in the immediate vicinity of Europe."
"Despite the request from the Group of the Greens, the rapporteur has also consistently failed to discuss Turkey which, through its membership of NATO, is in practice excluded from the codes of conduct."
"The report also means that Europe' s war industry is regarded as an economically important industry, and that is an indefensible perspective on an industry whose primary task is implicitly to kill and annihilate people."
"As long as the European Parliament is unable to make the logical connection between the production and sale of arms and the continued global military destruction of the environment and human life, we cannot support reports such as this."
"support this report from my colleague, Gary Titley, and agree with him that responsible arms trade practices form part of the ""acquis communautaire"" and therefore candidate countries should be actively involved in the further development of the Code of Conduct on arms exports and that this should be legally binding."
"I particularly share his view that there is a need to establish common rules and effective EU controls to combat illegal arms trafficking and to control the legal trade in small arms and light weapons."
"I trust the Member States will give this considered and early attention."
"The world would be a safer place without weapons."
"I am therefore in favour of a code of conduct which renders it impossible to produce and export arms and which results in arms factories switching over to the production of useful commodities."
"From this perspective, I have read Mr Titley' s proposals and examined to what extent his text contributes to a world of peace without weapons."
"In general terms, I endorse the small steps forward, even if they do not, by any means, completely lead to the solutions put forward by myself."
"It is a different matter if such a small step forward puts a spanner in the works when it comes to reaching real solutions."
"I believe that the choice today is not between complete freedom in the arms trade and this code of conduct."
"If these were the two options, I would endorse the code of conduct as the lesser of the two evils, the underlying rationale being that something is better than nothing."
"However, the real choice is between this code of conduct and a complete ban."
"The code of conduct is based on the assumption that the arms trade will continue to exist and that European arms production must be promoted."
"The excrescences are being regulated because it is they that draw attention and instil indignation."
"The issue of the arms trade itself remains out of range."
"To me, this is a reason not to support the code of conduct."
"- (SV) It is good that the European Union wishes to implement a code of conduct to restrict arms exports."
"However, I cannot accept the introduction of the requirement of a common defence policy and a European security and defence policy within NATO."
"Sweden is neutral and does not intend to enter into any defence alliance."
"Consequently, I cannot support these viewpoints, expressed either in Recital R or in Paragraphs 1 c, 1 d and 1 e."
"France, Germany and Great Britain, together with the USA, are the main arms dealers feeding the planet' s conflicts: in Africa, where 10 states are at war, and in Asia, between India and Pakistan."
"The European states have sold arms to Indonesia, whose army is implicated in the massacres in Timor and the Moluccas."
"France is selling helicopters to Turkey, which is waging war against the Kurdish people, and aircraft to China and Taiwan, not to mention the scandal of the famous Taiwan frigates."
"In the recent past, France was an accomplice to the genocide in Rwanda by delivering any amount of small arms to the regime perpetrating the massacres."
"No one has yet insisted that the European Union and France answer for that."
"The resolution is not seeking to reduce arms sales radically to promote a policy of disarmament, but just to regulate them in order to guarantee greater profits for the industrial groups."
"There is no such thing as a bloodless war."
"There are only wars that kill."
"This hypocritical resolution seeks the implementation of a 'European code of conduct' while simultaneously declaring that the defence industry is 'economically and strategically important for the EU' ."
"We take the view that the restructuring of the defence industry should not be motivated by the political ambition to create a common defence policy, but by the strategic and industrial requirements of the major companies and Member States involved."
"On this basis, link-ups between European and North American companies are as much to be welcomed as between European companies."
"While we can support a code of conduct which sets out a level playing field with a set of rules to which we can all voluntarily adhere, we do not wish to encumber industry with more unnecessary regulations."
"In particular, we do not support the proposal, in Paragraph 9 of the resolution, that the code of conduct should be made legally binding."
"Our objections to this are four-fold: the possibility of yet another range of activities being justiciable in the European Court of Justice is opened up; the possibility of obtaining agreement by other arms exporting countries outside the EU to an international code of conduct will be that much more difficult and unattractive if it is legally binding; if legal sanctions are involved there is a danger that some of those involved in the arms trade will be less open in their activities; there may be reluctance by some countries to place arms orders with European states which are encumbered by legislation, particularly when a long-term after-sales support relationship may be involved."
"While there is much that we can agree with in this resolution there are a number of fundamental flaws and this is why we have abstained in our vote."
"Report Angelilli (A5-0258/2000)"
"Children are the first victims of violence on television."
"We all now recognise the impact and the harm which the daily and increasing bombardment of violent television programmes and similar multimedia products wreaks on young people, who are less discerning because their critical faculties are not fully developed."
"The Commission text and the report contain a number of accurate findings as regards the adverse impact on the psychological makeup and developing personality of children and, consequently, on the dangers in store for tomorrow' s society as the result of their watching these programmes and using these products."
"However, their proposals are confined to watersheds and programme classification and, in adopting the Oxford University report on television programme filtering devices, which parents have to buy before they can use them to protect their children, are targeted specifically at digital and subscriber television."
"Once again, the delicate and sensitive issue of the protection of our children, i.e. the members of tomorrow' s society, are being hijacked by commercialisation and the profit motive."
"The entire onus of protecting children is on the parents and the question of the actual production and broadcasting of programmes which are harmful to children is hardly even touched on."
"And, assuming that they can afford these filtering devices, how are parents supposed to protect their children from so-called children' s programmes, the majority of which contain scenes of violence and some of which are scarier than horror films?"
"And how are they supposed to protect them from the violence which inundates multimedia products and the Internet?"
"The Commission communication acknowledges the problem but proposes no specific measures because it is blinkered by the philosophy of market liberalisation and competition, and any proposals which it makes fail to get to the heart of the harsh reality - a reality especially harsh on children - of the unaccountability of multinationals which, in their lust for profit, are indifferent to the impact which their programmes and products have and which not only shift the entire responsibility to parents but even expect them to buy new products to protect their children."
"The only reference to companies is to do with a code of self-regulation."
"We do agree with a number of interesting proposals on protecting children in the Angelilli report, such as the need for a detailed study into the moral and legal aspects of the protection of minors."
"I have today voted against Roberta Angelilli' s report on the communication from the Commission on an investigation concerning parental control of television broadcasting."
"If I do so, it is not because I am opposed to the report as such but because I should like to send a clear signal to the effect that the EU and the Commission should concentrate on their core tasks."
"It is not a task for the EU but for the Member States to take initiatives in this area."
"There are enough other pressing tasks for the Commission to expend its energies on."
"I welcome the main provisions of this report, which highlights once again the importance that the European Parliament attaches to the protection of our young children in Europe."
"This report confirms that it is in the public interest to protect children from viewing excessive television violence and other programmes that may produce harmful effects."
"The subject of this report is both highly specific and highly complex."
"Any further analysis of specific technology such as filtering systems will have to take account of the advances in technology which are evident today."
"This report is based on the principle of common sense."
"It is premised on the need for television broadcasting to take responsibility for the protection of minors by means of a self-regulatory code which should apply throughout the European Union."
"A committee of experts will also be constituted at a European Community level with the mandate of drawing up a memorandum setting out general principles for the protection of minors in the media context."
"It is now incumbent on the European Commission and the European Parliament and all interested parties to work together to see how best young people can be protected from viewing excessive television violence. I would hope that the key television broadcasting organisations, both from the private and the public sector within the European Union, will engage positively in this process."
"Certainly we must recognise that technology is changing rapidly within the television sector within Europe."
"Digitalisation of old analogue television networks is taking place across the length and breadth of the participating Member States of the EU."
"This, too, will lead to greater challenges for legislators to put in place the necessary protective measures to guarantee that young children are protected from viewing wholly violent and inappropriate television programmes."
"I will be working closely at national European level to ensure that EU governments implement the necessary legislation to put in place the necessary protective mechanisms which I have addressed."
"TV is now an essential part of daily life."
"With viewing averaging three hours per day, it is the most extensive human activity after sleep and - for adults - work."
"Changes at work, like more working women and more flexible hours, mean children are increasingly left alone with the small screen."
"There are various solutions, but none is satisfactory."
"A self-regulation code for professionals is an excellent solution, however."
"I feel that this is the right direction."
"As the rapporteur has stressed, parental control must not end with TV."
"Children are also great consumers of the Internet and video games."
"The approach must include all forms of image transmission."
"I have voted firmly in favour of Mrs Angelilli' s report. She spells out the difficulties of operating at Community level, when every Member State has its own history and its own special relationship with its national television."
"Individual cultural features are reflected in the content of programmes. Furthermore, the definitions of child and minor differ from one legal system to another."
"I also support the amendments from the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party which contribute useful details on 'who does what' ."
"I should like to congratulate Mrs Angelilli on the proposals in her report on developing control mechanisms to protect children from watching violent and other broadcasts which are unsuitable for their age."
"I agree with them completely; however, I should like to point out that this is a minor issue at a time when there is a major issue at stake. What I mean is that these proposals are contained in a non-binding Commission communication, while the binding ""Television without frontiers""; directive (97/36/ÅC) to which they refer is being infringed time and again by almost every Member State."
"Under these circumstances, it is essential that all the Member States comply with Community legislation as quickly as possible."
"Furthermore, I have ascertained from a personal investigation in the relevant Commission services that eight Member States (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Portugal, Sweden, Spain and the UK) are applying Community legislation, while the rest (France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands and Luxembourg) are infringing it one way or another."
"I also agree with my fellow Member that these measures should not be confined solely to television and should also apply to the Internet, which no longer has any reason to ""envy"" television, now that its multiple applications include film projections."
"If all these proposals are to be translated from theory into practice, we need to create filtering and classification mechanisms which allow parents to select the programmes which are suitable for their children."
"Encouraging industry to move in this direction through international collaboration and increasing parents' , teachers' and children' s awareness will act as a catalyst."
"Report Dybkjær (A5-0198/2000)"
"This third annual report on equal opportunities for women and men in the European Union sets out the highlights and successes of the year 1998."
"It must be said that although equality between women and men has been proclaimed by law, the facts are there to remind us that the discrimination and difficulties women face unfortunately persist."
"Women are the most vulnerable to unemployment."
"The 1998 report makes a special study of the phenomenon of unemployment and the economic impact of under-employment of women."
"It also analyses the measures taken to incorporate employment policies strictly focused on women or policies to restrict gender discrimination in employment, for example, in employment contracts, types of employment and remuneration."
"Moreover, women are often in 'flexible' jobs; temporary contracts and low salaries are typical in sectors where women employees are in a majority."
"Women' s careers are often unstable, and they can only acquire experience with difficulty."
"That situation is often illustrated by low levels of social protection and precarious living conditions."
"Women are also over-represented in 'typically female' occupations but under-represented in jobs with responsibility and in the professions."
"Furthermore, women are not as well represented as men in rapidly growing sectors such as information and communications technologies, with women tending to occupy the lowest level in the hierarchy."
"It is therefore crucial to restore balance by establishing education and training policies specifically geared to young women."
"Gender disparity is also prevalent when it comes to wages and salaries. Figures available for 1995 show that for the European Union as a whole, the hourly wage for a woman is only 73% of that for a man doing equal work."
"I therefore fully support the rapporteur in urging the Commission to pursue its efforts and in particular to strengthen the 'strategic' nature of its annual reports, by assessing the effectiveness of policy initiatives rather than contenting itself with describing them."
"I also think it is necessary to stress that Community standards of respect for women' s rights and equal opportunities should be implemented in the candidate countries even before they join."
"Finally, I invite the Member States to pursue the dual strategy advocated at Community level, involving mainstreaming and specific actions for women."
"Interestingly, this is the first time that the need for the Commission' s annual reports to go further in its evaluation of the efficacy of political initiatives has been identified."
"What we have before us is a motion which, although not lacking in proposals for studies and research, stops well short of a real approach which will highlight crucial problems not yet resolved and the new problems which are beginning to threaten existing rights and achievements, together with their real causes."
"Women are still one of the most vulnerable sections of society, whose rights are rudely trampled underfoot by the current social and economic system."
"That is what we should have acknowledged first, then we would not have had such a knee-jerk report singing praises and dispensing declarations of intent."
"Equal opportunities at work, equal social participation, equality in health and elsewhere are impossible within a framework of reactionary policies offensive to human dignity as a whole, without equal social prospects, in a society of unemployment and underemployment, with no welfare state, a society in which human values are costed and commercialised."
"Social rights and social achievements are not expanding; on the contrary, they are increasingly being eroded on the grounds that they are too expensive."
"The flexible, elastic forms of employment generously offered to women are not a sign of progress; they are sleights of hand by the economically powerful in a bid to counteract the economic crisis and safeguard competitiveness and excessive profits at the expense of workers and women."
"And the first victims are women, who still get less pay for the same work, who still tend to occupy inferior, unskilled jobs, who face more problems and who have unequal access to the job market."
"They are the first to fall foul of cuts in public spending, privatisation of the health sector, the right to health care and medical attention - never mind the right to prevention and information programmes."
"They work in conditions which are bad for their physical, mental and spiritual health, conditions which affect women more than men because they have to juggle so many duties and take on double and triple social roles."
"Even the report acknowledges that, ""In addition to their general failure to substantiate the impact of policies and programmes, the reports also fail to discuss the factors behind continuing inequality."""
"How can progress in resolving women' s problems and offering them institutional protection against all forms of discrimination be planned and strengthened within the framework of a social and economic system which commercialises and subjects everything to the rigours of public financial policy and the quest for greater profit?"
"A policy of fundamental protection for women cannot be implemented unless we redirect and radically restructure our social development model."
"In the face of plans and practices to exploit and oppress, in the face of discriminatory tactics, we call on women to enforce and claim their demands together with men within the framework of a wide grass-roots battle front in each individual country."
"Although it has some positive points, this motion merely skirts round the problem."
"We fear that its proclamations and good intentions are, yet again, no more than 'lame excuses' ."
"That concludes the vote."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.06 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Topical and urgent debate"
"The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance."
"Peru"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B5-0777/2000, by Mr Medina Ortega and others, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the crisis in Peru;"
"B5-0780/2000, by Mr Di Pietro, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, on the situation in Peru;"
"B5-0784/2000, by Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra, on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on the crisis in Peru;"
"B5-0790/2000, by Mr Lipietz and Mr Nogueira Román, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/ European Free Alliance, on the crisis in Peru;"
"B5-0792/2000, by Mr Marset Campos and Mr Di Lello Finuoli, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on the crisis in Peru."
"Mr President, I have here a speech I gave on 9 April 1992, in which I referred to the coup, the so-called self-inflicted coup, by President Fujimori, and at the time I said that it was not acceptable for a democratically elected president to relinquish his legitimacy by relying on the armed forces."
"Since the last electoral farce, Fujimori has lost his legitimacy and not only that, but he has lost the political support that he previously had."
"At the moment, the question that arises is the future of Peru, of knowing whether the country will be able to get out of the difficult situation in which Mr Fujimori has now placed it."
"Various political groups have presented a joint draft resolution in which we basically ask President Fujimori to go, but to do so in such a way that, through a process of clean and democratic elections, democracy can be consolidated in that country."
"Secondly, we ask the institutions of the European Union to help the democratic process in Peru, which is something that they are capable of doing."
"We are also asking for a delegation from the European Parliament to go to Peru in order to monitor the development of events on the ground."
"We hope that Fujimori does not make things worse, that he makes this transition possible and that in Peru there will not be the same situation as there currently is in Belgrade, with a popular uprising that is practically on the streets."
"Therefore, I think that if the European institutions and the European Parliament help the Peruvian people at this difficult time, we could contribute to the stability of the country and to the consolidation of democratic institutions across Latin America."
"Mr President, Peru is currently going through a period of uncertainty, and we all cherish the hope that the current situation will be resolved through a process in which all civil and political rights are guaranteed, which will help to strengthen and consolidate democracy and peace in Peru, a country that has suffered 25 000 deaths in the last fifteen years."
"The European Union, which is the leading cooperating country in economic terms and the main investor in Peru, with figures exceeding 6 000 million dollars in the last seven years, must maintain its cooperation based on the democratic clause established in the third and fourth generation agreements with the countries of the Andean Pact. These are based on universally recognised principles of respect for pluralist democracy, the rule of law and human rights."
"Also, the European Union must, with maximum care, invite all the Peruvian democratic forces to take part in dialogue in order to achieve commitments guaranteeing the exercise of civil and public rights and freedom of expression."
"Mr President, we are delighted to have confirmation of what we predicted in a recent vote."
"The European Parliament firmly rejected the election of Mr Fujimori and I am pleased to see honourable Members in the two main groups committing themselves clearly to strong European Parliament support for establishing democracy in Peru."
"But we are concerned about the fate of Mr Montesinos."
"The right of asylum cannot be used to protect criminals."
"The whole world rejoiced when the international resolutions finally began to work against one former dictator, Mr Pinochet."
"Mr Montesinos cannot be allowed to find refuge in Panama or, as some rumours are beginning to suggest, in Morocco."
"He should be brought to trial on the grounds of torture, drug-trafficking and the rest by any state where he seeks refuge."
"Mr President, the Peruvian people' s desire for peace, democracy, justice and well-being is coming closer to being realised with the resignation of Mr Fujimori."
"The adverse effect that North American backing for him has had on those desires must be neutralised by another influence, a positive influence in favour of human rights and full democratic progress, coming from the European Union."
"For this reason, we feel it is necessary to highlight two aspects of the joint resolution that we are presenting."
"The first aspect is that the European Union should deny asylum - and not negotiate with other countries either - to a figure such as Montesinos, who is responsible for terrible crimes against humanity."
"The second is that a delegation should be sent from the European Parliament to Peru with the purpose of assessing the prospects for democratic progress and for peacefully overcoming the present problems, so that our contribution will be a very positive one."
"Mr President, I would prefer it if, for once, we could have a debate on Latin America following well-prepared discussions in the committees, rather than it being part of some urgent procedure or other."
"It seems to me that we only ever deal with events in Latin America on a case by case basis, but otherwise pursue a very reticent policy."
"It is a shame, because the continent merits more attention."
"As far as Peru is concerned, a number of speakers, and also our resolution, have pointed to the fact that President Fujimori' s forthcoming resignation offers scope for a fresh start."
"I am not so sure whether this will be the case though, because there have already been one or two disturbing developments on this front, and I will only be convinced once Fujimori has actually stepped down or been voted out of office."
"I therefore think it is extremely important for the European Union to get fully involved with this country, and with the situation in Peru, for example by maintaining an orderly dialogue with the forces of opposition."
"I would like us to send the delegation that we wanted to send to the elections - which then failed to take place for reasons we are all familiar with - to Peru now, with a view to supporting those who are working towards democratic reform in the country."
"And if that were to be the outcome of this afternoon' s sitting, I would be more than satisfied."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I believe that the events in Peru are evidence of the world of difference that there can be between the formal meaning of words and their tangible weight."
"The term in question is the word 'democracy'."
"Peru has a parliament which has been elected by universal suffrage and a president who has used the powers of persuasion of the army to violate all constitutional precepts."
"I feel that this resolution marks a key point in Parliament's political initiative."
"I would like to focus briefly on one of the subjects covered by the report: the call for Parliament to send a delegation."
"The European Union has got to do something and do it quickly."
"The process of democracy needs to be consolidated, but consolidated with political instruments and human resources."
"We must ensure that, when Peru reaches its goal, it has candidates who are capable of rising to the challenge and responding to the Peruvian people's demand for political renewal and genuine democracy."
"Mr President, Commissioner, this is why I strongly support the call for Parliament to send a delegation, not just to act as a witness should something go badly wrong, but, for once in its history, to support a country which is seeking a democratic way forward."
"Mr President, the need for the resolution on the situation in Peru has made two things clear."
"The first is our frustration at having to return to the vigilance over democracy and human rights in Latin America, which was of major concern to Parliament in the 1980s and which diminished in the 1990s with the emergence of democratic governments in most countries there."
"It is also frustrating because, in addition to the situation in Peru, other attempts at aggressive populism are creating appalling dictatorships, which confirm our worst fears and mean that we must target Latin America once again in our vigilance over democracy."
"Let us be quite frank: this resolution highlights the feeling that Europe' s influence on that sub-continent has weakened."
"Europe felt that its conscience no longer required it to intervene after the switch to democracy in the 1990s and did little for those countries, apart from giving advice on models of economic integration."
"Opening up our markets was symbolic - with the exception of beef from Argentina, because of BSE as we know - but there was very little technology transfer, cultural and political relations existed in name only, and career training and investments in added value made little progress."
"Europe did not take the opportunity provided by the fledgling democracies to promote development and social justice in Latin America to help these countries to break their almost exclusive dependence on accumulating capital, which is based on drug trafficking."
"The situation with Peru and Mr Fujimori has not yet degenerated into a disaster, Mr President."
"There are signs of disillusionment and the situation should serve, for the moment, as a warning."
"In order to avert a disaster, it is absolutely crucial that Europe takes its politics to the American sub-continent as well."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the conditions under which elections were held in Peru in May this year, were unacceptable."
"Against this background, the Commission gave its support to the Organisation of American States, whose brief is to monitor a range of significant democratic reforms that the government and opposition had agreed on."
"The European Union emphasised only very recently, in a declaration, that President Fujimori had seized the initiative with his decision to call fresh elections."
"This initiative could prove to be an important step in the direction of democracy, but only if he refrains from employing the tactics that he has announced he is going to use in these elections."
"If this opportunity is to be made use of, a whole range of serious shortcomings are going to have to be overcome."
"These are shortcomings that became apparent during the previous elections."
"If these weaknesses are not dealt with, there is a risk that the next elections will be extremely dubious too."
"The Commission therefore supports the Organisation of American States in the continuation of its work as per the schedule agreed at the time, and this notwithstanding the difficult conditions and numerous imponderables that weigh heavily on these forthcoming new elections."
"The Commission, in tandem with the Member States, is currently examining how we can best help, in practical terms, in the preparation of these plural and democratic elections, and, if need be, as observers of the process."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 6.00 p.m."
"Afghanistan"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B5-0776/2000, by Mr van den Berg and Mr Sakellariou, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the situation in Afghanistan;"
"B5-0778/2000, by Mr Dupuis and others, on behalf of the Technical Group of Independent Members, on the situation in Afghanistan;"
"B5-0781/2000, by Mrs Dybkjær and Mrs Malmström, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, on the situation in Afghanistan;"
"B5-0785/2000, by Mr Morillon, on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on the situation in Afghanistan;"
"B5-0789/2000, by Mrs Schroedter and others, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, on the situation in Afghanistan;"
"B5-0793/2000, by Mrs Ainardi and others, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on the position of women in Afghanistan."
"Mr President, I think we owe a great deal to the man behind this resolution, General Morillon."
"It is an important resolution because Afghanistan and its desperately suffering people, and especially its children who are blown up by mines and its women who face appalling discrimination, deserve far more attention from us."
"Thanks to this motion for a resolution, which has found broad consensus, Parliament is taking a firm position."
"As the resolution states, the fundamental political challenge is to put pressure on Afghanistan' s large neighbour, Pakistan, as a means of trying to influence the situation in Afghanistan, I would also add the other large neighbour, the People' s Republic of China, with which Pakistan has excellent relations and collaborates at military and nuclear level."
"We also know that there is extensive cooperation between those two big countries, Pakistan and the People' s Republic of China, at the level of the political nomenklatura and the local mafia as regards drug trafficking."
"We know Afghanistan is not far away, and we know it is the world' s largest producer of opiates, so we can well imagine the role played by these political mafias, which are not necessarily simply political, in the expansion of the drug trade."
"We also know that the policy of the United Nations, especially that of UNDCP and Mr Arlacchi, is a disaster. Despite the millions of dollars invested in Afghanistan in the course of the last few years, production has doubled."
"To summarise, I think pressure needs to be exerted on Pakistan and the People' s Republic of China, all funding needs to be withdrawn from Mr Arlacchi and UNDCP so that these prohibitionist policies on drugs do not end up encouraging production and trade in drugs, because that is what is happening now."
"Mr President, earlier in the day we had a debate about the rights of women in the European Union, and we also touched upon the question of the new candidate countries."
"In facing a decision like this about the Taliban regime, it has to be said that it has really been a luxury, purely and simply, to discuss the other issues, when one considers what is happening in Afghanistan."
"Ever since I first heard about the Taliban regime, I have been appalled."
"I find it completely incredible that such things can still be going on in the year 2000, and not only do we not intervene, but we cannot, in reality, do a vast amount about them."
"In war, there will clearly always be a large number of innocent people who suffer distress or die, and very often it is, of course' women and children and old people who are totally defenceless in a wide range of situations."
"What is happening here, however, is in fact even worse."
"It is a far more systematic form of oppression than is to be seen in normal war situations."
"It is far more systematic and far more violent in relation to a particular group of women."
"It appears as if it is simply a question of groups of men who find themselves in a world in which nothing else counts but their own solidarity and their own oppression of women."
"I therefore also think it good that the decision should include some clear and explicit points about the position of women in particular and should draw attention to how necessary it is for us to try to help prevent the Taliban regime from continuing with its wholesale discrimination against women."
"Is Afghanistan condemned to sink back into the dark ages and suffocate slowly under the Taliban yoke, in the image of its women under the weight of the obligatory chador?"
"How many more deaths and displaced persons do there have to be to pierce the veil of our political indifference?"
"How many more tons of drugs injected into the veins of young people worldwide must we deplore?"
"Must we wait until state terrorism is fully established, wait for the victory of Jihad, the application of the expansionist will of religious fanatics to the whole region, before we Members of the European Union finally agree to get involved, as is our duty?"
"The long offensive carried on by the Taliban, with quite open support from Pakistan, is now cutting off the peoples of the Northern Alliance from a supply route essential to their survival."
"The international community can no longer content itself with burying its head in the sand, and conducting 'wait-and-see' diplomacy."
"I think I speak for many people here when I declare our rejection of a comfortable neutrality, making a theory out of passivity and justifying blindness."
"We protest at the sort of neutrality that tends to put the protagonists on the same level, stacking the daily atrocities of the Taliban regime on the same shelf as the armed resistance of Commander Massoud. Massoud is seen as a war leader, but how could it be otherwise after so many battles?"
"But for those who know him and have seen him at work, he is also a man of dialogue and unification."
"He sees himself as the champion of a tolerant Islam."
"He can be a man of peace."
"Massoud insists that there is no military solution to the Afghan problem."
"He is right."
"We must act urgently to find political solutions which respect the values underpinning our Union."
"That is the thrust of the resolution drafted by all the groups, which I have the honour of defending here."
"Essentially it calls on the Council Presidency to bring its influence to bear to put an end to foreign interference in that country."
"It calls on the Commission to take stock of the humanitarian aid measures intended for the Afghan population so that this aid reaches everyone."
"Finally it insists, and this is the essential point, that the European Union coordinate its initiatives with those of neighbouring countries to impose a solution whereby peace, stability, and respect for international law and the most elementary human rights can be re-established."
"We are well aware that this will not be an easy task, but here I would like to quote the motto of a great European, William of Orange: ""Hope is not necessary to engagement, nor success to perseverance."""
"Mr President, Afghanistan has the worst human rights record in the world, both in terms of the number and the severity of the violations committed."
"The predicament of Afghan women is a particularly apt case in point."
"Women cannot go to work, girls cannot go to school, women cannot walk freely down the street, and they are stoned, to name but a few examples."
"There is not a single human rights organisation working in Afghanistan."
"It is the country that has the most mines."
"It is a country where there is no hope for the children."
"75% of the boys and 90% of the girls do not go to school."
"It is one of the poorest countries and there is a forgotten war going on."
"I feel this all goes to show just how important this resolution is."
"On balance, it is clear that the international organisations and the UN are not doing enough as matters stand."
"In other words, the conflict is far more complex, there is no solution in the offing and yet, as we all agree, there is an urgent need for one."
"The EU has an important task before it in this respect."
"It could bring its ideas on non-military conflict management to bear."
"There are a few examples I could mention: the monitoring of weapons exports and small arms through to the end-user, so that we do not secretly aid and abet the conflict out there, support for non-governmental organisations and women' s organisations based there, which are courageous enough to take action despite the hopelessness of the situation."
"In particular, in light of the above, it is absolutely imperative that the Member States grant asylum to all those who flee Afghanistan, as a matter of course."
"It would do the EU' s image no harm at all if it were to get a political initiative off the ground in the United Nations, with a view to finding a peaceful solution to the conflicts in Afghanistan."
"Mr President, the recent Taliban offensives must obviously concern us."
"Terrible suffering has been caused by this conflict."
"I, too, support the joint resolution, of course."
"But I want to join previous speakers in emphasising two concerns."
"The first issue is the position of women."
"It is not something we can get used to it."
"We must never trivialise it."
"They still endure appalling conditions: they are denied access to work, health care and education."
"They live in destitution and permanent insecurity."
"They are regularly victims of stonings."
"They are suppressed in the true sense of the word."
"All Afghan women, whatever their age, are faced with systematic violation of their most fundamental rights."
"That is why I also believe they should be entitled to the right of asylum."
"The European Union must renew its solidarity with all Afghan women in their struggle at home and abroad against the Taliban regime."
"The second issue is that the Taliban are clearly seeking international recognition, on the grounds that they now control virtually all of Afghanistan."
"So peace, stability and respect for rights can only be re-established through a political solution."
"Greater involvement of the European Union is definitely needed."
"And in that search, I believe it is vital for the Council to reinforce the restrictions it has decided on."
"There can be no recognition by any Member State, as long as Afghanistan maintains its policy of violation of human rights, notably its systematic discrimination against women."
"The Commission should also take much stronger emergency humanitarian measures for the people, doing everything possible to enable the NGOs to provide aid to Afghan women and involve them in their activities."
"Mr President, today, just as and even more so than in the past, the tragic military success of the Taliban has meant that hundreds of thousands of women are subject to severe repression and are denied medical assistance, education, the possibility of supporting themselves and the freedom of movement."
"Around a million people, most of them children, have been mutilated by anti-personnel mines."
"The urgent resolution to be put to the vote today calls for the concerns voiced by Parliament on many occasions to be translated into further practical initiatives."
"There is one point which I must stress in particular."
"There has been a budget heading for the funding of mine clearance and prevention programmes for many years now."
"Funding has been allocated for 2000 and will be provided for 2001 as well."
"We need to take immediate action to prevent thousands of children inadvertently triggering tragic explosions while they are playing in the fields, and receiving disabling wounds."
"We can do this. The operations have been endorsed and are viable, but the funding is being held up by bureaucracy, by the need to assess previous actions and by confusion over the responsibilities of the different departments."
"Ladies and gentlemen of the Commission, look up from your texts, find out what is going on outside the realm of documents: thousands of children are in danger."
"Rise above sluggishness and uncertainty."
"Yes, carry out all the assessments you want to, but, in the meantime, let the funds for 2000 reach their destination and you will be saving the lives and preventing the mutilation of a great many unfortunate people."
"Mr President, maybe it is not useful or politically correct to point out who supported the Taliban at the start, when they were aiming to achieve the power that they now have in Afghanistan."
"Other Members have already spoken of a million displaced people, a million people mutilated by landmines, thousands of women deprived of their most basic rights, such as the right to education, health, work, or to move around freely: it must be terrible for many of these women, who are accustomed to education, to a secular way of life, to be confined to that area with no freedom."
"And we do need to take this into account in the European institutions, as well as the fact that drug cultivation is used to buy arms."
"This morning - and I will shortly conclude, Mr President - a code of conduct was approved on the sale and trafficking of arms."
"I do not think that this code will be useful unless it is effective in preventing weapons from reaching the hands of people who are committing very serious violations against human rights, as these people are."
"Mr President, we all know by now that we should not entertain any illusions with regard to the nature of the present regime in Kabul."
"We only have to cast our minds back to the events in Afghanistan this summer."
"The Taliban launched a new military attack on their northern opponents in the middle of the worst drought this poor country has had since time immemorial."
"This drought has resulted in a drop in harvest by an estimated 2.3 million tonnes of food."
"This essentially renders a quarter of the total Afghan population dependent on grain supplies from the World Food Programme."
"It was in just such a tragic situation that the country' s radical Islamic rulers revolted against the UN' s so-called bread programme in the capital of Kabul."
"This was a project that was due to benefit 28 000 war widows, no less."
"The Taliban' s excuse?"
"There are countless bakeries which offer employment to women."
"Despite this - at least in western eyes - inhumane policy, the Taliban is seeking international diplomatic recognition."
"They seize on cooperation in the return of millions of Afghan refugees, sponsored by the United Nations, as official global acceptance of their unbearable tyranny."
"It remains very much to be seen whether this religious barbarism is really sufficient for us to form a closed international containment front against the hosts of Jihad conspirator, Osama bin Laden."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the current intensification in the armed conflict between the Taliban and the Northern Alliance is extremely disturbing."
"Increasing numbers of people are fleeing from the fighting."
"Some sources put the number of displaced people at 90 000."
"Many of these are now seeking sanctuary in makeshift camps in the mountains in the north-east of the country."
"The conditions there could go badly downhill when winter sets in."
"In the light of this development, ECHO, the Commission agency for humanitarian aid, is currently working hard to put together a package of emergency aid to the value of EUR 3 million, in order to support these displaced people with medical supplies, food, and the means to get through the winter."
"In addition, ECHO has already made EUR 5.7 million available this year for the victims of drought in Afghanistan, for mine clearance in the north of the country and for the resettlement of refugees."
"The victims of drought are also due to receive a further EUR 3 million."
"I would like to take the opportunity to say, in response to Mrs Paciotti' s comment, that naturally I will not hesitate to inquire within the Commission today as to what has become of the funding for mine clearance and what is going to become of it."
"Should I find that there are bureaucratic stumbling blocks here, as you put it, then you have my word that I will do all I can to overcome these obstacles with all speed."
"The honourable Members are well aware that the Commission has a long-term commitment to the Afghan refugees and those who have been displaced within Afghanistan itself."
"Between 1991 and 2000, the Commission made a total of EUR 400 million available for refugee aid, humanitarian emergency aid and food aid."
"A significant slice of this was earmarked for mine clearance and associated information campaigns conducted by UN agencies, European or Afghan non-governmental organisations."
"With its common position on Afghanistan, the European Union is supporting the United Nations' special mission in Afghanistan, and the efforts to achieve peace undertaken by the General Secretary' s special representatives."
"The Union has resolved to make an effective contribution to the restoration of peace and stability in the country, and it is as plain as day that this will not come about until human rights and fundamental values are given full recognition."
"Accordingly, the common position roundly condemns the ongoing discrimination against women in Afghanistan and other human rights violations that take place there."
"As long as the Taliban leadership continues to be as ambiguous in its statements on opium cultivation as it has been hitherto, the Commission refuses to support any anti-drugs projects in Afghanistan."
"That said, it will give staunch support to the neighbouring countries, so as to improve their chances of tackling the drugs problem."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 6.00 p.m."
"Human rights"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B5-0794/2000, by Mr Medina Ortega, Mr Linkohr and Mr Fava, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the kidnap in Colombia of a Spanish Jesuit engaged in negotiations with the guerillas;"
"B5-0795/2000, by Mr Di Piandro, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, on the kidnap of Father Alejandroi Matos Castro in Colombia;"
"B5-0796/2000, by Mr Marset Campos, Mr Miranda and Mr Di Lello Finuoli, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on kidnaps, abductions, and the peace process in Colombia;"
"B5-0797/2000, by Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra, on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on the kidnap in Colombia of a Spanish Jesuit engaged in negotiations with the guerillas."
"Mr President, I am speaking to confirm the agreement of the various political groups that have tabled a motion for a resolution on the kidnapping of a Spanish Jesuit in Colombia and to inform the House that we have decided to withdraw it in view of the fact that the person has been freed."
"Two other Community citizens have also been freed today."
"Therefore, I am not going to discuss the draft resolution, as it no longer exists."
"Nevertheless, Colombia is clearly a country that deserves our attention."
"But as Mr Linkohr was saying, the problem with Latin America is that we only concern ourselves with these countries when there are problems."
"I think this is a good time to highlight the need for the European Union to draw up a comprehensive policy on Latin America which could perhaps prevent these countries from regularly going through the crisis situations that some of them have experienced."
"Mr President, I would like to reaffirm what my colleague, Manuel Medina, has just said."
"Fortunately, in this particular case, we can welcome the fact that the Spanish Jesuit and other Spaniards, as well as other Community citizens, have been released."
"It is also true, however, that Colombia, which we frequently discuss here, has several problems."
"At the moment, for example, there is a Colombian priest, Oliveiro Medina, who is in Brazil."
"His extradition to Colombia could put his life in danger because we have already seen, in the last resolution on Colombia that we discussed, that more than 24 human rights defenders have recently been murdered there."
"Unfortunately, we all hoped that we would not have to discuss Colombia again."
"Unfortunately, we may have to discuss it again, but I think that the European Union should have a fundamental role - as Manolo Medina was saying - in Latin America in general."
"And reducing budgets for Latin America is not going to help us to play the role that we should be playing there."
"Mr President, I would like to share in the happiness of my compatriots and fellow Members who have talked of their satisfaction at the freeing of the Spanish Jesuit Alejandro Matos and of other Community citizens."
"We cannot forget that, in the past year, 2 075 people have been kidnapped in Colombia by the guerrillas, and we must express our concern for the violent situation that it is experiencing, particularly in the north, in the Santander region - a jungle region whose border with Venezuela is, moreover, very easily penetrated - where the constant clashes between guerrillas and paramilitaries are increasing, with many road blocks and frequent murders."
"I therefore think that we should reiterate our support for a peaceful solution to the Colombian conflict, in which the actions of the drug cartels have a dramatic influence."
"The European Union must therefore support the initiatives by President Andrés Pastrana, aimed at achieving a negotiated peace between his government and the guerrilla groups, the FAR (Revolutionary Armed Forces) and the so-called National Liberation Army."
"Mr President, the issue of Colombia is something that really has not been properly addressed in the European Union."
"Even the Red Cross is leaving there because neither the paramilitaries nor guerrillas respect international humanitarian law."
"This highlights that the wrong approach has been taken in relation to Colombia."
"Signing peace agreements is all very well, but first and foremost we have to have respect for humanitarian law."
"That is not happening there."
"Not so very long ago there was a resolution on the situation of the peace community in San José de Apartado."
"That was less than a month ago."
"Since then the situation has got even worse for the community there."
"At the very least five people have been killed."
"We have to address the role that the paramilitaries are playing and also the role that the state is playing in this."
"It really is not acceptable that people are being persecuted out of their homes, out of their land and that the world is standing idly by and letting this happen."
"The state involvement has to be addressed as well."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission, in common with Parliament, welcomes the release of the Spanish Jesuit priest, Alejandro Matos Castro, last week."
"We call upon the guerilla groups to release the other hostages."
"We urge them to eschew kidnappings in future and to respect international humanitarian law."
"The Commission is deeply concerned about the escalation of violence in Colombia, particularly in respect of the massacres perpetrated recently by paramilitary forces in the so-called peaceful communities of San José de Apartado."
"We urge the Colombian government again to investigate the precise circumstances of these crimes."
"The Commission deplores the ongoing human-rights violations in Colombia and entreats the warring parties to continue the peace talks and work towards a lasting peace in Colombia, based on a negotiated solution."
"In this context, I would emphasise that the Commission supports President Pastrana' s efforts to secure peace and will do everything in its power to promote lasting peace in Colombia."
"In particular, the Commission would like to have some say in the process when the European Union puts together an aid package in support of the Colombian peace process."
"The Commission has already offered to coordinate the measures for a package of this kind, and is planning to approve a considerable amount of funding for this package as early as in the next few days."
"Furthermore, the Commission has proposed organising in Brussels a follow-up meeting to the Donors Conference that took place on 7 July in Madrid."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 6.00 p.m."
"As several speakers have indicated, I can inform you that after good news from Colombia about the release of the Jesuit priest, and following agreement between the political groups, the motions for resolutions on this issue are withdrawn."
"Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B5-0779/2000, by Mr Dupuis and others, on behalf of the Technical Group of Independent Members, on Macedonia;"
"B5-0782/2000, by Mr Haarbyr, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, on Macedonia: law on higher education and universities;"
"B5-0786/2000, by Mrs Pack and others, on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on FYROM: law on higher education and universities;"
"B5-0788/2000, by Mr Lagendijk and others, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, law on higher education and universities in Macedonia."
"Mr President, I just want to point out that FYROM is rather an anachronism and I invite our Greek colleagues, who always do their duty when Macedonia is on the agenda, to intervene perhaps a little more firmly with their government and supersede this situation, which frankly borders on the ridiculous."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think this resolution is important because it refers to a positive decision by the Macedonian government, and unfortunately not by all the political forces of Macedonia, on the law on higher education which will at last allow young people from minorities, in particular the Albanian minority, to study in their mother tongue."
"I think we should congratulate Mr Georgievsky, the Prime Minister, and Mr Xhaferi, leader of the Albanian party in the government majority, who are behind this law on higher education. Unfortunately, it was not supported by the parliamentary opposition."
"It is regrettable that, at the request of the Socialist Group in particular, the text of the resolution does not mention their names, and I would like to point out to our Socialist friends that their request, made in the name of a more general principle that political forces should not be cited, strikes me as rather unreliable given that, looking at the motion for a resolution on the Middle East we are going to vote on today, we are frankly dealing with very specific situations and very specific players."
"So, once again, we have double standards and I think that is deplorable."
"I call on the Commission to monitor this issue very closely."
"It will take a great deal of money to establish the university."
"This is a practical way of supporting a project which could help overcome the problems of two large, differing populations living side by side, and this is an area where monitoring by the Commission is crucial."
"Mr President, I would like to take up what Mr Dupuis had to say."
"I believe that when the audience in the stands sees ARYM up there, they will actually think this refers to a different country."
"ARYM means Ancienne République Yougoslave de Macédoine, i.e the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Quite simply, that means 'Macedonia' ."
"The dispute about the name is a dispute between Greece and the country of Macedonia."
"Of course we all hope - and that includes the Greek MEPs here - that this dispute will soon be settled."
"We have seen how the difficult situation in Macedonia has steadily worsened where the treatment of the Albanians is concerned."
"All of those who, for a long time now, have been going in and out of this country, have kept up the pressure for this problem to be resolved."
"However, I would also stress that this problem is nothing new: it is the legacy of the Yugoslav period, when the Albanians were always discriminated against, including those in Macedonia."
"Unfortunately, it was, of course, the case that the problem was not resolved under the last government, in the run-up to 1998."
"Therefore, we are all delighted that a genuinely sound solution is perhaps at last to be found to this problem of higher education."
"The illegal foundation of Tetovo university many years ago produced great tension in Macedonia, which I am sorry to say, could not be defused over the past few years."
"We owe a duty of care to the students to ensure that this problem is resolved."
"After all, these students had, or have, diplomas that serve no purpose in the outside world."
"Therefore, I believe we owe it to the young people to find a solution to the problem, and have now paved the way to this end."
"As a delegation, we have always insisted that a solution should be found to this problem."
"Now at last we have found it."
"Not us, but the government under Prime Minister Georgievski, and also the Albanian leader, Xhaferi, and above all, the representative of the Council of Europe, Max van der Stoel."
"This outstanding cooperation has led to a draft bill, which was adopted by the majority in Parliament."
"In common with Olivier Dupuis, I bitterly regret the fact that the opposition parties - which formed part of the government up until 1998 and could have resolved the problem - have closed their minds to this draft bill without offering a better solution themselves."
"I am particularly at a loss to understand the behaviour of the Albanian opposition party, which has deliberately closed its mind to the necessary solution to the Albanian problem in Macedonia."
"The fact that the Socialist opposition refused to support this must have been against their better judgement, but that sometimes happens with the opposition, and not just in Macedonia."
"We are now awaiting the necessary aid for the transformation of Tetovo university into a private university whose diplomas will then be recognised."
"All those who want to see an improvement in the inter-ethnic relations in Macedonia, in the interests of stabilisation, must now do their bit to help solve this problem and ensure that a private university actually becomes a reality."
"That is what this urgent procedure is all about today."
"People from different ethnic backgrounds must be able to live together in Macedonia."
"This could provide a good role model for the neighbouring countries and help to stabilise the entire region."
"Mr President, it makes a nice change in this Parliament to be able to reflect on positive developments in south-eastern Europe, and very often the subject is Macedonia where, despite all the problems this country has to deal with, the two largest groups of the population co-exist in peace, even form a coalition government and have now adopted a new act on higher education."
"That is a breakthrough on an issue which has caused a great deal of problems for a long time."
"At long last, the Albanians now have the opportunity to attend university courses in their own language and within the official education system of Macedonia."
"That is a real step forward for Macedonia."
"As far as I am concerned, it proves to all neighbouring countries that education does not only have to spread hatred, as is often the case these days, but that it can also serve as a cradle for a peaceful, multi-ethnic society."
"That is a development which, in my view, deserves unqualified support from the European Union."
"Finally, I would like to spend a moment on something which, normally speaking, I do not think belongs in a European Parliament, namely the role of a fellow countryman."
"I am proud of the fact, that this time round, the role of Mr Max van der Stoel, the High Representative for minorities of the OSCE, has proved crucial in this issue."
"Mr President, I would like to echo Mr Lagendijk' s praise of Mr Van der Stoel."
"I believe it is extremely important for the outside world to send positive vibes to Macedonia."
"That does not mean to say that the Macedonian people are not sufficiently alert themselves to be able to deliver something in this area."
"The former President, Mr Gligorov, was already a shining example of non-ethnic thinking, and the new President, too, has gained the trust of all groups of the population in Macedonia."
"In my view, it is an extraordinary achievement on the part of the Macedonians to be able to settle the issue within their own borders."
"It appears to me that cooperation between Slavonic Macedonians and especially Albanian-speaking Macedonians is an extremely important topic which could manifest itself in the fight over the important initiative to establish a university in Tetovo."
"This initiative has been on the cards for years and still there is no talk of official recognition."
"Fortunately, this initiative is now being backed by a parliamentary majority, as a result of which a key problem in the inter-ethnic relations has been solved, not only because it is so important to teach in Albanian at the universities, but especially because it considerably enhances the social position of the Albanian-speaking Macedonians."
"It attracts a new class of students to higher education."
"It is also significant in terms of the presence of Albanian speakers in the official apparatus, a presence which is currently lagging far behind what should actually be the case."
"It appears to me that the recognition of degrees from Tetovo university is a major step forward."
"In time, the university should also be funded by taxpayers' money only. After all, the Albanian speakers pay taxes and are just as entitled to a share when it comes to paying for education."
"I, myself, was educated at a university which was a 'Free University' , free from church and state influence, yet government-funded."
"I have to say that I still believe this to be a great bonus and it also proves that the state respects the country' s own particular educational sphere."
"The outside world should do all it can to help the Albanian speakers integrate in their country."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my group proposes to support the present motion, which we have also signed, because I believe it is right for the European Union to support the solution that has been found in Macedonia and which accommodates the Albanian population."
"I would have preferred it if we could have found a solution that all the parties in Parliament could have voted for."
"We would rather leave it to the Macedonians to discuss where the process broke down, Mrs Pack."
"I have it on good authority that they were only trivial issues, and that the government could have accommodated the opposition in this respect. I do not know."
"I do not think that is the be-all and end-all."
"What matters most is that a solution is found which we can all subscribe to."
"Even though this notion is unpopular in this House - indeed the prevailing mood is the smaller the unit, the more divided the systems, and the more separatist the movements, the better - I would like to make the point here, which is one we have also discussed at some length in the delegation with our counterparts from Macedonia, that we must be clear about the fact that their own Albanian-language institutions should help to promote social cohesion in Macedonia and not create divisions."
"That is an important aspect we should not lose sight of."
"Mr President, General De Gaulle spoke of the ""paix des braves"" i.e. the peace of the brave, in the era of Franco-German reconciliation, by which he meant that patriots on both sides had been able to achieve a lasting settlement."
"That is exactly what has happened in Macedonia."
"Therefore, I also believe that this reconciliation is sustainable, but that the government, which has very courageously found a solution to the university issue and to many other issues, needs visible signs of its success, and powerful support, else peace throughout the region will be under threat."
"That is why it is so important, firstly, to find a solution to the name problem."
"When Greece, of all countries, again puts forward a proposal to call it Slavo-Macedonia, it really is asking for trouble, because that is precisely what the Albanians would regard as being another example of exclusion tactics."
"Secondly, I take the view that it is very important to quickly bring the stabilisation agreement to a successful conclusion, and thirdly, I believe that it is very important to support Macedonia as a role model in the region, so that it has a stabilising effect on its neighbouring countries. It is also imperative for free, country-wide elections to be held as soon as possible in Kosovo, in order to ensure that forces with unequivocal democratic legitimacy come to power there - and not just at local level - which will truly have the interests of the Kosovo Albanians at heart."
"I am sure this would defuse no small number of problems in Macedonia, too."
"I feel Macedonia has every chance of becoming a type of Switzerland of the South-East, and we should give it massive support on this journey, and reject anything that could lead to a relapse into nationalism and chauvinism, which, I am sorry to say, certain forces in the country are currently trying to provoke for tactical reasons."
"Mr President, no one can deny that what has been achieved in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia over the last eight years is nothing short of a miracle; not only has this tiny country managed to keep out of the armed conflicts in the region, it has also made serious efforts to modernise its economy and society, set up democratic institutions and respect human rights and the rights of minorities."
"Without doubt, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is helping enormously to promote peace and security in the region and we trust that the last problem in its relations with Greece will shortly be resolved in a way which respects the dignity of both countries."
"I welcome with the utmost satisfaction the new law on higher education, which will create the conditions needed for the Albanian-speaking community to set up a private university."
"I am convinced that this tiny country in the Balkans deserves the undivided support of the European Union and I trust that an association and stability agreement will be signed before the end of the French Presidency."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am sure we are all agreed that the stability and even long-term viability of Macedonia is dependent on Macedonians and Albanians being able, in the long run, to live together in peace there, and it is therefore in the interests of Europe to provide all the support we can in order to strengthen this peaceful coexistence and make it a lasting proposition."
"That is why the Commission has repeatedly urged the Macedonian Government to resolve the outstanding problem of higher education in the Albanian language."
"The Commission welcomes the passing of the new law."
"The Commission is working with the OSCE High Commissioner for national minorities, Max van der Stoel, with a view to providing financial support for the implementation of this important law."
"Perhaps I could use this opportunity to say that the cooperation between the Commission and the High Commissioner, Mr van der Stoel, has already got off to a good start."
"Our combined efforts have enabled us to solve a similar problem that existed in two other European countries, i.e. Estonia and Latvia, and I am grateful to be able to take this opportunity to say that our cooperation with the OSCE High Commissioner in this respect has been extremely constructive and valuable."
"I believe the same will apply to Macedonia."
"The Commission is intending to make EUR 1 million available for the current year, under the national programme for Macedonia, in order to support the implementation of this law."
"The funding allocation is provided for in the financing proposal which is to be put forward today - possibly this very hour - to the PHARE administration committee."
"If the Member States adopt this financing proposal, a financing agreement will be concluded with the government and a detailed project will be drawn up in close cooperation with Mr van der Stoel in the coming weeks."
"The PHARE funding made available for the year 2000 under the national programme could also be used to support the university in the coming academic year, i.e. in 2001 and 2002."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 6.00 p.m."
"Samina ferry disaster in Greece"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B5-0783/2000, by Mr Katiforis and others, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the sinking of the Greek ferry;"
"B5-0787/2000, by Mr Hatzidakis and Mr Trakatellis, on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on the sinking of the vessel 'Express Samina' ;"
"B5-0791/2000, by Mr Korakas and others, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on the sinking of the vessel 'Express Samina' ."
"Mr President, Commissioner, all the political groups have now agreed to debate this issue and have tabled a joint resolution."
"I think this is extremely important, as is the fact that the Socialists have changed their initial position, because the sinking of the Express Samina has not only shocked Greece, it has shocked the whole of Europe."
"We are not debating here merely in order to express our sorrow; the main subject of our debate is what happened, why it happened and how we can rectify the situation, how the Commission and the European Parliament can help from now on to ensure that the same does not happen again in the future."
"There can be no doubt that the human factor played a decisive part."
"However, there are aspects of the accident which, in my view, prove that Community law has been infringed."
"The directive on the registration of passengers was infringed."
"The Minister has admitted as much, the Prime Minister admitted as much yesterday in Parliament and I hope that the Socialist Group in the European Parliament will admit as much."
"The directive on life-saving equipment, life-jackets and life-rafts was infringed."
"Mr President, on Sunday, three hours before the deadline for applying Directive 98/18 expired, some 50 Greek ships were taken out of service by the Ministry of Merchant Marine."
"What amazes me is that the Government and the company both insist that the Express Samina complied with all the safety requirements."
"In other words, had it not sunk, it would still be sailing."
"The government itself says so."
"So what are we calling for?"
"We are calling mainly for three things. Firstly, full application of Directive 98/41 on the registration of passengers."
"Secondly, a shorter timetable for Directive 98/18 so that there are no longer any derogations for Member States, as has been the case to date with Greece."
"Parliament consented at second reading under pressure from the Greek government at the time."
"Mr Stenmark remembers and can testify to this."
"And, of course, we are calling for an end to the derogation for Greece on cabotage, the monopoly and oligopoly arrangements governing transport by sea."
"Greek cabotage operators are running their new ships on the routes to Italy, where there is competition, and their old ships on the Greek routes, where there is no competition, and that is how safety standards drop."
"I should like to point out that all the Greek MEPs have now reacted against this situation."
"We do not consider that everything is a mess in Greece; there are some very good ships and the overwhelming majority of Greek seamen are very good at their job."
"We have tabled the motion as an expression of our awareness of the issue and our intention to fight for Greece to adopt even higher safety standards than the European Union in order to correct this negative impression of our country."
"Three amendments have been proposed by the GUE/NGL Group, one on shipping registers, one on working conditions and one on an in situ investigation by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism."
"We disagree mainly on technical grounds, which I do not have time to go into now, but would be happy to explain privately to my fellow Members."
"The problems are technical rather than political: for example, as far as shipping registers are concerned, the resolution already contains a reference to them and there is no need to repeat it."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we voted against a resolution on the sinking of the Express Samina under the urgent procedure the other day because a judicial inquiry is already under way in Greece and the Greek Government had already made a number of statements on what needs to be done."
"We feel that the word of the European Parliament needs weight if it is to be more than passing comment."
"Besides, our Parliament does the same every time a sad incident such as this happens. Must it continue to do so?"
"Someone said in the House the other day that we do not want to debate shipping safety."
"But has there ever been or will there ever be an in-depth debate in 2 or 3 minutes under the urgent procedure?"
"In deference to the House' s decision the other day, we sat round the table and thrashed out a joint text which, I admit, was only made possible by the cooperation and good faith of all the groups."
"This final text expresses our sorrow, which was expressed at the start by our President, Mrs Fontaine, and takes account of the statements by the Commission and the call on the Greek Government for full information and a full investigation, which has already begun. It also stresses the importance of applying safety regulations and our scepticism about all forms of derogation."
"But, surely, this is precisely what our proactive Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism is doing and - as we all know - it needs serious and often time-consuming dialogue and procedures in order to decide what needs to be done on each occasion."
"Is it that easy to decide what needs to be done about shipping under an urgent procedure?"
"Nor was the need for urgent procedure justified after the event, given that the compromise text contains no references which might have been misunderstood as urgent party politics against the Greek Government, precisely as the result of the good faith which, as I have said, was demonstrated on all sides."
"So the question remains."
"What have we gained from the text which would have been lost had the resolution not been urgent?"
"Be that as it may, Mr President, we have agreed to this joint proposal for a resolution, which we support as it stands, urgently, and we of course disagree with the amendments tabled, again urgently, for the reasons which I have stated."
"And as far as shipping is concerned, in deference to the memory of the innocent victims of the Express Samina, we shall support and take the lead in any action which targets personal safety and environmental protection and tries to do more than just make an impression."
"Mr President, that I personally am saddened and angered by the sinking and on behalf of its victims does without saying, although I suppose that we shall never completely do away with accidents at sea and shipwrecks. But what really irritates and angers me are shortcomings, imperfections, derogations and the problems which this sinking has brought to light and that is why we need to debate them;"
"I do not know if it will be under the urgent procedure but, in essence, it must be as quickly as possible."
"And they do not only concern Greece."
"We need to debate and to call, as we do in the resolution, for the absolute application - with no derogations - of Community legislation, which is inadequate and needs to be enriched; we need to call for and encourage modernisation and improvements in port infrastructures, crew training in modern equipment, crews which, I should like to add, Mr President, are among the most experienced in the world."
"Of course, we also need to reorganise and refine administrative monitoring, control and sanctioning procedures."
"Mr Papoutsis has already ""dismantled"" a very important directorate in his ministry, the Directorate of Merchant Ship Surveys."
"It is only a very small first step, I know, and other steps are needed."
"And because all this concerns Greece, which has the biggest shipping sector in the European Union, it basically concerns the safety of all types of shipping throughout the Union."
"Which is why we are impatient to receive the recent decisions finally taken by the Council and we are impatient to receive them in legislative form in Parliament also, which is why we feel that it would be useful if a parliamentary committee were to go to Greece and work with the authorities, agencies and professionals to see where the difficulties lie - it is the most experienced country when it comes to shipping - so that it can assist the European Parliament in helping to improve, enhance and introduce stricter legislation for the safety of shipping throughout Europe."
"Mr President, I too shall, of course, start by expressing my deepest sorrow and solidarity with the families of the victims and with those who survived along with the memory of their terrifying ordeal."
"Of course, accidents at sea happen, human errors are made; but what is most important, Mr President, is for us to see, when a human error is made, if the right action was taken before and after the error."
"In other words, in the present case, if the right inspections were carried out and the right certificates issued for the ship, if the life-jackets were in the right places, if the crew was doing its job."
"There is a whole series of things which need looking at right away, especially if Community legislation was also infringed."
"In my view, the Greek competition committee has never acted in cases in which it should have acted."
"Of course, I know it is not a matter for the Commission, because the Commission acts in cases of competition at European Union level, but my question is this: how is it possible for a competition committee appointed by the Minister, a committee already in place, to have done nothing and to gradually have allowed a shipping monopoly to emerge?"
"And, as we know, monopolies, be they private or state monopolies, are a bad thing. In the present case they are bad for both freight and passenger shipping."
"It seems to me that the factor which needs to be quantified here as the result of this tragic incident, is what needs to be done at European Union level, because the bigger picture is the safety of shipping in the European Union."
"I should like to say, as far as the resolution is concerned, because there are a number of amendments, that my amendment on shipping registers is covered in the text, it is already there."
"As far as my amendment on working conditions is concerned, there is a directive on this and the wording of the amendment is less satisfactory than the text."
"And finally, the visit by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism is not, I think, the answer to our prayers; it is up to the European Commission to investigate and ascertain if a Community directive has been infringed, to hurry up with the case law which we want to see in order to make shipping safer and, finally, to do whatever needs to be done and, as I said, to investigate the matter of this famous competition committee."
"That is what we are waiting to hear from the European Commission."
"Mr President, I too would like to express my deepest condolences to the family of those killed tragically in this ferry disaster, but also pay tribute to those involved in the rescue effort, not least of course, the Royal Navy."
"On behalf of the Socialist transport team, I regret the fact that this debate is taking place as an urgency."
"It could be more properly debated in committee next week, but that was the decision of the House which, of course, I respect."
"What we certainly do not need today, or indeed next week, or in the future, is a point-scoring exercise between our Greek colleagues in the run-up to the general election in Greece."
"That serves no one's interest."
"This is not a concern solely for Greece."
"It is a matter for Europe as a whole."
"This was an accident waiting to happen."
"Some of us have worked on the issue of ferry safety for many years, not least because other ferries in other parts of Europe have also sunk with a tragic loss of life, be it the Herald of Free Enterprise, the Scandinavian Star or, of course, most notoriously of all, the Estonia in the 1990s."
"All these demonstrate that ferries are not safe enough."
"In our view, this tragedy could well happen again."
"Not because we have too few laws in Europe, but because the laws are not properly enforced."
"It is not just Greece."
"There are other Member States that do not comply with maritime safety laws and if I may, I will name some: Italy, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland and the Presidency, France, are all failing to implement the port-state control directive."
"I hope today, and in the coming days and weeks, we will hear from the Commission on what action they propose to take against these Member States that do not take maritime safety seriously."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to join the name of my own group in expressing sympathy and solidarity with the families of the deceased and the survivors of the shipwreck and gratitude also to those involved in the rescue operations."
"It is human nature to be the more affected by a tragedy the closer it comes to one."
"If I speak with special feeling in this debate, it is because over the years Greece has become another home to me."
"I have had many opportunities during this time to observe just how skilful Greek seamanship can be."
"But the issue cannot be localised in this way."
"In recent years many other lives have been lost at sea in our waters, not only by way of major ferry disasters but, on all too frequent a basis, from amongst our fishing communities."
"That is why we have to address issues of maritime safety more generally and in the constructive way suggested in this motion."
"I, too, would put particular stress on the need to implement properly the legislation we already have."
"I would ask that we become even more cautious than we ever have been before about allowing derogations from future legislation where matters of safety are concerned."
"Nor are such issues important only for those of us who come from areas where the sea is our highway or our place of work."
"They are important for us all, even when we are not immediately affected."
"This is so, if only because, in the words of the early English poet, John Donne, any man's death diminishes me because I am part of mankind."
"Mr President, on behalf of my group, I, too, should like to add our condolences to the families who have lost loved ones in this tragedy."
"Our thoughts are very much with them at this particular time."
"As a Member who represents Scotland, I feel a particular sadness and concern too about these events."
"Although Scotland and Greece sit at the furthest edges of the European Union, we nevertheless share a common topography."
"Both our countries have many island communities around our shores and as such the people of Scotland's islands felt a particular sense of shock following the recent events in Greece."
"Our island communities depend on ferry services as an absolute lifeline."
"These ships provide transport for passengers and goods and ensure the sustainability of some of Europe's most remote and fragile communities."
"It is the duty of Member States to make sure that the owners and operators of ferries are aware of their responsibilities for the safe passage of people and goods."
"We are fortunate in Scotland not to have directly suffered the type of tragedy to hit Greece but we are only too well aware that our waters are some of the most hazardous in Europe."
"We have many concerns about the forthcoming tendering process which is under way."
"I should like to ask the Commission for some assurance that in tendering for lifeline ferry services, or indeed any ferry services, safety is given its highest priority."
"In the cut-throat world of tendering, all too often companies can be pushed into cost-cutting measures and I would not like to see safety measures being sacrificed."
"It is simply not acceptable to the northern and western isles of Scotland, nor for the potential North Sea to European mainland crossing which I hope will be established in the not-too-distant future."
"Our citizens deserve the best of safeguards in sea transport."
"The trade unions who represent the men and women who work on ferries, as well as representatives of our seaboard communities, ought to be involved in discussions at the pre-tender stage, so that they can play a role in ensuring that safe practice is not sacrificed for the sake of profit."
"Mr President, allow me start by expressing by deepest sorrow and sympathy for the victims of this tragic sinking."
"It has been argued, including here in the House that the human factor was to blame."
"This argument is the least unacceptable."
"The fact that the ill-fated ship was 34 years old and was not included on the list of ships which - and this too is wrong - were exempted from the additional inspections required under Directive 98/18/ÅC, is positive proof of the unaccountability of the shipping industry which always finds a way, for which governments and regulatory authorities are to blame, of getting round even these generally inadequate regulations, at the expense of passenger and shipping safety."
"The legal framework for shipping in Greece and in the European Union in general has proven to be inadequate and dangerous and we need new, stricter rules, especially for very old ships, rules without derogations."
"Equally dangerous is the modus operandi of the regulatory authorities and the shipping register which, by operating as a private, profit-making company, is basically controlled by the very shipowners it is supposed to be controlling."
"Even the tragic shipwreck has not thrown up any useful conclusions."
"On the contrary, innocent victims are being exploited in order to promote shipowners' wider objectives."
"Hurrying to suspend cabotage in Greek seas, as earnestly called for, including in this joint resolution, will intensify profit-seeking competition between the shipping companies, with even more tragic consequences for passengers."
"We call on the European Parliament not to approve the suspension of cabotage by rejecting the reference to it in Paragraph 5 of the joint resolution, on which our group has requested a separate vote, and for the European Parliament to approve the involvement of crew representatives in regulatory authorities and shipping registers and the manning of ships in line with the real needs of cabotage by approving the amendments which we have tabled."
"Mr President, my group would also like to express its condolences to those involved in the Samina Express disaster."
"Such a disaster is always a sad event, especially if it could have been prevented."
"Let us therefore hope that the inquiry into the cause can give us a clear picture of the situation, at which stage it will be possible to take adequate measures."
"Judging from the survivors and those involved, we can already draw two conclusions."
"Disasters at sea are often caused by a lack of maintenance and a lack of staff who are both able and aware of their responsibilities."
"It is particularly tragic since this tragedy can also be put down to the lifting of EU legislation."
"I am pleased that the Greek government has now nullified this exemption."
"The European Union should be very wary when granting exemptions to EU legislation, particularly when public safety is at stake."
"I would, in this light, refer to two other southern countries that would like to join the European Union in due course."
"The quality of both ships and staff under their flags is rather more notorious than renowned."
"We cannot afford to make the same mistake again."
"On a final note, I would just like to say that great human suffering forces us to draw lessons from this tragedy."
"It is unfortunate that we still have to learn the hard way."
"This resolution points us in the right direction."
"Mr President, as you are aware, Bavaria, more than any other German Land, has an extraordinary affinity with Greece."
"This had its effect in the 19th century, during the wars of liberation."
"The first Greek king was a Bavarian, and it also has its effect in the present day, in that a particularly large number of people from Bavaria go on holiday to this beautiful country."
"There are particularly large numbers of Bavarian tourists in Greece."
"Therefore it came as a double shock to us to have to see these terrible pictures and hear this dreadful news. It was a shock because families suffered so badly as a result, and because we mourn the loss of human life, but it was also a shock because it revealed a flagrant disregard for safety."
"We must be aware that when something like this happens, the credibility of the European Union also comes into play."
"Time and again, we rightly complain that there is too much of a centralising drive in various areas."
"We criticise any attempts to formulate a common European tourism policy, which some people here want."
"That is something we can confidently leave to the Member States and regions."
"According to the principle of subsidiarity, tourism policy is something that should be devolved to Member State level."
"But what people in all countries must be able to depend on in equal measure, are safety standards."
"That is precisely why it is one of the European Union' s most important tasks to ensure that exceptions are no longer made where safety standards are concerned, as has obviously been the case here."
"We must be in no doubt that, particularly in an era of cross-border mass tourism, whether it be tunnels - where there was a spate of disasters last summer - or ships, which have been involved in a great many disasters in recent years, people expect to be able to depend on safety standards within the European Union."
"Human error happens all over the world."
"Greek sailors are excellent and famous for being of a high standard."
"But what we must realise is that when it comes to technical standards, there is, I am sorry to say, a degree of chaos in this region."
"This is the point at which the European Union and the European Parliament must take direct responsibility."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission shares the deep sorrow and consternation felt throughout Greece over this horrendous accident."
"The Commission has expressed its sympathy to the families of the victims and the Greek government."
"Unfortunately, this is not the first accident of its kind in European waters and, as I am sure you know, the European Union took decisive measures after the last serious ferry accident, the Estonia disaster in 1994."
"A series of far-reaching provisions was introduced in order to improve the safety of ferry passengers."
"As you will recall, the purpose of the provisions introduced at that time was to ensure: first, that passengers are registered."
"As a result, domestic and foreign voyages by passenger ferries to or from Union ports are covered by a complete legal framework."
"It is the Commission' s job to monitor the practical application of this legal framework within its remit as set out in the Treaty."
"The Commission therefore contacted the Greek authorities as soon as the Express Samina went down, requesting clarification of the application of Community law."
"The Commission asked the Greek authorities to check if the ships required to adopt the Community' s safety standards by 30 September had in fact done so."
"As a result of the check requested by the Commission, 60 ships were taken out of service pending proof of compliance with standards."
"The Commission fully endorses the European Parliament' s view that safety regulations applicable to passenger ferries now need to be tightened."
"The Member of the Commission responsible, Vice-President De Palacio, therefore intends to include the question of revising the current directive on safety standards for passenger ferries in its work programme for 2001."
"The Commission also intends to conduct a detailed examination of passenger transport liability regulations, in order to ascertain if they need to be changed."
"Finally, I should like to stress that the Commission is convinced of the need to make European legislation on the safety of passenger ferries a top priority and to ensure that this legislation is applied strictly and uniformly throughout the Community."
"Only thus will we contain the risk of a repeat of such accidents."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 6.00 p.m."
"Honourable Members, we have finished the last debate and there is a short time left before the start of the debate and statement by Mr Solana, the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy on both the situation in the Middle East and the elections in Yugoslavia. We shall therefore take a short break."
"Mr President, as you just said, the debate with Mr. Solana is not due to start for another 25 minutes, despite the fact that there are a great many urgent questions which cannot now be dealt with."
"We have finished early nearly every Thursday afternoon over recent weeks."
"There is nothing on the agenda this evening after the vote on the Plumb report and tomorrow morning' s agenda is almost non-existent."
"It seems to me that a curious discrepancy is starting to take shape."
"On Tuesday and Wednesday, there were considerable delays."
"Question time with the Commission started nearly one and a half hours late and yet Thursday' s agenda is disappearing before our very eyes."
"The question which I wish to raise and which I would ask the Bureau to clarify is if, having done away with Fridays, certain parties are now trying to do away with Thursdays."
"We all know that you strongly advocate Friday sittings and you are perfectly within your rights to do so."
"I think your point deserves discussion."
"We have taken note of it and I personally shall ensure that this aspect is discussed in detail at the next Bureau meeting."
"The sitting was suspended at 4.36 p.m. and resumed at 5 p.m."
"Situation in the Middle East - Elections in Yugoslavia"
"The next item is the statement by the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy on the situation in the Middle East and the elections in Yugoslavia."
"We are delighted to welcome Mr Solana, and I shall waste no time in inviting him to speak."
"Thank you, Mr Solana."
"Like Mr Solana, Commissioner Verheugen will be speaking on the two issues on our agenda this afternoon, which is to say the Middle East and the elections in Yugoslavia."
"Afterwards the Members of Parliament who have put their names down will speak."
"I think the groups have arranged that they will speak on the first issue initially, and then on the second."
"Madam President, High Representative, honourable Members. I agree with the High Representative' s observations on the situation in the Middle East and on the situation in Belgrade."
"Allow me to start by saying a few words on Serbia."
"During the elections on 24 September, the Serbian people ousted Milosevic and his regime."
"The Serbian people voted clearly in favour of a new beginning with new political leaders."
"The European Union has always made it clear that the Serbian people have as much right to be in Europe as any of the other people of Europe."
"We have always made it clear that we would radically revise our policy towards Serbia if the Serbian people voted at the elections in favour of the opposition and, hence, democratic change."
"We made it clear - and I should like to reaffirm this - that any decision in favour of democratic change would also be a decision to return to Europe."
"There is not the shadow of a doubt that this message was heard in Serbia and the Serbian people have cast their vote."
"The victory has been won, although the regime has made and continues to make huge efforts to forestall it."
"The question of whether democratic change can now be introduced and if it can be introduced without violence will perhaps be decided in the next few hours on the streets of Belgrade."
"Allow me to say loud and clear: Europe unreservedly supports the democratic opposition in Serbia."
"We call for the voice of the Serbian people to be heard and respected and we share its burning desire to see the back of Milosevic and his cohorts, who have brought so much suffering and unhappiness to so many, both in Serbia and in several other countries."
"As soon as the will of the people is respected - and it will be, of that I have no doubt - what has happened in Serbia will create an opportunity for real, lasting peace in the Balkans."
"It will give the Serbian people the chance to rejoin the European family of nations and to build a peaceful and stable future together with its neighbours."
"If the Serbian people bring about democratic change - and the European Union promised this a long time ago - the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia will enjoy the same benefits as its neighbours and the European Union will maintain the same relations with it."
"We must be prepared to keep this promise as soon as the will of the people is respected."
"As Mr Solana has already indicated - and I can confirm that the Commission is already working on reconstruction aid for the Serbian economy and infrastructure - this aid will come to fruition as soon as a democratic government is in office."
"We are prepared to lift sanctions and provide emergency aid against the harsh winter conditions."
"The President of the Commission commented last week that this is an immense task which we must tackle immediately and without delay, as soon as the will of the people is respected."
"I think that the signal which this debate sends to Belgrade today will be decisive."
"The message which Parliament must send can only be to urge Milosevic one more time, perhaps for the last time, to see the writing on the wall, step down and pave the way for democratic change in Serbia."
"(Applause)"
"I should like to make a few comments on the dramatic and rapid developments in the Middle East."
"We feel deep sorrow and sympathy for the numerous victims."
"It is mainly Palestinians who have fallen victim to the conflicts which have re-ignited over the last few days."
"We cannot be harsh enough in condemning the disproportionate and indiscriminate use of force."
"We condemn any action which deserves to be seen as provocation, especially in connection with the holy sites in Jerusalem."
"We welcome and support the efforts being made by President Chirac, President Mubarak and Secretary of State Albright and can only hope that the supreme objective of ending the violence and restoring peace and order will be achieved."
"On the question of the committee of enquiry, the Commission supports the Presidency' s stance."
"Obviously, this crisis may have dangerous repercussions on the peace process."
"We share this concern."
"Nonetheless - and I take the same view here as Mr Solana - it would be premature to consider that agreement between Israel and Palestine is now out of the question."
"The window of opportunity will be open until the end of October."
"After that, the stability of Prime Minister Barak' s government will be in jeopardy and there will be tremendous pressure on President Arafat to declare statehood."
"I hope that the meeting between President Mubarak, President Arafat and Prime Minister Barak in Sharm el Sheik will mark a return to constructive negotiation on a lasting peace agreement."
"It is our job to convince Israel that recognising and respecting the rights of the Palestinians, with all the compromises which that implies, is the best way of safeguarding its long-term national interests."
"Israel' s long-term interests lie in lasting peace."
"We must convince the Palestinians that the best way of achieving their objectives and safeguarding their rights is to negotiate with Israel."
"I should like to reaffirm that the European Union supports the peace process because it is the only mechanism which can make the only possible alternative for Israel and the Palestinian people come true."
"Fair, comprehensive peace, even if it means painful compromises on both sides."
"However complicated the issues may be, the parties must grab the historic chance which they now have."
"Anything else would be an awful tragedy."
"Negotiations should build on the progress made in Camp David in July."
"This progress was not directly tangible, to be sure, because the summit as a whole was not successful."
"But nor was Camp David a failure, because the gulf between the parties was clearly narrowed and some serious taboos were overcome."
"The European Union' s stand on the substance of the peace process has not changed."
"We support the parties in negotiating an agreement in keeping with the principles and references of the peace process set in motion in Madrid."
"We are convinced that a compromise can be found on all the points at issue."
"We are also prepared to make a contribution and provide help."
"If, as we hope, the parties manage to conclude an agreement, the European Union will add its political and financial support to the efforts being made by others on the basis of a fair distribution of the burden and will meet the parties' demands to a reasonable extent."
"We are prepared to work on securing stability in the region and, in the long term, on safeguarding the permanent welfare of the region through sustainable economic growth and an improved standard of living, so that the people in the region can reap the benefits of peace."
"This philosophy is in complete accord with a stronger Barcelona Europe-Mediterranean process and we shall continue our efforts within the context of that process."
"Thank you, Commissioner Verheugen."
"Madam President, Mr Solana, Commissioner, I take part in this debate with certain reservations because I do not want this Parliament giving the impression that it is sitting in judgment, casting anathema on this or that person when, after such great hopes were raised here only a month ago, we face the dramatic consequences of this new explosion of violence in the Middle East."
"I have agreed to be spokesperson for the Group of the European People' s Party because, like my colleagues in the group, I think it is essential to ask the Council, the Commission and you, Mr Solana, to spare no effort - you have just committed yourself to that - to help restart negotiations to secure the peace so long awaited throughout the world, in Europe, but especially there, on the spot."
"I know from experience that it is a lot more difficult for an army to win peace than a war."
"I know that the transition from fighting to peacekeeping requires troops who are capable, not of unleashing violence from their weapons in the conquest of an objective, but of controlling that violence."
"That requires special training, standard now for soldiers in European Union armies, because we are lucky enough to be at peace."
"The forces of Israel and Palestine are not so lucky."
"It is up to us to take our place beside the United Nations and the United States of America and, in close cooperation with them, to continue tirelessly supporting all those who have the determination to succeed at the price of the necessary concessions."
"And I have one question, Mr Solana: surely the time has come for an intelligent and courageous initiative by the European Union on the status of Jerusalem?"
"We all know that is the crux of the matter and we have not forgotten the interesting proposals we have heard on this subject in this very Chamber, which deserve our support."
"Madam President, I want to begin by expressing my deep sympathy with those families who have been affected by the latest bloody events that have taken place in the area we are talking about."
"Like others, I also want to express my concern about what is happening and, at the same time, say that, whenever this area is talked about, the impression given is really one of crossing a minefield and of its not taking very much to provoke a reaction, almost no matter what is said."
"I too, however, must urge both the Commissioner and Mr Solana to do everything in their powers to press for the successful achievement of a ceasefire agreement, so that the bloody events in question might be brought to an end."
"If that does not happen, a chain reaction might be triggered, in other countries too, which might prove to be uncontrollable."
"A minor example of this is the events that took place yesterday in Copenhagen when a peaceful demonstration turned violent. Happily, no-one was killed as a result, but unfortunately a number of people were injured."
"What we in the EU must and shall do, therefore, is continue talking in terms of negotiation, negotiation and, again, negotiation, so that those windows which are now open do not close before we have achieved a result. A peace agreement is needed now."
"Otherwise, there is a strong possibility of things ending in disaster."
"Madam President, my contribution today is not based on all kinds of theoretical analyses but on my own experiences over the past week, because I happened to be in Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip when the disturbances took place."
"On that basis, I would like to make three observations."
"Firstly, I would like to comment on Mr Sharon' s provocation on Thursday."
"It was clear from the outset that the issue was one of internal party-politics, namely the battle between Sharon and Netanyahu."
"In my view, what is far more damaging is the fact that this provocation was condoned by Prime Minister Barak, who, in my view, either made the huge mistake of wrongly gauging the implications of Mr Sharon' s visit, or made a conscious attempt to bring the whole situation to a head."
"Secondly, I would like to turn to the disturbances at the Al Aqsa Mosque on Friday."
"The next day, I talked to various people who visited that Mosque and it is really incomprehensible that various men in their fifties and sixties - i.e. not those throwing the stones - were shot at in the Mosque."
"Talking of provocation, I find it extremely shocking that the Israeli Government should shoot people who were praying in the Mosque on Temple Mount on the Holy Day of the Muslims, and I believe that the international community was entirely justified in its condemnation of the incident."
"My final comment concerns a visit to the hospital in Eastern Jerusalem the next day. In fact, I have quite a few observations regarding that visit."
"I found it extremely shocking to see that during the disturbances, an ambulance driver was shot."
"In another incident which I witnessed with my own eyes, an ambulance driver was shot in the foot from a ten centimetre range as he was trying to come to the rescue of some people. The most shocking of all is the fact that the Israeli police and the army used fragmentation bullets."
"These are bullets which, upon contact with the body, shatter into dozens of pieces. They are banned internationally, even in battles amongst soldiers; yet they are now used against citizens."
"My conclusion is that the Israeli Government has applied excessive force which has been widely condemned, and rightly so."
"My question to Mr Solana and the Commission is the following: what could the European Union do in very concrete terms in order, first of all, to substantiate the international inquiry into these disturbances, and secondly, to bring the peace process back on track?"
"Madam President, Mohamed was one of the many babies killed by the Israeli army. Eight years on from the signing of the peace agreements, the army still occupies over 80 % of the territories."
"The settlers have opened fire."
"How can we describe these new massacres and this Palestinian rebellion."
"More stone-throwing youths?"
"It is more than that. The Palestinian security forces are also firing."
"The explosion had been brewing for months: it is difficult to believe in peace when you consider that the number of settlers has grown from 141 000 to over 200 000 since the signing of the peace agreements; when you cannot find work to support your children, which is the case of my friend Talal who works as a builder in the settlements, maybe even on the land which used to belong to his family; it is difficult when the soldiers stop you from moving around."
"Ariel Sharon was the catalyst but the responsibility also lies with the government which allowed him to visit the holy site and did not stop the soldiers firing on the crowd."
"While condemning all forms of violence, we cannot make any parallel between the Israeli violence and the Palestinian violence."
"On the one hand, there is a state and an army occupying a territory in breach of all international laws and, on the other, there is a people who is tired of suffering and humiliation."
"This is not the work of Hamas: it is the uprising of a people who have had enough of being oppressed and are not being given satisfaction even by their own leaders and decision-makers."
"It is the revolt of the Palestinians who live in Israel who are not only demonstrating their solidarity with their brothers but demanding to be treated as citizens with full rights and to be allowed to live free from discrimination in Israel."
"We must play our part in bringing the violence to an end and re-establishing negotiations: the fighting must cease, the Israeli soldiers must be withdrawn, there must be an international inquiry, at which Europe must be present, and the Palestinian people must be protected."
"It would be enough for the European Union and the UN to make it clear that the UN resolutions, starting with resolutions 338, 242 and 194 on the return of refugees to their homes, apply."
"This would in itself have a major impact and could change Israel's - by now - firm conviction that it can always do whatever it likes with impunity."
"The right of the State of Israel to exist and to security is very important to us, as are the Israelis themselves who, together with the Palestinians, are currently demonstrating that they have had enough of occupation and enough of this violence."
"But the rights of the Palestinian State are no less important."
"In my opinion, Europe can and must do a great deal in this direction, and it must be clear and resolute."
"It is true that peace is achieved through dialogue but rights have to be respected, and here rights are not being respected."
"It is not a question of the Israelis making concessions; we must enforce the law."
". Madam President, I shall be very brief, very clear and perhaps a little emotional."
"The latest reports I have received - and I regret I may have to leave Parliament to go to Paris immediately - are that the parliament building has been taken over by the demonstrators in Belgrade and the television building is now in the hands of the opposition."
"The situation in the central part of Belgrade is extraordinary, and we may be very close to the last moments of a regime, as the British Foreign Secretary said."
"I would like to ask Parliament at this critical hour to issue a statement of support for the brave people who have, today, defended freedom and liberty in the streets of Belgrade, echoing the support which we Europeans gave not many years ago to sustain those people in other capitals who were also fighting for their freedom."
"That has allowed us to start a new process in the European Union, opening the doors to those countries which, for historical reasons, are not part of this institution."
"We would like to see them here in this Parliament as soon as possible."
"Let us hope that this moment is the moment of truth, and that freedom will be in the streets of Belgrade soon."
"I have been recalled by the Presidency to be in Paris as soon as possible."
"I would ask you to allow me to leave forthwith: I hope you understand that my obligation right now is to be with the Presidency of the European Union to try to tackle the complicated situation we will be faced with over the coming hours."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, the bloody confrontations which have taken place in the last few days in Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip, the West Bank and Israel are particularly serious, because of the high numbers of victims and also because they have brought renewed talk of exclusion as regards the State of Israel, talk that we thought belonged to the past and which is dangerously irresponsible."
"The violence, the unacceptable provocation, the disproportionate reaction against the Palestinian people must not become a pretext for questioning the fundamental right of both peoples, Israeli and Palestinian, to have a state to ensure expression of their nationhood."
"Some of the statements that have been made - here, even, and elsewhere - are disturbing."
"They are not likely to make negotiations any easier, quite the contrary."
"The events of the last few days demonstrate exactly how fragile the peace process is."
"So we must do everything possible to douse the fire as quickly as possible."
"The only effective way of doing that is through intergovernmental talks and Mr Solana, who has just left us, is right to concentrate his efforts in that direction."
"And here I want to pay homage to the resolute diplomacy of the United States, France and Egypt in particular."
"The main lesson to be drawn from these grave troubles, the source of which has been Jerusalem, and more specifically the Temple Mount and the Al Aqsa Mosque Compound, is that as long as the negotiations on Jerusalem and in particular on the Holy Places are put off, peace cannot be definitely assured."
"It is absolutely essential to end the dangerous deadlock where each side considers it unthinkable that the other should have sovereignty over the Holy Places."
"So, negotiations should concentrate on the possibility of making the most sensitive areas neutral, and why not revive the proposal made here on 2 September by the Chairman of the Palestinian Legislative Council, Mr Ahmed Qurie?"
"As you will remember, he told us that the major differences over Jerusalem lay at the heart of the failure of Camp David, and made the following proposal, with particular reference to UN Resolution 181, and I quote: ""we Palestinians agree that both parts of Jerusalem, East and West, should be a unified Jerusalem, an international Jerusalem, and it should not be the capital of Israel and Palestine alone, but of the whole world."" ."
"I think this avenue ought to be explored as soon as possible, because until the Jerusalem question is resolved, it will continue to be the source of periodic confrontations likely to degenerate in the same way as the tragic events we are currently witnessing."
"Madam President, there is no doubt that Europe would be well advised to seize the opportunity presented to us here by the Chairman of the Palestinian Legislative Council."
"Madam President, I have just been talking to the group Chairman in the front row."
"I have not yet had a chance to talk to the others further up, but we are entirely in favour of your making a statement expressing what I believe is the unanimous feeling of this Parliament towards the Serb people."
"That is the most direct method and we hope the message can reach those people in their heroic struggle for democracy."
"Thank you for that proposal, Mr Barón Crespo, and for your confidence in me."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I have one minute to put my position on an issue which has been close to my heart since 1967. The evidence seems to be that the State of Israel has no intention, and never has had any intention, of negotiating seriously with Palestine and granting it all the powers of a sovereign and independent nation."
"The State of Israel sees many advantages in this situation of latent conflict and does not hesitate to make use of them."
"Whatever the alleged good intentions of certain Israeli leaders, nothing has really changed for the Palestinians."
"Colonisation of the occupied territories is increasing."
"The economic dependence of Palestine is increasing."
"Access to the Muslim Holy Places is being made more and more difficult."
"The Palestinian leaders are in a no-win situation."
"The fact is, they either accept perpetual talks, generally under the auspices of the United States, and endorse the expansionist policy of the State of Israel or, with the aid of other Muslim countries and their traditional friends, they create a new and more favourable balance of power."
"This new balance of power calls, in particular, for the immediate proclamation of a Palestinian State, the use of oil as a weapon and more organised recourse to legitimate defence."
"Madam President, the peace process in the Middle East is extremely fragile."
"Such a situation requires tact."
"Provocations such as those initiated by Mr Ariel Sharon, must be refrained from."
"However, violence is not a legitimate response to provocation, and calling on the population to use violence certainly is not."
"If the European Union wants to be a reliable partner in the peace process, it will have to unequivocally condemn provocations and calls for violent action."
"To this end, my group has tabled two amendments to the resolution to that effect."
"It is not acceptable only to condemn Israel if the Palestinian leadership is still using violence as a possible tool in the negotiations."
"It is heartrending if children are sacrificed in a battle which should be settled around the negotiating table."
"The position of Jerusalem is a moot point in the negotiations."
"I call on this Parliament to follow the Biblical line: pray for peace in Jerusalem so that the Jews and Arabs can live together in peace."
"Madam President, over the last few days, we have watched the dream of peace in the Middle East disintegrate."
"The horrifying pictures of children running for cover being killed and of civilians being fired at from tanks and helicopters give us just a tiny glimpse of the hell which could be in store for both sides, Israel and Palestine, if they fail to conclude and implement the peace process as quickly as possible."
"That is the most important aspect at the moment, not apportioning blame and condemnation."
"The European Union should do everything it can to serve this objective and the potential inherent in it."
"However, I am not prepared - as I have been urged on several occasions, purely in order to appear fair - to refrain from calling the events of the last few days by their proper name or from making the same demands on both sides, as if the provocation and force were divided equally between them."
"Or should I call on the Hamas leader Scheich Yassin to refrain from his possible intention of visiting the wailing wall on the Sabbath in order to provoke the Jews praying there?"
"Should I perhaps call on the Palestinian army to withdraw its tanks and helicopters from Israeli towns and villages and stop firing on civilian Israelis?"
"Should I perhaps call on the Palestinian army not to shoot any small Israeli children cowering behind walls and trying to take cover behind barrels?"
"I am not prepared to engage in this sort of fairness."
"But I am prepared to call on my fellow members in the House to have the courage to call a murder a murder and to condemn provocation as provocation and not as counter-productivity, as Mrs Albright said, in order to gloss things over, purely to appear fair towards both sides."
"In this respect, I am most grateful for the clear statement made by my fellow Member Mr Lagendijk."
"Madam President, I think the text of this resolution is a perfect demonstration that Europe will never act as a mediator between Israel and Palestine."
"Once again, there is confusion between, on the one hand, a democratic State doing its best to deal with an extremely difficult situation and, on the other, the institution at the heart of Palestine which, under provocation certainly, immediately takes up arms to shoot at the Israeli forces of order."
"That is happening again today, and that is what will prevent, and has prevented Europe from acting as mediator in the Middle East all these years, leaving the United States to fulfil that role alone."
"Finally, regarding Serbia, I would like to tell Mr Barón Crespo that he and his group might at least have the good grace to keep quiet on the subject, given that throughout the previous parliament his group was willing to go to any lengths to block any action designed to bring Milosevic to justice, and when a majority was achieved it was not with the support of the Socialist Group."
"Madam President, fellow Members. It is of course difficult, as events unfold in Belgrade, to sit here calmly and give a speech which was prepared before all this came to pass."
"I expected today' s events to take place last Monday."
"We all know that the people have stormed Parliament, that the television station, which has been fully occupied by the army, has been stormed and that army vehicles and the police are now out in force in the middle of Belgrade."
"We can only hope that all the people hiding behind the army and behind the police - all of whom are essentially there to serve the people, not a dictator such as Milosevic - will think twice before turning against the peaceful demonstrators."
"Since democracy raised its head again in Serbia last Monday, the possibility of Serbia soon rejoining the European family is now a real possibility."
"The results of the elections on 24 September have made a democratic change of direction possible."
"I should like to congratulate everyone who helped to achieve it: the democratic opposition and, most importantly, the people and the leader of the democratic organisation, Mr Kostunica."
"I think that, in him, we have a man who understands both the Serbs and our concerns and with whom we can discuss a qualified procedure for bringing Serbia closer to Europe."
"Since 24 September, Milosevic can no longer claim to be an elected ruler."
"Everyone, including his own citizens in Serbia now clearly see that he is a dictator, who is using all the brutal, ugly and contemptuous instruments of dictatorship in his own country. Special police units, dirty tricks and deception, quasi-legal procedures which he is using in a bid to hush up the fact that the people are sick and tired of him."
"He has managed for years, with the help of his propaganda machine and by exerting brutal pressure on the media, to deceive the people in his own country and, unfortunately, many in the western world, to whom he has misrepresented the real situation."
"At last, all that is at an end. The people in Serbia have expressed their will in democratic elections and they are painfully aware of the fact that Milosevic has no intention of respecting this will and is thinking only of hanging on to power and maintaining his contemptuous regime."
"Which is why we must support Serbia in its bid for freedom."
"Those who have fought for peace in south-eastern Europe for years now and who are familiar with the situation in the region, know how difficult the fight against authoritarian rulers and tyrants in most of these countries was and, in places, still is."
"Sometimes we expect too much of the new people in power or we expect them to follow our views and our way of thinking, which do not fit in with their traditions and which are irreconcilable with their philosophy of life or alien to their mindset."
"I should therefore like to state quite clearly that we shall soon have new contacts in Serbia, who may well not understand us immediately or who will perhaps misunderstand us, partly due to inexperience and partly due to the cultural or structural differences which I have mentioned."
"I should like straight away to warn against interpreting any such initial difficulties in communicating with the newly elected president as a sign of irreconcilable differences between us and the advocates of democracy in Serbia."
"There are no such differences."
"We can help them on the path to Europe."
"If we want to give the implementation of the stability pact a real boost after the imminent change of power in Serbia and push the so-called quick start packages through at long last, then we must do more than just talk."
"I therefore call on the Commission and the Council to give a sign at long last and at least lift some sanctions, because these sanctions have made 200 000 people in Serbia richer and richer and 10 million people poorer and poorer."
"Please help us to give the people a glimmer of hope, with Kostunica, so that we can all nurse some hope for Serbia."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. We are delighted to hear that the people of Yugoslavia, mainly in Belgrade but also in other towns, have known how to take their fate into their own hands and have done so."
"However, our delight is tainted with fear that there may be bloodshed, that not everyone wants to and can accept the voice, power and strength of the people."
"Everything must therefore be done to prevent bloodshed, because a civil war in Yugoslavia or Serbia would be a veritable disaster."
"Mr Dupuis, you have abused this truly historic moment here in order to engage in political demagogy."
"I have only one thing to say to you: my group and I are unequivocally in favour of bringing Milosevic to justice before the court in the Hague."
"That has always been our objective; but we have a still higher objective, which is to avoid bloodshed and we shall do everything we can so that bloodshed is avoided."
"The Commission and the Council will do their part and that is what is currently at the top of the agenda in Yugoslavia and that is what we have been interested in all along."
"We shall not sacrifice the Serbian people to our noble and moral objectives, because that would mean that perhaps thousands of people in Serbia and Yugoslavia might die for them."
"Secondly, we are in a very delicate position and, therefore, we too trust that there will be fast changes in Yugoslavia and Serbia, because the situation is not easy in either Montenegro or Kosovo."
"Here, too, I have one thing to say: we have supported the efforts with which the people have defended themselves against the brutal force emanating from Milosevic in both Kosovo and Montenegro, but under no circumstances do we support the concept of ethnically clean states."
"Kosovo must be independent come what may and Montenegro must be independent come what may, just to ensure that Serbia is weakened."
"Our objective is still - and I admit it - for there to be a new Yugoslavia, a Yugoslavia with an independent state of Kosovo and an independent state of Montenegro; it is not for there to be new divisions, renewed conflict, renewed clashes or renewed force, that is not our objective; on the contrary, a new Yugoslavia needs to emerge, a democratic Yugoslavia, where people stay willingly, not under duress, not under brutality, but because they are convinced that a federation can emerge which has a democratic future, a democratic future under different leaders and from which Milosevic can be removed - if possible - by bringing him before the court in the Hague, because we want justice, but we want justice with peace."
"Madam President, despite his twisting and squirming we are probably seeing Milosevic's final moments in power."
"It is a power that he has abused cynically and he is now trying to cheat democracy."
"We are certain that Mr Milosevic will fall, possibly this evening, certainly soon."
"What we are seeing on CNN is more than the fall of Milosevic."
"It is the end of the dreary succession of 20th century European tyrants."
"Serbia is suffering the final pangs of fascism on the fringes of our own Union."
"We will all rejoice when that suffering is over."
"As the drama concludes it is the duty of this Parliament, as a symbol of united free Europe, to support the crowds outside the Yugoslav parliament and to help Mr Kostunica to achieve and fulfil the mandate."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is slightly bizarre that we should be discussing Serbia in this Chamber at a time when the Serbian parliament building is going up in flames and hundreds of thousands of people are on the streets."
"Despite this, I would like to make an attempt at explaining why I am positive and optimistic about the outcome at the moment."
"There is of course the support of hundreds of thousands of people - the figure of one million has even been mooted - who are prepared at this moment to put themselves at risk in order to support the opposition and to help Mr Kostunica against the wishes of Mr Milosevic."
"There are also the latest reports on the role of the police, which, as has been apparent for some time, have been in doubt as to whether to continue to support the regime, and which, as it appears from the first reports now coming in, have opted to side with the demonstrators; according to the latest reports, the same could happen with the army."
"There is also the fact that the chairman of the state broadcasting corporation has resigned, this being a signal, I believe, that he refuses to act as the extension and mouthpiece of the Milosevic regime any longer."
"I would like to make two minor observations with regard to the future."
"I wholeheartedly support the proposal and appeal by Doris Pack to reach the decision quickly, in fact as quickly as possible, to lift the sanctions, because these have done far more harm than good."
"I would also like to say - and this is more of an appeal to the Council, but I am sharing it with the Commission and Parliament for now - let us not just make fine declarations with regard to the aid which we will soon be willing to grant to Serbia, but let us also make room for this cause in our own budget, the European Union' s budget, so that we do not end up concluding that we can only help Serbia by taking funding away from other projects in the Balkans which need our support."
"Finally, I would like to propose that a delegation from Parliament visit Serbia at the earliest opportunity, and once a new Yugoslavian government has been installed, so that we, in tandem with this new government, can make plans for the reconstruction of a new Serbia."
"Madam President, I am wondering how we can help democratic Yugoslavia, considering the way in which events appear to be, or we hope they are, unfolding now."
"Our group has confidence in our President and in the declaration which we have agreed she should make."
"However, Madam President and Commissioner, we need more than pretty words."
"Do not say in general terms, ""Serbia belongs in Europe"" , which is, after all, something which you have only recently discovered."
"We refer to Yugoslavia but it is no help to Mr Kostunica if we appear to be implying that Montenegro, for example, will secede."
"And to ensure we do go beyond pretty words, do you intend to propose as quickly as possible that Yugoslavia, by that I mean democratic Yugoslavia, be included in the list of candidate countries for the enlargement of the European Union?"
"We at least hope that you do."
"Madam President, Slobodan Milosevic' s latest polling box fraud comes as no surprise to us. It is an electoral manoeuvre which is ad nauseam reminiscent of an extremely poor political reputation."
"Precisely this unfeeling attitude is also making us fear the worst - and current events are bearing out the words written by myself only a few hours ago."
"Is the Yugoslav President really making way for his opponent and probably lawfully elected successor, Vojislav Kostunica, without any bloodshed?"
"A pressing question indeed."
"Along with the Serbian population, the Western world would be only too happy with such a switch in power in Belgrade."
"However, a sense of relief should not be attended by reckless carelessness."
"The European Union and the United States are being warned about this from various quarters in the region."
"They consider Kostunica - in terms of ideas - just as much a Great-Serbian nationalist as Milosevic, with all that entails for the Montenegrins and Kosovars."
"In summary, should Kostunica take Milosevic' s place, the West would do well to make aid strictly dependent on his concrete efforts to establish a constitutional state in Serbia and Yugoslavia."
"Madam President, I hesitated before asking to speak again because I noticed that your press secretaries just handed you something and I thought perhaps you had received the latest news."
"If you have not, I would be grateful if I might briefly read out the following release from the German press agency timed at 17.53 hours."
"It says: several dozen members of the special police have joined with the demonstrators in Belgrade."
"All the police deployed to guard the state television building stormed by the protestors, have laid down their combat weapons and have allied themselves with the demonstrators."
"This was reported on Radio Index."
"Apparently at least one police station in the city centre has joined the protestors."
"That was the latest at 17.53 hours."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is clear that today may well turn out to be a historic day in this Parliament, possibly ushering in the end of one of the last buttresses of a totalitarian dictatorship in Europe."
"It is of course difficult to determine how long the Serbian population will need to continue fighting before Milosevic will actually disappear off the scene."
"A unanimous stance on the part of the Serbian population has proved extremely important, as it will continue to do so for the next couple of days and weeks."
"This means, at the same time, that the European Union too will very much need to form a united front."
"In this context, I deplore the fact that the Dutch Minister for Foreign Affairs, fortunately abandoned by almost all parties in the Lower Chamber, adopted a stance out of the blue which goes against the unity of the European Union and against the wishes of the opposition in Serbia."
"I believe this displays a lack of earnestness, and is at the same time insulting to his office. It also signals an excessive drive to stand out from the rest, to the point where the life of people could be at stake."
"I believe it is also important to establish at this time on what basis the High Representative and the Council will need to adopt their positions."
"Will it be by largest common denominator, or on the basis of a large majority in the Council, which should not be difficult to achieve with regard to this issue?"
"In addition to establishing unity in the Union, this is also, of course, about recognising the fact that Kostunica has won the presidential elections."
"I wonder if the Commissioner has planned any steps in this respect to demonstrate that we really do consider Kostunica to be the only lawfully elected representative of the Serbian people, and the only partner with whom the European Union is involved as from today."
"Naturally it is difficult to mention budgets at this early stage."
"The High Representative explained this only a moment ago, but what we can do is to selectively lift sanctions by way of sending a message to the Serbian electorate."
"The neighbouring countries will take a great interest in this too."
"I hope that the Council, in conjunction with the Commission, will take clear measures in this respect in the short term."
"It is not easy to gauge Serbia' s future."
"As we have already witnessed all over Central Europe, constitutional states and democracy do not blossom automatically after a revolution."
"Nationalism does not automatically disappear if a democratically elected president can be found."
"We should therefore remain level-headed and focused in our attempts to create openings for a development which will bring Serbia nearer to Europe, also from a moral-political point of view."
"The debate is closed."
"I have received three motions for resolutions, pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The vote will take place shortly."
"Vote"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is as a friend of Israel that I am explaining tonight why I have voted for the joint resolution."
"Indeed, while I regret a certain ambiguity in the wording and while I do not accept the failure to mention that there is a multitude of Palestinian groups prepared to do anything to wipe out the State of Israel and the Israelis by means of violence and war, it is my very friendship for the Israelis that makes me implore them to end the armed repression against children."
"It is also my friendship for Israel and my esteem for the Palestinians that makes me implore them to do everything possible to achieve peace, even if that means great sacrifice on both sides."
"Their security and their medium- and long-term existence are at stake and no doubt world peace too, at this moment."
"Mr President, if you will allow me, I would like to explain why I have abstained in the vote on the resolution regarding the Middle East."
"I believe that in delicate matters such as these, preference should be given to a diplomatic stance and, as far as the specific content of Paragraph 4 is concerned, it does not comply with the standards for a balanced resolution, in my view."
"Especially with regard to the committee of inquiry, I would like to stress the fact that it should be an internationally constituted committee of enquiry and that its competences must be clearly delineated."
"Mr President, there is a problem with the German urgent debate file - I do not know if the same applies to the other language versions - in that it only contains the proposed amendments of the GUE group but none of the motions for resolutions and not even the joint text."
"That is a serious error."
"If I had not been given information by Mrs Langenhagen, who is a first-class shipbuilding and shipping safety expert, I would not now know what I was supposed to be voting on."
"Please ensure that this does not happen again."
"Statement by the President on Yugoslavia"
"The people of Serbia have taken their destiny into their own hands."
"The European Parliament wishes to express its total solidarity with them at this historic time, as tyranny crumbles and democracy emerges triumphant."
"We applaud the political courage of the millions of Serbs now on the streets, and we hope all the police forces will join them."
"The European Union and the European Parliament, in particular, will do everything possible to help re-establish the democratic process."
"To that end, we call for sanctions to be lifted and for the Union to draw up solidarity measures for a free Yugoslavia."
"(Loud applause)"
"Mr President, I wish to comment on this morning' s agenda, which, as you know, is particularly lean, even though extremely important events are taking place in Europe and it is most striking that we have held an entire part-session without having a single debate on the single currency."
"Last week, on 24 September, an extremely important referendum was held, in which the Danes rejected the single currency."
"Yesterday, the European Central Bank raised its intervention rates by a quarter of a point, which led to a further fall in the euro' s value."
"There are two conclusions to be drawn here. Firstly, the public will never take any interest in our debates if Parliament persists in side-stepping discussions on every important issue."
"Secondly, the euro is an artificial currency and it would be a disaster to make a complete changeover to the euro in the present circumstances."
"Mr President, I just wanted to draw attention to the huge pile of documents we needed for voting this week."
"I would like to congratulate the honourable Members."
"We have all been very industrious."
"(Laughter, applause)"
"Thank you, Mr Rübig."
"Loans for projects in Croatia"
"The next item is the report (A5-0237/2000) by Mr Seppänen, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the proposal for a Council Decision amending Decision 2000/24/EC so as to extend the Community guarantee granted to the European Investment Bank to cover loans for projects in Croatia (COM(2000) 289 - C5-0336/2000 - 2000/0122(CNS))."
"Mr President, the European Investment Bank grants loans to non-EU countries, guaranteed by the European Union."
"The bank guarantees individual loans freely in accordance with its own criteria and not the precise guidelines laid down by the EU."
"However, the Union has fixed a ceiling for the loans it guarantees."
"The loans are not guaranteed one hundred percent and the Council decided in December 1999 to guarantee just 65% of the final total for loans for the period 2000-2007."
"For the rest the bank must itself obtain other forms of security or cover the risk itself."
"In practice there is no risk and the European Investment Bank would even be prepared to lower the percentage the EU guarantees."
"There is a special Guarantee Fund in the Union budget for loans from the EIB."
"For each guarantee, funds are transferred from a special reserve into the Guarantee Fund, with a maximum amount decided in the finance frameworks contained in the interinstitutional agreement."
"In 2000 a maximum of 204 million euros can be transferred from the reserve to the Guarantee Fund."
"Technically 9% of the sum for EIB loans should be transferred from the reserve into the Guarantee Fund, a figure representing 65% of the nominal value of the loans."
"The Guarantee Fund in the budget is also used for macroeconomic aid to non-EU countries."
"It is a cheap way for the Member States to grant development aid."
"These loans are granted on political grounds to the EU' s humble partners and they are guaranteed one hundred percent by the Guarantee Fund, unlike the Investment Bank loans."
"In macroeconomic aid it is often a question of the EU' s share in an overall package in which other sources of aid are the World Bank and the IMF."
"Generally, financial aid to non-member countries is granted in accordance with the economic and political behavioural criteria set by the IMF - the more guarantees are given for Investment Bank loans, the less macroeconomic aid can be granted, and vice versa."
"The Guarantee Fund can also be used to guarantee the Euratom loans to support the development of core industries in non-member countries, although no transfers from the reserves to the Guarantee Fund have had to be organised for these sorts of loans in recent years."
"In December 1999 the Council decided the maximum amount for guarantees for the Investment Bank for the period 2000-2007, and produced a list of non-member countries that would be entitled to receive aid."
"The European Parliament adopted a position on the matter in a report by Mrs Rühle in autumn 1999."
"As Parliament has been heard, the matter is no longer being discussed in Parliament with regard to the terms and conditions of the guarantees."
"Parliament must today decide a very simple matter: whether Croatia should join that group of countries to which the European Investment Bank may grant loans with an EU guarantee."
"Croatia is no longer at war and democratic change has taken place there."
"So there are good grounds for the country joining the group of borrowers, just as there are to increase the ceiling of the EIB mandate."
"If Parliament could table amendments to the Council Decision it would certainly remind us of Croatia' s unemployment and social problems, which are the result of that country being put on a slimming regimen, but there is no legal basis here for such amendments."
"The same problem of legal competence will also apply in the decision to be discussed soon in Parliament regarding Turkey joining the group of those countries receiving loan guarantees given by the EU to the European Investment Bank."
"Parliament is bound to have a lot of conditions it would like to impose on loans to Turkey, but at the time we will be making a decision in practice with regard to just one word."
"Today we add Croatia to the list of those receiving guarantees and then it will be Turkey' s turn."
"In this connection we will at the same time make it known to the Commission that next year the Guarantee Fund reserves will not be sufficient for guaranteeing the loans we can expect."
"Mr President, this proposal for a Council decision with a view to extending, for the first time, the Community guarantee for the European Investment Bank undoubtedly has a truly extraordinary scope."
"Before commenting specifically on the issues raised by this proposal for a decision, I should like to express our support for it, since it endorses Parliament' s position on relations between the European Union and Croatia."
"For this very reason, I wish to state from the outset that I share the concerns expressed by the rapporteur a few minutes ago on the situation of the loan guarantee reserve, whose narrow margin could cause problems should any unforeseen events occur."
"There is one decision that must be put in a dual context. We should consider Croatia' s situation firstly from a strictly political point of view."
"We must welcome the new political direction that is being taken there, following the legislative and presidential elections."
"The European Union must encourage Croatia to remain firmly grounded in democracy and the rule of law and there is no doubt that this encouragement must be translated into action involving financial support to improve the economic situation there and to enable the Croatian people to make the necessary sacrifices to balance out the fundamental deficits in their public accounts."
"The EIB can and must play a leading role in the region, but this powerful financial instrument serving the external policy of the Union, whose activities, in accordance with the mandate provided by the 1999 decision, cover more than sixty countries, must match its actions to those of the Commission. It must also be made clear that the Commission cannot distance itself from the recent agreement that was reached in the tripartite dialogue in July, when a commitment was given to the effect that every new proposal' s compatibility with existing financial programming must be substantiated in the financial statement."
"From the operational point of view, I believe that both the loan guarantee reserve that has been provided for in the current financial perspective, and the functioning of the Guarantee Fund require an improvement in the mechanisms for achieving the objectives of quality and efficiency in Union loans that are given budgetary guarantees."
"In this sense, the rapporteur' s analysis strikes me as being an admirable starting point."
"It does not seek to cast doubt on the budgetary protection plan nor on the role of the EIB."
"The Interinstitutional Agreement provides for a series of three-part dialogues to take place within the budgetary procedure."
"Given this context and bearing in mind the narrow margin of the loan guarantee reserve, which is set at EUR 200 million per year, there is no reason why we should not discuss the priority uses of this margin in coming years."
"Our aim is clearly to improve the efficiency of the European Investment Bank. In order to achieve this, the Commission must ensure that the most thorough assessment possible of its activities will be carried out."
"We cannot content ourselves with saying that we have a reliable system of guarantees."
"In the budgetary procedure for 2001, our political group has maintained a strategy of pursuing a marked improvement in the quality of expenditure and an improvement in the mechanisms for monitoring its performance."
"It is time to call for the same objectives with regard to the activities of the EIB."
"What is clear is that Parliament cannot restrict its role to passively assimilating the information supplied to it by the Commission and the EIB, or to giving its blessing to the decisions of the Council."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report by the Committee on Budgets under discussion, which recommends extending the Community guarantee given to the European Investment Bank to loans granted to Croatia, deals with two important matters."
"Firstly, the political situation in Croatia has improved dramatically."
"The new government is committed to political and economic reform."
"That is an opportunity for the European Union to continue once more with cooperation, which was interrupted in 1995 when Croatia began military action in Krajina."
"The other message is contained in Croatia' s still very difficult economic situation."
"For years the country practised an economic policy based on plundering, which has left the new government to shoulder the burden of a depressed business sector and an unemployment rate of more than 20%."
"The rapporteur, Esko Seppänen, says quite rightly in the explanatory statement in his report that social conditions in Croatia are difficult and the Community' s contribution to the reform process should also have a positive impact on the social dimension."
"An important political change was seen in Croatia in the parliamentary elections that were held earlier this year."
"The country' s inhabitants showed by voting that they demanded democratic change."
"The new government was made up of a democratic frontline of six parties, which has a firm majority in the country' s parliament."
"The government has indicated it is rapidly recognising the values of European democracy and the rule of law."
"In foreign relations it gives priority to the integration of a Euro-Atlantic framework."
"In its programme, the government is committed to such matters as a respect for human rights and the rights of minorities, the repatriation of refugees, improved relations with its neighbours, and considerable economic reform."
"Legislation is already in place to achieve these aims."
"Developments in Croatia have swiftly led to closer relations between the EU and Croatia after a gap of several years."
"Between the Union and Croatia there is an advisory working party in place, whose purpose it is to offer Croatia expertise and technical assistance in negotiations on contractual relations."
"According to the Commission, talks on the Stability and Association Pact with the country should be started as soon as possible."
"The Council decided in August that the Tempus 3 programme, which relates to higher education, should extend to Croatia."
"In July the Commission freed 10 million euros to support the repatriation of refugees."
"The proposal under discussion contains a target figure of 250 million euros in EIB loans for Croatia for the period 2000-2007."
"With that sum, it is proposed to finance basic infrastructure projects and environmental investment, the development of industry and SMEs, housing reconstruction, urban renewal and tourism."
"The plans are in accordance with projects that were put forward by Croatia at the Regional Funding Conference held in March."
"Croatia' s leaders are committed to difficult but necessary economic reform."
"The cure will be hard to endure, but, hopefully, the loans now being spoken about will help to soften the negative effects of economic reform on the lives of the people."
"We also have to remember that Croatia has good industrial manufacturing plants, a qualified and trained workforce and excellent opportunities for the development of tourism, for example."
"According to a survey by the Commission the country' s competitiveness in European markets could be strengthened enormously with a raft of consistently applied and ambitious structural reforms, but at present many Croatian businesses still have problems competing in the free economy."
"The events in the Balkans and the future of the region are burning issues."
"This week, in the wake of the Presidential elections, we have followed the situation in Yugoslavia with bated breath."
"The winds of change are blowing in Belgrade too."
"The international community has already indicated it will support the Serbian nation and sanctions are being lifted."
"The European Union and the European Parliament have every reason to support positive developments in the Balkans."
"Instability in the region is a threat to Europe as a whole."
"We know that nationalism and poverty mean war."
"Ahead of us there is a massive amount of physical and spiritual reconstruction to take place and we also, for our part, have to clear the barriers to effective assistance."
"Unfortunately, interinstitutional discussions on next year' s budget - in particular section IV on financing - still appear to be very difficult for the time being."
"Hopefully, the signs of hope in Croatia and now also in Yugoslavia will encourage us to find a solution to the problems of the budget and its financial perspectives."
"Mr President, last night we discussed the topic of Serbia and the revolutionary changes that are taking place there."
"In somewhat less dramatic style, Croatia changed governments last year."
"In any event, the election victory of the opposition was given the same recognition."
"This is why it is possible to pick up where we left off in 1995."
"The chances of achieving a stabilisation and association agreement have now been looked into, and it is expected that negotiations on this topic will begin before the end of this year."
"A delegation of the European Union has been primed for action, and as you know, the Summit at the end of November will take place precisely in Zagreb, in order to give Croatia the message that the country is welcome in European Union circles."
"This is why it is necessary for the economy to be rebuilt."
"In its recent past, Croatia has witnessed dramatic changes for the worse and widespread corruption."
"Let us not forget that, until recently, Croatia was the classic example of a privatisation programme which had got completely out of hand, and which benefited only one individual."
"This whole process will need bolstering, which will require enormous investments - investments in infrastructure, in the environment, but also investments in very risky operations."
"As we all know, setting up small and medium-sized businesses in that kind of country is risky."
"Things can go wrong, and this also applies to the reception of refugees, an investment goal which was lacking from the rapporteur' s report, unfortunately."
"These too are risky investments."
"It is therefore only justified that the mandate of the European Investment Bank will be increased by 250 million."
"The European Union is acting as guarantor."
"But this is exactly where the problem lies, because we are now at the same point where we were last night when we were discussing the subject of Serbia, namely the fact that the Council underestimated the actual cost to be incurred in the Balkans last year in Berlin."
"As a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, I know that the members of the Committee on Budgets have criticised me and my colleagues for continually wanting more funds for the Balkans, and for having to enter into negotiations with the Council, which is not always that easy."
"But there is very definitely a real problem."
"I mentioned it yesterday when we were debating Serbia and I am repeating it here."
"It is not acceptable that the rift between the pledges and promises made by the European Union on the one hand, and the reserved funding on the other hand, should be as huge as it is now threatening to become."
"Having spoken fine words yesterday and having granted this guarantee today, the European Union cannot afford to arrive in Belgrade empty-handed tomorrow."
"I would therefore urge the fellow Members but also, and mainly, the Council, to stick as closely as possible to the Commission' s proposal during the next couple of months of negotiations on the budget for next year and subsequent years, the reason being that, in my view, the proposal still provides the best estimate of the total cost in Croatia, but also in other parts of the Balkans."
"I would now like to turn my attention to the overall programme for the Balkans."
"I support the amendment by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, which is right in saying that this loan is important, but that, in the final analysis, the overall programme, given the necessary financial backing, is more important."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his report and explanatory comments."
"I am sure we are all agreed that Croatia must be given political assistance, but political assistance also entails financial support, because political stability is always a prerequisite to social and economic stability. This can only be achieved, of course, if there is an appropriate level of investment in this sphere."
"There is not a moment to lose if the fall in GDP recorded for 1999 and the increase in the budgetary deficit in Croatia are to be halted and reversed. In the final analysis, the only way to achieve this is through Croatia developing self-supporting economic cycles."
"The contribution under discussion, which would take the form of an EIB loan in excess of EUR 250 million for the period from 2000 to 2007, may not prove to be a milestone, but it would certainly help the process on its way."
"The course of action proposed by the Commission and backed by the report is the inevitable outcome."
"However, the problems that have come to light and which are as yet unresolved, are something else altogether."
"It is generally the case that new political challenges demand increased financial outlay, but not - I might add - at the expense of others."
"Therefore, we must think in general terms - and hopefully arrive at positive political decisions - firstly, about increasing the reserves for the guarantee fund, and secondly, about the fact that it must not be left solely to the Council to determine how the residual margin is to be used, and thirdly, about establishing binding criteria for the effective deployment of the EIB loan, so as to be able, at the end of the day, to monitor whether this package is actually consistent with the necessary objectives for which it was intended."
"Mr President, living through these dramatic hours, we look to Belgrade and hope that a process of democratisation will get underway there which will present us with a real democracy in the course of the next few years."
"Yet there is still a huge question mark hanging over all this."
"We want to support and welcome the process, but we must not get carried away."
"Croatia started building a democracy as long as ten years ago."
"Democratic elections were held there in 1990, which the international community deemed fair and free."
"Following these elections the former Communist government, under the leadership of the present Prime Minister, Mr Racan, stepped down in a disciplined manner and a new democratic development began under the Tudjman government. According to the international community though, a few cracks started to develop in this administration, and the situation went downhill from there."
"We must now consider the bigger picture."
"Looking back, not only did this country have to rid itself of the burdensome legacy of fifty years of Communist government - and all Central and Eastern European States, including the candidate states still have their work cut out there - a third of this country was occupied by foreign troops under the Dictator Milosevic, who held office at the time and is still in office today."
"A third of Croatia was occupied, and it was many years before the country was reunited and a democracy established which - and this is a point worth emphasising - led to a peaceful change of government."
"The current administration did not take over under the conditions faced by, what will hopefully be the future government in Belgrade, because the previous government in Croatia stepped down after free and fair elections, and then a new government took office."
"It is therefore not quite accurate for the report to talk in terms of democratisation."
"Democratisation took place in Croatia ten years ago."
"We must also recognise what remarkable achievements there have been over the past ten years in terms of building a market economy, democracy and a constitutional state."
"Mr Langendijk is right, some colossal mistakes were made with privatisation."
"There was corruption on a massive scale, but if you take a look round the associated countries, the candidate states, you will detect the same trend there."
"The current democratic government in Croatia and its democratic opposition, need our full support."
"I therefore welcome the fact that we are going to take the decision today to adopt the guarantee payments."
"But we must be clear in our own minds that this is only a first step in the right direction."
"Mr Markov was right to point out that funds are scarce, and that this can only be a first step."
"Our aim must be to forge ahead down this path, not just by providing more funds, but, above all, by sending out political signals."
"To this end, we must at last conclude an Association Agreement with Croatia, which will spell out that this is a European country that has a definite future as a member of the European Union."
"I therefore say 'yes' to financial aid, and 'yes' to this guarantee, but, at the same time, would call upon the Commission most emphatically to lend massive support to this deeply European, and now truly democratic and constitutionally governed country, and to include it in the list of candidate countries, because I believe Croatia has earned our full support."
"This could send out a signal to the entire region and might lead to its rejuvenation."
"Mr President, these days, we cannot talk about Croatia without seeing it in the context of its neighbour Serbia, where the people are now finally throwing off the yoke of the authoritarian government clique."
"A clique which referred to itself as socialist, but managed to stay in power for more than ten years by using fascist methods alone."
"Along with legal inequality for the opposition and overt state violence, this also manifested itself in the fact that fear was instilled in the people of Serbia vis-à-vis the big bad world outside and that people who criticised the regime were proclaimed traitor to their own country."
"The same formula has been applied in Croatia over the past ten years."
"Croatia is not one of the states we have been discussing this week as being potential future candidate states of the Union."
"In many respects, the position of that country is the same as that of Slovakia, which is now a candidate state."
"Up until 1918, both regions were rebellious sections of Hungary and boasted their own language, culture and identity, but were thwarted by the official state authority."
"International pressure forced them thereafter not to become fully independent, but to join new large collective states which were intended as melting pots for minor Slavonic peoples, but they never managed to integrate properly."
"When half a century ago, Croatia and Slovakia became nominally independent for the first time, they became vassals of the Hitler regime."
"In 1945, the outside world agreed that these states should cease to exist permanently."
"With the benefit of hindsight, this was a silly move."
"Ignoring the wish of those peoples to be able to make independent decisions, provided the breeding ground for aggressive and authoritarian nationalism for years, a nationalism which had little consideration for the tragic legacy left by the Nazi era and which was hostile towards other peoples and democracy at home."
"People hid behind Tudjman and Meciar because they saw this as the only guarantee for being treated as equals vis-à-vis their neighbours who used to rule over them."
"It is only now that all their reasonable demands have been met and nobody doubts the right to independence any longer, that nationalism is fading away and normal political alliances are emerging."
"The nationalists recently lost political power in both countries."
"This could serve as a lesson for other strongly nationalist regions."
"The only way to eradicate nationalism is to meet all reasonable demands of those nationalists."
"There is now every reason for treating Croatia in the same way as Slovakia and other Central European countries which can join the European Union if they so wish."
"The damage done by the war has not yet been cleared, as we witnessed recently."
"The country' s road infrastructure is vulnerable because Dalmatia and Slavonia form the two halves of a pair of scissors, as it were, with Bosnia being wedged in the middle, which, particularly in West Herzegovina, is also populated by Croats."
"The environment in the large population concentrations in Zagreb, Rijeka and Osijek is at risk."
"This set of circumstances will probably necessitate huge investments, which will not be repaid until later on in the form of tourism and new industry."
"This is why it would be useful to make the necessary arrangements at this stage."
"Along with the rapporteur, I do wonder whether the funds will be made available in real terms, especially now it appears that Serbia will also be needing large funds shortly and the Union' s budget is not being increased."
"There is little point in the European Union making pledges to crisis areas and candidate states left, right and centre, which it cannot meet."
"As far as Croatia is concerned, there is every reason to set up a financial arrangement."
"The comment which my colleague Mr Papayannakis made yesterday about admitting Serbia to the European Union should also apply to Croatia."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the last few interventions, yesterday' s debate and the one we are having today, show that despite the necessary and widely approved increase in the guarantee payment, and the increase in the guarantee payment for the EIB loan, as we see it, what is needed is an overall plan for this region, a contractual agreement that cuts across the political divide and incorporates aspects of economic policy, together with discussion and decision-making."
"There is another individual measure that has been well received today."
"Of course we cannot consider the issue of guarantee payments and the issue of Croatia separately from the debate that took place yesterday evening and the developments in Belgrade."
"We must immediately appeal to the military and the police, in no uncertain terms, to throw their full weight behind democracy, and do all they can to ensure that this changeover of power - which was triggered by the outcome of democratic elections - proceeds peacefully over the next few hours."
"We have every intention of recognising these democratic elections and the electoral victory of Vojislav Kostunica."
"Of course my country, Austria, in common with all the other European countries, will also have to do its bit towards the reconstruction of Yugoslavia, in tandem with the European Union."
"We will also do everything in our power to ensure that the anticipated removal of sanctions against former Yugoslavia is implemented in full."
"Our honourable friend, Mr Posselt, was correct in what he said about the developments in Croatia."
"But we are all agreed, nonetheless, that the parliamentary and presidential elections that took place in January 2000 have produced a new political climate."
"The new government has reinforced its commitment to political and economic reform."
"This will have a positive effect on relations between Croatia and the EU."
"The European Union' s response to this development has been not only to appoint the advisory EU-Croatia Task Force, but also to develop the office of the special representative in Zagreb into a permanent representative office of the European Commission."
"In the feasibility report on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Croatia, compiled in May 2000, the Commission reaches the conclusion that the conditions for taking up negotiations with Croatia have been fulfilled."
"The delegations from the Croatian Parliament and from our own, have also called upon the Council to extend the EIB mandate."
"The Council held in June established that all the preconditions to commencing negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement had been meet."
"In July, the European Commission forwarded the draft of a negotiating mandate to the Member States, for them to comment on."
"Austria, the country I come from, was one of the first three Member States, to make a positive statement."
"The reason I mention this development in the year 2000, after the election, is because it shows that we need to do more than increase the guarantee fund."
"We have already come a long way."
"We must single-mindedly pursue the process that started in May and July as far as an Association Agreement."
"Croatia and the region deserve this in the interests of peace within Europe."
"Mr President, first of all I must declare a personal interest, I have a son-in-law who was, and is, a refugee from the Krajina in Croatia."
"Even if it is now technically possible to return, much more has to be done to make the return of Serbs to Croatia and the Krajina in particular positively welcome."
"Much physical restoration is required in that sad part of Croatia."
"We in the European Union must insist that this is positively encouraged and not just a nominal gesture."
"Our financial contributions should be on that condition and I would appreciate a reassurance from the Commission that this aspect will be taken into account."
"My second point refers to Serbia itself."
"Even if there is the happy, democratic outcome, which we hope for in Serbia, there will still be great resentment resulting from what happened with the Kosovo campaign and our recent relationships with Serbia."
"This will not be overcome immediately."
"We in Europe must be prepared to rise above any peevish reactions to those sentiments."
"The top priority, not just for Serbia but for all the Balkans including Bulgaria and Romania, is to restore normal transport links in the whole area and bring Serbia with all its hurts back into the European fold."
"I am grateful, on behalf of the Commission, to Mr Seppänen for his report relating to the proposal to extend the existing Community guarantee for European Investment Bank lending outside the Union to cover interventions in Croatia."
"As the House will know and as has been remarked again this morning, the parliamentary and presidential elections early this year resulted in the change of government in Croatia and brought a new political climate."
"We celebrate that and we act as a Community to support it."
"But I cannot let this debate pass without referring to another part of former Yugoslavia which is beginning the century with hope and the prospect of freedom."
"I am speaking of the glorious revolution taking place now in Serbia, thanks to the courage of the Serbian people and their insistence on democracy."
"The House will know that the Commission has made it crystal clear that European Union sanctions will stop with the advent of democratic government in Serbia."
"When it appears that Milosevic has fled and the will of the people has prevailed, we hope that action to establish normal relations and partnership between Serbia and this Union of democracies will only be days away."
"Meanwhile the new government in Croatia is clearly demonstrating its serious commitment to putting that country on a secure democratic path and to implementing the political and economic reforms necessary to adhere to the conditions of the European Union stabilisation and association process for the western Balkans."
"Taking account of those advances last May, the Commission produced a positive feasibility report on the opening of negotiations for a stabilisation and association agreement with Croatia and on 19 July recommended opening negotiations."
"This constitutes a major step forward in EU-Croatia bilateral relations."
"The Commission hopes that a decision can be taken in November so that negotiations can start without too much delay."
"It is also essential for the Community to provide appropriate financial support for Croatia."
"The resumption of EIB lending is intended to assist the country's investment activities in infrastructure and private sector development."
"The new Croatian leadership clearly needs dependable and sustained backing to pursue demanding reforms."
"The proposal before the House would cover up to EUR 250 million of lending over the next four years."
"As Mr Purvis has just said - and I fully acknowledge - that must be regarded as part of a process of normalisation, stabilisation and progress that extends over many years."
"The rapporteur has not proposed any amendments."
"I therefore thank him and the House for supporting this useful and progressive proposal as an investment in stable democracy in yet another part of our continent."
"(Applause)"
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Explanations of vote"
"Mr President, I wanted to be here not just to state that I voted for this aid for Croatia but, above all, to have the chance to express my satisfaction, as others have today, at the democratic events taking place in Serbia at the moment."
"After many years of difficulties for this people - all kinds of difficulties - we are at last, extremely democratically, beginning to welcome Serbia back into the community of the peoples of the European Union."
"I hope that negotiations will soon get underway and, as with Croatia, that aid will also be granted to the Serbian people, who deserve our greatest respect."
"Thank you, Mr Fatuzzo."
"Adjournment of the session"
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"(The sitting was closed at 9.45 a.m.)"
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday 6 October 2000."
"Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting"
"The Minutes of the previous sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Madam President, the Minutes of the Parliamentary sitting tell us that the issue was raised in this Chamber of the racist attack made on a teacher in Verona."
"The Minutes also say that Parliament condemned the incident and, in particular, expressed its solidarity with the teacher."
"I would like to inform you that the teacher in question invented the whole story and has confessed that he was not the victim of an attack at all but that his wounds were self-inflicted."
"What this amounts to is that we have all been taken for a ride."
"I just wanted to inform you of this, seeing that this hoodwinking of Parliament by the teacher from Verona is recorded in the Minutes."
"Mr Speroni, this information does not, most probably, require any amendment to the Minutes, but I take note of your comment nonetheless."
"Are there any further comments on the Minutes?"
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Statements by the President"
"Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, since our last part-session, a fortnight ago, three more people have been shot and killed by ETA."
"Let me mention their names and, in commemorating them, express our compassion and sympathy at this time of sadness to the members of their families: Luis Portero, Chief Public Prosecutor of the Regional Court of Andalucia, murdered in Granada on 9 October;"
"Antonio Munos Carignanos, a colonel and doctor in the Spanish air force, murdered in Seville on 16 October;"
"Maximo Casado, a prison service employee, murdered yesterday morning in Vitoria."
"It is on behalf of the whole House that I express our most sincere condolences and deepest sympathy to the families and friends of these people."
"These victims take the number of ETA murder victims since the cease-fire was broken on 3 December 1999 to a total of sixteen."
"Even if we cannot find the words to express our response to such a tragedy, we must not give up the fight by any means."
"Quite the opposite."
"As we have always done on each of these sad occasions, we must, once again, condemn this intolerable behaviour."
"The right to life is sacrosanct."
"The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which was approved in Biarritz by unanimous decision of the Heads of State and Government, reaffirms this most categorically."
"I would ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to pay tribute to these victims by observing a minute' s silence, and to lend our support to the authorities and to democrats in Spain in their fight against this scourge, a fight that often puts their lives in jeopardy."
"Thank you for observing a minute' s silence."
"(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)"
"o"
"o o"
"President."
"Unfortunately, I must again take the floor to pay tribute to the memory of all those who have been victims of the upsurge of hatred and xenophobia in the Middle East."
"Tomorrow, this House will discuss this sensitive issue as part of its debate on the Biarritz European Council, but today I should just like to express my deep sadness at a phenomenon that we find disturbing in the extreme, since it is a tragic illustration of the baleful influence of the extremists on both sides."
"On behalf of all the Members of this House, I would express our deepest sympathies to all the members of the families of the victims of this conflict, and further express my solidarity with all the people wounded in the conflicts."
"I hope, moreover, that the advocates of peace and dialogue will ultimately succeed in prevailing over those that incite to violence and hatred."
"o"
"o o"
"President."
"Finally, as you know, several days ago, torrential rain caused unprecedented damage in Switzerland and Italy, resulting in the deaths of twenty-five people, injuring many more, and occasioning extensive material damage."
"The day before yesterday, in Spain, heavy rain and flooding was also to blame for the deaths of three people, with three others reported missing."
"I should like, on behalf of the European Parliament, to express our distress at these events and to offer the families of the victims our deepest sympathy. If you agree, I shall once again ask you to observe a minute' s silence in honour of these victims."
"(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)"
"Mr Trakatellis, I shall give you the floor on a procedural motion, but let me first point out for your benefit, and for the benefit of all Members of the House, that on the Tuesday of the last part-session, I explained in our plenary sitting that, after receiving strong protests from a great many Members who considered that, on the previous day, the right to speak on procedural motions had been abused ..."
"... I explained, then, that speakers on procedural motions would be cut off after one minute, as expressly stipulated in the Rules of Procedure, in Rule 141, to be precise."
"I should just like to point that out."
"Your applause today, as well as the applause I heard on the Tuesday of the last part-session, confirms that you endorse this approach."
"Madam President, it is quite right that the municipal elections in Himara were marked by violence and fraud at the expense of the Greek minority living there."
"That this happened is beyond question."
"We have the findings of international organisations which monitored the elections."
"Albania is a country whose own minorities have suffered persecution at the hands of other countries and, as we all know, the international community reacted to this persecution."
"It should not repeat inside its borders what it suffered outside its borders; that is, I think, the first lesson in democracy which we should bring to the attention of this country, which is starting to establish an internal democracy."
"I should like the European Parliament to take note of these violations and, of course, to call for repeat elections in Himara."
"Madam President, in connection with your words on the Middle East, I would like to announce an initiative conceived by some of the female Members of Parliament - Nuala Ahern, Pasqualina Napoletano, Ana Palacio Vallelersundi, Ulla Sandbaek and myself - who have asked other women to go with us to Jerusalem to meet with Palestinian and Israeli women who, in recent years, have never stopped trying to communicate with one other and build bridges of peace."
"And so, in this spirit, we invite the women of the European Parliament to be part of this delegation."
"We will make an appeal on Tuesday and Wednesday and collect the names and signatures of those women who wish to be part of the delegation. Our intention is to build bridges of peace between women in places where violence prevails."
"Madam President, I would just like to inform the two Greek speakers that the next meeting of the South-Eastern Europe delegation - in the course of which we will also receive representatives from Albania - will also address this issue, and I am certain that with Mrs Pack in the chair, we will approach the matter objectively."
"Madam President, last week, the MEP Karla Peijs was attacked in Brussels."
"I would urge you to approach the Belgian Government again and to see to it that security levels are stepped up in Brussels."
"Indeed, Mr Rübig, I shall do so."
"Madam President, I have a question concerning the Statute for Members."
"My question is: Who is speaking for the European Parliament concerning this Statute?"
"I ask because when I read the public statements made by our colleague, Mr Rothley, I get the impression that we have appointed a saboteur and not a rapporteur."
"I hope that you are speaking for Parliament rather than Mr Rothley."
"Madam President, I understand that you will shortly be announcing the decision of the French Government to terminate my mandate as a Member of the European Parliament."
"I believe that this is a grave injustice and a penalty which is out of all proportion to the minor incidents which served as a pretext for it."
"I received no notice in order to prepare my defence."
"I was not permitted to waive my parliamentary immunity and I did not have the benefit of any of the defences that even a guilty party would have."
"I believe that the European Parliament has the opportunity in this case to, perhaps, demonstrate its ability to come to the defence of its own dignity."
"Madam President, there are more victims of ETA, but there are also more victims of the Spanish repression: more arrests, more people tortured, new dispersals of political prisoners jailed in the Basque country."
"All in all there has been more suffering for Basques and Spaniards; certainly the Spaniards and Basques are fed up with the present conflict."
"It is not surprising if they express their profound dismay more and more clearly because, with the exception of the Spanish Government, no one believes in the benefits of the ongoing strategy."
"Can the European Parliament give up hope of ever finding a democratic . . ."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Madam President, I do not wish to be repetitive, but the situation requires it."
"You are aware of the situation in Campo de Gibraltar, where there is a damaged British nuclear submarine."
"As we have feared and supposed since the start, according to the technicians, the significance of the damage is increasing daily with the passage of time."
"I ask you, Madam President, to do everything possible to speed up the procedure under way in the Committee on Petitions concerning a protest document that has been presented by more than thirty social groups and NGOs against this situation, in which there has been a blatant failure to comply with Community regulations on radiation protection."
"Madam President, firstly, I would like to speak as chairperson of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market to point out, following on from what Mr Haarder said, that Mr Rothley, first Vice-Chairman of the Committee, is not a spokesman but a rapporteur, and I think that so far he has conducted himself impeccably within that mandate."
"Secondly, I would like to speak in support of Mrs Morgantini' s motion."
"I think we are at a stage in the process in the Middle East in which dialogue between Palestinian and Israeli female Members of Parliament and European female Members of Parliament could contribute to resolving this conflict."
"Madam President, if I have understood correctly, we are at present establishing our Agenda."
"Our Rules of Procedure do not admit any points of order at this juncture."
"According to the Rules of Procedure, we are allowed procedural motions pursuant to Rule 141 and points of order with reference to the Rules of Procedure pursuant to Rule 142, but not, in any manner of speaking, points of order, especially not to make the kind of representations we have just heard."
"Apparently, just anyone can stand up and say whatever they want when the Agenda comes up."
"When oh when, Madam President, are you going to apply the Rules of Procedure and nothing but the Rules of Procedure?"
"Let me answer you, Mr Goebbels."
"This is a problem that everyone chairing a sitting has to deal with."
"The problem is determining whether a matter is grounds for a procedural motion or not."
"I feel that if we stop to discuss whether, every time a Member wishes to speak on a procedural motion, it actually complies with the Rules of Procedure or not, then we shall waste a great deal of time."
"I think applying the minute rule is the least damaging solution, in the final analysis, as we have, in fact, seen."
"Madam President, you will recall that at the last part-session I raised the plight of the British democracy campaigner, James Mawdsley, who was held illegally by the Burmese authorities."
"You promised to convey your concern, and subsequently this House passed a resolution condemning his imprisonment."
"That was part of a concerted diplomatic effort and the House will be pleased to have learned that Mr Mawdsley was released by the Burmese authorities last week."
"I should like to take this opportunity to thank you and Members of this House for the part you played in seeing this process through to a successful conclusion."
"I hope that we can return before too long to the question of the thousands of other people who are political prisoners in Burma and the lack of democracy which afflicts that country."
"Madam President, when my fellow Danish MEP, Mr Bertel Haarder, spoke a little while ago, his Danish was so garbled that it was completely impossible to understand what he was saying."
"Could you not make sure that we can hear what he is saying in future?"
"It was really difficult to understand his Danish."
"Madam President, last Monday, Antonio Russo, the Radio Radicale correspondent, was found dead in Georgia with his chest caved in. He was the only Western journalist to remain in Pristina, in Kosovo, for a number of weeks last year."
"The autopsy performed in Georgia revealed that he was the victim of murder and had, in all probability, been tortured."
"Antonio Russo, a courageous journalist, was investigating the crimes taking place in Chechnya, and it is our opinion that this was the reason for his tragic death."
"I know that it would not be usual for Parliament to hold another minute's silence - and I would not be so bold as to propose this - but I wanted you to be informed of the development, for Antonio Russo was a journalist and a very brave man who gave his life for the freedom of information for all people."
"Madam President, pursuant to the second paragraph of Rule 7(4) of our Rules of Procedure, the President is bound to refer the matter to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market before ratifying the decision of the French Government."
"The Council of State ruling, which you will perhaps be invoking as a defence very shortly, was issued by a body which has no jurisdiction in the matter, whereas French law stipulates that only plenary is competent to rule on the subject of the mandate of a Member of the European Parliament."
"In the course of this procedure, Madam President, the parliamentary immunity of our fellow Member, Jean-Marie Le Pen, has been violated from start to finish."
"I do not see how you can cite the Charter of Fundamental Rights, as you did a short time ago, without actually implementing it in the exercise of your office."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the topic of violence is given priority status in this Parliament and that is how it should continue to be."
"Further to your appeal and your expression of sympathy with the families of the victims of violence, we too would like to show our solidarity with all those who are protesting today against the violence of ETA in so many places in the Basque country."
"That is why, after approval of this agenda, we intend to hold a small, peaceful demonstration, which will take a few minutes, in front of the Parliament building, together with all colleagues and delegates in this House who wish to attend."
"Madam President, it is not possible to let Mr Gollnisch impugn the supreme administrative court in France without responding."
"If he respected the rule of law, he would respect its jurisdiction."
"As for Mr Le Pen, what an affront to the dignity of the European Parliament and for any true democrat to hear Mr Le Pen using the word 'dignity' !"
"Madam President, I have a genuine point of order."
"We have no urgent procedures this week, yet, Chechnya, Albania, Burma and Palestine have already been discussed."
"My question to you is this: can we not change the Rules of Procedure in such a way that we no longer have urgent procedures, but deal with these matters at the beginning of the sittings instead?"
"(Applause)"
"Do you see, Mr Goebbels? Is this actually a procedural motion or not?"
"Believe me, we could spend hours and hours debating the point."
"Madam President, between 3 October 2000 and yesterday, at least seven memorials were desecrated, eight people were subjected to racist attacks, four hostels for asylum seekers were set upon, and seven synagogues, Jewish cemeteries or memorials were desecrated in the Federal Republic of Germany."
"Just because, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are supposed to be discussing the order of business does not mean that we have to take orders as to our business."
"A number of Members of Parliament have had a fantastic dream, this I can understand."
"They have dreamt of building the kind of federal state envisaged by Chairman Spinelli, for instance, or turning our Treaties into a constitution."
"Well, today, acknowledging that the jurisdiction of the European Parliament is subject to a State, regardless of which one this is, and has a bounden duty to terminate the mandate of one of our fellow Members, would be to admit that Parliament is not a sovereign assembly and must yield to national legal or government authorities."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have the opportunity to take a great step towards your dream, one I do not, however, personally share."
"Simply by acknowledging that the European Parliament has the discretionary power to settle the matter of the termination of the mandate, you will have gone some way towards achieving your federal dream."
"Otherwise, Madam President, in yielding to the authority of others, you are effectively taking a step backwards."
"Madam President, I am astounded, all the same, that the case of the termination of Mr Le Pen' s mandate has not been dealt with, or even mentioned, by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, considering that this is the first time under either the Third, Fourth or Fifth Republic that we have had a French Member of Parliament thrown out of office for a matter of a minor offence."
"A whole series of violations of the law - not just French law, but also European law - have taken place and I feel it would be a grave mistake not to refer the matter to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market or to hear Mr Le Pen' s side of the case."
"Agenda"
"Madam President, Mrs Klass' s report has already been deferred twice."
"We would, however, like to request that it be deferred for a third time for political reasons."
"The fact is, this apparently technical report, which does not seem to make any great changes of a political nature, is extremely important insofar as it introduces the possibility of carrying out genetic engineering in viticulture and hence ending up with genetically modified viticulture."
"We think, given that for the moment we are at the conciliation stage with regard to the framework directive on GMOs, that it would be wiser to await the conclusion of these conciliation proceedings and to deal with this problem once the framework has been clearly defined, which should, in principle, be in the month of January."
"We therefore propose postponing examination of this report."
"Mr Lannoye has just presented his Group' s request."
"Is there a speaker to support this request?"
"Madam President, as we have already told the rapporteur and the House repeatedly, there is an important piece of legislation on the release of genetically manipulated or modified micro-organisms, namely the report by David Bowe, which we are currently dealing with in the conciliation procedure."
"This is the fundamental piece of legislation and it forms the basis for any other piece of legislation governing genetically modified plants."
"It is therefore only sensible, and indeed, right and proper, to wait until the end of the conciliation procedure, which will not be for another six weeks or so, and then take decisions on all the other pieces of legislation."
"I therefore support Mr Lannoye' s amendment."
"We shall now hear from the rapporteur, Mrs Klass, who, I believe, is opposed to postponing the report."
"Madam President, I am against postponing the report, and I question the way in which this House works."
"The report was adopted in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development by a good majority and with only two votes against."
"We are now embarking on a discussion about the release directive 90/220, which is inappropriate."
"We are referring here to the release directive, and according to the conciliation procedure, that is precisely what the speeches will focus on."
"We are doing exactly the same as we have already done in the case of forest and plant material, i.e. we are making reference to the horizontal directive."
"Not voting on the report will lead to delays."
"It will obstruct the trade in vine material in Europe, and so I believe that in the interests of the single market for Europe' s vine propagators, we must vote on our report."
"(Parliament rejected the request)"
"Relating to Tuesday:"
"Madam President, on behalf of my Group, I would like to move that a particular item be included in tomorrow morning 's debate, namely a statement from the Commission about an interview that Commissioner Verheugen gave to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung last Friday, 20 October."
"Mr Verheugen gave the impression that, according to the current state of play, the European Union will have ten new members by 2005 and, what is more, and this is more disturbing still, he called into question the significance of majority decisions in the Council of Ministers, which is what we regard as the fundamental reform element to be dealt with at the Nice Summit."
"He has already been criticised within his own political circles for saying this."
"We would urge the Commission to clarify matters tomorrow in its statement."
"Regrettably, this is now the second time that Commissioner Verheugen has said such contentious things."
"He is obviously making a habit of putting his foot in it."
"We urge the Commission to clarify its position."
"Mr Poettering, in tomorrow' s debate, every speaker will be free to raise any issue and to address both the Council and the Commission."
"Announcement of the removal of Mr Le Pen from office"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I must inform you that on Thursday, 19 October 2000, I received official notification from the competent authorities of the French Republic of a ruling by the Council of State on 6 October 2000 rejecting the appeal lodged by Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen against the decree of the French Prime Minister on 31 March 2000 terminating his mandate as an elected representative to the European Parliament."
"I must inform you that, since that time, I have received a copy of a request for clemency for Mr Le Pen presented to Mr Jacques Chirac, President of the French Republic, by Mr Charles de Gaulle, Mr Carl Lang, Mr Jean-Claude Martinez and Mr Bruno Gollnisch."
"I shall give the floor to Mrs Ana Palacio Vallelersundi, chairperson of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, to give us her views on the matter."
"Madam President, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, having deliberated at its sitting of 15 and 16 May, agreed to recommend that the announcement in plenary of Parliament' s confirmation of the removal of Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen' s mandate be suspended."
"I repeat, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market recommended that this announcement be suspended until the deadline period that Mr Le Pen was given for appealing against the French Council of State had expired or until a decision by the latter."
"And I am quoting word for word from the letter dated 17 May that you yourself, Madam President, read in plenary."
"As you said, the Council of State rejected the appeal and we were duly informed of that rejection."
"There is therefore no longer any reason for delaying this announcement in plenary, which is an obligatory act according to primary law, specifically paragraph 2 of Article 12 of the Act of 20 September 1976."
"The request for a reprieve that you mentioned, Madam President, does not alter this situation, as it is not a legal appeal."
"As its name indicates, it is an act of the Prince, which does not affect the decree from the French Government which, in accordance with the recommendation of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, must be announced in plenary."
"Thank you, Mrs Palacio."
"Consequently, pursuant to Article 12(2) of the Act of 20 September 1976 on the election of representatives to the European parliament by direct universal suffrage, the European Parliament hereby takes note of the notification by the French Government of the termination of Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen' s mandate."
"Mr Le Pen, please leave the Chamber forthwith. In order to ensure that these proceedings go ahead in an orderly manner without affecting the dignity of either this House or your own dignity, I propose to suspend the sitting for ten minutes."
"(The sitting was suspended at 5.40 p.m. and resumed at 5.50 p.m.)"
"Request for waiver of Mr Pacheco Pereira' s immunity"
"The next item is the report (A5-0304/2000) by Mr MacCormick, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the request for the waiver of Mr Pacheco Pereira' s immunity."
"Madam President, this issue arises from a request (announced by yourself to the House on 17 February) by the appropriate Portuguese authorities seeking a waiver of the immunity of Mr Pacheco Pereira in respect of proceedings in Portugal concerning words spoken on a television programme some years ago."
"The television programme involved a discussion about the respective roles of politicians and journalists."
"Mr Pacheco Pereira in that debate made remarks about a third party not participating in the debate, to which the third party took exception."
"Initially, public criminal proceedings were initiated but these were dropped and there is now a private action taking place before the Cascais First Criminal Court."
"This is therefore a case involving the exercise of freedom of speech in a political matter."
"The immunities of Members of the House arise under Article 10 of the Protocol of the Privileges and Immunities of the European Communities."
"The substance of this, for our present purpose, is that Members of this Parliament enjoy in their own Member State the same immunities as would be enjoyed by members of the national parliament of the state in question."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, having looked into the matter, is satisfied that, upon an issue of the kind before us, Mr Pacheco Pereira, were he a member of the Portuguese Parliament, would enjoy immunity which could be waived only by the Portuguese Parliament."
"Therefore, under our rules, he enjoys immunity which can be waived only by decision of this Parliament."
"It is important that I should underline the point that immunity is not conceived as an advantage to a particular Member, which she or he may waive or assert as she or he chooses."
"Rather, it is an immunity asserted by this House as a whole, in the interests of preserving the conditions of effective, democratic politics and argument and of enabling this House, through its Members, to discharge its function properly in an all-Europe democracy."
"Therefore it is for the House to decide whether the immunity ought to waived or not."
"We do not do this arbitrarily."
"We do it in accordance with precedence and practice established over many years."
"The concluding section of my report ought to be read out: ""It is indisputable that Dr Pacheco' s comments on a television programme on the press qualify as part of a political debate and therefore Paragraph 1 of Article 157 of the Portuguese constitution would be applicable."
"Accordingly, he does enjoy immunity as a Member of the European Parliament in respect of statements made and opinions expressed in the television programme to which the case relates."""
"It has been the practice of the House to insist upon upholding immunity in all cases where to deny it would be to inhibit political activity of a legitimate and democratic kind."
"On that ground, therefore, the Legal Affairs Committee has unanimously come to the conclusion that, after considering the reasons militating for or against the waiver of immunity, we recommend that the immunity of Mr Pacheco Pereira not be waived by Parliament."
"Madam President, the case of Mr Pacheco Pereira has been carefully examined by the Legal Affairs Committee: the recommendation, which was approved and which is tabled before the House today, is not to reject the request for waiver of Parliamentary immunity."
"The reasons and justifications for this are given in Mr MacCormick' s excellent report, and the grounds are the following: influences deriving from nationality or affiliation to a particular party cannot, and must not, be permitted; the legal basis must be sound and final; immunity is not a Member' s personal privilege but a guarantee of the independence of Parliament and its Members in relation to other authorities; the date of the alleged deed and the personal desire of the interested party to relinquish their immunity are of no importance."
"The reference made in the Protocol to national legislation does not mean that the European Parliament is being passed over but is in connection with the procedure, while every Parliament - including, in the case in point, the European Parliament - preserves its authority in its autonomous decisions."
"When all is said and done, Mr Pacheco Pereira was performing a political activity and cannot therefore be considered responsible for any crime."
"That is the position of the European People' s Party. We would also like to point out that, if Mr Pacheco Pereira had been Italian, proceedings would have been brought against him without the European Parliament knowing anything about it."
"The Italian judiciary does not ask for authorisation when the person in question is a Member of the European Parliament and ignores every principle of the respect due to this institution."
"Some Members of Parliament have already been taken to court during this parliamentary term without a request being put forward for waiver of parliamentary immunity."
"Personally, I was not able to intervene to condemn these actions in that it concerned members of my own party who have always been political targets, and my involvement would therefore have appeared exploitative."
"However, the incident has been repeated again, and this time, although the Member concerned is a member of the European People' s Party, he is not from the same political party or persuasion as I am in Italy."
"Proceedings were brought against Mr Cocilovo without Parliament being informed, indeed in contempt of Parliament."
"This is an extremely serious matter, Madam President, that you cannot ignore."
"The autonomy of the European Parliament is at stake!"
"Madam President, I certainly do not require the two minutes allocated to me because, after the explanation from Mr MacCormick and the additional explanation by Mr Zappalà, from the point of view of the Group of the Party of European Socialists of the European Parliament, there is no doubt that Mr Pacheco Pereira' s immunity should not be waived."
"I would say that this is a really trivial issue, a few comments by a politician on a television programme, which have resulted in a criminal action that has no grounds, and which are covered by the Portuguese constitution and by application of Community rules on the waiver of parliamentary immunity."
"In short, here we have all the ingredients for Mr Pacheco Pereira' s parliamentary immunity not to be waived and, therefore, the Group of the Party of European Socialists agrees with Mr MacCormick' s proposal that Mr Pacheco Pereira' s parliamentary immunity should not be suspended."
"Social policy agenda"
"The next item is the report (A5-0291/2000) by Mrs Van Lancker, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Commission communication to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on the social policy agenda [COM(2000) 379 - C5-0508/2000 - 2000/2219(COS)]."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, may I first and foremost thank my fellow MEPs and the Commissioner together with her offices for the excellent cooperation we have had in the framework of this report, and may I also seize this opportunity to express my gratitude for the contributions of the many NGOs, the social partners and the experts who have helped us formulate an ambitious social agenda on behalf of Parliament?"
"It has often been said that 'social policy is a productive factor' and this is true, for a society with greater social cohesion is also a society which performs better."
"However, social policy does have its own rights; social policy must ensure that inequalities are ironed out, that social cohesion is promoted and that people' s quality of life improves."
"That is why this social agenda deserves a far more prominent position in European policy."
"The Lisbon Summit has given us the opportunity to lend more weight to social policy; we must seize that opportunity with both hands."
"It was with great delight that I noted that the Commission and the French Presidency want an ambitious social agenda, and I believe, Commissioner and Minister, that we fully endorse the objectives."
"I would therefore like to use some of my speaking time in this debate to draw attention to a number of points which Parliament would like to reinforce in this agenda."
"The first point relates to the strategy."
"The social agenda must raise the profile of social Europe among the citizens, and that is why we are in favour of defining measures, priorities and instruments more clearly and with greater intensity."
"We must be able to see where progress is being made; this progress must be measurable and the social agenda must be afforded centre stage in the political discussion at European level."
"Hence our urgent appeal in favour of the introduction of a social scoreboard, similar to the one already in use in the internal market, which details specific measures, expiry dates and deadlines."
"Hence also our appeal in favour of having social agenda discussions at the annual spring Summit."
"Secondly, I would like to comment on the instruments."
"It is true that the open method of coordination, which has been used within the sphere of employment since Luxembourg, has brought fantastic new openings in fields which up to now were only subject to national authority."
"We would therefore ask that this method be reinforced and, as has now been decided by the Social Affairs Council, be applied to combat social exclusion and poverty."
"Furthermore, we would very much like to see this major innovative method being deployed to make progress in the modernisation strategy of social security."
"Thirdly, there is a 'but' ."
"Stressing the importance of this open coordination method does not mean that this method should replace social legislation, because we should lay down social rights in Europe too. We should have the nerve to formulate minimum social standards and draft social legislation which is necessary within the framework of a European internal market."
"Parliament is of the opinion that the Commission could lend a helping hand here and there, for example where individual and collective workers' rights are concerned, where more security in new types of labour are concerned, or as regards the protection of health and safety relating to new risks in the workplace."
"In addition, we believe it is crucial that the European Commission should take the initiative to re-establish the link with the ' 92 recommendations in order to underpin Member States' efforts to guarantee everyone a right to a reasonable income."
"Only then can the fight against poverty be efficient."
"Needless to say, the social partners are major players when it comes to achieving this agenda, where lifelong learning is concerned for example, or the organisation of working time, and new forms of work, and we hope that they will be prepared to negotiate within all these fields."
"However, Commissioner, if this consultation does not yield results, we would also ask the Commission to use its right of initiative to the full."
"I would like to finish off by making two remarks: as we endeavour to achieve the European social agenda it is essential to establish a close partnership, a partnership between institutions, and with the Member States, the social partners, but also with the many social NGOs which have a key role to play in the realisation of the agenda."
"Here too, we believe that Europe should take an initiative as a matter of urgency to reinforce this dialogue with the citizens and the dialogue with the social NGOs."
"Finally, social policy should not be viewed in isolation."
"It must be integrated into all EU policies."
"I am convinced that Europe will only be social when a social dimension is added to economic policy, competition policy, external policy and the entire enlargement discussion."
"I hope, Minister, that the Council will be inspired by Parliament' s expectations, and I hope that you will succeed in setting ambitious goals at the Nice Summit for a European social agenda, which we can work towards together over the next couple of years."
"Mr President, the proposed social agenda sent out a political message which did not go unheeded."
"This issue provoked intense interest in societies throughout Europe and the Committee on Women' s Rights has taken account in its opinion of the numerous proposals submitted by representatives of non-governmental organisations and civil society in general."
"We hope that the application of the social agenda will also give citizens the chance to feel part of social Europe and to realise that the European Union intends to take positive action to continue raising standards of living, rather than merely guaranteeing minimum levels."
"We must also make it clear that the social agenda does not intend to impose a uniform social policy but to coordinate, support and boost national policies within a global framework for social development, because all Member States currently face common challenges, which are naturally of varying proportions, such as working structures, discrimination against citizens and gender inequalities."
"The Committee on Women' s Rights maintains that the social agenda must focus all its ideas and projects on the qualitative and quantitative participation in the job market of women of all ages and from all social strata and must therefore give priority to any measures which facilitate access to work, the sort of measures to which we refer in our opinion, such as making it easier to combine professional and family lives or other personal choices."
"The Committee on Women' s Rights also proposes that women of all ages and from all social strata should have access to an adequate and dignified system of social protection."
"We must not forget that women are always the first to fall prey to economic crises and the majority of our fellow citizens who are victims of social exclusion and poverty are women."
"In our opinion we also support dialogue and cooperation with civil society, especially women' s organisations in countries preparing to join the European family, because here too we must anticipate uniform development which follows in the footsteps and adopts the rationale of the rest of Europe."
"Before I give Mrs Péry the floor, on behalf of the Council, I have a few comments to make."
"This is Mrs Péry' s third visit in succession to Parliament, and we welcome this."
"That was the first point I wanted to make."
"The only explanation I have for this is that the culprit is always drawn back to the scene of the crime."
"Mrs Péry was Vice-President for some years, sat in this very chair, and we were always in a very safe pair of hands during difficult votes."
"All the more reason why I am delighted to see you here today, Mrs Péry."
"Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteurs, ladies and gentlemen of the House, let me firstly thank you, Mr President, for this personalised introduction."
"I am very pleased to be able to join you today for this important debate on the social agenda."
"I must also say, however, that Elisabeth Guigou, the current Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, would have liked to have been able to attend proceedings here today in this institution to which she too once belonged and of which she has fond memories, but her new duties require her to be in Paris today, and she has therefore asked me to present her apologies."
"Before going any further, I should like to congratulate Mrs Van Lancker, and also the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and its chairman, on the report before us today, which testifies to the dynamism and great commitment of the European Parliament to the social agenda."
"Following the informal Employment and Social Policy Council on 8 July this year in Paris, the Presidency invited all the parties involved, the European Parliament, of course, the Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions, both sides of industry, NGOs, Council groups and committees, to submit their proposals."
"The European Parliament resolution on the social agenda which you are just about to adopt is a very ambitious contribution to our joint exercise."
"The French Presidency welcomes this text and undertakes to give it the utmost consideration in its work."
"The informal Council meeting of 8 July, the September conference you hosted with the European Commission and Mr Briet' s tour of European capitals have provided the basis for a number of comments."
"Let me first make some general remarks on the social agenda before covering the various individual areas, in a very succinct way, as befits my allotted speaking time."
"I am happy to be able to say that all the parties involved in social policy declared themselves in favour of drawing up an agenda."
"This is intended to give a higher profile to European social policy and to make it more effective, preparing the European Union for the great shared challenges ahead."
"The agenda is, of course, in keeping with the Lisbon conclusions and the future European Charter of Fundamental Rights, to ensure its effective implementation."
"The areas of action listed in the Commission communication were also subject to general agreement."
"What debates there were did not involve the type of action to be undertaken but rather the method to be adopted in order to achieve the desired objectives."
"I think we should adopt a pragmatic approach and overcome any misguidedly ideological rifts."
"As you very rightly suggest in your resolution, thereby supporting the approach proposed by the European Commission, we shall continue to use the entire range of Community instruments available to us: social dialogue, legislation, coordination, convergence, information exchange and financing under Community funds and programmes."
"It is up to us to determine, area by area and action by action, the instruments best suited to the desired objective."
"I now come to my more specific comments, and firstly my comments on employment."
"Employment is our number one priority, even if the method of tackling the problem is in flux."
"Here, too, I noted unanimity on the need to continue and step up the Luxembourg process in the context of the objectives established at the European Council in Lisbon."
"We are particularly committed to the objective of full employment."
"It is a false line of reasoning to set quantity off against quality, and Lisbon clearly established a twofold objective: more jobs and better jobs."
"It falls to us to define the key elements which characterise the quality of employment and then to be capable of measuring these."
"You will understand, given my duties as a member of the French Government, that I was particularly pleased to note that, firstly, the equality of men and women and, secondly, lifelong training are two areas which receive very strong support."
"The subject of lifelong training was unanimously adopted as a priority area."
"Moreover, the two sides of industry have undertaken to work on this subject."
"We must encourage them to do so in order to ensure that initiatives by collective agreement are taken to promote lifelong training within the shortest possible time limits."
"Let me, at this point, remind you that there will be a European Seminar on this subject on 4 and 5 December in Biarritz, which I shall be chairing."
"On the subject of the equality of men and women, many Member States stressed the need for a better coordination of work and family life, particular with regard to childcare."
"This is indeed a key issue, both in order to increase employment rates and in order to make progress towards male-female equality."
"To stay on this subject a moment, your resolution provides for many measures in favour of women and contains one general objective to include the concept of male-female equality in all the sectors covered by the agenda."
"I support this method."
"As you perhaps know, on 27 October, I am holding a ministerial symposium on this subject."
"I already spoke at length on this subject at your plenary sitting on October 5."
"I shall not therefore remind you of the three areas that we shall be debating at this meeting."
"You will shortly be discussing the fifth gender equality programme for 2001-2006."
"I should like to thank you most sincerely for responding to the Presidency' s invitation by working very quickly and very successfully, enabling us to adopt this most important programme, which proposes both an integrated approach and specific actions, on time."
"You can count on me to make every effort to complete the task successfully and to support the financial commitment of EUR 50 million."
"Finally, in order to step up the integrated approach to equality, the Presidency was in favour of implementing this concept in a number of meetings of the Council of Ministers."
"This is something that will be done under the French Presidency."
"The social agenda has many more objectives."
"Let me just mention the mobility of workers."
"Freedom of movement must be encouraged, while ensuring that career paths are safeguarded."
"I should also like to briefly point out our fight against insecurity and insecure employment. This must be dealt with better."
"Both sides of industry pointed out the need for common definitions."
"I am thinking in particular of non-standard work."
"Plainly, a number of Community Directives on European works councils, transfers and mass redundancies, for example, need to be updated."
"I also noted a strong desire for definition of a genuine Community strategy on the working environment, particularly concerning health and safety."
"Existing directives must be simplified and adapted to technical progress, but practical proposals must also be made on emerging risks or dangerous jobs."
"Let me say something about social protection."
"We all agree that we should pursue the strategy of cooperation in social protection, paying special attention, as we were urged at Lisbon, to the issue of pensioners."
"At the Employment and Social Policy Council held on 17 October, a great deal of progress was made in the fight against exclusion by defining appropriate objectives for the fight against poverty and social exclusion, which will serve as a foundation for national action plans."
"The agenda could also give an opinion on the follow up to be given to the 1992 recommendation on minimum resources."
"Within the next few weeks, the Presidency intends to draw up a general report on all these subjects, in the light of the contributions submitted to us."
"We should be able to successfully complete a document intended for the Heads of State and Government by the time of the Employment Council on 28 November. This document should express some real ambitions for the next five years."
"Quite clearly, the European Parliament will have made a significant contribution, and I thank you for this."
"Mr President, today we are debating social policy."
"I would like to warmly thank Mrs Van Lancker and Mrs Kratsa for the huge effort they have made in order to set down thoughts from within Parliament on paper."
"I would like to make two observations in this regard."
"Firstly, we used to debate the social action programme, and an action programme implies that something is done."
"We are now discussing the social agenda and this could mean that something is done, but not necessarily, and so this is one of the aspects which we need to continually bear in mind."
"We are dealing with a Socialist-inspired Council, so chances are that there will be a lot of talk and little action."
"I hope I will be proved wrong."
"What matters is that something is put on the agenda and that something is done."
"This is the aim of this report and we have tried to emphasise this in a number of amendments."
"Today we are discussing social policy, as the rapporteur pointed out earlier."
"In our Group, we have always set great store by the social market economy as a basis for everything we do, also within the framework of the European Union."
"Fortunately, we have largely managed to bring about the common market."
"We have also managed to bring about a few things in the social sphere, but not everything, and this was because the Treaty of Amsterdam had not taken effect at the time; so, in this light, the social action programme or this social agenda is of particular significance."
"We need to try to list and identify the gaps left in the system, and at least put them on the agenda."
"The importance of drafting an agenda is that we can include items which we hope the Commission will develop further."
"A number of such points are included."
"It would have been very wrong on the part of this Parliament not to make any mention of these points, but I am aware that we have not yet solved all the problems related to these points."
"It is thus something which we are passing on to the Commission for further examination."
"I would now like to turn to the point of open coordination which I believe is crucial."
"In fact, I would also like to refer to the recommendation made by Mr Cocilovo, which admittedly is not being discussed here but which will be voted on later."
"In particular, his recommendation responds to Parliament' s observations on employment."
"This is why little mention is made of this in the present report."
"However, these two recommendations should actually be seen as one entity for the picture to be complete."
"I think there are some problems left unsolved, but these will need to be addressed in the course of the votes on the amendments."
"I would like to congratulate Mrs Van Lancker on producing an excellent report."
"I have heard from some quarters that having read the report, they agree with the diagnosis but not with the prescription."
"I take the view that unless we follow this prescription then the prognosis is not good for the stated aim of the social agenda, which is to make sure that social policy has a full and equal place alongside employment and economic policy."
"This is the prescription we need to follow."
"For the Socialist Group there are many very important points in this report."
"For us the open coordination method is very important."
"We want to see it strengthened in relation to employment."
"We want to see it also applied to social exclusion and social protection."
"I am glad to hear what Nicole Perry had to say to us today in that respect."
"Open coordination seems to be regarded by many as a soft option and I have no doubt that is why it is being supported in certain quarters."
"It cannot be a soft option."
"We will insist at every possible opportunity that it has to entail indicators and benchmarks and proper peer-group review and that there should be a part for Parliament in that procedure."
"We also support social dialogue but we insist that the Commission should manage that procedure properly and that where negotiations fail we should have an expeditious introduction of legislation where necessary."
"Paragraph 14 lists a number of points we think are important."
"I cannot go into them all in the time available but let me stress for us the importance of those paragraphs relating to the need to update the framework of legislation relating to restructuring."
"Again I was pleased to hear what Nicole Perry has said today."
"I have not heard similarly encouraging things so far from the Commission in relation to, for example, the need to update the European Works Council Directive, or relating to collective redundancies and transfers."
"We also, of course, place considerable emphasis upon the general framework relating to information and consultation to make sure that industrial change is managed with social responsibility."
"Mr President, as far as the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is concerned, it is crucial that the Europe of the future should also be a social Europe."
"The political task is therefore to find the best way of achieving that objective."
"For us in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, it is important that decisions should be taken as close to the people as possible."
"This applies especially to labour market and social policy."
"At the Lisbon Summit this spring, the EU' s Heads of Government adopted a far-sighted vision for the development of a social Europe."
"Importance was attached to promoting the EU' s position in the knowledge society, as it was to open coordination in pursuit of common objectives, but with flexibility and freedom in the choice of resources."
"This was established as a leading principle."
"In its communication, the Commission has found a framework for the social agenda which I think admirably reflects the spirit of the Lisbon Summit."
"In our view, open coordination is the correct route to go down if we are to secure a social Europe."
"There may be a need for legislation in some areas, but we have no need for a host of bureaucratic and constricting rules which bring European cooperation into discredit without producing real results."
"I also want to express my appreciation of the major effort which Mrs Van Lancker has put into drawing up the report."
"Her contribution has been very constructive, and if my Group is sceptical about a number of the main elements in her report, that is because we disagree politically, and that is, of course, understandable."
"We do not therefore share the report' s predilection for legislation at EU level."
"There are a number of areas in which we feel that too much detail is gone into."
"I want to emphasise that, in the EU countries, we have different traditions and different problems in the areas of the labour market and social policy, and the decisions of the Lisbon Summit acknowledge this."
"The Commission' s proposal strikes a good balance."
"Technological development and new methods of organisation call, of course, for flexible cooperation in which we concentrate more on objectives and on achieving results and less upon rigid regulation."
"Open coordination of this kind is not necessarily devoid of obligation."
"Of course, it must be binding, but it must be constructed from the bottom up and not developed by us specifying a host of rules and quotas centrally."
"Specifically, open coordination must be open both in the choice of resources and in the way in which everyone concerned is involved."
"It is therefore important that more public interest be created for open coordination and that the latter should be focused on to a greater degree, whether it be in employment policy or with regard to the issue of social exclusion which we are now addressing and to which open coordination can also be applied."
"It should not be secretive."
"The process should be much better known, and it is here that I think Parliament has something to offer."
"It can make the process more transparent and give it more public focus."
"Mr President, first of all, I should like, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, to thank Anne Van Lancker and congratulate her on the quality of her report both in terms of its content and the inclusive way she strove to work on it."
"The apparently technical term 'social agenda' in fact covers the day-to-day realities experienced by our fellow citizens."
"We must both respond to the urgent situation and give practical shape to what has been called the notorious European 'social model' ."
"We have no right to miss this deadline unless we intend to shatter the expectations of all the citizens and the collective movements they have formed, which are the groups most motivated to establish a European Union which is a community of citizens."
"The issues to be discussed select themselves: we simply need to respond to the urgency of the situation and bring in legislation to match the declarations made at the Lisbon Summit."
"We must give the people of Europe the tools and the public policies they need in order to fashion their own place within Europe, in order to ensure that their fundamental rights, including social rights, are safeguarded."
"The urgency of the social situation and the need to defend the European social model call for initiatives that aim to establish rights: the right to an income, the right to a wage, the right to decent pensions for all within the European Union."
"Implementing the ambitions for society declared in Lisbon calls for an effort on the part of the Community, an action plan to create jobs in services, especially those related to the information society."
"As far as that is concerned, the directive proposed in the report in order to guarantee the social protection of new forms of working is essential."
"It is also important to ensure quality in health, an improved social situation, and an improved environment for everyone - the third system - and tax and legislative measures are essential in order to ensure both the economic longevity and the visibility of this emerging economy of solidarity."
"We support Anne Van Lancker and Mrs Péry when they propose to quickly adopt the 1998 directive on employee information and consultation and to revise the European Works Council Directive."
"The fundamental notion of the general interest ought, moreover, to spur us all to approve the proposal to include recitals relating to employment in the regulations and decisions on the mergers currently dictated by considerations of competitiveness."
"These three examples intended to combat poverty, support the development of activities for job creation, social liaison and quality of life, and to improve employees' rights, should harness the support of a Parliament that is anxious to propagate the dream of a Europe of the Citizens, although these same citizens currently all too often feel that Europe is a machine commercialising all human activity."
"A number of amendments betray the terror of some of our fellow Members who get their erasers out as soon as they see the word 'legislation' ."
"Are they going to go and explain to the people of Europe that Parliament deems it necessary to vote through directives to protect investment and liberalise general interest services, but not to define and regulate what has been described here as the labour market?"
"Such a rejection of legislation, moreover, leads to a plain rejection of negotiation. We even have one amendment that goes as far as proposing to eliminate the objective of concluding European collective agreements between the two sides of industry."
"It is in this area that we can, in our opinion, find the kind of old-fashioned ideas attributed to those who expect a brave new world to spring out of a free market."
"Mr President, there really is a need for a social agenda in Europe after many years of neo-liberal economic policy which has lead to unemployment and social exclusion everywhere, including in my own affluent country, Sweden."
"Begging has returned to our large towns after having disappeared from them as long ago as the immediate post-war years."
"Even the private charitable organisations and their soup kitchens appear to be needed again."
"I must therefore welcome the purpose of the Commission' s work and of Mrs Van Lancker' s report."
"Many of her proposals are extremely commendable and deserve our full support."
"Genuine social initiatives cost a lot of money, a factor which I think is discussed far too little in the report."
"These resources must come mainly from the Member States. It is therefore the social authorities in each country upon whom demands must essentially be made."
"Governments must set aside more resources, more social workers must be appointed and more resources must be given to the voluntary social organisations. Otherwise, the result will be fine words without any practical content."
"Mrs Van Lancker' s report presents the Commission and its legislation as the real engine of social work."
"I believe that the impetus must come from below and that it is a question of providing aid at a problem level."
"The Commission can obviously make an important contribution, but the social problems have their roots in local conditions and must be handled with great sensitivity for the practical conditions concerned."
"The Commission can help set a high standard, but it is social workers, the unions and voluntary activists we must pin our hopes on, and not officials in Brussels."
"Finally, I would just add that I am not a co-author of Amendment No 35 as stated in the document with the amendments."
"On the contrary, I am very critical of the amendment."
"The name Figueiredo should be there instead of my own name."
"The Secretariat must have made a mistake, and I would ask for this to be corrected."
"This received fresh impetus at the Lisbon European Council meeting of the European Union leaders earlier this year. Key priorities in this agenda include the following: an increased role will be given to the social partners in terms of drafting EU directives and regulations."
"There will be continued European Union support for local job creation programmes. New EU mechanisms for mediation, arbitration and conciliation will be drafted."
"There will be improved coordination of policy programmes in the area of the information society. And there will be a modernising of telecommunications services and Internet-related activities."
"From an Irish perspective I would like to say to the Members of the House that one of the reasons why there has been such strong economic progress in our country is the fact that we have had a system of social partnership in place since 1987. This has meant that the government has worked closely with the trade unions and employee groups on a whole range of economic and social activities in an effort to secure broad agreement in matters such as pay and conditions for employees in Ireland."
"This has certainly helped to reduce industrial unrest in our country and has contributed to increased inward investment programmes from abroad."
"I would also welcome the commitment of this policy agenda to the modernisation of telecommunications services."
"The European Union must take advantage of the new and evolving technologies which are coming on stream at this time."
"I welcome the publication of the new framework programme of telecommunications regulations and directives which was published in July of this year by the Commission."
"Parliament is presently deliberating on seven different telecommunications regulations and is due to give an opinion on these matters before Christmas."
"As regards e-commerce, it is fair to say that the United States of America had a head start on the European Union."
"However, the European Union is catching up fast and the implementation of a broad range of telecommunications directives and regulations would certainly assist in this process."
"Finally, I would like to commend the Commissioner for consumer protection, Mr Byrne, for his efforts in trying to secure an agreement on how best to move forward on regulating a vast structure for e-commerce transactions now and for the future."
"Mr President, for almost half a century European integration has been based on the economy."
"Indeed we spoke of a European Economic Community."
"The priority was given to setting up a common market, with the principle of the free movement of property, goods and capital, the establishment of rules governing competition between firms and state aid."
"Social policy served to mitigate the most damaging effects of economic policies."
"The provisions enshrined in the Treaty of Rome were confined to the principle of equal pay for men and women (Article 141) and the freedom of movement of workers."
"The Commission communication and Mrs Van Lancker' s report have the merit of remedying this imbalance by acknowledging the interaction between social and economic policy and employment policy."
"Mrs Van Lancker' s report is an ambitious one. The rapporteur effectively asks the Commission to intensify the agenda, chiefly in the following areas: Employment, with the framing of a European pact for employment and social cohesion, as concerns lifelong training and the introduction of prior cross-border testing of social and fiscal legislation."
"Next, in the area of social dialogue, this intensification would be expressed by adopting a directive on employee information and consultation, and the European Works Council Directive, with a revision of the directives on redundancies."
"Finally, in the area of social protection, it would take the form of pursuing a strategy of convergence."
"It is a veritable catalogue of measures which is more a declaration of intent than a plan that could be implemented in the medium term."
"In conclusion, the objective of giving new impetus to European social policy in the face of globalisation, enlargement and an ageing population is a laudable one."
"It demonstrates that economic competitiveness and social cohesion are not mutually exclusive."
"The method used, on the other hand, seems more debatable."
"Regarding the financing of NGOs and their participation in Community policies, there is still no legal basis in the Treaty, paragraph 13."
"Similarly, with the new social agenda, there is a desire to pass legislation at Community level, at the risk of harmonising to minimum standards and short-circuiting social relations within the Member States."
"Before we continue with the agenda, there is something I would like to say."
"Due to the fact that we have wasted another 40 minutes today on a debate about the Rules of Procedure, we are now hopelessly behind schedule."
"I must therefore ask you to stick religiously to your speaking time, so as to ensure that the sitting now proceeds in an orderly manner."
"Can you please discuss within your respective groups whether it is constructive to have forty minutes of moaning and groaning at the beginning of every sitting, before getting down to business."
"The only people that suffer are you, who want to engage in political debate."
"Mr President, if the rapporteur will allow me I will start by saying where I agree with her and - if the rapporteur will forgive me - that may not take long."
"Of course, colleagues and I share her ideals for a better standard of living for all the peoples of Europe, for a better quality of life and for promotion of social inclusion."
"Where I part company is on her proposals or - as Stephen Hughes said - her prescriptions to secure that end, because her proposals will lead us further away from those ideals rather than towards achievement."
"Various speakers have talked about the Lisbon Summit today."
"That was hailed six months ago as a very important summit."
"Mention was made there of a new direction for Europe: moving away from the social regulation agenda of the 1980s towards enterprise, innovation, competition and employment."
"However, the report says something slightly different: whereas Lisbon calls for a reform of the social model, it calls for reinforcement; whereas Lisbon calls for liberation of enterprise and more flexibility, the report proposes four new or amended directives and a number of legislative initiatives."
"The report sets out the standard Socialist solution throughout the ages of legislation, legislation, legislation."
"What we need to pursue our common goals is not more regulation, but less."
"We do not want more burdening of business, we want less."
"We do not want more unemployment, we want less."
"The original Commission proposal was much better left unamended - congratulations Commissioner."
"I propose that we leave it unamended and we reject the report, otherwise we will give the clearest possible signal that Parliament is continuing to pursue the old agenda."
"Surely it is time to move on."
"Mr President, the Commission has tabled a very ambitious proposal, and I should like to take this opportunity to thank the Commissioner for combining great understanding of national differences with considerable determination, without which this would never have been anything other than a pretty piece of paper."
"I should also like to thank the other Anna for the substantial work she has done on this matter, something we could not have done without."
"The debate today and in the Committee shows that there are major political differences and major differences in ambition in this area, and I think it good that these differences should be clearly brought out."
"In this way, people have a clear choice when they vote at the next parliamentary election: a choice between those who want to see a social Europe and those who merely want the EU to regulate the internal market."
"A choice between right and left."
"Our fellow MEPs from the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party and, in particular, from the British Conservative Party, have re-tabled a series of amendments which would genuinely weaken the ambitions of this social action programme."
"Every time legislation is proposed, these Thatcher-inspired neo-liberals embark upon an ideological crusade."
"Europe does not deserve dogmatism, however."
"What Europe needs is for us to assess pragmatically what regulatory tool will be the most effective in the practical situation."
"In some cases, we need the open coordination method."
"On other occasions, it is better for the two sides of industry to negotiate their way towards an agreement."
"We must not, however, be afraid to use legislation if this is what is required for us to achieve our objectives."
"I also want to raise another practical issue which this strategy has focused upon."
"This is the need to come up with a definite strategy for the working environment which would give us the opportunity to devise a coherent policy in this area."
"Within the area of the working environment, too, we must make a practical assessment of which tools are best for solving the various problems."
"Here, too, dogmatism is not the way forward but, rather, finding pragmatic solutions to real problems."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I feel that the Lisbon Summit has presented us with a picture of a future Europe which cannot, which must not be purely an economic Europe, but which must be a genuine political entity."
"And in order to be a political entity, Europe must have a cultural and social, as well as economic structure."
"In my opinion, therefore, the proposal presented by the Commission on the social agenda is extremely positive."
"However, I do agree with almost all of Mrs Van Lancker' s report - and for this I am grateful to her - for I do not believe that when Mrs Van Lancker makes a specific reference to clear objectives, proposals for specific instruments and, in particular, precise deadlines, that she is reverting to the socialist logic of old, as somebody has suggested today."
"It is rather that she is simply reverting to a longstanding need, the need for cohesion in a situation which, from this point of view, is becoming increasingly difficult to regulate because it lacks any form of harmonisation."
"In discussing a Charter of Fundamental Rights and advocating a European Constitution we cannot shy away from certain issues: we have to insist that all the necessary measures must be taken, even if this means producing more accurate legislation."
"I do not believe that Mrs Van Lancker intends to create laws to regulate absolutely everything;"
"I feel rather that she considers it necessary, when coordinating actions do not produce the desired results, when the citizens encounter inequalities between the States and when there is no social harmonisation, to bring about this harmonisation."
"The issue of open coordination must therefore be tackled alongside a comprehensive action to develop social legal bases, for without them we will not be able to persuade the States to harmonise a social policy which upholds equality and equal opportunities."
"Mr President, now that we have had a return to growth, it is crucial for the European Union to provide itself with the means to meet expectations in the social sector."
"The Commission communication highlights a raft of ambitious objectives, such as full employment, equal opportunities, training, etc., but there are many contradictions between the European Union' s declared ambitions and its political decisions."
"Among other aspects, let me cite the concern for productivity, which generally involves wage moderation as a priority."
"I would therefore like to join my fellow Members in congratulating Anne Van Lancker on her report, which opens up new perspectives, with an approach which aims for greater precision and greater coherence."
"Her report appreciably builds on the Commission' s proposals by suggesting the harmonisation of social regulations and the coordination of national social legislation."
"It calls for a genuine European agreement to be framed in favour of employment and social cohesion and proposes initiatives on the gradual reduction of working time prior to retirement, the introduction of a minimum wage and cross-border supervision in relation to social and fiscal law."
"This is all a specific encouragement to go beyond laudable intentions and actually take practical action."
"Moreover, at a time when a great many employees of major European industrial groups face redundancy plans in the context of mergers and restructuring, I think it important for the report on the social agenda to take a stand in favour of taking social clauses into consideration in competition policy, in favour of directives to this end and in favour of a revision of the European Works Council Directive as well as the directive on redundancies."
"This, I feel, is part of the consistent approach which we are lacking."
"I am pleased to see, furthermore, that Mrs Van Lancker has included a number of amendments tabled by my Group, particularly that on factoring in the social dimension of enlargement and incorporating the right to strike into Community legislation."
"Together with my Group, I have tabled some amendments criticising the Commission' s approach calling for the adoption of wage restraint."
"I advocate the reduction of working times without a concomitant reduction in salaries."
"Having said that, I support Anne Van Lancker' s report, which has the great merit of adopting an ambitious social policy backed up by specific objectives which go beyond the usual purely formal declarations."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mrs Van Lancker, who has supplemented the Commission's already excellent report with amendments tabled by myself."
"Naturally, I am very pleased about this: it is just a pity that the amendments which are most important in my opinion have not been included."
"I listened with pleasure to Mrs Péry' s brief summary of the Council' s social policy, which I firmly support."
"I am very familiar with the project and support all the work carried out by Commissioner Anna Diamantopoulou to date."
"She will remember that I asked her, one day, whether her attitude to pensioners' issues was that of a fairy godmother or a wicked stepmother."
"Up until now, I feel I can say that she has been a fairy godmother: two weeks ago, she announced that the Commission had programmed a special undertaking to resolve the problems of pensioners by extending the directive on pension funds and via the proposal to regulate these European pension funds in such a way that they are used to benefit workers who have hitherto paid a large part of their salary to the State, to the different States, and who would have liked - and this is what I propose - their funds to be properly managed, just as, I am sure, Mrs Diamantopoulou manages the finances of her own family and as every bank, every British bank, in particular - and on this point I agree with Mr Bushill-Matthews - has done thus far."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are two people here today who deserve special congratulations, one being Anna Lancker, for her outstanding report, and the other being Anna Diamantopoulou, for her outstanding submission."
"It is an ambitious agenda, and I still have a clear recollection of the painfully slow progress that was made during the last legislative period in the sphere of social protection."
"The Council was not even prepared to discuss the matter at the time."
"What is clearly new is that we have adopted an employment policy, based on the Lisbon Decisions, indeed an employment policy that should be of a qualitative nature. We do not want over-regulation - and I say this to the British delegate who spoke before - but the diversity of modern contracts of employment requires new forms of social protection, and not the rules of the nineteenth century."
"We also stand to gain a great deal from having a constructive and effective policy mix between economic and financial policy, and, not least, from developing the social economy and the services sector."
"What is not so new, and the subject of repeated demands, is lifelong learning - which is something even the smallest Member States have done something about - as are the long overdue reforms to the European factory committee law, the legal protection of nursing and expectant mothers, and freedom of movement."
"I would like to raise a criticism in connection with the lack of initiatives produced in response to the new challenges we face in health and safety at work, employee participation and labour relations."
"Of course, I was delighted to see the French Presidency show such commitment to the issues of childcare, family and women' s policy."
"Perhaps it has something to do with the fact that all three people responsible - in the Commission, Parliament and the Council - are women."
"But what we need now, in tandem with this, are instruments that allow for the involvement of fathers."
"That would be a new departure."
"Besides, this agenda should send out a signal to the candidate countries, and I therefore wish it every success."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, the citizens of the European Union expect more than just vague commitments that are then forgotten and which are rarely converted into binding instruments or decisions that bring about a real improvement in the quality of their lives and of their work."
"In order to dispel any lack of confidence, this social agenda must enable objectives and policies that have been postponed for years to be put into practice. The Council must not leave various specific proposals that have been postponed year after year simply hanging in the air."
"I have in mind proposals on decisions that are crucial to improving the rights of working women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, and vital for improving workers' collective and individual rights, including the right to information, consultation and participation, specifically in the framework of the European Company Statute and of the European Works Council. This is necessary from the point of view of guaranteeing workers' rights and preventing redundancies as a result of successive mergers and relocations by multinationals in various European countries."
"As the rapporteur, Mrs Van Lancker, emphasises, although social dialogue is important, it must produce tangible results."
"Otherwise, the Commission will have to propose legislative instruments and the Council will have to approve the measures needed, specifically by amending macroeconomic policies and the Stability Pact, in order to give credibility to our fight against poverty and social exclusion and to our efforts to defend good quality jobs with respectable salaries and to advocate reforms that give employees dignity."
"Mr President, I think that the social policy agenda is positive for everyone."
"I think that harmonising the social policies of the different Member States cannot do anything other than benefit all Europeans."
"It will be particularly beneficial in all aspects relating to employment, which, since the Lisbon Summit, we know is a priority for the whole of the European Union."
"I would like to particularly stress the benefit which, in terms of employment, can be obtained by women through giving them improved access to employment with guarantees in terms of working time and salary."
"I think that there is also a great advantage, if we succeed in getting the directive applied, modified and updated, with regard to maternity leave: for women to receive help during maternity and for maternity to be protected when women have to continue working during that period."
"I also think that it will be very positive in terms of helping women to reconcile family and working life."
"It is going to enable women to continue in their jobs without neglecting their family obligations."
"Neither can we forget what the e-Europe initiative means for new jobs, new technologies and the information society, where I think women have an important role to play."
"These are new jobs where people can work from home with regulations that help to reconcile working life with family life."
"All these coordinated social policy actions will also help to combat poverty and social exclusion."
"I think that we should all welcome the arrival of this social policy agenda."
"Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur, the Commissioner and Mrs Péry on this presentation of the social agenda."
"I consider the social policy agenda to be an extremely important political document which identifies instruments, sectors of intervention and timeframes and guarantees positive, dynamic interaction between economic, social and employment policies."
"These instruments are intended to adapt the European social model in line with the changing reality."
"I fully support Mrs Van Lancker's report and I would like, in particular, to stress a point which has, moreover, already been raised by both the rapporteur and Mrs Péry in their speeches, and that is the need for all the instruments to be genuinely implemented at European level, and therefore for application of the open coordination method to go hand in hand with reinforcement of the legal dimension."
"This is what happens in many countries."
"In conclusion, I would like to give an example: last week, the Italian Parliament adopted a new law on welfare which was proposed by a Minister - a woman, like the three representatives of the three institutions."
"This is tantamount to a revolution, for the old law on welfare had been in force for over 100 years."
"Mr President, the Commission draft on the socio-political agenda contains many positive concepts such as full employment, quality of work, social quality and modernisation of social protection."
"But it lacks substance to some extent."
"Mrs Van Lancker' s outstanding report makes good the deficiencies of the Commission draft as regards content."
"We support a pact for employment and social cohesion, a European action plan for employment with a view to boosting the social economy and local employment initiatives, social regulations for new forms of working such as tele-working and new forms of self-employment, the minimum wage, and guaranteed income."
"The European Union has already stood idly by for far too long, watching poverty and social exclusion take hold in the Member States."
"Indeed Mrs Van Lancker' s proposals for improving the information available to, and participation of, female employees, and for social clauses in public contracts, mergers and international agreements, are long overdue."
"We object to the fact that the Commission and the Council are unwilling to make additional resources available for the social agenda."
"Social quality cannot be achieved free and gratis."
"It sometimes seems to me that the concept of modernisation is often tantamount to the undermining of social protection."
"Extending people' s working lives is not modernisation, no more so is funding pensions by freezing or lowering the statutory pensions level, and advising people to take up investment opportunities on the financial markets."
"We need modern, European social harmonisation, not deregulation."
"Mr President, I have one minute and three points to make. Firstly, I should like to thank Mrs van Lancker on the work she has done in producing this excellent report."
"As for my second point, I wish to restate my Group' s fundamental convictions."
"The working areas opened up in the social agenda must be given a coherent, and certainly conciliatory, legal framework: The policy of convergence and the policies of coordination which have been initiated, and also supported by legislative measures, when necessary, which in turn should be reinforced by genuinely stringent monitoring methods."
"As for my third point, there are some rights that have simply been glossed over from the viewpoint of a social Europe: the right to a minimum income, the information and consultation of employees, the European collective agreement."
"These are points which, we know, are contested by the conservatives in Europe, but to which we, in our Group, attach great importance."
"Minister, Commissioner, we must continue to adopt an ambitious approach on these issues."
"I hope, Minister, that in Nice the French Presidency will succeed in pushing through an ambitious social agenda, since embarking on the construction of a social Europe is still the great hope of all our fellow citizens."
"Mr President, I should like to extend my special thanks both to the rapporteur, Mrs Van Lancker, and the French Presidency for the excellent cooperation which we have enjoyed to date."
"I shall try very briefly to pinpoint a few political aspects of the four areas touched on in greater or lesser detail by all the speakers, i.e. the new political approach in the social agenda, secondly the content, thirdly the means and fourthly the procedures."
"As far as the political approach is concerned, we need, I think, to highlight two new elements."
"The first is that, since Lisbon, the new approach to social policy is to deal with it not as a product or by-product of economic policy, but as a policy in its own right which needs to be exercised in tandem with economic policy and the employment strategy."
"In other words, this is the only way for us to deal with Europe' s objectives of competitiveness, given our constant concern for enterprises and the economy, and social cohesion, given our constant concern for our citizens and their welfare."
"The second element in the new approach is quality."
"Quality as a new political concept to deal with working conditions, employment relations and the services of the social state."
"These two political approaches underpin the entire content."
"What are the basic strands which make up the content?"
"There are three."
"A set of projects and proposals on employment."
"I think that what we are endeavouring to achieve through the employment strategy, by strengthening and enriching it as we progress - because the entire social agenda is a process of dynamic change - is to support competitiveness and entrepreneurship in the European Union and flexibility on the job market, alongside security, mobility and new working models, and to support and analyse new social partnership models and the impact of competitiveness and major restructuring on employment and the social state."
"The second strand to the social agenda is a set of projects on social policy."
"Here I would like to refer to the proposal for combating poverty and exclusion, the new work which we have started on pensions and social protection, policies for people with special needs and, more importantly, I would like to pinpoint a particular political aspect, i.e. the need for a new approach to social policy."
"We must not simply calculate the cost of social policy, which is often seen from several political angles as an obstacle to economic development; we must calculate the cost of not implementing social policy."
"I think that this analysis will give us new, interesting results and approaches."
"The third strand in the content is enlargement."
"To be brief, social policy, the new social standards and harmonisation of the social legislation of candidate countries with the Member States are one of the most important features of the enlargement procedure and we must not lose sight of that."
"This brings me to the third area which has engaged our attention today and throughout our cooperation: the means."
"I think that the discussion on deregulation and legislation, i.e. do we or do we not need legislation, is old hat."
"Clearly we have a fairly complete legislative system in Europe, but changes on the job market, changes in the economy, changes in the environment due to globalisation and the information society are throwing up new requirements."
"When we need to deal with these new requirements with legislation, we shall not, of course, have any hesitation in doing so."
"If we can deal with them in other ways and with other methods, we shall do so."
"The proposal for a scoreboard, for a specific method for monitoring the social agenda, is a huge challenge."
"The problem is that, because of the legal basis which it has in the Treaty, the social agenda does not constitute a set of laws, a set of directives with specific steps for the Member States."
"It is still hard for us to define European objectives which are equally valid for all the Member States because the situation on the ground varies."
"We therefore believe that, in the first instance, common European indicators, a project which is now nearing completion, and national objectives, i.e. the need for each country to have its own scoreboard and carry out monitoring, are a step along the road to providing us with specific results."
"Finally, as far as procedures are concerned, I really must congratulate Parliament on its initiative in starting a dialogue with the civil society and the important contribution which this dialogue made to the agenda, as well as highlight the discussions which took place with Parliament, with the Member States and with the social partners at European and national level; this is how we were able to combine national idiosyncrasies and ensure, above all, that the Agenda is not merely ambitious but flexible and efficient."
"And one last comment: the question of sexual equality runs right through the social agenda as regards both the political approach and the content and means."
"Thank you, Commissioner, for your interesting speech."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12.30 p.m."
"Community framework strategy on gender equality (2001-2005)"
"The next item is the report (A5-0294/2000) tabled by Mrs Eriksson, on behalf of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, on the proposal for a Council Decision on the Programme relating to the Community framework strategy on gender equality (2001-2005) [COM(2000) 335 - C5-0386/2000 - 2000/0143 (CNS)]."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased to see you all here."
"The Commission' s communication affirms that democracy is a fundamental value of the EU Member States, the EEA States and the candidate countries, as well as a key part of external relations and development cooperation in the Union."
"It also affirms that real democracy requires all citizens, women and men alike, to participate and be represented equally in the economy, decision making and social, cultural and civil life."
"There are major deficiencies in all these areas. The Commission therefore proposes to tackle the problem with a combination of measures."
"In tandem with integrating equality perspectives into all policy areas - what is normally called gender mainstreaming - specific measures for women will be implemented."
"I fully endorse that strategy and approach and consider that it is not an exaggeration to say that no efforts to promote gender equality are of lasting value unless women' s rights are strengthened at the same time."
"This work has gone quite quickly despite the fact that it took a little time at the beginning."
"The Committee has submitted 49 amendments."
"At the beginning we had 126, which indicates that we are incredibly committed."
"I am very pleased about this."
"We believe, for example, that it is very important for the Commission to guarantee maximum openness around this programme so that all interested parties can keep abreast of proceedings throughout the implementation phase."
"It is also incredibly important, not to say fundamental, that the various Community actions, the framework strategy and the Member States' measures complement, and do not counteract, each other."
"This is, of course, also the Commission' s and the Council' s express ambition."
"The Commission has now identified five focus areas of strategic importance."
"I have no objections in this respect, nor has the Committee."
"We have come up with a new shock proposal, which is really a reiteration of what was stated in our opinion on the budget."
"We believe that 40 per cent of the Structural Funds should be earmarked to focus on women' s conditions and needs."
"The Commission' s proposed measures should be expanded to include reviews of individual access to medical and health care and to social security and pensions, an analysis of shortcomings in the organisation of work and perhaps also a study of the significance of a general reduction in working hours."
"What we have just recently discussed here in this Chamber are, of course, the social issues, and I wish once again to emphasise the repeated observation that over 50 million EU citizens are, in fact, classified as poor and that a large majority of those are women."
"This is, of course, something which needs not only to be observed but also to be combated, and with the help of vigorous measures."
"We have had a lot of detailed discussion of various assessment procedures."
"I shall not go into any more detail here. Rather, I just wanted to mention it."
"We have touched upon the idea that the plan must be to increase accessibility and also scope for active participation for non-governmental organisations."
"Discussions have been held as to how the candidate countries can be incorporated in the programme in a natural way."
"We have also discussed what we must do in order not only to give a mention to women in the developing countries but also to be able to do something practical in this area."
"During the final phase of the journey, I have been in very close contact with people in both the Commission and the Council."
"We naturally want to include the strategy in the Council decision, too."
"What we mean in the Committee by strategy is, of course, not the Commission' s opening gambit, but that strategy beginning as from paragraph 2 ( 'The Strategy' )."
"I am saying this so that no mysterious or technical procedures cause this to be misunderstood, for no less than seven different amendments in the same spirit have been tabled."
"In other words, the Council too must adopt the Commission' s strategy."
"It is therefore important that non-governmental organisations should obtain influence in the course of implementation."
"One amendment is to the effect that it should be possible to hold an annual debate here in Parliament, together with the Commission."
"This perhaps affects only the Commission and Parliament, but I am very grateful indeed for the fact that you, Mrs Diamantopoulou and you, Mrs Péry are here, and I am very much looking forward to hearing your points of view on all the amendments."
"Commissioner, we waited with a great deal of anticipation for the Commission' s communication on the strategy which it intends to apply to gender equality over the next five years."
"Unfortunately, the time available to us in committee did not give us a chance to process either the communication or Mrs Eriksson' s report although, having said that, we did make every possible effort to respond to the objectives set by the European Commission."
"We do, of course, agree with the Commission' s justification of the need to integrate the question of equality into all aspects of European policy as well as adopting special measures. We also trust - and here we agree with the rapporteur - that the Commission will present a detailed budget for the programme, especially as regards the allocation of funds between the five high-priority areas."
"At the same time, we must stress the need for complementarity between the measures and main lines of approach in the areas of economic life, equal participation and representation, social rights, the civil society and the roles and stereotypes of the two sexes."
"We trust that the programme will be open to all of society, that knowledge of it will spread far and wide, especially in women' s organisations, that it will provide an opportunity for dialogue and for raising awareness in all the decision-making centres in all the Member States and that numerous agencies will have the chance to make good use of it."
"Women will then feel close to Europe and Europe will benefit from the interesting and innovative ideas which will be formulated as a result of their connections with this programme."
"We think it is extremely important to promote a positive image of women and visibility of their work and importance."
"We think that these projects will help women gain self-confidence in their role."
"Finally, we trust, as was said during the previous plenary when we debated older parliamentary reports, that we will have an evaluation procedure of substance and consistency."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we have had the fourth framework programme, and today we are discussing the fifth."
"The present reports by the Commission and Parliament show that despite the fact that there have been a number of successes over the past few years, the list of unfinished or unsatisfactory points is too long."
"Therefore it is still our goal for the next five years to consolidate the position of women in the policies of all Member States, both in terms of quality and content."
"We need measures to be given substance, we require strategic goals and the implementation of policies such as equal opportunities in the economic and social spheres, social rights for women, taking into account their personal situations, and the need for childcare. Other points to be considered include the fact that women might want to take up a career later in life, or resume a career etc., gender roles, stereotypes, and the need for equal participation and representation."
"As far as the strategic goals are concerned, for example, in the sphere of 'women in working life' , economic and employment policy issues cannot be dealt with separately from issues of social responsibility, social security, and a fair distribution of caring responsibilities."
"Problems to do with access to social security must be looked at on a case-by-case basis to this end."
"Furthermore, the Community must do more in the way of assessing the need for additional initiatives, including, where necessary, implementing legislation and equal opportunities, and fighting discrimination."
"The European Parliament, the national parliaments and networks must therefore become more closely involved."
"Financial resources are indispensable, as is always the case when goals are to be achieved and there is a great deal of catching up to do."
"This programme is therefore conditional on funds totalling EUR 50 million being made available for the period from 2001 to 2005."
"This means that we must step up our efforts to achieve a women' s policy that crosses the institutional and political divide, and to enable the equal opportunities strategies called for to be implemented more effectively."
"We must invest our energies in the realisation and implementation of the planned programmes, and this must go hand in hand with well-timed evaluations and coordination with other programmes."
"We expect to receive an annual report from the President of the Commission, within the context of an annual debate in the European Parliament."
"It is also necessary to establish a Council of Ministers both in order to deal with the content of the work, and with a view to winning recognition for women' s policy."
"Making women' s policy an adjunct to other political themes does not do the matter justice."
"Women' s policy must also be a criteria used to assess whether the candidate countries are ready for accession."
"The European Parliament could lead the way here by setting a better example."
"I hope that the sixth framework programme will not need to be as comprehensive as the present one."
"For this to be the case, women' s policy will have to be taken more seriously over the next five years and not just included in all political, economic and social programmes, but actually implemented."
"Women' s policy is not - as happens so often - to be incorporated into programmes for minorities."
"At 52%, women are not a minority group!"
"I would like to congratulate Mrs Eriksson on an excellent report and the Commission on an excellent strategy for gender equality."
"It encompasses all those areas where action is needed and, if successfully coordinated, could make a real difference to women in all aspects of their everyday lives."
"This could work if the framework strategy were an integral part of the programme, as an annex to it."
"This would ensure the implementation of the programme and I therefore support the comments made by the rapporteur earlier on."
"There has not been a shortage of good ideas or good plans to achieve equality in the past but their implementation has often failed."
"This time the Commission is putting forward a new approach."
"It is very welcome but it is only valuable if it can actually be made to work."
"That means also reaching women in their own communities."
"The involvement of local and regional authorities in this process is invaluable."
"They are the largest employers across the Member States and the central providers of education, training and economic development and, as such, they are key players in achieving equality."
"I hope due regard will be paid to them in the final programme."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, no one is disputing that we should strive for greater equity between men and women."
"For too long, women' s role has been despised."
"In this respect, the Napoleonic Code, which was framed in France at the beginning of the 19th century and exported to every corner of Europe, must shoulder a large share of the blame."
"Women must once again be given a place that is in keeping with the vital importance of their vocation, and I am not entirely sure that Mrs Eriksson' s report makes any contribution towards this."
"All the same, the texts before us are not entirely lacking in quality."
"So, Amendment No 2, presented by my own committee, grants single fathers the same rights as single mothers. Equality and fair treatment must work both ways, that is the ideal."
"I am delighted, moreover, that improvements in childcare facilities are planned in order to better support the reconciliation of professional and family life."
"This report does, however, give some cause for concern."
"Amendment No 18, for example, which seeks to support action by candidate countries to combat discrimination must not afford any opportunity to foist on them social choices alien to their culture."
"In this respect, in New York, very distinct differences between the European Union and Poland emerged."
"By failing to respect Poland' s social choices, the European Union would be taking a very peculiar, and very disturbing, view of pluralism."
"Furthermore, Amendment No 19 on establishing an audit of equal opportunities within the public budget is extremely debatable."
"Indeed, the way the concept of discrimination has been manipulated makes it, in many respects, an empty formula used by a whole collection of sorcerer' s apprentices in order to achieve their ideological ends."
"It is high time we broke with an ideological vision of woman' s place in society."
"In this area, as in many others, it is essential for public authorities to exercise true pluralism in selecting their associates."
"It is not right for a handful of women, expert in making claims of society and living on intravenous injections of public monies, to monopolise the role of speaking on behalf of women."
"In this respect, I cannot but endorse the decision by the Committee on Budgets to break the monopoly held for so long by the European Women' s Lobby."
"I should like to see this House confirming this bold change of course."
"A decision of this type would be like a breath of fresh air to the strange alliances which too closely bind a number of pressure groups to the European Commission and to some political groups in this House."
"The women' s movement can only be strengthened by such a decision."
"I could go even further, and say it would be ennobled by such a decision."
"This is something my Group will take into consideration in its final vote."
"(Applause from the UEN Group)"
"Mr President, we are aware of the progress that has been made in recent years with regard to the situation of women, particularly the legislative progress, but there are still situations of real inequality in everyday life."
"The low level of representation of women in political and economic spheres and gender-related violence are two clear signs that structural discrimination against women is continuing."
"This programme will undoubtedly help to ensure that the concerns, needs and aspirations of women are taken into account in all policies."
"The current situation requires that positive action measures in favour of women be implemented."
"The objectives that the programme sets out in five specific areas will help to ensure that all the action taken will be associated with at least one of those areas."
"Participation in economic life, which women should enjoy under equal conditions to men, employment, which is the basis for all equality and integration, and achieving the 60% target proposed at the Lisbon Summit, would also solve other problems."
"The inclusion of this objective in all Community programmes, within the framework of the Structural Funds, should be effected in accordance with Community legislation."
"Equality in participation and representation, balance in the decision-making process, greater participation in political life, whatever the process adopted, in order to achieve an increase in the participation of women, until we reach the 40% figure proposed by the Commission."
"Equal access and full enjoyment of social rights for women and men, which would mean ensuring that the legislation is applied in the social sphere in terms of maternity leave, maternity protection, working time, employment contracts, etc."
"Equality between women and men in civil life, allowing women to fully enjoy human rights and fundamental freedoms."
"We especially need to guard against and eradicate trafficking in women and domestic violence."
"We need to encourage a change in the roles and stereotypes associated with gender, which will also help to solve some of the other problems above."
"In relation to this objective we will support the organisation of awareness campaigns and a European Equality Week in cooperation with the Member States, as the Commission proposes."
"We think that it is very useful to create a web site, not only due to the increasing use of computerised media, but because this will help women to familiarise themselves more and more with this new world from which they must not be excluded."
"Something that we think is of particular importance is the evaluation of the programme ..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe we are now discussing Commissioner Diamantopoulou' s second tour de force."
"With the framework strategy and the new action programme in place, the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities - working under intense time pressure, and restricted to only a few official languages - has now, with a great deal of good will, introduced 60 proposed amendments."
"I hope that the President-in-Office of the Council, Nicole Péry, will be able to get through the programme in the Council in November."
"I hope there will be no repeat of the fourth action programme, when the erstwhile Federal Government under Helmut Kohl halved the budget, no less."
"Time is pressing."
"Women are still not adequately represented in politics and in economic decision-making processes."
"According to EUROSTAT, approximately 77% of the recipients of low wages are women."
"Depending on the country and sector, women earn up to 30% less than their male counterparts."
"The framework strategy must be brought to bear in this regard as well."
"All the equal opportunities initiatives should be coordinated under one roof and translated into the five, specific, strategic goals."
"Other speakers have made the same point."
"That would be the logical way to implement the gender mainstreaming concept."
"I am expecting the male protagonists to at last get down to work and do their bit to counter inherited notions of gender roles and stereotypes."
"We also want to see the leading politicians on our side, and call upon President Prodi, the Council, and the Ministers, to take full account of the gender aspect, for example in the context of the European Union' s foreign relations, and particularly where the enlargement process is concerned."
"More emphasis should be placed on establishing links between women' s organisations, which is something I called for back when I was rapporteur for the interim report on the fourth action programme."
"Our parliamentary committee plans to stage a conference on this specialist policy area, together with the parliamentary committees of our Member States and of the candidate countries, in November in Berlin."
"I am hoping that this will provide the necessary political impetus for the implementation of the programme and framework strategy."
"This is where Europe will again lead the way in the fight for women' s rights in Europe."
"Mr President, following the first four action programmes for equality between women and men, it was a good move on the part of the Commission to innovate by proposing a Community framework strategy for equality and a programme to implement this strategy and make real progress towards equality."
"There is great need of this, even though a quarter of a century has passed since the first Community directive on the equal treatment of men and women with regard to pay."
"I find the Commission' s new approach to be a very positive one, and the proposal for a decision for the 2001-2005 programme to have been well considered."
"Unfortunately, the report by the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities is no improvement on the text put forward by the Commission."
"It overeggs the pudding, and includes unconsidered and indigestible proposals, worded in such a way as to make a first-year law student' s hair stand on end."
"In committee, I had tabled a raft of amendments intended to do away with the worst of the incongruities, particularly those that demonstrated an outlandish mish-mash of strategy and programmes."
"The Commission has produced an excellent text."
"It is a very serious mistake, in politics, to mix strategy up with tactics or with programmes."
"As is so often the case in reports by the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, we have here a report including the ideological claims of the left wing coalition, the gauche plurielle, in this Parliament, like the claim that measures eligible for programme funding in a transnational context should include the analysis and assessment of, I quote, ""the significance of a general reduction in working hours"" ."
"Do we really need to waste any of the paltry EUR 53.45 million in appropriations to cover five years on such an analysis?"
"I think not."
"I am also of the opinion that the appropriations for the European Women' s Lobby, budget line A 3037, should not be included in the appropriations committed for the programme and I hope that the Commissioner will favour the amendments that I and the other members of my Group have tabled, above the rapporteur' s own far-fetched amendments."
"Mr President, I think it would be a great shame if Nicole Péry were not also to seize the opportunity to state her opinion now that she is here, so that we might hear her points of view, too."
"Mrs Eriksson, Mrs Péry has not asked to speak and I cannot force her to."
"I cannot order the President-in-Office of the Council to take the floor."
"In any case, I feel that we should thank her for following the debate, especially since she was not scheduled to be present during this discussion as well."
"However, I see that she is preparing to leave now."
"Mr President, I should like to thank and congratulate Mrs Eriksson, who has endeavoured in the short time available to respond to the need for us to accept the programme as quickly as possible, so that we can avoid a vacuum between the fourth and fifth programmes and can start implementing the fifth programme in January."
"This programme is an important document for the Committee on Women' s Rights, which is why it provoked a great deal of interest and, of course, it forms part of the more overall strategy which was discussed with the Committee on Women' s Rights, the Committee on Social Affairs and the Council."
"It is the familiar 5-pronged strategy of participation of women in economic life, at the decision-making centres, in social policy, in civil society and in human rights, together with the new model of gender equality for the mass media and education."
"Our cooperation with the committee was excellent, which is why we can accept a large number of amendments, either to the letter or in spirit."
"Specifically, we accept Amendments Nos 2, 4, 5, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 23, 28, 32, 43, 46, 48, 49, 51, 55, 56 and 59."
"We are also able to accept parts of Amendments Nos 3, 7, 8, 11, 14, 15, 20, 27, 35, 37, 45, 50, 53, 57 and 58."
"I think that the large number of amendments accepted is illustrative of the meeting of minds between the Commission and the Committee on Women' s Rights."
"I should like to make two comments on the amendments which we are unable to accept, mainly for technical and legal reasons rather than because of a difference of approach."
"First, as far as the strategy is concerned."
"It is not possible for the entire strategy to form part of the Council decision, but I agree that some amendments could be made to the wording of the articles in order to make it perfectly clear that this strategy has been taken into account and forms the basis on which the programme will be implemented."
"Secondly, as far as the specific percentage to be earmarked from the Structural Funds is concerned."
"I should remind you that a regulation was voted through last year which clearly sets out how items are allocated and we cannot use a programme to change the regulation which already exists."
"I must stress that we absolutely agree on the need to focus on complementarity between current actions and programmes and, of course, on the important role which non-governmental organisations must play in designing and implementing these programmes."
"And I should like to stress, in the light of certain comments, that the women' s lobby really does play an important coordinating role at European level and that there are no protests or complaints in the Commission about exempting certain organisations; on the contrary, European organisations as a whole are able to take part in all the programmes, such as this programme, EQUAL, the programme to combat discrimination, the programme to combat exclusion, DAPHNE or STOP."
"Major European women' s organisations therefore clearly have access to all the programmes."
"I really do believe that the strategy behind this programme, the main objective of which is to implement mainstreaming in all policies, is a huge challenge for all of us, both at Commission level, with the cooperation between the individual committees which we need in order to obtain a final result, and at national level, with the need for horizontal action in every ministry so that the women' s policy becomes a horizontal policy."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.30 p.m."
"Competition policy"
"The next item is the joint debate on the two reports tabled on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy:"
"(A5-0290/2000) tabled by Mrs Riis-Jørgensen, on the XXIXth report on competition policy - 1999 [SEC(2000) 720 - C5-0302/2000 - 2000/2153 (COS)];"
"(A5-0281/2000) tabled by Mr Evans, on the Commission's eighth survey on State aid in the European Union [COM(2000) 205 - C5-0430/2000 - 2000/2211(COS)]."
"Mr President, I very much welcome the Commission' s report."
"It is a splendid piece of work that Commissioner Monti and his staff carried out last year."
"In my report on the twenty-ninth report on the Commission' s competition policy, I expended particular energy on the problems concerning mergers and the repayment of State aid."
"I did this for a number of reasons."
"Firstly because, in the course of last year, I was approached on a number of occasions by companies which have felt a certain degree of powerlessness in connection with rulings on mergers, especially in relation to those cases in which they have needed to appeal to the Court of First Instance against the Commission' s ruling."
"With regard to State aid, moreover, problems apparently still exist with ensuring that unlawfully paid State aid is paid back to the national exchequers."
"Let us begin, however, with mergers. One consequence of EMU is, of course, that we see more and more mergers."
"I also think the time is ripe for re-assessing whether the procedures and sets of rules we have at present are as good as they could be."
"The world is not, of course, always so easy for those who have to follow the rules and procedures we are involved in devising."
"I think it is necessary for clear rules to be devised for what is called the relevant market."
"It is important to distinguish between what may be called the peripheral areas of Europe and what may be called the heart of Europe."
"It is especially important to put this distinction in place before enlargement, for it can be difficult for the smaller countries in the peripheral areas when companies wish to merge, because the latter quickly become large players in their own market."
"It is not especially appropriate that larger companies in small countries should be prevented from merging for, in that way, their opportunities to compete globally are reduced."
"I should therefore like to remind you that we do, of course, have existing rules to take care of those circumstances in which companies exploit their important and possibly dominant market positions."
"We therefore need not perhaps be so afraid of mergers."
"After all, it is not a crime for companies to merge."
"Another thing I feel very strongly about is the need to arrange for mergers to go through more quickly."
"I am thinking here, in particular, of those circumstances in which a company wishes to appeal against the Commission' s ruling."
"Quite simply, a period of between 25 and 35 months is too long in our global village for getting a case through the courts, and what is very time consuming is having the documents of the case translated."
"That is not good enough."
"We owe it to our companies to offer them the best conditions so that they are able to plan their production and, especially, their future."
"On the subject of mergers, I have two questions for you, Commissioner Monti."
"Would it be possible to consider different possible solutions for separating the Commission' s functions of judge and prosecutor?"
"For example, could there be a panel of independent experts during the second hearing so that it is not exclusively people from the Commission who assess individual merger cases?"
"I also have another idea, even if it is perhaps a touch outside your sphere of authority."
"Might not a committee of experts or an expert tribunal, specialising in companies, be set up in the department of first instance at the court in Luxembourg?"
"In Denmark, for example, we have a special maritime and commercial court dealing exclusively with issues relating to companies."
"I would also take the opportunity of asking the Commissioner to explain why one of the most trusted merger specialists has left the Commission."
"The other subject I raised in my report is that of State aid and the repayment of State aid which has been awarded unlawfully."
"I make no secret of the fact that I feel very strongly about tightening up on the repayment of State aid which has been awarded unlawfully, especially since this is another area it is important to sort out before enlargement."
"It is good that State aid to shipyards in Europe should be phased out as per 1 January 2001, even if it is extremely problematic that our shipyards should continue to have to compete with the South Korean treasury."
"In the light of the latest development, I can appreciate why the Commission has, with good reason, adopted a harder line on South Korea."
"I am wondering, therefore, if you could report on the very latest developments, Commissioner, even though I am well aware that you only have limited time available."
"I also want to take the opportunity to ask Commissioner Monti if and when a public, efficient and properly functioning register of State aid may be expected to be put in place and, in the same vein, when the long-promised scoreboard is to become a reality."
"Finally, I want to emphasise that, for me as a liberal, it is crucially important that companies can be sure of being dealt with properly and efficiently in all areas, so that there are no hitches where companies' future legal certainty is concerned."
"I should also like to thank my fellow MEPs in Committee for the splendid way in which they have cooperated in connection with my report."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in view of the lavish amount of speaking time we permit ourselves for debates of this kind, I want to dispense with the preliminaries and address Commissioner Monti directly."
"Commissioner, you know that for some time now, there has been a substantial consensus in this House on competition issues."
"This means that the entire House supports the Commission in matters of competition policy."
"With the passage of time though, I have begun to wonder whether the Commission is not, in fact, gradually losing its sense of perspective where individual decisions are concerned, or whether it even wants to prejudge fundamental decisions in entirely different political fields under the mantle of competition."
"I will cite one of several examples, and it is one that is currently the subject of intense debate in other regions besides my own."
"It concerns the subsidisation decision or non-subsidisation decision in relation to the coal industry."
"I will take the precaution, Commissioner - in case you should want to point out that this in fact falls within Commissioner Palacio' s remit - of saying that I am addressing the Commission as a whole."
"I would also draw your attention to the fact that the coal issue is raised both in the competition report and in the subsidy report that we are discussing today."
"I expect the Commission to uphold its agreements."
"I do not expect it to abuse judgements from the Court of Justice in order to withdraw from these agreements."
"I will reiterate what I have already said repeatedly in debates of this kind: competition is not an end in itself."
"When a decision is to be taken in matters of competition policy, account must be taken of the social, structural and industrial implications, and if this is not done then competition policy will degenerate to the level of pure ideology."
"If the aspects I mentioned are taken into consideration, and one considers the net product chain of the state-of-the-art technology, then the subsidy licences that have fallen due for coal mining must be granted without delay."
"This does not just apply to the sphere of energy policy; it applies right across the board."
"Competition is important but it is not the be-all and end-all."
"To sum up, what we need is to strike a balance between competition rules and acting for the public good."
"This must be the guiding principle in all areas."
"Commissioner, I want to take up what I said at the beginning. The support is still there."
"But if you carry on in this vein, you risk losing the support of not insignificant sections of the House."
"I dare say that is unlikely to help matters overall."
"Mr President, I am going to talk about Mrs Riis-Jørgensen' s report."
"I want to begin by congratulating her on a very good report."
"One of the absolutely basic principles of EU cooperation is that competition between different companies, products, countries and regions should work well and be fair and correct, as well as be for the benefit of consumers."
"Allow me to begin with something said by Adam Smith, the father of economic liberalism, in 1776, to the effect that people in the same industry seldom meet for pleasure or diversion without their conversations' ending with a conspiracy against the general public or some device for raising prices."
"Certainly, a good deal has happened in the last 200 years or so, but we have the same aspirations today."
"If the internal market is to operate, we must have active institutions which look after issues of competition."
"Commissioner Monti is to be congratulated in this respect."
"Paragraph 16 of Mrs Riis-Jørgensen' s report talks of increased legal certainty where applications for mergers are concerned, together with more effective and shorter timeframes within which to appeal before courts."
"This applies particularly in view of the fact that, in dealing with mergers, the Commission has something of a double role."
"The Commission both supervises and applies the rules of competition."
"This double role makes special demands in terms of openness, control and predictability."
"The second paragraph I want to mention is paragraph 18."
"It is of general relevance, but its point of departure is the planned merger between motor manufacturers Volvo and Scania."
"As is well known, the Commission opposed this merger, which in turn led to an extensive debate about how the rules of competition operate and how market shares are to be calculated and assessed."
"A clearer definition and further discussion are needed in this area."
"As long as the internal market is not complete, it is mainly large companies in small Member States which can lose out in competitiveness to companies elsewhere in the world."
"How are large companies with large home markets to be able to merge and compete in a global market if the EU' s rules make this impossible?"
"Coming as I do from a small country, I myself am very pleased, therefore, that the Committee should have adopted the amendments I proposed in this connection."
"I hope that the Commission is now also prepared to broaden the discussion and shed more light on the rules of competition on the basis of these assumptions."
"Commissioner Monti, on behalf of the Italian Radicals, I too would like to thank the rapporteurs for the two sound reports they have produced, which commend both your work and the work of the Directorate-General for Competition."
"I would like to take this opportunity to raise a few general points regarding European competition policies and also the competitiveness and opening-up of the European markets, not in order to deny any progress made thusfar, but with a view to the future."
"In my opinion, a particularly regrettable factor, if we want a genuinely open and competitive market economy to develop, is still the presence of large numbers of powerful public companies in sectors which have already been formally liberalised or which are currently going through this process."
"I could mention, for example ... let me see ... the State monopoly of retirement pensions, but I will restrict myself, more pertinently, to firms operating in the sectors of general interest services."
"It is my view that, in these sectors, competition and the market are being severely hampered by the fact that the State is both regulator and operator."
"I know, Commissioner, because I have had occasion to read and hear your views on the matter, that your response to the objections is that the articles of the Treaties do not provide for any distinction between the public or private nature of firms."
"However, we cannot be satisfied with this response if we want Europe to become a more competitive and more open market in the future and - dare I say it - if we study carefully certain situations which are developing, in which even the current rules would allow us to intervene."
"The whole of Europe is experiencing the growth of an aggressive State capitalism which has resulted in a series of private companies being taken over by State monopolies or former monopolies, in any case by companies which are firmly in public hands, companies which are State-owned."
"We have heard the justification many times; it is always ready to be trotted out - we must ensure that our companies and their assets retain their value through the privatisation process - meanwhile privatisation generally becomes more and more delayed instead of facilitated."
"And, naturally, these are clearly statements to which the ears of the various Ministers for the Treasury in Europe are extremely sensitive."
"In all cases, these are public companies whose financial prowess derives from their past and present positions of monopoly rather than managerial expertise."
"In many cases, they are companies which operate entirely or in part with considerable legal monopolistic reserves."
"Truly, Commissioner, can we not perceive in these cases the existence of State aid, concealed to a greater or lesser extent, or abuse of a dominating position?"
"Or again, the transfer at the very least of the distorting effects of the dominating position from one sector to another?"
"Or, lastly, the ever increasing consolidation of the positions of the incumbents which will make it difficult for newcomers to enter the various markets after liberalisation?"
"By way of example, Deutsche Post has recently gained control of DHL International and is operating under a monopoly for dispatches up to 200 grams, and then, on a more general note, we could cite the diversification of the State postal companies in other sectors;"
"EDF (Eléctricité de France) has taken over companies in Britain, Sweden and Finland, France Telecom has taken over Orange; on the Italian side of things, Enel has taken over Infostrada and, still in the Italian context, we could mention the various companies owned by local authorities which are behaving in a similar fashion."
"Lastly, Commissioner, there is the case of the public financing of State television under the alibi of financing a public service, which is a concept that is fading fast."
"Of course, there is the Treaty of Amsterdam, but I wonder whether the constraints imposed by the governments on the excellent work of your predecessor should, in any case, be justified as a way of exempting these companies from European competition rules."
"Mr President, we welcome the modernisation of the competition policy which, in terms of set-up, has undergone little change since the sixties."
"This overhaul is all the more imperative since nearly all of the Member States have now established a sound, independent competition authority."
"I do not share the concern expressed by quite a few fellow MEPs with regard to the re-nationalisation of policy."
"If we want to avoid a chaotic and unwieldy bureaucracy in Brussels, then we have no choice but to embrace decentralisation."
"I am delighted about the special attention being paid to the position of large undertakings in small Member States in Paragraph 18 of the motion for a resolution."
"These are the ones experiencing major adverse effects from infringements of the internal market or from the continued existence of borders within the internal market, because their 'home market' cannot sufficiently absorb these blows."
"What are the Commissioner' s objections to lending the concept of 'relevant market' a predominantly EU-wide dimension in the event of mergers?"
"I would also like to draw the Commissioner' s attention to the environmental significance of soil decontamination projects."
"Naturally, we endorse the polluter pays principle."
"But this principle certainly cannot always be applied, especially in the case of large or substantial soil decontamination projects, because we will then end up with contaminated soil well into the next century."
"Given the staff shortages in your Directorate-General, Mr Monti, it is not logical to accord a great deal of attention to this."
"It seems to me that the effect of these projects on the competitive sphere is rather minor."
"Finally, the book by your predecessor, and former Commissioner, Mr Van Miert, entitled ""Mijn jaren in Europa"" [My years in Europe] gives some idea of the blackmail-like tactics which a Competition Commissioner comes up against."
"It speaks volumes."
"I hope you are affected by this to a lesser extent, but I fear the worst."
"I therefore wish you all the strength and wisdom you will need to keep your chin up over the next couple of years, and I look forward to reading similar memoirs by yourself in due course."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to say a warm thank you for the reports we have heard about today, and which do not just record what happened in the past, but also pick out the central themes of the present debate, and even incorporate the Commission' s plans."
"Competition is not, as has already been said, an end in itself."
"It must serve the interests of consumers, companies and local conditions."
"Competition is therefore always a means to an end."
"It is a vital cornerstone of our model, in terms of political order, of the socio-economic market economy."
"I stress this point because the market cannot regulate everything, which is why competition is not completely unrestricted, nor should it be."
"We therefore need two things: firstly, in the interests of increased transparency, we need to make the public aware of all the approved subsidies that influence competition, and secondly there must be areas of our day-to-day lives and behaviour which are not subject lock, stock and barrel to the dictates of European competition policy."
"The sports sphere or the numerous non-governmental organisations in the social and health spheres, to quote two examples."
"Who, like us, says 'yes' to a functioning internal market, must also have the courage of their convictions to say 'yes' to European competition policy."
"Therefore, we welcome the modernisation of competition policy, which is initiated and then maintained by a stream of new proposals."
"The Community' s competition policy has been given a new European and international dimension."
"In view of the enlargement process and globalisation, it is playing an increasingly important part in economic relations within and outside the European Union."
"I therefore welcome the modernisation going on within the Community on the one hand, and the fact that European competition policy now extends beyond Union borders."
"On a final note, we need a more precise definition of the relevant market because, increasingly, the market is not the national market."
"We need to promote the citizens' awareness of competition policy, so that they recognise the advantages."
"We also need to step up debate in the European public arena on the relevant proposals, because they are frequently misunderstood."
"What I mean - and this is directed at the public, not the Commission - is that its decentralised application must not lead to renationalisation, but must instead lead to Europeanisation."
"When you delegate responsibility, you must take care not to surrender your key responsibility!"
"Lastly, boosting the citizens' autonomy must not create legal uncertainty, rather, European competition policy must well and truly leave its mark on the thoughts and actions of the people beyond the institutions."
"We still have a lot to do on that score, Commissioner!"
"Mr President, today no one disputes, and of course I am not going to do so, the fact that state aid alters the conditions for competition and is a damaging element that encourages inefficiency in undertakings."
"This is certain, but if each and every one of us is honest, we have to admit that in our public life we have often defended state aid when an undertaking has required it in order to establish itself, for example, in our constituency, or in order to prevent it from closing."
"I began by saying this in order to highlight what is associated with some positions and to point out that when we are trying to issue a European Parliament opinion on the annual report on state aid, the Group of the Europe People' s Party tries to conduct an ideological debate in this House on state aid in which it aims to go further than anyone and to demonise all types of aid."
"This happened last year with the Jonckheer report, and this year, despite the more flexible position adopted by Mr Evans, it has continued to arise, perhaps in order to present the Socialists as some sort of outdated interventionists who use measures that are as damaging for the market as state aid."
"I have already had the opportunity to express that state aid is a transfer of public money to private companies and, therefore, that as Socialists we should also be against it."
"However, we cannot deny the obvious and we should recall that the Treaty does not forbid all types of aid, so some types that are aimed at objectives such as social cohesion, regional cohesion, the environment, etc. should be permitted. If that is the case, and it is, why does the Group of the Europe People' s Party refuse to accept amendments that cover that point?"
"The same occurs when the report insists, following the Commission' s line, that aid for coal did not serve to secure the future of the industry, but in the same paragraph they refuse to accept a sentence, also from the Commission, saying that this aid was necessary in order to mitigate the social and regional impact of the restructuring of the sector."
"In this respect, it is difficult for us to agree with a report which, although it reflects part of the truth, refuses to include another part of the truth."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Evans and Mr Karas have highlighted the significance of state aids and competition policy very clearly in this debate."
"In future we must remember that there are national aid schemes, in respect of internal competition, for example, which are especially important and valuable in countries with low population densities and where distances are long."
"I wish to raise one issue in this regard, that of transport aid."
"I am thinking here of my own country, for example, where the distances are long."
"In the north the price of fuel is 0.2 euros higher than in southern Finland."
"In addition, shipments of raw materials, animal feedingstuffs and similar goods are especially important as far as internal competition is concerned and issues of major importance in order that state aids may continue to support them."
"They are especially significant with regard to the regional economy and employment, and I hope that in future this can be made clear, so that these aids, these internal aids, which affect regional development and the regional economy, in which transport aid is a key example, might continue."
"Mr President, Commissioner Monti, ladies and gentlemen, a European, open, competitive and coordinated market economy needs an effective competition policy."
"Without a properly administered competition policy, neither the European Union' s economy nor its external manifestation, in the form of the euro, will ever be able to achieve its full potential."
"Only a company that is competitive in the Internal Market without State aid can also be competitive in the global market."
"However, in shaping European competition policy we have to ensure that it does not limit the opportunities for companies to succeed in the wider, global economy as well."
"As Mrs Riis-Jørgensen quite rightly emphasises in her report and speech, there is a danger, particularly with regard to the small Member States, that too narrow a concept of the market is used to define a dominant market position, which makes it harder for companies in small Member States to become sufficiently large players in the area of global competition."
"Besides, a dominant market position is not even a problem unless there is evidence that this position is being abused."
"Only if the dominant market position leads to adversity with regard to consumers and competitors must we tackle the situation using stringent measures, as you, Mr Monti, have done."
"As Mrs Riis-Jørgensen states in point 15 of her report, we have to focus on the harm caused as a result of measures restricting competition, and not so much on what sort of economic players are involved."
"Special account must be taken of the position of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Small-scale State aid might be more harmful to an SME than people think if the market is a small one."
"For that reason it is good that this report of Mrs Riis-Jørgensen' s also emphasises the importance of this."
"In his report, my colleague, Mr Evans, thanks you, Mr Monti, for having got to grips with the issue of State aid policy."
"Massive amounts of State aid are still a problem in many sectors."
"Although State aid may, on the surface, seem a good solution, when viewed in the longer term it very rarely produces lasting positive results."
"I certainly do not want to condemn all State aid."
"There is also aid that is necessary, as laid down the Treaties."
"In the long run, however, levels of State aid will have to fall."
"State aids lead to the postponement of inevitable structural change, to the distortion of competition, and breed inefficiency."
"In a sense, State aids prop up Potemkin villages, which at some stage will come crashing down. Then it is the private consumer and the taxpayer who foot the bill."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all let me express my deep disagreement with the excessively liberal, if not actually ultraliberal, tendencies of the report by our fellow Member, Mr Evans."
"Hearing him deny the fact that state aid was reduced in the period 1994-1998, even though the Commission itself acknowledges this reduction, is already bizarre, to say the least."
"It is all the more serious, however, to see him, in an almost obsessive way, stressing the exceptional nature of state aid, even though the Treaty itself provides for the use of such aid in order to achieve the objectives set by the Treaties, such as in matters of the environment or social cohesion, and even though the European Commission itself recognises that some policies cannot be sustained solely by market forces. These, I feel, are adequate reasons for me not to support the report as it stands."
"And, even if I can relate to the demands for increased transparency on the subject of state aid, and for Parliament to be kept informed with regard to the monitoring of aid approved by the Commission, I shall nonetheless continue to argue in favour of maintaining state aid in order to develop social cohesion, research, innovation, environmental protection, in order to compensate for shortfalls in the market, in order to promote European competitiveness in the world, in order to combat the fraudulent machinations of competing countries, such as Korea in the sphere of shipbuilding."
"Let me add that state aid must be supervised strictly according to the terms of the treaties and not in accordance with the prevailing liberal ideology."
"Between the omnipresent State, which no one wants any more, and the completely absent State, which is nothing more than a modern-day law of the jungle, this concept which many term the European social model forces us to continually seek a balance between those things that can be governed by the market and those which public authorities have a duty to regulate."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are also to discuss the Montfort report this week, which Parliament wants to use to promote an entrepreneurial way of thinking."
"It is therefore particularly apt to acknowledge three things in this debate."
"Firstly, the fact that a European Charter of Fundamental Rights has now been drafted, Article 16 of which establishes the right to entrepreneurial freedom."
"Of course, this right demands strict competition law, because only this will guarantee fair competition."
"It protects consumers and investors."
"Secondly, it is only right that we should acknowledge the highly commendable book by Karel van Miert, which tells us about the means employed by entrepreneurs to bring pressure to bear on other entrepreneurs."
"Thirdly therefore, I would like to congratulate the Commission and its staff on the actions and decisions they have taken in the field of competition law, previously under Karel van Miert and now under your overall control, Professor Monti."
"Against this background, you have reworked a communication on services of general interest and set out the legal situation once again."
"This statement contains three important messages."
"Firstly, the Member States have the right to define everything that belongs under this heading."
"Secondly, the Member States have the right to inject supplementary funding if it would otherwise be impossible to maintain these activities."
"And thirdly - and this is highly relevant to this debate - there must of course be no areas which are exempt from competition law."
"It is therefore possible to see why renationalisation would spell trouble."
"It must not annul the general validity of Community law."
"Hence those articles in the motions for resolutions which point to this fact, including the need for transparency, are particularly valuable."
"Professor Monti, I would like to make a suggestion in this respect. You really ought to clarify, at an earlier stage, that start-up aid - the administration of which varies substantially from Member State to Member State, in the sphere of renewable energies for example - will enjoy confidentiality protection, at least for the duration of its lifetime, even if, in the meantime - which is what I am hoping will happen - the Union as a whole upgrades its support measures."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Parliament in general for the great interest that it has once again displayed in matters of competition."
"Mr heartfelt thanks to Mrs Riis-Jørgensen for her valuable contribution as rapporteur of the XXIXth report on competition policy."
"A big thank you to Mr Evans as well, for his excellent report on the rules governing State aid to the steel industry and on the eighth survey on State aid in the European Union."
"All three reports assume considerable importance in the light of the efforts the Commission has made to increase the transparency of its competition policy and to explain what it is doing to the citizens."
"On the subject of explaining competition policy, I would like to say that I am extremely pleased with the success of the first two European Competition Days, which were held in Lisbon on 9 June and in Paris on 17 October this year."
"The idea was conceived in this Parliament and developed by Parliament and the Commission."
"My feeling is that, together, we are making progress in helping the citizens to understand this policy."
"I would like to stress that I fully agree with much of what has been said and with very many of the points contained in the resolutions."
"Mr President, in the time available to me, I would like to focus on the following three points: the modernisation of Community competition law, the practical application of competition rules in 1999 and State aid."
"On the subject of modernisation, I will attempt, within the constraints imposed, to respond to some of the extremely interesting points which have been raised."
"The annual report on competition policy emphasises the need to modernise the legislative and interpretative framework of Community competition law in the areas of both monopolies and State aid."
"I will not go into the details of the reform projects which have recently been completed or are still being developed, for they have already been the subject of a specific consultation process between the Commission and Parliament, or will be in the future, in the constructive dialogue which is so valuable."
"With regard to State aid, in my opinion, the entry into force, in 1999, of the Rules of Procedure was a considerable step forward."
"They increase transparency and establish the deadlines for adopting the decisions on State aid."
"As far as monopolies are concerned, the Commission adopted a proposal for a regulation on the matter on 27 September last."
"A great many observations made by Parliament during consultation over the White Paper were taken into account even as early as at the stage of drawing up the proposal."
"Particular attention was paid to the concerns expressed by Parliament regarding renationalisation and legal certainty."
"I would therefore like to assure Mrs Palacio, Mr Karas and the other Members who spoke on these points that the regulation takes their concerns into ample consideration."
"I am now waiting for the commencement of the second stage of dialogue between our two institutions on these legislative proposals and I am sure that it will be as constructive as the first stage."
"As you know, on 9 and 10 November, the Commission and Parliament are jointly organising a conference on this reform in Freiburg, a conference proposed for the first time precisely in your resolution on the White Paper."
"My second point is the application of the competition rules during 1999."
"In the year in question, there were an unusually large number of cases requiring the use of considerable resources and which were closed by formal decisions."
"One of the things I appreciate is your call for an increase in human resources."
"The Commission has continued to intervene resolutely, particularly where cartels and abuse of a dominating position are concerned."
"As in the debate on mergers, since time is limited and I prefer to attempt to answer some of the specific questions, I will not mention the major - albeit numerous - interventions we have made."
"The third point is State aid."
"I am happy to note the support which Parliament continues to lend us in relation to the eighth survey too."
"I welcome Parliament's proposals on the future development of these information tools, which will include the register and the scoreboard as well as audits."
"I confirm to Mr Evans and the other Members who have spoken on this subject that we will be ready to present the initial versions of the register and the scoreboard - Mrs Riis-Jørgensen also upholds this idea - before June 2001, and I am confident that transparency will be an important additional tool for the application of the legal instruments governing State aid."
"Mr President, I would now like to focus on at least some of the specific points raised."
"Several Members - Mrs Riis-Jørgensen, Mr Schmidt, Mr Blokland and Mrs Kauppi - have posed the problem of large companies operating in relatively small countries."
"Could we not relax the definition of the relevant market there, when it comes to merger operations?"
"Well, if the relevant market, on the basis of the analysis conducted, happens to be national in scope, you must realise that doing what you suggest would amount to discrimination against the consumers and customers in those national markets."
"What we have to work together for is to gradually establish in the marketplace the reality of a single market going beyond the national market."
"Otherwise we would be serving our purpose of helping competition and the consumers in a perverse way."
"I add, in relation to the specific Volvo-Scania case that I am sure underlies many speakers' remarks, that both companies have been able to reach solutions that make their own further international growth compatible with the protection of the interests of competition and consumers in those markets."
"Should we introduce a panel of independent experts to assess mergers?"
"The recourse to external expertise can be useful and already takes place in a number of cases."
"But the Commission should not and will not give its ultimate responsibility of taking decisions to an external body."
"It belongs to us."
"It may, on occasion, be uncomfortable, but this is our task."
"Concerning the problem of one DG Competition official who resigned, I have already expressed my regret about that resignation."
"Further increasing the right of defence, the transparency of the procedures, including the enhanced position of the hearing officer, is something to which I am very much attached and upon which I am reflecting, taking into account several inputs including the useful ideas provided by that official before he resigned."
"As far as Korea is concerned, Mr Lamy, who will be coming here during the course of the week, will be better placed to update you on the latest developments."
"I can only, for my part, state my conviction that any extension of operating state aids to shipyards would not be the appropriate response to a situation that requires other types of intervention."
"Mr Evans, I very much share your concern on the issue of state aids to financial services."
"We will pursue that point with determination."
"Mr Rapkay, it has been extremely important for the Commission to have the support of the European Parliament in pursuit of its competition policy and I do not feel that this support may fade away."
"Looking at the resolutions we are discussing today, I see the Commission' s policy as very much in line with a vigorous implementation of those resolutions."
"In the area notably of state aids, it must not be thought that the Commission believes in a pure or ultra-liberal policy."
"State aids have their place but it is a fact that in many cases the concrete manifestation of state aids goes well beyond what the Treaty allows and what the guidelines allow."
"But believe me, I certainly see competition policy as an instrument of a social market economy."
"The stronger the implementation of competition the better the market tends to be."
"There is full scope for social aspects provided they are not mixed up in a non-transparent way with the functioning of the market."
"Mr Della Vedova, the presence of public companies raises competition problems and - although it is possible and I have, of course, to confirm that the Treaty provides for neutrality with regard to private or public ownership - it is possible to intervene in the event of distortion: the instruments are those which you mentioned, the instruments on the control of State aid and on the abuse of dominant positions."
"You mentioned Deutsche Post: for example, procedures are currently in progress at the Commission on Deutsche Post in respect of both these areas, and I can assure you that the Commission does not intend the Protocol annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam on public television broadcasting to create a condition preventing appropriate control of State aid on this matter as well."
"In this regard, and as far as State aid is concerned, I refer you to the Communication adopted by the Commission on 20 September on services of general economic interest."
"Mr President, I think I have exceeded the time allowed to me."
"I apologise to those to whose questions I have not had time to respond."
"I would, however, like to end by quoting the report of the Legal Affairs Committee."
"It states, Mrs Palacio:"
"All too often Commission decisions in the field of competition are presented in the press as defeats for national interests rather than victories for the internal market and for the consumer.'"
"Our intention is to have more and more of these victories and to be more and more able to explain them to European consumers and to European citizens."
"Of course, Parliament has a very important role to play in this respect."
"Mr President, I would just like to set the record straight for the benefit of the Commissioner."
"I would not presume to speak on behalf of the whole of Parliament, and certainly not in advance of a vote on the matter."
"I merely want to clarify that I spoke here on behalf of the second largest group, and expressed a real concern of ours, and if you heard Mr Caudron speak, then you would be aware that this is not something I alone am concerned about, because it is also something that bothers another MEP."
"And so I only spoke on behalf of my Group, and not for Parliament as a whole."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.30 p.m."
"Financial assistance for Member States' balances of payments"
"The next item is the report (A5-0277/2000) by Mrs Sartori, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission report to the Council and to the European Parliament on the review of the single facility providing medium-term financial assistance for Member States' balances of payments [COM(1999) 628 - C5-0307/2000 - 2000/0807 (CNS)]."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, today, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I am tabling a proposal for a resolution on the Commission's report on the single facility providing medium-term financial assistance for Member States' balances of payments."
"The financial assistance is currently governed by Council Regulation No 1969 of 1988."
"This mechanism can be activated either at the request of a Member State or under Article 119 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, a provision which remains in force during the third stage of Economic and Monetary Union for the States which are covered by a derogation, currently Denmark, the United Kingdom and Sweden."
"The regulation and the proposal for a regulation have merged two mechanisms (medium-term financial assistance and the Community loan mechanism intended to provide medium-term financial assistance for Member States' balances of payments) into a single facility providing medium-term financial assistance."
"This proposal changes the mechanism' s ceiling."
"The fact that, at the moment, only three countries can benefit from it suggests that the amount hitherto available - EUR 16 billion - can be reduced."
"At the same time, however, past experience tells us that we cannot reduce it by very much, for the very reason that the last time the mechanism was used, in 1993, the loan was for EUR 8 billion."
"Therefore, although the increase in convergence of States reduces the likelihood that the mechanism will be used, it must still have sufficient resources to meet the simultaneous needs of several countries, should this be necessary."
"This is why we propose to reduce the amount available from EUR 16 billion to EUR 12 billion."
"This resolution also envisages the possibility of considering creating a special mechanism providing financial assistance to the balance of payments of the candidate countries."
"Clearly, this is a possibility for the future and therefore does not have a bearing on the present situation, but it is a possibility which I considered that we could at least examine in some depth so that we will be prepared should these issues arise."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Sartori for her report, which we have found very valuable."
"The aim of this Commission report is to provide a basis for examining the single facility providing medium-term financial support and for revising it, should this prove necessary."
"The financial mechanism implements Article 119 of the EC Treaty, which only remains in force during the third stage of economic and monetary union for the Member States which are not participating in monetary union."
"The last assessment was carried out in October 1997 on the basis of a report drawn up by the Commission."
"On that occasion, the Council endorsed the Commission' s position, which recommended that the mechanism should be continued, and decided that a further assessment, carried out according to the same procedure, would be necessary in the light of the changes linked to the commencement of the third stage."
"The Commission is therefore bound to submit a report to the Council so that the Council can carry out this additional assessment of the mechanism."
"The report makes three principle recommendations."
"Firstly, the single facility should be continued in that it is an instrument implementing Article 119 of the Treaty which will continue to apply to the Member States which are not part of the eurozone; until they participate in the single currency, these Member States, in a similar way to the new Members of the Community, are liable to encounter problems with their balances of payments and therefore to wish to have recourse to the mechanism under consideration."
"In view of the current level of economic, financial and monetary integration, the likelihood that these Member States will encounter difficulties related to the balance of payments is extremely low from the institutional point of view, but the mechanism must, nevertheless, remain in force."
"Secondly, the possibility of having recourse to funds contributed by other Member States to finance the loans granted under the mechanism should be eliminated since, for various reasons, it has never been used."
"In future, recourse to the capital market should be the only option available."
"Thirdly and finally, the drop in the number of Member States who could now apply for this form of financial support and the need to cover the potential borrowing requirement of new Member States justify lowering the mechanism's ceiling from EUR 16 billion to EUR 12 billion."
"The Economic and Financial Committee has drawn up an opinion which it sent to the Presidency on 14 July 2000."
"The Committee considers that the conclusions of the analysis of the single facility performed by the Commission are in line with its positions."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.30 p.m."
"Vegetative propagation of the vine"
"The next item is the report (A5-0195/2000) by Mrs Klass, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the proposal for a Council Directive amending Directive 68/193/EEC on the marketing of material for the vegetative propagation of the vine [COM(2000) 59 - C5-0090/2000 - 200/0036(CNS)]."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful for the fact that we are, after all, to have the opportunity to discuss the proposal for a Council Directive amending Directive 68/193/EEC on the marketing of material for the vegetative propagation of the vine, and I also hope that tomorrow' s vote will have a positive outcome."
"In terms of area, production and consumption European wine growing is in a leading position globally."
"In several Member States wine growing represents a significant proportion of total agricultural production, and in many regions this sector is a crucial source of agricultural income."
"Wine growing frequently takes place in areas in which other forms of agricultural activity would be difficult or impossible."
"Wine growing is a very varied and dynamic sector characterised by long-established traditions and ancient cultures."
"The vine propagating material provides the basis for optimal grape and wine production as regards quality, excellence and quantity, and establishes these factors over a period of 25 to 40 years."
"It is thus extremely significant and it is essential to guarantee optimum reliability in terms of quality and trueness to variety."
"The trade in, and marketing of, material for vegetative propagation of vines has, up to now, been laid down in directive 68/193/EEC dating from 1968."
"The directive contains a number of provisions which up to now have allowed Member States to make unilateral exemptions from some of the rules, and the directive has already been amended several times."
"I welcome the Commission' s proposal for amendments, which has grouped the amendments needed clearly in a single document and has also included new amendments arising from new developments and knowledge: as for example those concerning new types of propagating material for vines produced from herbaceous cuttings and in vitro propagation."
"The desired consolidation of the single market is very much to be welcomed."
"There is an urgent need to change or abolish old or outdated provisions so as to remove existing or potential barriers to trade."
"As far as I am concerned, French vine propagators should also be in a position to propagate vines for the German or Italian market, and vice versa."
"The specific characteristics of wine production and its further development, in particular in technical and scientific areas, make it essential to stipulate detailed technical provisions which will contribute to the smooth operation of the internal market, improve marketing prospects and also protect the legitimate interests of consumers and producers."
"Accordingly, the Commission should publish a Community Catalogue of varieties, compiled on the basis of notifications from the Member States."
"This will bring greater trading security for European wine growers."
"Many amendments contain a better definition of terms such as 'genotype' , for example."
"Accompanying paperwork and controls are important, and the Commission must ensure that only one document is required for each party, wherever they happen to be in Europe."
"High-quality and healthy vine propagating material is playing an increasingly important role these days."
"The report has taken on a particularly explosive character in the past few weeks."
"This is because the Commission is proposing to create a legal basis with regard to genetically modified varieties."
"The Commission proposal refers to Council Directive 90/220, which is to regulate all genetically modified material, as a horizontal directive."
"We have done the same with respect to forest and plant material."
"However, the fact that directive 90/220 is still undergoing the conciliation procedure should not stop us from proceeding in taking exactly the same approach with vines as we have done with forest and plant material."
"All the amendments that are currently being introduced with regard to directive 90/220, under the conciliation procedure, will be applicable to vines at a later date."
"There is no genetically modified vine propagating material available on the market as yet; however, research is ongoing."
"The question as to whether genetically modified vines will be granted a permit at some future date, or whether this idea will be rejected by the wine producers and the wine trade, does not form part of today' s discussion of the directive."
"I am sure we will have the opportunity to discuss these matters at length on another occasion."
"The directive under discussion today guarantees that traditional vine varieties, which are characteristic of wine growing in the different regions, are to be maintained and protected."
"Traditional wine growing is our strength in the European Union, and so it deserves our support."
"I would therefore urge the House to assent to the report as it stands, and hope that this will enable the European internal market to be brought into play for vine propagating material."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the reason we wished to defer this report was that we wanted to ensure consistency in the work of the European Parliament as it influenced the course of European policy."
"The revision of GMO Directive No 90/220 is at the conciliation stage right now."
"It would be completely inconsistent not to wait until the end of this procedure before including references to GMOs in our directives and regulations."
"That is why, at the proposal of the draftsman of the opinion, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has unanimously voted to do away with all the references to GMOs in this report."
"And please do not tell us that we are barking up the wrong tree, and that this revision does not have any implications concerning GMOs, since a regulation of this type already exists for forestry."
"At the moment, we consume wine, but we do not yet feed on the wood of our forests."
"Contrary to what the executive committee and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development would have us believe, this revision slyly but irremediably introduces genetically modified vines."
"This is a clear indication that the European Parliament would, indirectly, give the green light to GMO experiments in the field of vine propagation or improvement."
"Why the rush?"
"It is not at the request of the winegrowers or wine merchants or vineyard owners."
"On 5 July, some of these issued the Beaune declaration, expressing their great concern at the introduction of GMOs into their sector."
"We have received a reply from the confederation of producers of registered designation of origin (AOC) wine, saying, ""We support the position of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, as it offers the guarantee that European regulations are not going to permit the implementation of procedures to authorise the sale of genetically modified wine-growing materials which may be harmful to the brand image of wine growing."""
"Just who is going to benefit from this amended regulation which includes GMOs?"
"The question - and the answer, of course - will have to come from the Commission, who must also tell us whether it is intending to continue to pave the way for us to end up with GMOs on our plates, and now in our glasses too."
"This is something that they are achieving, unfortunately, with the assistance of the French Presidency, in a way that is completely out of step with the way European consumers feel."
"The previous directive proved to be relevant and effective in enabling, firstly, products to be standardised and the internal Community trade in vine cuttings and plants to develop substantially in recent years."
"It now needs to be revised to take into account developments in phytosanitary regulations and scientific and technical progress, particularly in the field of in vitro propagation."
"The draft text presented by the European Commission, as amended by the European Parliament Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, proposes some interesting advances. I shall cite the most significant here."
"The current draft rules out any possibility of any of the Fifteen Member States enjoying a unilateral exemption from the terms of the directive."
"This provision, which was not laid down in the initial version of the directive, is preferable as it makes it possible to avoid barriers to trade and to facilitate the movement of propagation material within the European Union."
"The material produced by in vitro herbaceous cutting propagation techniques, which by now have been sufficiently mastered were, of course, not covered by the 1968 directive."
"The new text introduces provisions recognising special characteristics."
"While research into a propagation material that is more efficient in health terms is of benefit to the user, it is important that this approach does not create a barrier to trade."
"The draft amendment seeking to guarantee freedom to market throughout the European Union material that complies with the minimum requirements of the directive should be approved unreservedly."
"Finally, we must ensure that the new provisions on genetically modified varieties are in every respect compliant and compatible with existing texts, or texts in preparation, in this field."
"Should this regulatory mechanism need to be expanded or clarified, it would be preferable to delete the provisions relating to this point from the draft directive."
"We have reason to believe that the new or updated terms of the proposed directive offer a satisfactory response to the expectations of workers in the vine nursery and wine-growing sector and that they should contribute towards improving the quality of the proposed material and make it easier for the competent authorities to supervise the movement of vine cuttings and plants carried out by the institutions responsible for this."
"The regulations proposed by the directive, moreover, favour the production of diversified plant material by offering the best health guarantees, which is a basic requirement, in order to effectively support the restructuring of the Community vineyard sector, which is a key point in the new COM in wine-growing."
"Mr President, the need for a new directive revising the conditions for the marketing on Community territory of material for the vegetative propagation of the vine has become urgent."
"The base legislation in force dates from 1968, a long way back, and a great deal of progress had been made in this sector since then: new materials have been tried out, often using natural methods and sometimes genetic modification."
"Hence the urgent need for a modern regulation which recognises these new possibilities available to European vine growers and, at the same time, protects traditional varieties of vine."
"It is my opinion that the Klass report should be adopted, particularly in view of the additional guarantees provided by amendments such as that tabled by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development which clarifies the reference to directive 90/220, in the form in which it is going to be amended in respect of GMOs."
"Another amendment, tabled by Mr Garot and myself, refers once again to the precautionary principle and provides for the protection of those traditional forms of vine which would otherwise be overtaken by new experimental varieties."
"I also feel that, abiding by this precautionary principle, referring to the possibility of genetic modification, means, for example, cutting down on the intensive use of phytosanitary treatments."
"The amendments tabled by Mrs Auroi and the Chairman of our Committee on Agriculture and Rural Developmen, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf as a further guarantee precisely of experimental varieties, are precautionary."
"From this point of view, I therefore consider that Mrs Klass' report follows the right lines in a sector which is in urgent need of new legislation, a key, strategic sector for agriculture and the European wine industry."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what is the point of turning a technical report into a potential oenological disaster."
"The determination to amend the directive on the marketing of material for the vegetative propagation of the vine may look like a laudable initiative to update a rather technical text, which is 32 years old."
"Personally, I find the ' 68 vintage rather a fine one, but apparently the Commission has decided to modernise."
"The very first lines of the Klass report clearly stress the value, not just the economic value but also the cultural value, of grape and wine production."
"Everything, then, could be for the best in the best of all possible European wine-growing worlds."
"Well, as it turns out, that is not the case."
"The Commission has taken the opportunity of updating matters to open a Pandora' s box, even though this was something that not one European producer was looking for."
"While the Commission appears to be overcome with combined GMO and cloning fever, Mrs Klass goes further and goes into convulsions, compounding the GMO issue with all the genotypes she sees all around her."
"It must be said loud and clear, there was absolutely no need to stuff the articles of this directive with references to directive 90/220, which is currently being revised, unless the intention was to promote genetic manipulation in vines at all costs."
"And please do not tell me that this was done to anticipate this directive' s being revised or because GM vines do not exist except in laboratory experiments!"
"Commissioner, Mrs Klass, listen to the opinions of the experts from the Institut national des appellations d'origine, the French National Appellations Institute."
"The INAO has, on the basis of the information currently available, issued a blanket ban on the use of GMOs in any area whatsoever, which would therefore include, and I quote, genetically modified wine varieties and rootstocks."
"Would you care to read the Beaune declaration presented by the winegrowers of the Burgundy region?"
"Do you wish to show the industry that Europe is working for better quality and respects the precautionary principle?"
"Commissioner, withdraw the recitals and the articles incorporating GMOs and cloning into this draft."
"Mrs Klass, take out your amendments and let the relationship between GMOs and genotypes be clarified by the scientists."
"There is a second problem area, Mrs Klass."
"You restrict the practice of grafting to herbaceous cuttings alone."
"In so doing, you protect what goes on in your own region, but rule out the grafting of hardwood cuttings in the winter period, even though this is the grafting technique that is the most widely used in Europe."
"This amendment should, therefore, be withdrawn."
"In conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, in order to respect the precautionary principle in both spirit and letter, should the articles and amendments which I have just mentioned not be withdrawn, then, as the wine growers themselves demand, we would have to fall in with the opinion of Marianne Isler Béguin, and the Committee on the Environment, and vote against them."
"Mr President, rapporteur, I would like to congratulate you on your report."
"There has been some turmoil lately, and I believe the genetically modified organisms will, of course, be inclined to dispute the purport of this directive."
"But in all fairness, it has to be said that no one is forced to use genetically modified material."
"It has had no place in viticulture so far."
"I am fundamentally opposed to genetically modified organisms and am a wine lover, and I would very much like to stick with the wine we have been producing to date."
"I therefore welcome the fact that we have placed additional emphasis on traditional, regional types of wine."
"When it comes to genetically modified material, I take the view that the reference made in this report to directive 90/220 secures legal protection."
"Any prospective changes, will, and must, be made to this end."
"In addition, Mrs Klass, it is, however, important to stress the political dimension as well as the legal aspect, particularly where viticulture is concerned, and - providing we manage to do so - to keep viticulture free of genetically modified material if at all possible."
"I hope that the wine growers will have no truck with GMOs, for their own sake, because we know that consumers strongly disapprove."
"I hope this will inspire us to rule out the possibility of having genetically modified vines."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the rapporteur, Mrs Klass, for their extremely positive reception of the Commission' s proposal."
"The Commission appreciates the wide consensus on its proposal."
"Its aim is to strengthen the internal market in the sector in question, to update the legislation in the light of technical and scientific progress which has taken place since it was last updated and to ensure that authorisation for genetically modified varieties can only be granted if the appropriate steps have been taken to avoid endangering human health or the environment."
"With regard to the third point, in its current form, the proposal contains references both to the development of a specific procedure for assessing the risk to the environment, which is similar to the procedure laid down by directive 90/220 in terms of the risks to man and the environment, and to the criteria and assessment principles laid down in Regulation 258/97 on novel foods and novel food ingredients."
"The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has tabled 26 amendments."
"The Commission is able to accept the majority of them, that is 24 out of 26 amendments, as they are currently worded or with minor changes relating to the way they are worded or presented."
"For example, the proposal to recognise the specific characteristics of the genotype, referred to in Amendments Nos 4, 12, 15, 16 and 20, will be incorporated by changing the wording of the text."
"The genetic diversity of the varieties with genotypes which are suitable for specific local environments will be taken into consideration in discussions on the appropriateness of continuing the possibility of marketing material for propagating these varieties, on the basis of Article 3, paragraph 5, point A of the directive."
"With reference to the other two amendments, Amendments Nos 2 and 18, we can only partially accept them for the reason that certain aspects are unjustifiably aggressive towards other countries - Amendment 2 - or because the reference to the Commission' s obligation to provide greater resources should a common catalogue of varieties be compiled - Amendment No 18 - is superfluous."
"Lastly, we can accept Amendment No 27, tabled by both Mr Lavarra and Mr Garot."
"I am happy to be able to inform you that we can also accept Amendments Nos 35 to 40, tabled by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, which are intended to reinforce the transposal of the safety and management requirements according to directive 90/220."
"However, we cannot accept Amendments Nos 28 to 34 tabled by Mrs Isler-Béguin and others, for they would involve revoking the entire part of the directive which contains references to the GMO varieties and the related risk assessment."
"Moreover, these amendments have already been discussed but not accepted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"We cannot accept Amendment No 41, tabled by Mrs Schierhuber, either, for it concerns an excessively detailed definition in the light of the amendments proposed by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"If we were to accept this amendment, we would be running the risk of creating artificial barriers to trade, which would be contrary to the principle aim of the proposal for a directive which is to consolidate the internal market."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your attention and, once again, thank you to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"Mr President, if you permit, I should like to ask the Commissioner to give an opinion on the amendment put forward by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, Amendment No 1."
"The response is affirmative, Mr President."
"The amendment has been accepted."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.30 p.m."
"(The sitting was closed at 9.17 p.m.)"
"Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting"
"The Minutes of the previous sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Madam President, I see from Item 13 of the Minutes, entitled 'Communication of the announcement of the removal of Mr Le Pen from office' , that you presumed to speak on behalf of Parliament, and that the chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs presumed to speak on behalf of that committee."
"I would simply like to point out that Parliament was not in itself called upon to give an opinion."
"As for Mrs Palacio' s interpretation of events, I have a great deal of respect for the chairman on a personal level but none at all for her interpretation, which derives from a prior decision by the Committee made when it chose to postpone ruling on this issue."
"While the Council of State was in the process of examining the appeal lodged by Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen, the committee in no way refrained from discussing the consequences of this appeal, nor even from assessing the decision taken."
"This situation seems to me all the more serious since while French law expressly stipulates that a ruling from the Council of State concerning a Member of the European Parliament must be given in plenary session, it was only pronounced in this case by two sub-sections, which constitutes a serious breach of Mr Le Pen' s rights."
"As a result, I consider that Article 7(4) of our Rules of Procedure has not been respected."
"Mr Gollnisch, I can assure you that procedures have been respected absolutely, in both the spirit and the letter of Article 12(2) of the Act of 20 September 1976."
"The only issue open to debate is whether or not I should have taken note of the decree terminating Mr Le Pen' s mandate as soon as the French government notified me of it."
"As you know, the Committee on Legal Affairs advised me to wait for the decision from the Council of State, which I did."
"However, everything was done exactly by the book, and in conformity with the Rules of Procedure."
"Madam President, the Minutes state that I spoke on the situation in Spain."
"I spoke on the repression in Spain and the situation in the Basque country, which is totally different."
"I would not speak about ETA terrorist acts and say I am speaking about the situation in Spain."
"This has not been fairly reported in the Minutes."
"I would say that I spoke on the situation in the Basque country and about the Spanish Government' s repression."
"You can check it in the verbatim report of proceedings."
"Madam President, I speak with regard to Item 14 of the Minutes on the waiver of Mr Pacheco Pereira' s parliamentary immunity."
"We opposed this waiver, Madam President, which answers the question that you were just asking, in the name - to quote from Paragraph D of Mr MacCormick' s report - in the name of the ""independent nature of European parliamentary immunity compared with national parliamentary immunity"" ."
"I would remind you that the Greek word for such independence would be 'auto nomoi' , which means 'having its own laws' , and as the rapporteur says ""its own rules"" ."
"It follows that, if the Parliament has its own rules concerning the waiver of parliamentary immunity and if its discretion is not limited when the national authority requires that immunity be waived, then it is even more true that, this being so much more minor an issue, it also has its own rules when it is required to terminate a Member of Parliament' s mandate. It has its own laws, its 'autonomy' , it has discretionary powers and its discretion is not limited."
"Yesterday, Madam President, you had discretionary powers, as did Parliament, and there were no limits on this discretionary power."
"That was the legal error on your part, Madam President."
"Mr Martinez, you have jumped the gun on the vote on the report concerning Mr Pacheco Pereira."
"I would remind you that the vote is to take place at 12.30."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Madam President, on a point of order."
"Following the Danish referendum will you now write to the Danish Prime Minister to congratulate the Danish people on having struck an historic blow for freedom, democracy and the nation state?"
"The euro was meant to symbolise the strength and unity of Europe ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"This is not a point of order, Mr Helmer."
"At least in this case, that is very clear."
"Informal European Council in Biarritz (13/14 October 2000)"
"The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the Informal European Council in Biarritz, held on 13 and 14 October 2000."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is my pleasure to return to this House - as the French Presidency undertook to do on 3 October - to present the results of the Informal European Council in Biarritz to which, Madam President, you, as ever, made a highly valued contribution."
"As I have mentioned previously, most of the time available was taken up with the institutional reforms currently being examined at the Intergovernmental Conference, which I think was as it should be, and I will therefore begin with them."
"As to the IGC, I believe that work at ministerial level had already progressed as far as it could before Biarritz, and this Informal Council thus came at the just the right time to consolidate certain advances and to lay down guidelines for the final phase of the work, on which we have now embarked."
"At Biarritz we established, first of all, and I believe that this is fundamental, a general consensus on the need to bring about an ambitious treaty at Nice."
"I have christened this the 'Biarritz spirit' ."
"Next, tangible progress was made on qualified majority voting and closer cooperation. Lastly, there came what I will call the opening up of a substantive debate at the highest level on the two most sensitive issues: the re-weighting of votes and the Commission, which has enabled us to truly enter into discussions on these two tricky issues."
"Let me expand on the issue of qualified majority voting."
"A fairly broad consensus was reached on over half of the items under discussion, while ways of arriving at potential solutions to sensitive issues were also outlined."
"Thus, while certain deep-seated reservations persist concerning taxation, some form of progress will still be possible thanks to the technical adjustments that the Presidency is to look into with the help of the Commission."
"We have established that there is a clear desire to open up to cooperation in the area of combating tax fraud, and this is no small thing."
"I feel that we should also be able to make headway in the field of social affairs, on the proviso that we do not tamper with the principles that underpin the various national social security systems, which gives us some room for manoeuvre."
"Progress will also be possible in the field of external trade policy, but only when we find a way of dealing with the most sensitive issues on a specific basis and also avert a backdoor extension of Community competences."
"In the field of justice and home affairs, I am optimistic that a solution will be found concerning judicial cooperation in civil cases."
"On the other hand, issues relating to asylum, visas and immigration are still proving much more sensitive."
"Lastly, certain other problems remain, not least in the field of non-discrimination and the environment."
"Significant progress has thus been made even if certain advances still have to be consolidated."
"Concerning closer cooperation, all the Member States now agree on the value of this and acknowledge the need to inject flexibility into the arrangements for putting it into practice."
"Equally, they are all in agreement that these arrangements must remain open and accessible, that there is no question of moving towards a two-speed Europe, that the institutional framework of the Union must be respected and thus, in particular, the role of the Commission and that of the European Parliament, and, lastly, that there is a need to preserve the Community acquis, which is to say the internal market and cohesion policies involving closer cooperation."
"Finally, in the field of foreign, security and defence policy, I believe that specially tailored measures must be pinpointed in order to cater for the specific nature of the issues involved."
"Concerning the Commission and the re-weighting of votes, two issues which are closely interrelated and politically charged, the discussions revealed a consensus on the need to make the Commission stronger and more effective. Having said that, I must admit that not a great deal was actually said, because there remains a very marked rift over how this is to be achieved."
"Some Member States advocate setting a definitive ceiling on the number of commissioners, in tandem with a rotation of posts among the Member States on an equal footing, while others champion a system of one Commissioner per Member State, without ruling out the possibility of a radical restructuring of the college."
"Both options remain on the table, and must be assessed in the light of their potential for ensuring that the common interests of the Community are safeguarded."
"Concerning the weighting of votes, the two well-known systems also remain on the table: a simple re-weighting, in favour of which a narrow, very narrow majority is emerging, or a double majority system, but with alternative options, a double simple or double re-weighted majority, in other words a type of 'demographic safety net' ."
"It is clear that we will only be able to take a decision on these issues after negotiations have come to a close; nevertheless, discussions based on detailed proposals must continue in order to prepare for the final decision at Nice."
"Work will now continue in a very intensive manner up to Nice, on the basis of the informal guidelines adopted by this European Council."
"We thus have a little under fifty days left."
"The preparatory group therefore met yesterday to work on qualified majority voting and on closer cooperation, on very concrete bases."
"It also went into greater detail in its work on amending Article 7 of the Treaty in accordance with the positive guidelines laid down at Biarritz."
"The preparatory group is to play a full role up until 19 November, the date of the next ministerial level meeting."
"We will therefore hold a total of six ministerial-level working sessions between now and Nice. Four of these will be mini-sessions and two will take the form of a conclave, and we expect to turn all these occasions to good account in order to keep alive the Biarritz spirit."
"Finally, a word on a related subject, but one which I know to be of fundamental importance for the European Parliament: the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"The matter of its incorporation into the Treaties was quite rightly not dealt with at Biarritz."
"It is nevertheless clear that the majority of Member States are not yet prepared to do this, and it is my belief - this is not my wish, but simply my impression - that it will only be possible to formally raise this issue further down the line."
"I will now turn to international issues, which were also very much to the fore at Biarritz."
"You will all be aware of the events that were going on at the time this Summit was held with, on the one hand, the situation in the Middle East, and on the other the political changes in Serbia, which found expression in the visit to Biarritz by the new President of Serbia, Mr Kostunica."
"I will not dwell on the events in the Middle East."
"I will simply point out that, right from the outset, the European Union has called on both sides to strive to put an end to the violence, to reopen dialogue and safeguard what had been achieved at Camp David, and the Biarritz European Council called both sides to a summit meeting."
"The European Union continued to make its voice heard, the voice of reason and conciliation, at Sharm-el-Sheikh, where it was represented for the first time by Mr Solana, the High Representative for the CFSP - a fact that I would emphasise as I do not subscribe to the opinion that Europe is playing a diminished role in the Middle East, but actually one that is becoming gradually more important again."
"Unfortunately, it has proved impossible since Sharm-el-Sheikh to implement the agreement worked out there, and the tensions on both sides remain considerable, to say the least, with the European Union therefore monitoring the situation with the greatest of vigilance."
"We must recapture the spirit that reigned in the Oslo Agreements, and this is the ambition of this Presidency, all the Member States, the High Representative, and the Commission and Parliament."
"The second event that stood out at Biarritz, for the right reasons this time, was the return of democracy to Serbia and, more than this, the repercussions of the political changes in Belgrade on relations between that country and the European Union. I am sure that the events leading up to the investiture of Vojislav Kostunica will still be fresh in your minds."
"This investiture and these events have seen a completely new political order being installed in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, opening the way to the democratisation of the country and, let us hope, a more widespread reconciliation in the Balkans."
"The European Union has honoured its commitments and responded to this political turnaround at the meeting of the General Affairs Council on 9 October, at which it decided to lift the sanctions, including the oil and air embargoes, imposed on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1998, with the exception of course of sanctions directly aimed at Mr Milosevic and his entourage."
"President Kostunica therefore accepted the invitation from the Presidency to go to Biarritz and have lunch with Heads of State and Government."
"At the joint press conference he held alongside the French Presidency, Mr Kostunica expressed his heartfelt joy at being welcomed into the European family, for this is exactly what is happening."
"The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia will, of course, very soon benefit from the instruments that have been set in place by the Union to cover the entire Balkan region, beginning with the CARDS programme and also the activities of the European Agency for Reconstruction."
"Furthermore, the General Affairs Council confirmed the Union' s intention to contribute to re-establishing navigation on the Danube and to actively participate in modernising infrastructures in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia within a regional context."
"Moreover, without prejudice to a needs assessment and the coordination of economic and financial assistance to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which are to be the joint responsibility of the European Commission and the World Bank, the Biarritz European Council decided to grant the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia initial emergency humanitarian aid totalling EUR 200 million."
"Lastly, and I will end here - this is without doubt the most important decision in the medium and long term - the Union has decided to provide this country with a political prospect by proposing that it conclude a stabilisation and association agreement along the lines of those currently being negotiated with the other countries in the same region."
"It was precisely with this in mind that President Kostunica was invited, as you will be aware, to take part in the summit meeting between the European Union and the countries of the western Balkans, which is to be held in Zagreb, at the instigation of the President of the French Republic, on 24 November."
"These are the issues that can be singled out concerning the developments and situation in Serbia and their repercussions for the Union."
"I feel that the important thing was for the Union to very swiftly communicate to this country not only a tangible message of encouragement but also, and I would stress this point, the political prospect of its full and comprehensive integration into the European family."
"I believe that this message has been clearly given."
"We can only hope that the process of democratisation is able to continue under optimum conditions."
"These, in a nutshell, were the results of the Biarritz European Council which was, and I say this in all sincerity because I believe it to be true, highly productive and therefore of great value to the step forward that the Union is of course still to complete."
"Madam President, I would now, in turn, like to give the Commission' s impressions following the Biarritz European Council, to which you, Madam President, made an active contribution, along with another eminent member of this House, Mrs Méndez de Vigo, who presented the results of work on the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"The President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Moscovici, has spoken of something that he has dubbed the 'Biarritz spirit' ."
"One might talk of the Biarritz spirit or frame of mind, and also the climate at Biarritz."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I can truly say that the climate in which discussions took place genuinely matched the climatic conditions that prevailed in Biarritz for the two days we were there."
"The weather was cloudy and windy but it was, all things considered, an invigorating climate and, I felt, just the type of dynamic climate that we needed at that stage of the discussions, in which I myself noticed many stumbling blocks, far more stumbling blocks than can always be explained away by the delicacy of the issues."
"We needed this invigorating climate, as Mr Moscovici has said, and I too sensed among the Heads of State and of Government a very solemn air of collective and historic responsibility at this historic juncture for European integration."
"There seemed to be a genuine sense of purpose and, in any event, the will to achieve real reform at Nice."
"Much has been said, in the press and elsewhere, of the rift between larger States and smaller States, or less populous countries."
"These divergences of opinion are a fact."
"Everyone is conscious of them, but there is none of the hostility which is sometimes described."
"In this connection, I would prefer to talk of a moment of truth in the debate, rather than a moment of crisis."
"Above all, I would like to say, as someone who has, from the start and on a daily basis, been involved in these discussions as one of the workmen, alongside your representatives Mr Brok and Professor Tsatsos, that this rift is not the only one that might exist between large and small States."
"It is not even, it would seem to me, the central issue in these discussions if one recalls, and this is something that must be remembered and recalled, that ever since the process of European integration began, there has never been a case, either in the Council or within the Commission, of large countries forming a coalition against small countries, or of small States forming a coalition against large countries."
"This runs counter to the spirit of the Community."
"As regards my feelings on this matter, I am aware of and understand the sensitivity of the issues that the Minister has described, issues which directly relate to the position, the role, and the influence of each country."
"I perceived this sensitivity during the visits I made to each of the Member States, and also last week in Athens, with regard both to the Commission, with each country concerned at the position that would be assigned to it, and to the voting system, with each country concerned at the number of votes it is to have in the Council."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we must find a solution to these two issues, which will in fact only be resolved when negotiations are complete, and on which we must reach total agreement if that agreement is to mean anything at all."
"With regard to the Commission, a solution must be found that preserves its effectiveness, its credibility, and if possible its collegiate nature."
"With regard to the voting system, we must find a solution which respects - as both the Commission and the European Parliament have proposed - the twofold legitimacy of, on the one hand, the Member States and, on the other, the peoples of Europe."
"But if I had to tell you spontaneously and very sincerely how I felt, I would say this: regardless of the sensitivity of these issues - the composition of the Commission and the voting system - they cannot be used as criteria for assessing whether Nice is a success or a failure."
"The success or failure of the Nice Council will depend on the ability of the Heads of State and Government, and on the ability of Parliament and the Commission, as parties to the negotiations, to preserve or consolidate the Community model."
"In saying this, ladies and gentlemen, I have in mind a number of points that are still under discussion."
"Whether the Community system is preserved or weakened will depend on the scope of qualified majority voting and thus of codecision being extended to cover real issues."
"That is my first point."
"The preservation or strengthening of the Community model will be assessed on the basis of whether we have been able to resist the temptation felt by some to call into question the exclusivity of the Commission' s powers to initiate legislation."
"I am referring here to Article 250, for which some would like to introduce qualified majority voting."
"The preservation and consolidation of the Community system will be assessed on the basis of whether the Commission has been reserved a fitting role in closer cooperation, and not only as concerns the first pillar."
"The consolidation of the Community system will be assessed on the basis of whether the role of agencies has been allowed to develop to the detriment of the regulatory authority that belongs to the Commission."
"That, ladies and gentlemen, from my viewpoint as someone who, let me repeat in all modesty, is one of the humble workmen in these discussions, is what I say and think is the way to gauge whether or not genuine reform has been achieved in Nice."
"I would like to follow what the Minister has said by quickly touching on some of the points that I have just mentioned."
"Qualified majority voting: I would stress that the issue is not really about how many fields could be changed from unanimity to qualified majority voting."
"The real issue is the status of these fields, and the great merit of the Biarritz Summit will have been that of defining the most problematic areas and encouraging us, or authorising us, to find technical solutions for taxation issues, or in any case for the small section of taxation policy, or of social protection, which relates directly to the internal market."
"There is a need to reassure those who are worried that under no circumstances will the sovereignty of the Member States in taxation matters be challenged, and to also tell those who have worries that the idea is not to merge social protection systems, especially from the bottom up, but simply to see to it that the common market and the single market run smoothly within an enlarged Europe."
"Trade policy, asylum and immigration, cohesion policy, environmental policy: in each of these fields several approaches to solutions have been sounded out and, as early as yesterday morning, the group of representatives was back at work."
"Following on from what Mr Moscovici has said, I would like to state that the Commission is no mere bystander in this work."
"It is playing its part and is ready and willing, alongside the Presidency, to seek out the fairest solutions."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we must quite simply see to it that from now on we keep alive the spirit and climate of Biarritz as regards these qualified majority voting issues."
"Naturally, as regards all these areas, where the transition to qualified majority voting is involved, I would like to reiterate our intention to extend codecision where legislative matters are concerned."
"As Mr Moscovici has said, genuine progress has also been made concerning closer cooperation."
"It is interesting to note that many delegations feel that we have to turn this progress on closer cooperation to good account, and this is along the lines of what I was saying earlier, in order to strengthen the role of the Community institutions - the role of the Commission, but also that of Parliament."
"I feel that the fundamental demands made by Parliament and the Commission will be met or honoured, and that on this point we will manage to secure the abolition of recourse to the European Council, which is to say the right of veto, along with a lowering of the quorum to one third, or eight, of the Member States in Community matters."
"It was made eminently clear at Biarritz that closer cooperation would constitute an additional force for integration and not an instrument of exclusion."
"I also feel that an agreement could be reached on another theme, on Article 7, taking as a basis or as pointers the proposals that the Commission itself made to provide for vigorous Community dialogue on legal matters, and Community and political control of crises situations in which we might find ourselves due to the stance that one government or another adopts with regard to our common values."
"Mr Moscovici has spoken of the Charter."
"In drafting this instrument, work of high quality has been carried out in an original and intelligent manner."
"I feel that it will go on to be proclaimed at Nice, and this already marks a great step forward."
"We cannot stop there and at Nice we will need to envisage ways of addressing the place that this Charter is to have within the Treaties."
"Let us not wait until after Nice to consider the post-Nice scenario regarding a number of issues of a constitutional nature: that of the role of the Charter, and thus of the formal consolidation of citizens' rights, that of the simplification of the Treaties, on which we have worked with the Institute of Florence, that of the clarification or focussing of competences, so that we can finally say who is doing what within the European Union, what the Union is or is not doing, or what it should stop doing."
"These are issues that we do not have time to deal with thoroughly prior to Nice, but they must be raised and would perhaps merit in-depth attention after Nice."
"Ladies and gentlemen, there are still a great many thorny issues in these complex negotiations which can only be resolved by universal agreement. I would like to confirm that the Biarritz spirit or the Biarritz climate would seem to me to have been primarily one of determination."
"We are still some way off an agreement, but I would like, as regards the determined support the Commission offers you, to give a clear reminder, if there could be any doubts, concerns or questions surrounding this, that the Commission will strive to the very last minute - you can count on me - to set itself very ambitious targets for the Treaty of Nice in these negotiations, so that we will not simply be concluding the negotiations at Nice, but first and foremost ensuring their success."
"Madam President, I will quickly mention some other issues, if I may, to confirm or expand upon what the Presidency has said."
"First, Serbia."
"Everyone here has been deeply moved and heartened by the move to democracy in Serbia - firstly by the will of the people of Serbia and by the election of President Kostunica as President of the Yugoslav Federation."
"This is what has caused the European Union to radically alter its policy in respect of Serbia."
"I must say that President Kostunica' s visit to Biarritz was an important and moving event which marked the return of Serbia to the European fold."
"In more practical terms, we announced that emergency aid totalling EUR 200 million had been allocated to Serbia, and the Commission is soon to present a package of emergency measures that will cater for the country' s priority needs as winter approaches."
"Besides the emergency aid, there can be no doubt that Serbia will also need, as Mr Moscovici has indicated, more comprehensive support, which will be implemented in association with the World Bank and the EIB among others."
"The key thing, here as elsewhere, I feel, is to consolidate democracy."
"The President-in-Office of the Council mentioned about the Middle East."
"I will not dwell on this issue except to remind you that the European Council adopted a declaration that exerted pressure on both sides in the conflict to actually meet at Sharm-el-Sheikh."
"This meeting did indeed take place."
"We are aware of what was achieved there and we too feel that it was important that Javier Solana, the European Union' s High Representative, should play an active part in these talks."
"I would like to conclude by mentioning two issues that are of concern to this House and which have spurred the Commission to take action - crude oil and maritime safety. These issues were also dealt with at Biarritz."
"The Heads of State and Government welcomed the proposal from the Commission, presented by Loyola de Palacio, for a global strategy on oil reserves and oil prices."
"The President of the Commission, Romano Prodi, took the opportunity to emphasise, above and beyond the content of this Communication, the vital importance of Russia to this debate, and suggested that we discuss this issue thoroughly at the forthcoming summit meeting between the European Union and Russia in Paris on 30 October."
"Lastly, on the subject of maritime safety and the lessons to be learned from the Erika disaster, a few months ago the European Council ratified the guidelines we had proposed, and which were presented to you, on Community strategy in the field of maritime safety."
"As you know, these centre around three basic objectives: stepping up inspections of ships in port, stringent monitoring of classification societies and implementing a timetable throughout the Union for replacing single-hulled oil tankers."
"The French Presidency is determined to carry through the necessary reforms in this field before the year is out and, on the basis of the proposals from the Commission, to inject fresh impetus into this area at the Nice European Council."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the moment of truth has arrived."
"We have to make decisions in Nice to avoid endangering enlargement, which is our main priority."
"The President-in-Office of the Council has spoken of the spirit of Nice."
"We must not kill the spirit of Nice with boredom, and we therefore have an essential priority in the remaining 50 days: to bring negotiations to a political level."
"It would be better if this were done publicly as in the case of the Convention, but in any event, we cannot once again restructure the Intergovernmental Conference, which has been treading water for nine months without making any progress at all."
"With regard to the report by the President-in-Office of the Council, Parliament has no essential criticisms."
"We can be nice for once."
"There is one basic issue, however, that I would like the President-in-Office of the Council to clarify."
"The Commissioner has talked about qualified majorities and codecision."
"The President-in-Office of the Council has not."
"Our understanding is that the relationship is automatic: anything voted upon by qualified majority in the Council must immediately also be subject to codecision with Parliament."
"I would be grateful if the President-in-Office of the Council could clarify this point."
"Secondly, I would also ask him to clarify for the Assembly whether the distribution of seats in Parliament is currently a topic for debate at the Intergovernmental Conference, because here we are doing nothing but criticise the Council - which sometimes gives us ample cause for criticism - but we must not neglect our own responsibilities."
"I have already publicly condemned, here in this Chamber, our inability to distribute the small increase to 700 seats."
"I think we can also set an example, as we have done in the past, by distributing between large and small countries."
"I also think that we are not currently fulfilling our responsibilities if we are not capable of solving this problem."
"I am particularly addressing the groups that are blocking this decision in Parliament, starting with the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"Then there is the matter of the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"If we all agree that the Charter is a very important document, which we all support and which, furthermore, is a symbol of collective identity, I cannot understand what we are going to do with the Charter."
"Are we going to keep it in a box?"
"Are we going to save it for a rainy day?"
"In my opinion, it should be the frontispiece of a future Constitution, but at the moment, what we could do and what could easily be achieved in Nice, is to include the Charter in the Treaty by means of an extremely simple link: Article 6(2) of the Treaty on European Union."
"I would ask the Commission and the Council to make a statement on this matter."
"This is an important topic for current and future Member States."
"In this respect I would also like to address my colleagues in the European People' s Party - and I would ask Mr Poettering to listen to me - because what we advocate in this Assembly, we should also advocate outside it."
"It is also absolutely unacceptable that Mr Berlusconi' s party in the Italian Parliament voted against this Charter and that a Member of this Assembly used coarse, pre or post-fascist language in relation to the Charter."
"We must be coherent and uphold the Charter here and in our own national parliaments."
"We must do so because these values are essential for everyone."
"In this respect, I would also ask that a clear announcement be made regarding the proposal we are making, as we believe it makes political sense."
"In conclusion, Madam President, two final comments regarding fundamental matters of external policy."
"On the one hand, the presence of President Kostunica was an historic event."
"The important thing is that we help the Balkans to achieve stability, not instability."
"To this end, I believe that we should apply the same standards to all."
"We cannot ask Croatia to cooperate with the International Court and not demand the same of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia."
"We must find money - and here the Council has responsibilities - to assert our community of values and create a balanced, stabilising policy in the Balkans."
"With regard to the Middle East, it is clear that one of the causes of the situation - not the only cause, as this matter is far more complex - is that the European Union in the past was vetoed as a potential mediator."
"The step that has been taken should be applauded, although it was in a situation in which responsibilities had to be shared."
"I believe that we must honour our commitment in one of the most tragic situations we are experiencing today."
"Madam President, firstly I praise the European Council for accepting the draft Charter as definitive."
"From what we know of the performance of the Prime Ministers and Presidents at Biarritz on the trickiest questions of Treaty reform, the Charter will probably become the greatest trophy at Nice."
"So why is the French Presidency trying to suppress the question of the installation of the Charter within the Treaty?"
"President Chirac, with his usual capacity for surprise, said in his press statement that the Charter' s legal status would be a question for the Swedish Presidency."
"What does that mean?"
"What on earth is Sweden supposed to achieve that France cannot?"
"Surely it is for the European Council at Nice to consider whether the Charter should be inserted inside the Treaty."
"That is what the IGC is for."
"I would urge the French Presidency quickly to reassess its position on that central point."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the enlargement of the Union is a means of increasing stability and safety in Europe and of promoting tolerance and democracy."
"However, it is just as vital that there is reform of the Union' s institutions so as to ensure that the stability of the Union itself does not go under in a climate of indecisiveness on the one hand and public indifference and repugnance on the other."
"This would require majority decisions in the Council to become the rule, and likewise, codecision for Parliament, in agricultural matters, for example."
"I welcome the declaration of fundamental rights, but it has to be improved in order to better accommodate the citizens' expectations, and it has to form part of a European constitutional process."
"It must be integrated in the Treaty."
"The development of a credible and democratic Europe requires more involvement from the citizens, the regions, the small and large Member States, more decisiveness on the part of the Commission and a reinforcement of the role of Parliament, but especially the will of the Commission to play its role on behalf of the Union, and this is what we failed to do in the Middle East, for example."
"Peace must be achieved for the sake of those killed, especially on the Palestinian side and, in order to recover the spirit of Oslo, we must go back to basics."
"Israel is entitled to peace and safety but the Palestinians, who had to give up a large part of their land for this, are entitled to their own state, as enshrined in UN resolutions 242 and 338."
"The election of Mr Kostunica is without a doubt a sign of hope to all democrats, but at the same time, the issues of future stability push themselves to the fore in Kosovo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, for peace in the Balkans is fragile and we will need, with immediate effect, to have the means at our disposal to secure reconstruction and future stability in a democratic process."
"Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, while progress has been made on closer cooperation and the extension of qualified majority voting, deep-seated disagreement persists, as you yourself have underlined, concerning the composition of the Commission and the weighting of votes in Council."
"It is indeed a fact that there are still major differences of opinion between larger countries and the smaller countries, which fear the stronger countries setting up a type of cabinet."
"So, in speaking of the Biarritz spirit, I believe that in essence Biarritz reflects the complexity of the challenges facing the Union."
"I view it as expressing, along the line of other summits, even if it was an informal one, the contradictions that exist between social requirements and citizens' demands, the expectations of the peoples of Europe, and the free-market rationale that continues to hold sway in the European Union."
"There is a pressing need to work out a new design for an enlargement that unites rather than divides, that involves the candidate countries in the work of the Intergovernmental Conference and pays far greater attention to the social dimension of enlargement."
"I would therefore reiterate my Group' s commitment to a reform that guarantees balance between the European institutions and also between the Member States, and in doing so smaller countries being marginalised."
"A reform that also increases transparency and democracy and at last enables the general public to participate in the drafting of European policies."
"Biarritz also saw the unanimous adoption of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and, yes, there was indeed great ambition and a novel method."
"For the first time in a document of this type, civil, political and social rights were placed on an equal footing, with a commitment to establishing a Community of human values."
"I do not for all that share in the Presidency' s satisfaction, and can only regret the fact that the content of the Charter fails to live up to requirements and expectations, not least as regards social issues."
"I would also express the wish of my Group and of a good many NGOs to see the Charter evolve and continue to improve, in order to guarantee, amongst other things, more effective protection and rights for the citizens of the European Union, for employees, for the citizens of third countries and for the socially marginalised."
"The Council would truly satisfy the expectations of European citizens if it were to launch a widespread consultation of individual communities and national parliaments, culminating in a charter that genuinely met people' s needs."
"Finally, concerning international issues, I, like others here, am keen to hail the return of democracy to Serbia."
"It is very important, as part of the process that has started, for the Union to contribute to the reconstruction, stability and promotion of human rights in all the countries of the former Yugoslavia."
"Concerning the Middle East, all the signs following Sharm-el-Sheikh are that the peace process depends on certain undertakings being honoured, beginning with the full and comprehensive implementation of the UN resolutions, an end to Israeli colonisation of the occupied territories, the right of displaced Palestinians to return to their lands, and the recognition of a Palestinian state which has East Jerusalem as its capital."
"I too hope that Nice European Council is a success and welcome the fact that the peoples of Europe, and large numbers of associations, NGOs and trade unions are investing time and effort in preparing for it."
"Madam President, at the Biarritz Council we saw emerging, from behind the real or supposed quarrels between larger and smaller countries, a different but equally real type of rift between those who want to speed up European integration and those who want to preserve a design for a European Union that respects Member States and national democracies."
"The first group would seem willing to engage in ultrafederalism within a hard core of States, and the referendum in Denmark seems to have strengthened their convictions on this."
"My Group would like to warn them against this."
"By persisting in this approach, they would probably cut Europe in half, and even more surely would cut themselves off from their own nation."
"For the referendum held on 28 September was not simply an expression of the Danes' refusal to be run by a European superstate and their desire to preserve their national democracy."
"It also mirrored the feelings of many citizens in other Member States, even if these feelings are sometimes more abstract given the lack of a means to convey them."
"Were their voices heard at Biarritz?"
"One might well doubt it, in view of the fact that the most clear-cut decision taken during the Biarritz Council was to proclaim the Charter of Fundamental Rights at Nice."
"The ultimate goal of this Charter, should it become binding, would be to strip each national democracy of the right to itself determine the rights and duties of its own citizens."
"Worse still, the major concern of those promoting the Charter actually seems to be how to make it binding without first having it ratified by the national parliaments."
"The decision that it will be proclaimed at Nice has already been taken solely by the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council."
"The Commission subsequently informed us, in its Communication of 11 October, that the Charter could be rendered binding through the case law of the Court of Justice, still without any say from the national parliaments."
"It will therefore have been possible to strip the nations of Europe of their most fundamental right without ever openly having asked their citizens for an opinion."
"It is thus impossible to claim that Biarritz genuinely listened to the demand, as expressed in the referendum in Denmark, that national democracies be respected within the Union."
"Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I do not share Commissioner Barnier' s optimism about maintaining the Community system at Nice."
"It seems to me that we are moving in the opposite direction."
"We had a second pillar, then we had a third pillar, and now we are in the process of constructing a fourth pillar on defence, while a de facto fifth pillar also exists on economic and monetary union."
"On the other hand, the major points of balance between European institutions are slowly being broken down."
"We have a Commission that is weakened and, rather than dealing with such fundamental issues, Parliament is waxing lyrical on somewhat surreal themes, such as a charter that has absolutely no legal basis and which no authority will be entrusted with enforcing, when all of our fifteen Member States have their own charters of fundamental rights."
"While this Parliament holds forth on constitutionalisation, the real issue is - and I would stress this - that of the balance of power within the Commission."
"I cannot agree with you, Mr Poettering."
"The issue is one of not turning the Commission into a second Council by ensuring that each Member State is represented. The issue is that of turning the Commission into a genuine supranational body, an authority for the European Union."
"These changes can of course only work to the disadvantage of the smaller States, as might be suspected judging from the manoeuvring of some larger States, who are banking on scenarios for the reweighting of votes and the composition of the Commission and speculating on the future composition of the Commission in order to earn themselves a little extra room for manoeuvre with regard to reweighting."
"The real issue is that of giving the Commission, by means of elections, a genuine legitimacy that relates directly to the citizens."
"The only way to make Commission stronger is to have the President of the Commission elected by direct universal suffrage and also - why not? - the Vice-President with responsibility for external relations, in order to at last remove this area from the second pillar."
"This is the only way to restore a true balance between the various institutions of the European Union."
"But we refuse to talk about such things."
"We bring the question of the Charter of Fundamental Rights into our nation-oriented arguments, but fail to consider the fact that the future of Europe hinges on a Commission that is able to represent all its citizens and not the Member States as in the past, and one that has not been transformed - along the lines sketched out today - into a second Council, where all sorts of haggling become possible and no authentic expression of common European is able to emerge."
"We must therefore urge everyone to return to the roots of our Union, to have the courage that Giscard d' Estaing and Helmut Schmidt showed when deciding on the election of the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage in 1976 and in 1979, and to decide that in 2009 we will finally have a President of the Commission who is also the President of the European Union."
"Madam President, the Biarritz Summit was a breakthrough for reinforced cooperation."
"The heart of the matter is that the élites who are keenest on integration want to be able to make decisions without broad democratic support."
"There is no longer any need to take account of those countries in which referendums are required before sovereignty is handed over."
"In future, it will be possible to have proposals rejected in referendums and adopt them in any case."
"Any countries which vote against will sooner or later be pressurised into following suit."
"The pattern is familiar from cooperation on issues of legal policy."
"First of all, the pioneering countries implement a form of Schengen-style cooperation, and the legislation is subsequently transferred to all the countries."
"The most stubborn countries are made a special offer."
"They can have the legislation sent to them by fax without exercising any contributory influence. What they cannot do is avoid the legislation, no matter how many people vote no in the referendums."
"Elites in all the countries are also joining forces against their own voters."
"Those who stand apart from reinforced cooperation are really being given the same freedom as the back seat passengers in a car."
"Reinforced cooperation is like an eel trap."
"There is no way back, but only ever more integration, more centralisation and more Brussels, without the corresponding democracy."
"The Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities wants to see a freer and more flexible Europe in which there is no pressure to be a part of every development and which is characterised by democracy instead of regimentation: a Europe of democracies and diversity."
"Madam President, I still remember well the pitying smiles of those delegates who favoured an ambitious agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference, when I suggested to them back in February this year that we could count ourselves lucky if it proved possible to find a solution to the famous Amsterdam leftovers."
"What stage are we at now, eight months on and with the Biarritz Summit behind us?"
"Apart from hoping to make progress in the matter of extending qualified majority voting, in truth we have not made a great deal of headway."
"A new Treaty is just as distant a prospect today as it was eight months ago."
"Indeed it is clear that the question of the leftovers is going to be a fairly hard nut to crack."
"There is no prospect of any agreement to my mind."
"However, if no solution is found to the key issues, then it will not be possible for work which is at a more advanced stage - for example with regard to the reform of the European Court of Justice - to be included in a new Treaty."
"Similarly, the stock phrase used by the French, that it is better to have no treaty than a bad one, is unlikely to reinforce anyone' s faith in the attainability of an ambitious goal in Nice."
". (FR) Madam President, I would like to contribute to this debate by recapitulating on some of the interventions, rather than by replying to them."
"I have very little to add to what Commissioner Barnier has said, except perhaps to mention a slight difference of opinion over meteorology."
"The weather at Biarritz was in fact quite bad that weekend."
"I know the Basque coast very well and was rather disappointed for those participating."
"One might have expected somewhat better weather conditions, but I feel that the climate inside the European Council, at which I was present from start to finish, was a little better than the Commissioner has said."
"In this respect I would like to respond to what Mr Poettering has said about the rift between the larger and smaller states."
"It is true that we arrived at a juncture where marked differences of opinion were evident in the ministerial discussions."
"The intention of the Presidency was, on the contrary, to help ensure that this debate could go ahead in an open manner, in such a way as to enable us to move on from it, without the very same rift opening up again."
"Judging from the feedback on the most crucial discussion, the one that took place when the Heads of State and Government met for dinner, it did indeed force matters into the open so that solutions could then be sought."
"You can in any case rest assured, Mr President, that it is the genuine desire of the Presidency of the Council to seek out a compromise that suits everyone."
"Accordingly, the President of the French Republic, the President of the European Council and the French Prime Minister asked me to visit, before the President of the French Republic, the ten countries which are currently asking for only one commissioner."
"I immediately went to see the Belgian Prime Minister yesterday evening and moreover believe that he too can sense the Biarritz spirit."
"The determination to heal the rift between the smaller and larger countries is an integral part of this spirit."
"I do not, in this respect, share the feelings of the Chairman of the Group of the European People' s Party on the possibility of 'one Commissioner per Member State' ."
"I am aware of the criticisms that you have addressed to the German Chancellor."
"I am no more qualified than you to meddle in German internal affairs, but feel that this position is extremely consistent and if I am not mistaken also moves into line with what the Commission wants."
"A strong and effective Commission means a Commission that has even greater legitimacy by virtue of representing the general interest of the Community, and not by dint of a perceived intrusion of the intergovernmental phenomenon into the way it operates."
"When we proposed a rotation on an equal footing, it was precisely to show that the idea was not to pit the smaller and larger countries against one other but that, in a Commission with a ceiling on commissioners, those countries which we incorrectly refer to as 'large' and those that we equally incorrectly call 'small' would be represented on a perfectly equal footing."
"This is the clear position of the French delegation, and this is clearly the preferable solution."
"What I noted in Brussels yesterday, was that an idea is beginning to gain credence, that of having one Commissioner per Member State, which will probably be adopted at Nice, perhaps placing a ceiling on the number of commissioners at a later date."
"I therefore believe that we will clear up this ambiguity and that we must do so while effectively ensuring that the Commission continues to be a strong body."
"In fact, as Mr Barnier has said extremely clearly, a Commission packed to the rafters and representing the Member States alone would lose credibility and legitimacy."
"I share the Commissioner' s views."
"The objective is truly one of strengthening the Community framework."
"In order to do this, I would reiterate, in the same vein as my response to Mr Prodi at our last meeting, that we must upgrade each of the institutions: the Commission of course, the European Parliament of course, and the Council too."
"This is the balance that we must strike."
"I would also like to reassure Mr Poettering as to the actions of the French Prime Minister."
"The day after Biarritz, the Prime Minister, as some of those present can testify, appeared in person - something that does not always happen - and at length before the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, the parliamentary body that brings together members of the national parliaments, the European parliament and the parliaments of candidate countries."
"Furthermore, the French Parliament held an hour-long question session that was broadcast at peak viewing time and was specifically dedicated to topical European issues, and thus to the results of the Biarritz European Council, during which the Prime Minister spoke at length."
"You know how things work in the media."
"You might say something on Monday or Tuesday, but this does not necessarily mean that you will be questioned about it on the Thursday."
"You can therefore rest assured of the French Prime Minister' s resolve as regards this Presidency issue."
"I would like to briefly return to matters of external trade policy, as this is a very serious matter."
"France' s stance on this is no secret, and neither are the positions of a number of other Member States who feel that, when it comes to the field of services, especially cultural matters and even more particularly audiovisual matters, a cautious approach is called for since issues of identity come into play, and I am talking about issues of identity and not exceptions."
"Mr Barón Crespo asked several questions which primarily concern the link between qualified majority voting and codecision."
"I am aware that this is an issue which the European Parliament quite rightly views as very important, and must make clear to the House that I only dealt with the bare bones of the issue of course, given the limited speaking time available to me, but that this issue does not present any difficulties."
"Moreover, as I to some extent hinted at during our debate prior to Biarritz, the Presidency sees the extension of qualified majority voting as going hand in hand with codecision."
"As I am sure everyone here will be pleased to hear, that does not currently constitute a problem area for the Intergovernmental Conference."
"I would also like to return to the issue of the number of Members of the European Parliament."
"This issue was partially settled at Amsterdam in Article 189 of the Treaty, which set a ceiling of 700 MEPs."
"We have started to exchange ideas on this question, from which it has emerged that all the Member States want to maintain this ceiling after enlargement."
"One delicate issue is still to be resolved, that of how to allocate seats within this ceiling."
"I can state that a number of delegations, those from Germany, Britain, France and Italy and also from Holland, would like to see a proportional reduction and others a linear reduction."
"We shall have to see, as this will clearly be a sensitive issue."
"I would just like to express my disappointment at the fact that the European Parliament has dispensed with drawing up the report that it had announced and which was to have been the subject of an oral question today."
"Indeed I feel that this would have helped the Member States and not least the Council to form an opinion, as no one could have more definite ideas on this matter than the Members of the European Parliament themselves."
"Perhaps it is not too late to do this."
"I will end with the questions asked by virtually all the speakers concerning the binding nature of the Charter, and am anxious to make myself clearly understood on his matter."
"Firstly, all the members of the European Council are happy with the Charter, both from the standpoint of the method used and from that of its content."
"I will very quickly repeat that the Convention method is an innovative one which enables several legitimate authorities to be combined, the national parliaments, the European Parliament, the Commission and the governments. It is therefore something on which we could perhaps draw in the future when addressing other issues."
"The content of this Charter could indeed be interpreted in several different ways: the glass is either half full or half empty, it is a compromise."
"I see this compromise as a rather dynamic, gradual and progressive one."
"This text will stand out because it is clear and because it is accessible."
"It is the first European Union document that the citizens can consult without feeling completely alienated from its content."
"That really is something valuable, as was emphasised by all the members of the European Council."
"There remains, of course, the question of its legal power."
"I will make no secret of the fact that we are engaged in a process, one in which we are well versed, of having the Charter proclaimed by each of the three institutions."
"It has to be said that within the European Council there are a number of delegations, and I might even say a large number of delegations, that are opposed to the Charter being binding in nature, and therefore to it being incorporated into the Treaties as early as Nice."
"Given the circumstances, how could one possibly imagine that this constitutes a forward development?"
"We will strive for this change, as our Presidential role dictates, but I would not want to lead Parliament to believe that developments that cannot come about will come about."
"I do not think it will happen."
"It seems to me that we must adopt a gradual approach to this matter: see to it that this Charter is proclaimed at Nice by the three institutions and then go into its legal future since I, like many people here, believe that it will indeed be the preamble to a future constitutional treaty, but let us then address this as a constituent issue."
"In reality only one process or one procedure is still to be addressed and that is the reference to Article 6."
"I have already had occasion in this House to tell you that I was in favour of this."
"Little was said about the issue at the European Council, but I had the impression that one delegation - you can probably guess which - was reticent, as it is opposed to the Charter having any legal effect or being in any way binding."
"Lastly, in response to Mrs Ainardi, I see it as very difficult and even quite dangerous to open up the Charter package and discuss its content again, as I do not know what the end result of this re-examination would be."
"I strongly believe that this would be taking a step backwards rather than a step forwards."
"Now that we have this Charter, let us accept it for what it is, as the stage we have reached today, a first step that is subsequently to be confirmed and developed by taking others, whether in respect of its content or its legal status."
"Madam President, the speech by the President-in-Office of the Council gives me the opportunity to remind him of two things: first, that this Parliament - as far as I know - has not given up on drafting a report on the number of Members of this Parliament in the Treaties."
"In other words, we might yet please him by providing this report he is so keen on."
"Secondly, the position of this Parliament has never been that the Charter was to be the preamble to the Treaties."
"This idea has appeared from somewhere but it is not the position of the European Parliament."
"When we talk of insertion we do not mean that we want it to be the preamble."
"In any event, Madam President, I believe that Biarritz has contributed something very positive, and that is the unanimous approval of the Charter."
"A second very positive thing was the adoption of the Charter in its entirety."
"It also seems possible to me - and we are talking about policy - not to put the Charter on ice, to use Mr Barón Crespo' s expression, but to entrust it to the Swedish Presidency for its incorporation to be studied."
"I believe that now, in this policy of forward movement, the inclusion in Article 6(2) of the Treaty on European Union is very important, as there is no sense - and I do not wish to be inconsistent - in the European Union deciding not to provide a legal basis in the Treaty for the Union to be able to adhere to the European Convention on Human Rights and, at the same time, talking in the same paragraph about the interpretation of fundamental rights based on this same European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights."
"It therefore seems that mentioning the Charter in the Treaty of Nice is something that makes perfect sense."
"I therefore believe that with the resolution on which we are voting tomorrow, we are giving a very clear mandate to our two representatives, Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos, to enable them to present a proposal to this end at the Nice Summit."
"Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I have three comments to make."
"Firstly, one sometimes had the impression that at Biarritz there was an obsession with the debate between the smaller and the larger states."
"In a certain sense all this is quite natural."
"We are at last in the process of reopening the issue of major institutional balances and the way they would work within an enlarged Europe."
"The institutions on which the European Union is currently based were set up for three large countries and three small countries."
"This balance has not been revised since then."
"Indeed, the magic of the European Union is precisely its ability to foster alliances between small and large countries in the common interest."
"However, if the notion of a common interest is to work, each country must find its proper place."
"Everyone knows that if a larger Member State does not feel itself to be adequately represented and feels unable to make its voice heard as loudly as it should be within the European institutions, it will look elsewhere, which is in the interests of neither the larger nor the smaller Member States."
"That is the reason why we hear so much talk of smaller and larger states."
"Beyond this, it would seem to me that the Biarritz Council scored several points on this issue, which is crucial to the future of the European Union and its decision-making procedures, and we can only welcome that."
"The second issue that I would like to address is that of decision-making."
"Basically, if the European Union is not in a position to take decisions, it will no longer be in a position to govern. The markets alone will do this."
"So, if we want to be able to govern and decide matters, then decisions must be taken by a qualified majority, including those on non-discrimination."
"No one in this Parliament would understand it if no agreement on this issue was reached at Nice."
"I ask you in all sincerity, at a time when the Union is providing itself with a Charter of Fundamental Rights, would the Heads of State and Government reject the idea of decisions in this area being taken on a qualified majority?"
"That would seem to me to be bordering on the ridiculous and I hope that headway can be made on this matter between now and Nice."
"However, in parallel with the debate on qualified majority voting, there is the debate on closer cooperation."
"On this count, I consider it insufficient to say that the Community method must be safeguarded."
"We must say how, while remaining well aware that certain issues still have to be settled."
"We need to have further debate and focus our thoughts in this respect."
"We can say yes to Parliamentary control of closer cooperation, but how can this be put into effect without recreating conditions that are so restrictive that they do not allow this cooperation to be developed? These are questions that we still have to answer."
"Lastly, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I believe that I have never as an MEP given up on anything so long as a glimmer of hope remained. We have taken on board what you said concerning the timetable for incorporating the Charter into the Treaties."
"For all that, it is essential that the Treaty adopted at Nice should include a reference to Article 6, for at least three reasons."
"Mr Méndez de Vigo has already referred to the content of Article 6 and to the inappropriateness of there simply being a reference to the European Convention on Human Rights."
"However, in its Communication of 11 October, the Commission has just spelt out, quite correctly, the extent to which a judge to whom this Charter is submitted would be in a position to uphold its content, and would not be able to act as if this document did not exist."
"Consequently, should the Heads of State and Government say nothing at Nice, they would be leaving the door open to what others have called 'government by the judges' ."
"Finally, it does not seem to me particularly rational for the President-in-Office of the Council to say that the Swedish Presidency will subsequently look at the action the Fifteen Member States want to take with regard to the Charter' s legal status."
"Are we to imagine that discussions on the drafting of the Treaty will reopen straight after Nice and that a new process of ratification by the fifteen national parliaments will then be embarked upon?"
"I believe that to be unrealistic."
"There is a pressing need to equip the Union with a point of reference based on the content of this Charter."
"I hope we can still convince people of this and make progress, in order to win the day on this issue at Nice."
"The meeting in Biarritz was typified by very strange happenings."
"It therefore comes as no surprise that governments clashed on essential issues."
"After all, they are now discussing the redistribution of power in Europe, but especially at this stage, it is vital to have a sound presidency that seeks consensus."
"Unfortunately, France acted more as a spokesperson for its own interests and for those of the large countries than for proposals which could bridge those contradictions, even if Mr Moscovici is now trying to convince us that the opposite is true."
"If the French Presidency carries on like this, the IGC will fall flat on its face on Nice' s hard pebble beach."
"It is of major importance for each Member State to continue to be represented in the Commission."
"A hierarchy becomes inevitable, as this is also what tends to happen in national governments."
"Even once the present candidate countries have joined, each Member State must be able to retain one junior or senior Commissioner."
"It is highly suspicious that the large Member States, which are behind intergovernmental cooperation, would argue in favour of a small Commission in which they themselves would not always be represented."
"A rotation system of this kind would lead to a serious weakening of the Commission' s position and that is exactly what we want to avoid."
"If the large Member States ask for the votes in the Council to be redistributed to a certain degree, then that is a reasonable request, but if they over-react, they will antagonise the small countries."
"In addition, majority decision-making goes, by definition, hand in hand with codecision; it is totally unacceptable to us to separate the two."
"Reinforced cooperation works very well with a minimum of eight Member States."
"For foreign and security policy, we could possibly do with fewer."
"It is difficult but certainly not impossible to reach agreement in Nice."
"But the French Presidency should not act as strangely as it did in ""Bizarritz"" ."
"Madam President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council. I have two minutes and two messages: one on the Charter and one on taxation policy."
"Concerning the Charter, you have just replied in a very well reasoned manner, but my Group is nonetheless anxious to say to you that the work must go on."
"Work must continue, first of all, in respect of the content, if not now then at some time in the future at least, because we need more than just fine words."
"From the outset the Convention worked on the assumption that the Charter would be binding."
"As a result, we negotiated on an a minima basis and we have a minimal Charter, particularly as regards social rights."
"I can cite two practical examples: on the one hand we shifted the emphasis from the right to work to the right to engage in work and, on the other hand, a number of social rights that are covered in the revised Social Charter of the Council of Europe are not included in the Charter."
"Faced with this paradox of having negotiated a binding charter and then ended up with a minimal text and a non-binding charter, there is a real need, as some of the other Members have said, to take a series of decisions at Nice."
"A first course of action would be that of Article 6."
"A second course of action would be to actually establish a timetable at Nice and a clear method for rewriting the Treaties and incorporating the Charter into these Treaties."
"A third and final course of action, which no one has talked about but which seems to me very important, is the need to also incorporate a revision clause into the Charter so that we have a dynamic rather than a static text."
"Concerning taxation policy, Mr Barnier has quite rightly said that qualified majority voting is the criterion for an ambitious Treaty."
"I have to say that Article 93, in the form in which it has been drawn up by the Presidency, does not enable us to address even a straightforward debate."
"If we want to pursue the objectives that the Union has set itself, that of reducing taxation on employment and taxing pollution, and that of preventing damaging tax competition, which are two of the Union' s common goals, we must make it understood that the only solution is joint sovereignty between the Member States and not tax competition between these States."
"The wording of Article 93 becomes all the more critical considering that, once the first wave of new states has joined the Union, it will be all the more difficult for us to progress towards qualified majority voting."
"Mr Moscovici, Prime Minister Jospin had the extremely good idea of enlisting the aid of a economic analysis committee."
"This committee has just produced a study entitled 'European Issues' ."
"If you read through this study, you will see that the conclusions it comes to on taxation policy issues are the very ones that I have just set out."
"Madam President, this Chamber has seen many hypocritical speeches today, as many of our number are convinced that nothing actually happened at Biarritz, apart from the obvious fact it was raining, which we would all agree upon."
"It was a wasted opportunity, first and foremost with regard to the expected institutional reforms."
"Everyone knows that nothing will come out of the Nice Summit, because there is too much disagreement between the various governments of Europe."
"It was also a wasted opportunity for the Europe of fundamental rights, which was supposed to be a beacon for the world."
"Indeed, the Charter falls some way short of the texts already in force."
"It even constitutes a step backwards in social matters in that it fails to recognise the right to employment or to a minimum wage, the right to retirement, to housing, or to abortion."
"It ranks social marginalisation in the category of assistance, and not in that of fundamental rights that are binding on employers or on States."
"In reality, it once again proves that this Europe is being constructed against the interests of its peoples, and this is what tens of thousands of protesters will be saying in Nice on 6 and 7 December, and I hope that many of us will be there with them."
"In the second that remains, and since we are talking about fundamental rights, I would like to express my indignation at the silence and complicity of most of the Member States and institutions with regard to the ongoing massacre of the Palestinian people, with whom we should be showing a little more solidarity."
"Madam President, let us be clear about one matter: the single greatest challenge facing the Union is the reform of the EU institutions so that the enlargement process can take place."
"We all know that enlargement of the Union cannot take place until decision-making procedures within the key institutions are reformed; however, such a reform process must be fair and balanced."
"It must protect the position of smaller Member States within the Union. It must also protect cultural, linguistic and national diversities."
"It is clear from the debates that have been taking place across Europe, including those in Biarritz, that larger Member States are seeking, in part, to bully smaller Member States to reform the European Union in line with the direction taken by larger Member States and in accordance with their wishes."
"This is an unacceptable situation."
"Let us reflect for a moment on the ratification procedure for any newly revised European Union treaty."
"It is constitutionally imperative for a referendum to be held in Denmark, Portugal and Ireland before any treaty can come into force."
"If the European Treaty accepted at Nice completely dilutes the influence and representation of smaller Member States, it is going to be very difficult to sell it and secure approval for it in referendums in these three countries."
"Decision-makers within the governments of the larger Member States should remember that seeking the approval of the citizens in a referendum is not a mere technicality or a rubber-stamp operation."
"One has to convince the citizens in these countries of the clear merits of any new European treaty."
"It must strike the balance between ensuring that the enlargement process can proceed and ensuring that smaller Member States retain a strong voice in the decision-making procedures of the European Union."
"Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the Informal Council Meeting at Biarritz raised hopes that in-depth consideration would be given to the preparation of the Nice summit, which is to lead on to the reform of the European institutions."
"Besides the external issues that punctuated this meeting, nothing else emerged from it bar the genuine inability of the European institutions to make any headway on institutional matters."
"It was as if the idea was to better conceal the absence of any consensus on this issue and the inability to form a diplomatic counterbalance to the United States, which is acting as a mediator in the Middle East, even if it is quite laudable to want peace in the world, not least in this war-torn region."
"Above and beyond this bitter admission, this Europe so often promised, which seeks to be close to and receptive to the peoples of Europe, would actually seem to me to be moving further away from this goal."
"Is wanting to get involved with everything and everyone, beginning with what is happening outside our border - when even the United Nations, whose task this actually is, cannot successfully do this - not a negation of this Europe which is supposed to be closer to the citizens?"
"We would like to see similar zeal for action in the field when there are disasters in Europe, such as the storms of December 1999 or the sinking of the Erika."
"One might wonder whether such an approach is relevant in terms of coming up with real solutions."
"As is the case at every summit, the newspapers reported on the hope and anguish raised by this summit, the prelude to the Treaty of Nice."
"Our debate today also has the same ring to it."
"The negotiators see the fact that there are malcontents on both sides as proof that they are on the way to striking the right balance."
"But in the end, as Commissioner Barnier has said, the aim is not to enhance the lives of our fellow citizens but to ensure the survival of the Community structure."
"Four revisions in fifteen years have not improved matters, and now we are expected to believe that a charter or a constitution might do something to change things."
"On this basis, how can the Community act as a diplomatic entity on the international stage?"
"In conclusion, let us begin to do together those things that we can do well or better in line with our peoples' wishes."
"Then and only then will it be time to deal with everything else."
"Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, on the subject of the situation in the Middle East, two months ago this House was unanimous in praising the commitment to peace shown by Avraham Burg, the speaker of the Knesset, and Ahmad Qurie, the President of the Palestinian Legislative Council."
"Since then, those who preach hatred and advocate violence seem once again to have won the day."
"We would be failing to understand the origins of this crisis if we imagined that fears which have reigned for generations were to give way to lasting peace, a prelude to reconciliation, without further ado."
"If the European Union is to continue harbouring the ambition of playing a part in securing this peace, as is its vocation, it must first of all keep its head, and then bring all its weight to bear to facilitate the task of the decision-makers of that region who are firmly resolved to move towards peace."
"First we have to keep our heads, which means that amid all the emotion and horror it is not our job to castigate one side or the other."
"Then bring all our weight to bear, which means that the Union must speak with a single voice, which unfortunately was not the case last week at the tenth extraordinary session of the United Nations General Assembly."
"Bringing all its weight to bear also implies not contenting ourselves with advocating a renewal or intensification of economic aid under the pretext that only by raising the standard of living in the region will we be able to help establish a lasting peace."
"Such a solution would only have an impact in the long term. Faced with the emergency situation that now exists there, this is clearly no longer sufficient."
"We are well aware that Jerusalem is the nub of the issue."
"Well, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, since the High Representative is now participating in the negotiations, which is something we all welcome, I would ask you whether the time has not come for a powerful initiative from the European Union, which might offer its services to both sides in order to arrive at a status for Jerusalem that both find acceptable and, why not, to ensure that this is enforced."
"Mr President, with just seven weeks to go to the Nice summit, the time has come for clarity and open debate."
"How do things stand at present?"
"We still have no agreement on the modus operandi for the European Commission, on how votes are to be weighted in the Council, on what should be done about the principle of qualified majority voting or on proportional representation in the European Parliament."
"In other words, today - I repeat, today - there is a risk of the so-called Amsterdam left-overs becoming Nice left-overs unless we take some decisive action right away. And that is not all."
"The future of the Charter of Human Rights appears to be in the balance, even as an insert under Article 6, as suggested by the European Parliament at today' s sitting, as does the institutional fate of support for European political parties."
"Clearly the constitutionalisation of the Treaties will have to be postponed to a later date."
"There are, of course, some issues on which progress of a sort is being made."
"The first is reinforced cooperation, where significant progress has been made."
"Of course it is, on occasions, clear from the debate that this institution is viewed in some quarters not as the answer to the flexibility which Europe needs but as a sort of future defence to safeguard their interests vis-à-vis future members of the European Union."
"Progress has also been made with Article 7 on combating violations of the basic values of the European Union."
"So what are the deeper historical implications of these developments?"
"My purpose in listing them is not to disappoint, but because we still have time to act before Nice."
"The leaders of Europe have not formulated a clear vision."
"They have not clearly formulated their final philosophy."
"Sometimes the intergovernmental conference looks like an anxious administrative bureaucracy trying to share out power."
"This does not convince the man in the street."
"We are not managing a bank or a shop."
"We are leading people and that calls for a slightly different approach."
"Enlargement has turned from a dream into a nightmare for some people, who fear that it might upset the balance of power."
"But we are unlikely to achieve the desired result with a purely bureaucratic approach."
"I am also worried by the minimum response to Parliament' s call for democratisation."
"I am worried that the changeover to qualified majority voting is not directly linked to codecision with the European Parliament."
"But we still have time, miracles do happen in politics and I personally am keen to see a few happen in Nice."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I am extremely concerned that this affair of the Charter of Fundamental Rights will have a negative effect on public opinion."
"The Charter of Fundamental Rights has been accepted in its entirety by the informal Biarritz Council."
"Parliament has called unanimously upon the Summit to decide now whether to include the Charter in the Treaties. However, it is no simple matter, it is not easy to accept that the Community institutions which believe in this Charter can then hold back from giving it legal effect."
"It is a sign which could contribute to turning the public increasingly against the European project, as, sadly, is already happening even in the candidate countries."
"The Committee on Constitutional Affairs has decided on a method and a timetable which mean that the inclusion of the Charter in the Treaties is a decisive step towards the constitutionalisation of the Union."
"Therefore, the Council must stop making excuses and express an opinion."
"A further point is the Commission reforms."
"It would be short-sighted to envisage a Commission structured according to criteria based on the representation of the individual States."
"Until we are able to feel that each Commissioner represents all the citizens, irrespective of his or her nationality, we will not be genuinely united in our project."
"Lastly, closer cooperation. I reiterate once again that closer cooperation must be treated as a means of harmonising differences and, therefore, of strengthening the Community spirit, and not as a means of division."
"Nevertheless, if it is to be effective, cooperation must not be choked by constraints."
"Mr President, there are many important issues which must be solved."
"The Biarritz and Nice Summits might nonetheless be described as a battle between those who want to build the 'EU State' quickly and those who see the EU as a form of intergovernmental cooperation and as a unique form of Community decision-making."
"What is really worrying, however, is that what might be called a form of blackmail is being perpetrated against those who, when it comes to reforms, do not wish to go further than they have been authorised to do by the Member States."
"They are often accused in the press of delaying or even preventing enlargement towards the East."
"It is, rather, those who are demanding extensive reforms prior to enlargement who are guilty of that."
"What is needed is to act responsibly now and, in Nice, to concentrate on resolving the issues left over from Amsterdam: Let every country have a Commissioner."
"Re-weight the votes in the Council, but not in accordance with the principle of double majorities."
"Stop the formation of a permanent vanguard of core Member States to lead the development process and instead respect all Member States."
"The fact that people are not to be given the opportunity successfully to keep track of developments is worrying, as is the fact that there are those who oppose a genuine principle of transparency, something which is absolutely basic to democracy."
"Nor should we miss the chance of lending legitimacy to the Charter, which can be done by involving the people."
"I am glad to see that the Swedish Presidency will be contributing to this."
"Mr President, At the Biarritz Summit, there was obvious antagonism between the smaller and the larger Member States."
"If they were to be complied with, the large countries' demands for increased power in the Council and Parliament would upset the whole balance within the EU and mean that the small countries would have to pay for the whole cost of enlargement."
"A Union of this kind would be centralised in character and give the small countries less influence than that which the United States' s two-chamber system gives to small federal states."
"Nor would the Union become more efficient. Instead, all Member States must be prepared, upon enlargement, to surrender a proportionate amount of influence."
"In Sweden, supporters of the European Union have always justified EU membership by saying that it would give us influence."
"Now, the moment of truth has arrived in which we must be prepared to defend the little influence we have."
"I should also like to say that there is something remarkable about the fact that France, as the country holding the Presidency, consistently uses its position to promote its own national interests."
"Mr President, in our plenary sitting in September we experienced and shared moments of optimism and hope with Abraham Burg, speaker of the Knesset, and Ahmed Qurie, President of the Palestinian Legislative Council."
"A month and a half later, what we are now sharing is great concern over the way events are developing."
"On the one hand, there is the decision by the head of the Israeli government to put the peace negotiations on hold due to the violence in the area and focus on the creation of a government of national unity with the head of the opposition, Mr Sharon."
"On the other, there is the feeling that paramilitary militias and fundamentalist agitators have taken over the streets and taken the initiative in the territories under the control of the Palestinian National Authority."
"What is certain is that it is in difficult times such as these that the historic stature of political leaders is measured."
"Right now, Mr Barak and Mr Arafat must make their people understand that it is only through dialogue at a negotiating table, with painful concessions on both sides, that the conflict can be definitively resolved."
"The international community, and in particular the European Union, must persevere with their efforts to avoid a confrontation which would, moreover, constitute an extremely serious source of global instability."
"From a European perspective, for the first time since the Madrid conference, the European flag has been on the table in the peace process."
"The unity of action at a given moment has made it possible for the work and prestige of one of the Member States in this area to be used to the benefit of all."
"And while we are immersed in the institutional debate we could ask the European Commission to show creativity and political decisiveness in order to make progress in our integration in the second pillar as well."
"Does the French Presidency not agree?"
"Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I would like to say a few words on the subject of the Middle East and Yugoslavia, also in connection with contributions from previous speakers."
"The dramatic developments in the Middle East have of course caused a huge backlash and emotions among the European public and here in Parliament have inevitably run high in the wake of the violence of the past few days and the large number of victims - and rightly so."
"Following the summit meeting in Sharm-el-Sheikh where all parties involved were present in order to find a way to freeze the violence and to re-open the dialogue between Barak and Arafat, we established that it is very difficult - even if, for a fleeting moment, it seemed as if it were possible - to halt the violence."
"At the moment, it appears that the voice on the streets is stronger than the will for peace."
"Nevertheless, we all know that there are huge numbers of citizens, both in Israel and in Palestine, who are simply finding out - in the hope of peace - how tough life is as long as peace has not really been established."
"That is why we back Mr Galeote and Mr Morillon in saying that it is up to us, as the European Union, to do our bit in order to give peace a chance."
"We have had the protagonists, namely the Speakers of the Knesset and the Palestinian Legislative Council, in our midst."
"That was at a time when the spirit of Oslo and the spirit of Camp David were alive, even if Camp David had just collapsed, it was, so close to peace, nevertheless alive."
"This is not the case today, but we did witness that the Arab leaders have been willing to show restraint."
"We have witnessed that Mr Solana has managed to secure a stronger position in the peace process on our behalf."
"I believe it is right that today, we once again have a joint resolution before us from all parties in which we recognise - with due consideration for maintaining an equilibrium - that both parties must restore the peace; we as nations cannot do that."
"But we need to make every effort to give them international support in order to give them that opportunity. This message could also be conveyed by the French Presidency."
"We would also like to ask the French Presidency to re-deploy the entire Mediterranean-European partnership as an instrument in the forthcoming ministerial meeting in Marseilles."
"For dialogue in the region must of course be held on a wider platform and if all players take part, there is a chance that both nations will find a way to peace from within."
"The other point I wanted to raise is the topic of Yugoslavia."
"Needless to say, we in this Parliament can only rejoice at the victory of the Yugoslav people and the election of Mr Kostunica as President."
"It was a choice in favour of democracy."
"It was a choice for Europe."
"The sanctions have been lifted."
"The European Agency for Reconstruction has been deployed and so has the CARDS programme."
"The humanitarian programme has been extended to include refugees and other people who have been driven out of their homes."
"The republic is being given the opportunity to take part in the stability and association process."
"It is also being given the chance to participate in the stability pact and, along with this, to establish contact with their counterparts in the neighbouring countries, to recognise the sovereignty and, as such, to pave the way for a democratic process."
"We believe that the democratic process within Yugoslavia can only be viable if it is also respectful towards the neighbouring countries, and recognises their sovereignty too."
"It was a good, major step forward to make those EUR 200 million available for the Federal Republic."
"At the same time, we would ask the Council to operate in the same spirit during the budget negotiations for 2001."
"For without adjusting the perspective in chapter IV, we will simply allow Africa or Asia to foot the bill once again for something we should attempt to set up ourselves in Yugoslavia in terms of democratic values."
"Let us apply the same generosity of spirit which you, the Council, have shown this year with regard to 2001."
"In the Group of the Party of European Socialists, we therefore urge you to apply the spirit which you managed to apply previously in the budget negotiations, to the budget negotiations for 2001."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I regret that Mr Barón Crespo has not remained in the Chamber after pointing the finger at the political force which I represent."
"Clearly, Mr Barón Crespo has been misinformed regarding Italy and my party."
"I must make it clear once and for all that Forza Italia has never opposed the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"The members of Forza Italia voted for the Charter in Europe and I am able to inform you officially that we will vote for it here in Strasbourg in November."
"In the Italian Parliament, we voted for the Charter but with a different motion from that of the left-wing majority, in which we stressed the need for the Charter to provide greater protection of individual freedoms."
"We are the opposition and I feel that we have the right to vote for resolutions in favour of the Charter which differ from those tabled by the majority."
"I hope that Mr Barón Crespo will accept my invitation - which I hereby formally extend to him, and I hope he is listening - to come to Italy to gain direct, first-hand experience of the situation in my country, without interference from the Communist Party/Democratic Left."
"I would advise Mr Barón Crespo to ask his Italian colleagues to explain to him why they are in government in Italy with an openly Communist party and why they are preparing to go to the political elections with another openly Communist party, the Communist Refoundation Party."
"And Mr Barón Crespo should also ask his Italian colleagues to account for the vehement declarations made against the Jews in Israel, declarations which throw further fuel on the fire of a spreading anti-Semitic feeling which is already too violent in Europe."
"And he should also request information from the current leaders, who used to belong to the Democratic Left Party and who were leaders of the Italian Communist Party at the time when certain elements of the Communist Party helped one of the murderers of Aldo Moro' s bodyguards to escape from Italy to Algeria."
"I hope that Mr Barón Crespo will be able to come to Italy to discuss these points."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, it is certainly to be welcomed that account was taken in Biarritz of the need for coordination in the sphere of energy policy, which is of such crucial importance to citizens, the economy, growth and prosperity."
"There is really no point in Member States going it alone in this respect; the fact that the Community is totally dependent on energy says it all."
"The package of measures proposed by the Commission with a view to increasing energy efficiency and saving energy, is therefore constructive, and likewise the investigations into cartel problems with the oil companies."
"It is not just the cartel of oil-producing countries we should be concentrating on though, but also that of the oil companies."
"We wish the French Council Presidency every success at the negotiations in Riyadh, on which occasion, as I see it, these States would do well to ensure that oil prices do not rocket any higher, if only for reasons of self-interest."
"Setbacks in economic growth within the European Union have repercussions for the global economy."
"We should also take a look at our own situation, however."
"It is important to take a step forward on the European energy taxation front, such progress having been blocked hitherto by the unanimity principle."
"With that in mind, Parliament is expecting the Nice Summit to take a step in the direction of qualified majority voting in those areas where taxation policy is disrupting the proper functioning of the internal market."
"Biarritz did not manage to dispel all the storm clouds attending our mission to promote the democratisation of the European Union."
"The Council Presidency wants to abolish the cooperation procedure and replace it with the consultation procedure."
"This procedure is unacceptable from a democratic and integrationist perspective."
"Nor is it to be tolerated with regard to Economic and Monetary Union; on the contrary!"
"This is precisely where we must advance the cause of the codecision procedure."
"If the project is not yet viable, then we urge the French Council Presidency to seek progressive institutional reforms and measures which will enable Parliament to participate."
"At the very least, it must be possible to agree on the detail of a common position on these matters in Nice."
"But we say 'no' to replacing the cooperation procedure with the consultation procedure."
"That would be a retrograde step."
"That is why action is called for!"
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, a little while ago, you made the point that Parliament would not issue a statement on the number of seats in the European Parliament."
"I would urge you just to read through the Leinen-Dimitrakopoulos report, in which Parliament has taken up clear positions, not only in respect of the distribution of the seats, but also on the weighting of votes in the Council and the composition of the Commission."
"Perhaps these positions, when read in context, will help us to extricate ourselves from the present conflict between larger and smaller States, which is paralysing the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Because that is one of the most serious problems we face."
"We must recognise that the smaller States are on an equal footing with the larger ones in this Union of States, and that we must find other ways to redress the balance for the larger States."
"We must not allow things to reach a point where the smaller States fear that there might be recourse to solutions by decree."
"The increase in intergovernmental initiatives, the official demands raised, and the options discussed in connection with enhanced cooperation, are all initiatives that could ruin the truly successful nature of the European Union."
"In the past, the European Union has been successful in those areas where the Monnet method and majority decision-making are applied, and where the institutions, i.e. Parliament and the Commission, have been strengthened."
"This must be brought out at the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference, so as to avoid any misunderstandings in this respect."
"To do otherwise would lead us down a blind alley."
"This method, which was appropriate for 6 Members, will be all the more appropriate for 27 Members because it is not possible for the European Union to be led by a Council of Ministers that changes its chairmanship every six months, and will therefore not be in a position, once there are 27 Member States, to lend coherence to the development of the European Union."
"The Commission, having the option of simple majority voting, would be better equipped to provide this impetus in the future."
"For this reason, Mr President, I would urge you to push for the Monnet approach at the next Intergovernmental Conference, together with qualified majority voting, and in so doing, to make the Union fit for enlargement."
"Mr President, in this debate on the informal summit in Biarritz, I would like to focus on the IGC and the Charter."
"Concerning the IGC, I would like to highlight three points."
"Firstly, the issue of majority decision-making."
"As I understand it, the French Presidency has presented 45 articles and topics with regard to majority decision-making."
"This is looking reasonably promising, provided that this number is not cut down to 35 or 40 topics in Nice."
"But of particular importance is the fact that those topics which will fall under the scope of qualified majority will also fall under the scope of codecision with the European Parliament, and this issue does not appear to be an open-and-shut case."
"Indeed, if this does not happen, both the national parliaments and the European Parliament will be sidelined, and the democratic rift will widen rather than narrow. Surely that is the last thing we want."
"Secondly, the issue of the number of Commissioners."
"Like Mr Brok, I would like to stress here once again that one Commissioner per Member State is absolutely vital to give each country a place in the European executive."
"As for the number of MEPs, nobody is in favour of more than 700."
"Would it then not be useful to work on the basis of the new numbers during the next elections in 2004?"
"If new Member States then join, the new numbers can be applied and we will automatically remain under the 700 mark, for if we overstep the mark once, I do not think we can go back."
